<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Situation of the the war-torn
Angola is developing in favor of the government, Kundi Paihama,
Angolan Defense Minister said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official National Radio of Angola, Paihama said
that the government forces "have won some victories recently", and
"the general situation is developing in favor of the government."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister mentioned especially a series of failures
in central Angola's Cunhinga City, on the side of the military
forces of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
About 130 UNITA men have been killed in the city, about 30 km
northwestern of Kuito, capital of Bie Province.
</P>
<P>
Paihama also mentioned the successful actions the government
forces launched in Huambo and its neighboring Caala City, where
about 30 UNITA men were killed on June 19 and a lot of ammunition
captured.
</P>
<P>
The offensive scheduled for the dry season, he said, has been
postponed for some complicated reasons, including military
training and logistic supply.
</P>
<P>
The government has once again refused demands from the
international community for talks with UNITA, saying that the
government is trying to end the conflict through military means in
the "last war" against UNITA in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government purchased a lot of weapons
in February for the decisive war.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 800 Ethiopian audience
Sunday evening warmly applauded the excellent performance by the
visiting Chinese puppet troupe at the National Theatre in
Ethiopian Capital.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, Ethiopian Minister of Information and
Culture Woldemichael Chemu said the visit by the Chinese puppet
troupe "is a testimony to the consolidation of people to people
relations between our two sisterly countries".
</P>
<P>
He recalled that "a land mark in Ethio-Chinese relations was
observed during a state-to-state level visits to China by Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi, in 1995, and to Ethiopia of His Excellency
Jiang Zemin, President of the People's Republic of China, in
1996."
</P>
<P>
"These visits have a wider implication for the all rounded
relations of our two peoples and countries in the future," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Jiang Zhengyun, said that the
visit and performance by China's Chengdu Puppet Troupe will
further promote the friendly relationship of cultural cooperation
between China and Ethiopia, and enhance mutual understanding and
strengthen traditional friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Programs performed by the Chinese troupe included "Plating
Spinning", which borrows much from traditional Chinese acrobatics,
"Tortoise and Crane", which captures the humorous relations
between the two animals, and "Happy Spring Festival", which tells
how Chinese celebrate their traditional festival.
</P>
<P>
The one-hour performance won repeatedly warm applause from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
Puppet is a traditional Chinese art with a history of more than
2,000 years. This is the first visit to Africa by Chinese
puppeteers from Chengdu City in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member Chinese troupe will give four performances
during its stay in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the fifth country of the Chinese troupe's current
six-nation African tour, which include Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya,
Rwanda and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Arab Journalists, Lawyers Denounce Israeli Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab journalists and lawyers on
Sunday denounced Israel's attacks on Lebanese civilian targets as a
demonstration of the Jewish state's "terrorist orientation" and
"aggressive intentions" toward Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In a message to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
the Arab Journalists Union said Israel's attacks on Lebanese
civilian targets represented "a grave escalation not only against
Lebanon and its people, but the Arab nation as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based union called for "immediate intervention" by
the U.N. Security Council and implementation of the U.N.
resolution 425, which demands unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for rocket attacks on its northern areas by
Lebanese Muslim guerrillas, Israel launched air strikes Thursday
night against power stations, bridges, roads and water plants near
Beirut, leaving eight people dead and at least 60 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Arab journalists expressed confidence that "Israel's barbaric
attacks on" Lebanese civilian targets" will only strengthen the
determination" of the Lebanese resistance forces to "further its
legitimate struggle against the Israeli occupation."
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in southern Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas. Lebanese resistance forces have
been fighting against the Israeli occupation troops since then.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Lawyers Union, meanwhile, called in a statement issued
in the day for convocation of an urgent Arab summit to seek ways
of forcing Israel to relinquish the occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The union urged the world community to declare solidarity with
the Lebanese people and compel Israel to carry out the U.N.
resolution unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Arab lawyers called on the Arab countries to help Lebanon in
the reconstruction of the facilities shattered by Israel.

LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Gabonese Vice-President Didjob
Divungi-Di- Dinge praised here Sunday Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba for his tireless effort for an end to the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is doing tremendous work in trying to end the
11-month-old war, said Ndinge, who is here to attend the regional
summit on peace in DRC, which was postponed to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ndinge expressed his hope that the on-gong consultations on the

quickly be finalized to pave the way for the summit, at which the
cease-fire agreement will be signed.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who was mandated by Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to mediate a peace solution to war, told the
Gabonese vice-president that the war will come to an end as a
result of the overwhelming support and commitment from SADC, the
Organization for African Unity (OAU) and all stakeholders to end
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said the conflict should quickly be resolved so that all the
 resources could be devoted to the development of DRC and the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is a big challenge to Africa and all the efforts
to try to end the war should not be motivated by personal gain but
by the need to end the suffering of displaced people, Chiluba

nuclear weapons will not be adopted or even considered by Pakistan
over the Kashmir crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, he stopped short of directly ruling out the
possibility of a major conventional war between India and Pakistan

<P>
Speaking to reporters in the Pakistani embassy in Amman, Malik

but said his country will not give up its rights of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is currently striving to defuse the ongoing crisis and
tensions over Kashmir and to bring the Indian side to the
negotiation table, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malik was sent by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as a
special envoy to brief Arab countries on the current situation in
Kashmir and to explain Pakistan's position on the issue, Pakistani
embassy officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing crisis between Pakistan and India started after
Indian troops launched campaigns to expel what New Delhi called
Pakistan-backed intruders into the India-held part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Troops from both sides have been exchanging fire in
Kashmir over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan denied that it is militarily supporting those
guerrillas, saying it only gives moral support to those "freedom
fighters."
</P>
<P>
India has so far rejected Pakistan's proposals to hold talks,
saying no talks are possible before it expels all the intruders
out of its part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan, both having exploded their first nuclear
weapons last year, have fought three wars in the past half a
century, two over Kashmir.

<P>
Malik is also expected to meet Jordanian King Abdullah Bin

TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani said on Sunday that Iran's policy of supporting the
countries on the front-line of struggle against Israel is
"irrevocable."
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Syrian ambassador to Tehran Ahmad al-Hassan,
Shamkhani also pointed his fingers at what he called "certain
Palestinian groups" for "ignoring the interests, aspirations and
struggles of the Palestinian people and pinning their hope on a
compromise with Israel."
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after the Israeli air raids on Lebanon on
Thursday and Friday, which killed eight people and injured over 60
others.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hassan accused Israel of "trying to build up pressure on and
terrify the Lebanese government and people" by launching the
bloodiest Israeli air aggression on Lebanon in three years.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian diplomat praised Iran's "strong and explicit
stances" against the illegal acts of Israel and said that real

of encountering Israel's expansionism and defending Arab states'
legitimate rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Greek Cypriot
AKEL party on Sunday crossed into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north Cyprus to attend the 17th conference of the Republican
Turkish Party (RTP).
</P>
<P>
The three-member delegation headed by AKEL secretary-general
Dimitris Christofias went to the north to attend the conference at
the invitation of RTP leader Mehmet Ali Talat, the Cyprus News
Agency (CNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
AKEL is the main opposition left-wing party in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
An AKEL Central Committee message to the conference underlines
the need for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to seek common
grounds while respecting their different national backgrounds and
traditions.
</P>
<P>
The message says a future settlement to the Cyprus issue should
guarantee the independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty and
unity of a bicommunal Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot political parties have been
maintaining contacts despite efforts by Turkish Cypriot
authorities to ban meetings between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1997, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has
not allowed Turkish Cypriots to participate in most bicommunal
events or to cross into the Greek Cypriots-controlled area in
reaction to a European Union decision to open accession talks with
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue have been stalled since
Denktash demanded that the international community recognizes his
break-away state in north Cyprus, now only recognized by Turkey,
before negotiations can be undertaken with the Greek Cypriots.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya
have jointly appealed to the European Union (EU) to lift a
multi-million-dollar ban on exports of fish produced from the Lake
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, bordering the second-largest freshwater
lake, assure that illegal fishing with chemical substance has been
contained and consumers do not have to worry about food health.
</P>
<P>
Ministers responsible for fisheries from the three east African
 countries, who met in the Tanzanian capital Saturday, have said
that law enforcement organs have intensified surveillance on the
lake.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also informed that measures have been taken to
enhance people's awareness of perils in poisoning fish, media
reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, EU declared a ban on imports of fresh and frozen
fish products from the three countries following reports that
unscrupulous people had been using pesticides for cotton in
fishing activities which posed threats to food health.
</P>
<P>
The ban means that the three countries will suffer a loss of at
least 250 million U.S. dollars annually. A number of people on the
lake have lost jobs and fish prices have nosedived after the trade
embargo.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers agreed to co-ordinating in
improving sanitary standards in fish processing facilities and the
quality of fish products from the lake.

LAHORE, Pakistan, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister

to China, the second since he assumed premiership in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said in his departure statement that during his stay in
Beijing, he will hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart
Zhu Rongji, call on Chinese President Jiang Zemin and meet with Li
Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The visit is in the tradition of frequent high-level exchanges
between Pakistan and China which allow a regular review on matters
of mutual interest leading to a further strengthening of the
"excellent existing relations" between the two countries, said
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister said he will brief the Chinese
side on the latest developments in Kashmir and underscore the
urgency for a just and final settlement of the Kashmir dispute in
the interest of peace and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sharif described the Pakistan-China friendship as "a model of
inter-state relations." "It is a relationship based on principles
of peaceful co-existence which have stood the test of time and
changing global trends."
</P>
<P>
"We continue to share a close identity of perceptions on major
regional and international issues," said Sharif, adding that
"Pakistan feels honored to have China as its close friend and
ally."
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed his thanks for China's consistent and generous
assistance and support extended to Pakistan over the years.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the progress China has made during the
past decade, and said that a strong and prosperous China is "a
source of strength for its friends and a powerful factor for peace
and stability in the region and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is determined to join hands with China, said Sharif.
He expressed the belief that the relationship between Pakistan and

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. Officials Meet Over Kargil Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State Gibson Lanpher Sunday night met the Indian
prime minister's Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra and External
Affairs Ministry officials, and they discussed the latest
situation in Kargil sector of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
No details were disclosed about the meetings. But an Indian
spokesman said the talks between the two delegations lasted for
about two hours.
</P>
<P>
Lanpher briefed the Indian side about the discussions held by
General Anthony Zinni of the U.S. Central Command chief with
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Army Chief of Staff
General Parvez Musharraf in Islamabad earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesperson also said here Saturday that
Lanpher had come just on a mission to brief Indian officials on
the U.S. team's talks in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The Indian spokesman said in a statement said "It is imperative
that Pakistan heed the advice of the international community and
take immediate steps to withdraw the armed intruders from the
Indian side of the Line of Control."
</P>
<P>
"Once the armed intruders are withdrawn, it is possible to take
steps to resume the composite dialogue process that responds to
the wishes of the people of both India and Pakistan to live in
peace and amity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Lanpher told newsmen here after his meetings with Indian
officials: "I have brought no proposals on safe passage or
anything else from Islamabad."
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, The U.S. and Pakistan in their
talks Friday had made a deal to allow infiltrators holed up in
Kargil to withdraw quietly from Indian territory. India agreed to
the idea in principle.
</P>
<P>
An Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman told newsmen here
Friday that no proposal on providing the infiltrators with an
"exit corridor" had been received and that they would have to find
their way back.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Lifts Ban on Circulation, Deposit of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government has decided
to allow Iraqi citizens and resident foreigners in Iraq to
circulate and deposit foreign currencies acceptable to the Iraqi
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, the top legislative
body, issued the decision on Saturday evening, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, Iraqis inside and outside Iraq and
foreigners in Iraq can open current and fixed accounts in
licensed banks and get interests with the rates decided by the
Iraqi Central Bank, said INA.
</P>
<P>
In the past, neither Iraqis nor foreigners in Iraq were allowed
to deposit foreign currencies in Iraqi banks. They had to exchange
their foreign currencies into Iraqi dinars, the Iraqi currency,
for deposit or circulation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the measure is aimed at attracting
deposit in foreign currencies and stablizing the Iraqi dinar, which
is rated at over 2,000 against one U.S. dollar in black markets in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Before the United Nations clamped economic sanctions on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, one Iraqi dinar is worth
3.3 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal for S. Leone to Be Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A peace agreement between the Sierra
Leonean government and the rebels would be announced after the
rebels explain the agreement to its commanders in the bush, said
reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has been seeking a
power- sharing arrangement in a government of national unity
during the month-long peace talks being held between the
government and the rebels in Togolese capital of Lome.
</P>
<P>
The talks had been deadlocked over the number of cabinet
positions being offered by the government to the rebels and
mediators at the talks are believed to convince the government to
increase the offer from three to eight ministerial posts -- four
cabinet posts and four lower posts.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the mediators said that the RUF led by Foday
Sankoh had accepted the latest offer by President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh who attended talks late Friday with Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo told reporters earlier that "I think we have
come to the end of the negotiations, it is just a matter of
getting a mandate from my people."
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough of the peace talks seems to have been helped
by the involvement of Obasanjo who had long discussions with the
government and RUF representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president undertook a shuttle visit to Sierra
Leone, Liberia and Togo last Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo and Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who is the
current chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), met both sides late on Friday in Eyadema's home village
of Kara.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, a joint statement released Saturday
urged the two sides of the eight-year conflicts in Sierra Leone to
make "a final effort for peace and reconciliation".

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Urged to Privatize Petroleum Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi business leader Sunday
urged the government to privatize the state-owned Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation (BPC) to protect consumers' interests, the
national news agency BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
"The government should privatize the BPC to stop irregularities
and allow the organization to serve the consumers' interest more
effectively," Abdul Awal Mintoo, president of the Bangladesh
Chambers of Commerce and Industries, told a seminar on problems of
fuel in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of the BPC would ensure accountability,
transparency and productivity, which in turn would safeguard the
interest of the consumers of the country's sole fuel dealing
authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fuel refining cost might be brought down to three percent
from existing 12 percent if accountability and transparency was
ensured in the BPC through privatization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Fuel Owners' Association also underlined the
need for inclusion of people's representatives in the BPC's
management to help stop adulteration of petrol with kerosene.
</P>
<P>
About 800 petrol pumps are in operation in the country while
scores of others are being put up. Some 98 percent of the
country's fuel needs are being imported by the government while
the rest comes from local gas fields.
</P>
<P>
There are about 15 fuel depots in the country and the number is
inadequate and needs to be doubled, said participants at the
seminar.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece's former dictator George
Papadopoulos, who led a military junta from 1967 to 1973, died in
an Athens hospital on Sunday at the age of 80.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1919, Papadopoulos was an army colonel when he seized
power in an April 1967 coup.
</P>
<P>
In December 1967, Papadopoulos took over as Prime Minister and
Defense Minister, and in 1973, he became President of Greece.
</P>
<P>
With the return of democratic rule to Greece in 1974, he was
arrested and sentenced to death for treason, but the government
led by Constantine Karamanlis commuted the sentence to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Papadopoulos was jailed in the Korydallos Prison but in August
1996, he was transferred to hospital for health reasons and
remained there under police guard until his death on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Advance into Quarterfinals as Group B Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil scored the equalizer four
minutes into injury time to hold Germany to a 3-3 draw and qualified for
the quarterfinals as Group B leaders here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one of the most entertaining game of the World Cup, the
Brazilian team, which have already booked a berth in the top eight
with two straight wins over Mexico and Italy, fell 1-0 behind at the
8th minute when Birgit Prinz opened the scoring for the German team.
</P>
<P>
But the Brazilians, regarded as the most exciting and
entertaining team in the tournament, answered quickly with an
equalizer through Katia Da Silva at the 15th minute.
</P>
<P>
Top Brazilian forward Sissi, who tied with Sun Wen of China with 5
goals to lead the scorers' list, sent a curved free-kick into the net
five minutes later to put Brazil 2-1 ahead.
</P>
<P>
It seemed the German team would lose the game and give Italy a
chance to overtake if the Italians could score a big-margin win over
Mexico later on Sunday, but the Germans just would not give up their
hopes.
</P>
<P>
The German girls showed their determination and made full use of
their physical advantage in the second half, levelled the score 2-2
only one minute into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Birgit Prinz charged into the Brazilian area and was fouled down
by defender Suzana. The South Korean referee Im Eun Ju
awarded a penalty to the German team and Bettina Wiegmann made no
mistake from the spot.
</P>
<P>
The German team played better after the goal and dominated the
midfield. They again took over the lead at the 58th minute when
defender Ann Jones Stephanie slotted homefrom close range.
</P>
<P>
The Germans had more chances of scoring and as the game heading
to the end, it seemed they could win the game and qualify for the
quarterfinals as the group leaders.
</P>
<P>
But the Brazilian team scored a dramatic goal four minutes into
the injury time when Maicon collected a rebound within the penalty
area and sent it home with a right-footer.
</P>
<P>
Maicon had entered the match as a second-half substitute when
Brazil fell behind and needed a goal to tie the game and win the
group.
</P>
<P>
The win enables Brazil qualify as the group winners with 7
points. The Germans also qualify for the top eight with 5 points
from one win and two draws.

MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said here on Monday that the Russian leadership needs to develop a
strategy for the whole of Yugoslavia including Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He made this comment at the start of his meeting with Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"With your help Russia has waged an excellent campaign in
Kosovo and the whole of Yugoslavia," he told Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he was glad to see that Sergeyev is optimistic
about the success of the peacekeeping operation, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is concerned about the details of the
Russian peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, noting that all
decisions on the operation should be made collectively.
</P>
<P>
The Pristina airport has great strategic importance and Russia
will operate the airport jointly with peacekeepers from other
countries and is prepared to help them if needed, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian troops arrived at the Slatina airport near
Pristina on June 11 to NATO's surprise, strengthening Moscow's
hand in negotiating a deal on Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
No details are available for the Yeltsin-Sergeyev closed-door

AMMAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's population exceeded 4.77
million by the end of 1998, 570,000 more than the figure at the
end of 1995 when the last national census was conducted, according
to figures released by the National Statistics Bureau on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With a total number of 2.2 million, adults at or over the age
of 19 account for 46.4 percent of the total population,
indicating an increasing potential pressure on the labor market,
which has seen an annual unemployment rate of over 16 percent in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Some 38.6 percent, or over 1.84 million of Jordanians are
living in the capital city of Amman, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The annual population growth rate of the desert kingdom stands
at 3.55 percent, among the highest in the world, due to the
absence of family planning measures.
</P>
<P>
Birth control remains a sensitive issue in the Muslim country
though the government complained the population pressure had

Autonomous Region, Nima Ciren, met here today with Beijing-based
foreign correspondents from the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times,
Die Welt, Sweden's Dagens Nyheder, and Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun and
Sankei Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Western media have been biased and untruthful
in their reports on Tibet and that the correspondents should see
with their own eyes whether what they have heard is true or not.
He welcomed them to Tibet to see the development and said he hopes
they can tell the world about the new changes that have taken
place in Tibet in an objective, just, and comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions about the Dalai Lama, he said that the
Central Government's stand on the Dalai Lama's request for
dialogue remains unchanged and that the door to dialogues will
always be open to the Dalai Lama, provided that he gives up the
idea of "Tibetan independence," stops all attempts to divide the
motherland, and recognizes that the Tibet is an inalienable part
of China's territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou on Monday discussed with visiting U.N.
Secretary-General's Special Emissary Karl Bildt the developments
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and efforts to reconstruct the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Papandreou said that Greece was
even now accepting the Secretary-General's invitation to
participate in the New York talks as it wanted to play a leading
role in the Balkans and the future of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou will be one of the foreign ministers meeting at the
U.N. in New York on Wednesday to discuss civilian operations in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece hoped its northern city of Thessaloniki to
be the headquarters for services for the reconstruction of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Bildt, who was former Swedish Premier and the
European Union's former Bosnia mediator, said that their talks
were aimed at preparing the ground for the New York talks and the
participation of countries which could play a significant role and
make an important contribution to the efforts for stability in
Kosovo and the wider Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Greece was of those countries and could play a particularly
constructive role in the efforts under way to improve the
situation in Kosovo and the wide region, Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Greece's main opposition New Democracy (ND)
leader Costas Karamanlis also met with Bildt.
</P>
<P>
Karamanlis said that the ceasefire in Kosovo was not sufficient
in itself and the big challenge was the stabilization and
restructuring of the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged Greece to formulate a more active and efficient
foreign policy in order to play a leading role in the Balkan
region.

<HEADLINE> France Minimizes Dispute With Israel Over Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- France tuned down on Monday its
dispute with Israel over Lebanon, after outgoing Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon slammed France for criticizing Israel's air
raids against Lebanon last week.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel's new prime minister Ehud Barak and Sharon Monday
refused to meet with the French government envoy on Middle East,
Yves Aubin de la Messuziere, who carried a letter from the French
government to Barak.
</P>
<P>
Sharon accused France of being biased when commenting on the
Israeli-Lebanese tension. He also criticized France for sending
its envoy without pre-consultation.
</P>
<P>
But French diplomats said that besides Lebanon, the purpose of
the visit by de la Messuziere to Tel Aviv is to seek the
possibility of re-launching the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This visit was made in the wake of the Group of Eight (G-8)
summit in Cologne on June 20, during which the leaders of G-8
countries welcomed the encouraging declarations made by Mr. Barak
(on the peace process)," Agence France-Presse quoted an
unidentified French diplomat as saying in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said that France wishes to encourage Barak in pursuing the
way of peace and it also intends to play a role in helping realize
peace between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed and 60 injured in the air raids by
Israeli warplanes against Lebanon last Thursday and Friday. Israel
said it was taking revenge for the rocket attacks by Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah guerrillas upon northern Israel, which killed two
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
France has called on Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas to stop
taking actions of reprisal.

hospital, a ice hockey official in his home city of Lipetsk said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old forward, who plays for Lada Togliatti in Russia
's top league, suffered several deep wounds in a fight with local
gang members during a visit to his home town last week.
</P>
<P>
Said Lipetsk hockey club president Boris Afanasyev: "In one
case the knife cut his liver but doctors told us they're
optimistic he will recover to live a normal life."
</P>
<P>
The stabbing was the latest in a series of high profile crimes
which have plagued Russian hockey in recent months.
</P>
<P>
A former player and a youth coach were beaten to death in
Yekaterinburg and Moscow respectively and six men found guilty of
the contract killing of the head of the Russian Ice Hockey

<HEADLINE> Law on Troops in Macao Special Administrative Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Law on Stationing Troops in
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) was approved by the
10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said after
the law passed that it embodies the basic principle of "one
country, two systems." He also said the law meets the Central
Government's need to effectively handle the defense issue in Macao
and conforms with Macao's real conditions. The law will play a
significant role in ensuring that troops stationed in Macao
perform their duties according to law and safeguard state
sovereignty, unity, reunification, territorial integrity and the
safety of Macao, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Law has 30 articles in 6 sections on general principles,
the duties of the troops, the relationship between the troops and
the Macao SAR government, the discipline of military personnel and
their jurisdiction, and supplementary provisions.
</P>
<P>
The Law will take effect on December 20, when China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao. According to the Basic Law of
the Macao SAR, the Central Government will be responsible for
defense matters in Macao.
</P>
<P>
At the 3rd plenary session of the Preparatory Committee of the
Macao SAR held on September 18, 1998, Vice-Premier and Chairman of
the Preparatory Committee Qian Qichen announced on behalf of the
Central Government that it will station troops in Macao on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
A proposal on the Law on Stationing Troops in Macao, that was
submitted to the NPC Standing Committee by the State Council and
the Central Military Commission (CMC), said that under the
guidance of the basic principle of "one country, two systems" and
on the basis of the Constitution and the Basic Law of the Macao
SAR and in accordance with the duties of the troops to be
stationed in Macao, the Law on Stationing Troops in the Macao SAR
has been drafted after a long period of study.

<HEADLINE> Israel Protests French Stand on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Monday staged a
protest against France's stand on Israel's recent air raids
against Lebanon, saying it is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
David Granit, the acting deputy director general for western
Europe in Israeli foreign ministry, delivered the protest to
French envoy Yves Aubin de la Messuzires, who arrived here earlier
in the day for a short visit.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Granit also passed to the French envoy a
letter from Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon to his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine, in which Sharon said the French
statement regarding the Israeli assault is "unbalanced."
</P>
<P>
Israel will "do whatever it feels is necessary to do" to protect
its security, said the hard-line Israeli minister in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched air attacks on Lebanese civilian targets on
Wednesday and Thursday, killing at least eight civilians and
wounding over 60 others.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were said to have been carried out in retaliation
for earlier Lebanese guerrilla attacks which killed two Israeli
civilians in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Thursday's air strikes, the French government
issued a statement criticizing Israel for the attacks, but failed
to blame the Lebanese Hezbollah for its Katyusha attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The statement also announced that France is dispatching two
diplomats to Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territory
to defuse the tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Messuzires is also carrying a letter from French President
Jacques Chirac to Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, calling
on him to take immediate measures to push the Mideast peace
process ahead.
</P>
<P>
But due to the French statement, Barak refused to meet with the
French envoy and decided to accept the letter through a third
party.
</P>
<P>
Sharon and other Israeli government leaders all refused to meet
the French envoy.
</P>
<P>
French officials here said they are sorry "if there has been
any misunderstanding, and hope the visit of the diplomats will
contribute to calming the situation and advancing the peace
process."

<HEADLINE> Differences Appear in Congo (K) Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo (K) have
 disagreed on the modalities of disarming the militiamen fighting
in eastern Congo at the ministerial meeting in Zambian capital
Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting disclosed that the three countries said
they cannot sign a cease-fire agreement without a proper mechanism
being put in place on disarming armed groups in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
They explained that the three countries want to know exactly
how this will be done before committing themselves to the signing
of the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
And Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Sten Mudenge said his government
was happy with the first document that was done in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a number of issues are to be resolved in
the new document before the cease-fire can be signed formally.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was adjourned to later in the afternoon to give the
 delegates time to consult.
</P>
<P>
Officials involved in the Congo peace talks on Sunday night
finalized the cease-fire document which will accommodate fresh
proposals from Uganda and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Amama Mbabazi
confirmed that Uganda had come up with fresh ideas after looking
at the paper prepared by the secretariat which earlier gathered
views from all belligerent countries and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi said Uganda felt the previous paper did not address all
the issues, hence the need to refine it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Foreign Minister Nkhsazana Zuma told
reporters she was hopeful the cease-fire would be signed as
officials had been discussing modalities of its implementation.
</P>
<P>
"Of course the various officials stuck to their points but a
lot of progress has been made," she said.
</P>
<P>
Congolese Foreign Minister Abdulayi Yerodia expressed optimism
that a final solution would be found to the conflict as he said
much progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by ministers from Zambia, Kenya,
Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Tanzania and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
If the ministers approved the document, the heads of state
would meet in Zambia to endorse the signature of the agreement,
observers here say.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States has asked
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak to meet with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat prior to his upcoming trip to Washington, the
local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The White House request, delivered via the Israeli Embassy in
Washington, said U.S. President Bill Clinton wants to know whether
any new initiative to be put forward by Barak during his U.S. trip
will have been agreed upon by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the request,
but said it can only be decided by Barak himself whether to meet
with Arafat before going to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that after formation of his coalition
government, Barak will visit Washington in July to discuss with
Clinton on how to move the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli election law, Barak, who won the prime
ministerial election on May 17, has to form his coalition
government before July 9.

<HEADLINE> ARATS, SEF Officials Meet in Beijing Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said here today that their
meeting in Beijing was fruitful in implementing a four-point
consensus reached between the two sides in October 1998 and will
be conducive to further exchanges between them.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between ARATS Deputy Secretary General Li
Yafei and his SEF counterpart Jan Jyh-horng.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed the time and place of a proposed Taiwan visit
by ARATS President Wang Daohan sometime this autumn. Wang's visit
is considered a continuation of the high-level talks between ARATS
and SEF which began last year.
</P>
<P>
Li repeated ARATS' two suggestions on dialogues between ARATS
and SEF about a joint forum on relations across the Taiwan Straits
and exchange of views on political obstacles in practical matters.
</P>
<P>
SEF made some suggestions about talks on returning hijackers
and illegal immigrants from the mainland and problems related to
fishing disputes.
</P>
<P>
Both agreed to increase exchanges this year and to organize law
and agriculture delegations during July and August.
</P>
<P>
Li said that ARATS hopes to cooperate with SEF in making
arrangements for cross-straits political and economic talks and
would like to hear SEF's opinion.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jincheng, ARATS' vice-president and secretary general,
also met with Jan today.
</P>
<P>
Jan is scheduled to leave Beijing for Taipei tomorrow morning.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australia's Tax Reform Poises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new tax, which will come into force on July 1 next year,
could largely make the economy more efficient and competitive,
they said.
</P>
<P>
"GST has little to do with tax," said Steve Corbett, national
GST program director for Touche Tohmatsu. "It's about the
transaction, systems and processes you put in place to manage it."
</P>
<P>
With the GST changing the ways of cash flows in different
businesses, small businesses, especially retailers, are the
largest beneficiaries of the reform, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
While firms turning over more than 20 million Australian
dollars (13.2 million U.S. dollars) a year have up to 30 days to
make their GST payments, businesses under 20 million Australian
dollars can choose between monthly or quarterly GST returns.
</P>
<P>
The small businesses collect a 10 percent GST on nearly all
their sales, except basic food, yet in most cases they won't pay
GST on goods purchased for at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
This could encourage the small businesses to flourish, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The GST system will also have impact on competitive strategies,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Until today, aggressive businesses chasing market share have
often resorted to extending favorable terms, up to 180 days, in
order to win new contracts.
</P>
<P>
However, anyone who tries to adopt such a strategy under the
GST regime will need a good bank manager. The capital cost of such
competitive strategy rises appreciably under the GST system.
</P>
<P>
Learning how to live with GST system involves a detailed
knowledge of business and finance systems and processes, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Those that don't understand the cash-flow mechanics of their
businesses could be squeezed at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding cash flow on both ends, input and output, are
critical if you aren't going to get in trouble," Gorbett said.
</P>
<P>
While small businesses like retailers get the sweet end of the
GST pineapple, some groups, notably importers and manufacturers,
get the rough end of it, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
An importer must pay GST on imported goods once they clear
customs but the GST receipts from sales that offset the GST cost
on imports could be months away.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the importer is actually lending money
interest-free to the tax collector.
</P>
<P>
It's a not too dissimilar situation for manufacturers, although
the predicament will vary substantially from firm to firm, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers with long production cycles, who buy inputs
many months before selling finished goods, could need up to 10
percent more working capital under the GST system.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, manufacturers with short production cycles,
billing ever couple of weeks, won't have the same capital problem.
</P>
<P>
Under this impact, manufacturers would learn which parts of
their businesses made profits and which did not, the analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the investment side, the GST is likely to have
limited impact on personal investors, but the broader tax reform
that comes with it will introduce a series of changes that will
affect investment strategies, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest impacts to be felt by personal investors
from the GST will be an increase in the fees and expenses charged
by stockbrokers, financial advisers, managed funds and financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Investment classes such as property, insurance and collectibles
will also be hit by specific changes that could alter the way
retail investors manage their portfolios, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a well-documented potential rise in banking
charges, other financial services could increase in cost under the
new tax regime.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the GST, a fee charged for placing an
investment does not attract the 10 percent tax, but
fee-for-service advice for a financial adviser does.
</P>
<P>
Accountants and lawyers charging a fixed hourly rate for advice
will also have to add the GST to a client's bill.
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the impact list, the Australian Taxation
Office (ATO) faces severe pressure to implement the new tax system
due to a 1-billion-Australian dollar (660 million U.S. dollars)
shortfall for the GST administration, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Dirkis, tax director at the Taxation Institute of
Australia and a former ATO official, said the tax office would be
short of resource when the GST comes into effect on July 1 next
year.
</P>
<P>
The country's business would pay the price and the tax office
would be forced to rely on "shock treatment" to raise revenue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The tax office would be unable to advise business properly on
how to comply with the GST, instead relying on random audits that
were based on making businesses prove they were not tax cheats, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The funding crisis is confirmed by the tax office's recent
attempt to grab some of the 500 million Australian dollars (330
million U.S. dollars) in funding for GST compliance costs for
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
This proved that the tax office was "desperate" for resources
to implement the GST, Dirkis said.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Leak Reported in Russian Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian workers suffered
exposure to high doses of radiation two weeks ago in a chemical
plant in the central part of the country, Russian Atomic Energy
Minister Yevgeny Adamov said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the failure of the emergency prevention system
rather than any human error for the radioactive leak in the
Siberian Chemical Plant in Seversk, Tomsk region, on June 14, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Adamov, who is attending a meeting in Obninsk, Kaluga to mark
the 45th anniversary of the launch of the world's first nuclear
power plant, said that the managers of the plant in Seversk had
done their best to prevent emergencies, but the prevention system
failed to work properly.
</P>
<P>
The accident was originally attributed to a human error
committed in repairing a reactor.
</P>
<P>
Radiation was kept inside the hall that houses the reactor, in
the wake of the occurrence of the emergency rated level 2 on the 0-
7 level scale. Level 7, the worst level, applies to the Chernobyl
disaster, Adamov said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a crisis center would be set up in Moscow in
September to monitor the daily operation and safety of the country
's nuclear power stations.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Reject Confederate Solution on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' government said Monday
it will not discuss a confederate solution to the Cyprus issue,
threatening not to participate in talks with the Turkish side if
such a solution is set as a precondition.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Costas Serezis said the Greek Cypriot
government remains committed to the U.N. resolutions which
stipulate for the setting up of a bizonal, bicommunal federation
in the island.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that President Glafcos Clerides will decide
on how to react if the issue comes up at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is expected to approve two
resolutions, one on the U.N. Secretary-General's good offices
mission and the other on the six-month extension of the mandate of
the U.N. peace-keeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue have been stalled since the
Turkish Cypriots demanded that the world community recognizes
their break-away state in northern Cyprus, now only recognized by
Turkey, before negotiations can be undertaken with the Greek
Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> HK Exchange Fund Assets Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) announced Monday that the total assets of the Exchange Fund
amounted to 927.6 billion HK dollars (118.9 billion U.S. dollars)
as at May 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to HKMA figures, included in the Exchange Fund
Abridged Balance Sheet, the total assets of 927.6 billion HK
dollars were 28.1 billion HK dollars (3.6 billion U.S. dollars)
lower than at the end of April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets
decreased, by 5.6 billion HK dollars (700 million U.S. dollars)
and 22.5 billion HK dollars (2.9 billion U.S. dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesperson said the reduction in foreign currency
assets reflected primarily revaluation effects on foreign currency
investments and redemption of currency notes issued, which were
partly offset by investment income from foreign currency
investments.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in Hong Kong dollar assets reflected mainly the
change in the market value of the Hong Kong equities held by the
Exchange Fund, the spokesperson explained.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Getting Into Computer Music (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The new computer technology now
means that a guitarist can make music without an instrument and
Josef Fung, the president of the International Computer Music
Conference (ICMC), is organizing a computer music festival in
October in Beijing that demonstrates this new fact of life.
</P>
<P>
There, a guitarist, with sensors pasted on his body, can move
his body and create music, and a group of engineers can climb up
on a giant "sensor-net", a scaffold-like structure with sensor
rods linked to computers, to jointly create different melodies.
</P>
<P>
Fung, who is an Icelandic-Chinese, described this avant-garde
music to a Xinhua reporter in his studio where he manipulated a PC
to produce strange sounds and explained: "The sounds we are
hearing include those from the natural environment as well as
those that might never be heard by people."
</P>
<P>
The computer music system consists of a PC, a synthesizer, a
sensor, and other electronic equipment and can use a lot of
software. "Human beings can hear sound in a frequency range
between 20 and 20,000 hertz, but traditional musical instruments
can only produce a limited range," Fung says.

A musician will produce different music in different
performances, Fung says, letting his mind wander and create music
randomly.
</P>
<P>
For the proposed computer festival in October, Fung plans to
show traditional Chinese martial arts in a high-tech way with
performers covered by a light circle, inside which their moves
will be digitally read by a powerful computer on the spot, and
that, the 44-year-old musician says, must be tremendously exciting.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Fung was a member of a panel of judges for an
international computer music festival in Hong Kong and led a group
of famous Chinese musicians in a key-note performance.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the ICMC became a sort of musical Olympics and more
than 1,000 composers, musicians, professors, and engineers from 36
countries have joined it. This year it decided to stage the annual
festival in a developing country for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here say that computer music will open up the
minds of the Chinese people and push software production.

DAMASCUS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Syria reiterated Monday that it

<HEADLINE> U.S.-ASEAN Business Council Gives Thumbs-up to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is making good
progress in its efforts to respond to the financial turmoil in
Asia, President of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council Ernest Z. Bower
has said.
</P>
<P>
Bower said the response to the crisis in Malaysia has shown
measurable results.
</P>
<P>
"There is a vocal commitment among the country's (Malaysia)
leadership to consider the viewpoints of the business community
regarding what the next steps in the reform process ought to be,"
he was quoted as saying in a statement released by the National
Economic Action Council (NEAC) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bower also said the bank and corporate restructuring are well
underway in Malaysia, adding that the country has a relatively
strong banking system in which 16 out of 40 commercial banks are
foreign owned.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest banking directory, 14 out of 37
locally incorporated commercial banks in the country are foreign
owned.
</P>
<P>
"American business supported Malaysia's economic transformation
and continues to do so," he said, adding that Malaysia is the
second largest importer per capita for U.S. goods and services.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. business community is looking forward
to continuing consultations with Malaysian business leaders and
policy-makers, and is hoping to expand discussions on policies and
their implementation in both countries which will affect bilateral
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Bower said his recent visit to Malaysia was aimed at
continuing the "long-standing work to build Malaysian-American
trade and investment ties and gaining a better understanding of
the current economic and business trends in Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
"We are eager to build upon the strong foundations of the
long-standing relationship with Malaysia and are seeking
partnership in concrete efforts to drive forward the growth and
prosperity of both economies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council is the largest national
organization representing American businesses interested in
Malaysia and the other member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
He said the council is not alone in its assessment as more
international organizations have projected growth for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates that Malaysia's economic managers are soundly
in charge of the situation and that their policies for dealing
with the crisis are appropriate for the nation (Malaysia)," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian General Election Commission Asked to Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Election Committee
(PPI) chief Jakob Tobing has again asked the General Elections
Commission (KPU) to set the date for the national vote count as
the people are getting impatient in waiting for the results of the
June 7 election.
</P>
<P>
"Do not make various problems an excuse to keep away from the
main task of counting the votes," Tobing told reporters here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The KPU had originally scheduled the national vote count on
June 21. KPU Chairman Rudini meanwhile said the final vote count
could only begin after all tabulations and other substantial data
reprocessed.
</P>
<P>
KPU is estimated to conclude its final vote count before July
8.
</P>
<P>
Tobing said he agreed to grant the wish of some KPU members to
solve all election violations first but they should not make that
an excuse to postpone the national vote count.
</P>
<P>
PPI has regarded the vote count as its authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tobing alleged that there have been attempts to slow down the
national vote count.
</P>
<P>
This allegation, he said, is based on the fact that a number of
KPU members question irrelevant matters.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that they do not want the vote count to be completed
immediately by averting attention from the main task of the KPU,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Has Only Limited Contacts With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's contacts with NATO now are
only those needed "for joint participation in the peacekeeping
operation" in Kosovo, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader contacts with NATO, which were suspended following the
U.S.-led military alliance launched air strikes on Yugoslavia on
March 24, will have to be negotiated, Ivanov told a news
conference following his talks with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Leonid Ivashov, director of the Russian
Defense Ministry's International Military Cooperation Department,
said the visit of a Russian military delegation to NATO
headquarters does not imply that Russia intends to restore its
relations with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
A delegation headed by Vice Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov, head of
the ministry's International Law Board, will discuss with the
NATO command only issues related to the peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo, the Interfax news agency quoted Ivashov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation will discuss at NATO headquarters and at the
South European command those issues concerning Russia's
representation in these bodies, as far as the peacekeeping mission
is concerned, as well as joint command at the peacekeepers'
headquarters in Pristina," capital city of the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal hammered out between Russia and the United States,
Russia will dispatch 3,600 peacekeepers in Kosovo along with NATO
troops.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be back in Moscow on Thursday, Ivashov
said.

<HEADLINE> China Raising Standards for IT Industry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the official, various companies are trying to sell
their specific standards for cellular telephones and digital TVs
in China so that they can penetrate and dominate the market here.
</P>
<P>
So China will focus on developing its own technical standards
in conjunction with patents. China will develop laser video
standards, for example, which are compatible with DVD standards.
</P>
<P>
Once the standards are set, foreign products have to be
compatible with them if they want to enter the Chinese market, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the Ministry of Information Industry will
carefully time the approval of certain technical standards to
leave adequate time and room for the local IT industry to grow.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China will reform the technical standards on
a trial basis this year and will set up a nationwide commission on
standardizing audio, video, and multimedia systems and equipment,
which will consider all interested groups like the government,
enterprises, and research institutes to encourage the corporate
world and consumers to play a major role in drafting technical
standards.

<HEADLINE> China Raising Standards for IT Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China is to learn how to use
technical standards as a means of reducing the amount of reckless
competition from foreign companies in its information technology
business and protecting the interests of Chinese companies,
according to Vice-Minister of the Information Industry Lu Xinkui.
</P>
<P>
Lu told a ministry conference on standardization here today
that the time of just copying international standards is no more.
Since IT standards involve patents, he said, it will be more
negative than positive to just adopt foreign standards.
</P>
<P>
If China adopts other country's standards on video discs, it
will pay several hundred million U.S. dollars for the rights in
the next few years, he explained, and if a country refuses to sell
the IT rights to China, then China's products will be shut off
from the world while foreign products will penetrate the Chinese
market without opposition.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has to learn from other countries about
using technical standards as a method other than trade barriers to
protect its IT industry from competition from multinationals, so
China will try to establish a framework of standards that meets
the development needs of its IT industry in the next two to three
years.

<HEADLINE> China's Communist Party Celebrates 78th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged Party leaders at different levels to continue the
current drive for theoretical study, political awareness, and good
conduct.
</P>
<P>
At a forum in Beijing's Great Hall of the People for the 78th
anniversary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Jiang, who is
also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, pointed to
the positive results of this education drive in the past several
months and asked that the drive be continued to build the CPC.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed the CPC's history and emphasized that its success
came from the Party's ideological, political, organizational, and
workstyle efforts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the question of how to improve the building
of the CPC in times of peace has always been a major issue and the
present education drive is an innovative approach to this.
</P>
<P>
He said that political awareness should focus on Marxism and
socialism with Chinese characteristics and on the fundamental
interests of the people. Political awareness exists in economic
work and various other undertakings and leaders should be able to
observe or handle various issues from a political point of view.
</P>
<P>
Theoretical study is also very important, he said, adding that
leaders should master Marxist theories well, gain other knowledge,
keep a sharp eye on different ideas, and be able to correctly
design policies and measures.
</P>
<P>
For education in good conduct, Jiang said, leaders at different
levels need to carry forward the political nature and
revolutionary integrity of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The forum was chaired by Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee, was
attended by many senior CPC leaders.

<HEADLINE> Indian, Pakistan Prime Ministers Exchange Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif had
exchanged messages on the Kargil situation, a spokesman of the
External Affairs Ministry confirmed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"These messages were in continuation of their telephonic
discussions of the past few weeks in this context," the spokesman
said at the daily briefing on the on-going conflict between the
two neighbors in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The official spokesman also confirmed that former Pakistan
foreign secretary Niaz Naik visited New Delhi over the weekend
during which he met Vajpayee and hid principal secretary Brajesh
Mishra. He refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here said that Pakistan Foreign Office
maintained that Naik's tour was "a private visit and it has
nothing to do with Pakistan's foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the press that in these exchanges, Vajpayee
"has emphasized that Pakistan must withdraw its forces and
extremist elements from our side of the line of control (LOC) and
reaffirm the sanctity of the LOC."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee also conveyed India's continuing interest in resuming
the Lahore process once this happens, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
While New Delhi clearly indicated that Naik had come here at
the behest of Sharif, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman
reportedly said in Islamabad that "neither Naik briefed any
Pakistani official on his visit" nor "the government of Pakistan
had sought any briefing from him."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman denied any knowledge of the missing of
one of staff of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad reportedly said that one of its high commission staff
in New Delhi had been missing since Sunday night and urged the
Indian government to help trace him.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Concerns Over Growing Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
here Monday expressed concern over the narcotics business which
has not been affected by monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The opium business, which continues to attack the younger
generation, has not been affected, although the country is facing
several economic and political problems," Habibie said during the
commemoration of World Anti-Opium Day held at the state palace.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the trade of such banned substances continues,
the nation should start striking the "drums of war" to combat it,
otherwise the fruits of development will be useless.
</P>
<P>
Habibie also said that criminal operation in drug production
and trafficking has become ruthless, sophisticated and
well-organized.
</P>
<P>
"Through a forum, I instructed the security forces and law
enforcers to carry out the policies against narcotics criminals to
the best of their ability, according to the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on law experts to carry out studies whether or
not the laws are adequate in eradicating drug criminality.
</P>
<P>
As a country consisting of thousands of islands, Indonesia is
being seen by national as well as foreign anti-drug agencies as a
potential transit point for international drug syndicate.
</P>
<P>
An official said earlier that the number of drug addicts in
Indonesia was 0.062 percent of its total population of 202
million. This was a relative low figure compared to other
countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Would-be Ministers Signs Ethics Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The 42 would-be ministers and 12
presidential advisers Sunday signed on a 14-point code of conduct,
enshrining probity, transparency and accountability in governance,
The Guardian paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new ethics code is aimed at instilling confidence and trust
in public office holders - both for the current crop of officials
and for the successors in office as ministers and special
advisers, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The document declared that the government officials should be
open to scrutiny by members of the public and "open and
transparent in the discharge of public duties."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is expected to
swear-in the new appointees Wednesday, described the document as a
landmark achievement in the history of governance in the most
populous African country.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of the code of conduct for ministers and special
advisers in the federation is a landmark in the revival of just
and honest government in Nigeria," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo told the would-be ministers in capital Abuja Saturday
that "you must be prepared to make sacrifice, if any sacrifice for
this purpose is considered too much, it would be better not to
accept the responsibility."
</P>
<P>
The president last Wednesday submitted his first bill, an anti-
corruption bill, to the National Assembly, or parliament of this
west African country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's latest moves are clearly aimed at stepping up the
anti- corruption thrust, which he promised would be one of his
government's top priorities.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Calls for More Attention on AIDS Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. agency on AIDS has urged the
international community to pay more attention to the fight against
the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
"We must keep on building this momentum and turn it into new
resources and sustained energy to fight the epidemic," Peter Piot,
executive director of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Public acknowledgment of the urgency of AIDS is the first step
" and "every part of society must be involved in responding to the
epidemic," Piot told the opening session of the eighth meeting of
UNAIDS' governing body, the Program Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
Piot stressed that the expanded response requires a long-term
commitment of human and financial resources, which has so far been
lacking in many countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report sponsored by UNAIDS, after a quick
influx of donor spending in the late 1980s, support for the
international fight against AIDS began to level off in 1990, with
wealthy nations allocating an average of less than 1 percent of
their annual official development assistance (ODA) budgets for
AIDS programs in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, 33.4 million people were living with HIV
infection or AIDS, and a further 13.9 million had already died
from AIDS-related causes since the start of the epidemic,
according to estimates by UNAIDS and the World Health Organization.
AIDS is now the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, and
the fourth leading cause of death in the world.
</P>
<P>
Piot said, "Africa can barely begin to meet its immediate and
long-term AIDS needs. Just as the continent's leaders are stepping
up their political momentum, the international community must step
up its commitment to a new partnership against AIDS in Africa."
</P>
<P>
He said UNAIDS' priority areas in the coming year will be the
young people, community-based care activities, vaccine development,
prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission and highly
vulnerable populations.
</P>
<P>
Present at the two-day meeting are representatives from 22
governments, the seven cosponsor organizations of UNAIDS, five non-
governmental organizations and associations of people living with
HIV/AIDS, as well as some 60 governmental and non-governmental
observers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes British Investment in Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran welcomes British companies to
invest in the country's oil sector, said an Oil Ministry official
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between British companies and Iranian private
sector would further activate and promote performance of Iranian
businesses in developing the oil sector, said Iranian Deputy Oil
Minister for International Affairs Mehdi Husseini.
</P>
<P>
The official told the Islamic Republic News Agency that a
visiting British business delegation has put forward proposals
including transfer of modern technology and financial facilities
to implement some projects in oil, gas and petrochemical sectors.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation comprising representatives from 29
British companies arrived here Friday. It is the highest ranking
trade-economic delegation to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain upgraded their relations last month to
ambassadorial level after the two countries agreed to put aside
the controversial issue of Salman Rushdie, who was sentenced to
death by late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said the British delegation is here to seek further
expanding economic ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the transfer of modern technology, the Iranian
oil industry research center would study the proposals by the
British delegation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of the British delegation, Alan Munro,
told Iran Daily that Britain plans to promote mutual economic
cooperation with Iran and sees Iran as an important trading
and investment partner.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published on Monday, Munro said that Iran has
made clear that it wishes to attract foreign investment and
technology for national development.
</P>
<P>
Even if Iran is on the list of risky countries regarding
investments, "I believe that the risk of making investments in
Iran is comparable with similar risks in other countries," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Poised for New Tax System in Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia is poised for a new tax
system in the new millennium after the Senate gave its final
go-ahead to the 10 percent goods and services tax (GST) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The federal government declared it a great day for Australia
after the core provisions of the GST passed the Senate 38 votes to
30.
</P>
<P>
The legislation must now go back before the House of
Representatives by Wednesday for rubber-stamping before the GST
officially becomes law, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats Party deputy leader Natasha Stott Despoja
and her colleague Andrew Bartlett crossed the floor to vote
against the GST.
</P>
<P>
Independents Brian Harradine and Mal Colston also voted against
the new tax, which will be introduced from July 1, 2000, along
with Labor and the Greens.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said this
was a great moment for the country's economic security.
</P>
<P>
After quarter of a century of trying, Australia was finally on
the brink of tax reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For 25 years political parties and prime ministers and
opposition leaders have striven for this day and at long last it's
within reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has initially passed laws to introduce the GST and
to provide 12 billion Australian dollars (7.9 billion U.S.
dollars) in income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a second vote the upper house gave the nod to
more than 20 other GST provisions, including the contentious wine
equalization tax and compensation measures.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt saw a fiscal deficit of 1.43 billion Egyptian
pounds (420 million U.S. dollars) in the second quarter of the
current fiscal year, accounting for 0.5 percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP), the economic newspaper Alam Al Yom
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the period, total expenditures stood at 17.324 billion
pounds (5.095 billion dollars), whereas, revenues did not exceed
15.894 billion pounds (4.67 billion dollars), the newspaper quoted
a report by the Ministry of Economy as saying.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, fiscal deficit of the first quarter stood at 2.6
billion pounds (about 765 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The average Saudi crude oil price is expected to
exceed 13 U.S. dollars per barrel this year, which will prompt an
economic growth rate of 1.4 percent in Saudi Arabia and cut budget
deficit by some 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) will rise in nominal
value this year to about 490 billion Saudi rials (about 130.7
billion dollars) as compared to 488 billion rials (about 130.1
billion dollars) last year, the Arab daily Al Hayat Monday quoted
a Saudi official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The growth was attributed to the expected rise in oil prices
and an expansion in government expenditure, said Saeed Al Sheikh,
director of the Economic Department of the Saudi Commercial
National Bank.
</P>
<P>
Saudi oil revenues will exceed 30 billion dollars this year as
compared to about 26 billion dollars last year, indicating that
the oil sector in Saudi Arabia would grow by over 15 percent in
1999, based on an average crude oil price of 13 dollars per barrel
against last year's 12 dollars, said the banking official.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq, suffering from acute shortage of hard
currency, has issued new regulations which allow Iraqi citizens
and foreigners to open bank accounts and trade in foreign
currencies, the Arab daily Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A decree, recently approved by the Iraqi Revolutionary Command
Council and signed by President Saddam Hussein, states that Iraqis
are free to own, open bank accounts and trade in foreign
currencies as authorized by the Central Bank of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqis, living abroad while holding hard currency accounts in
Iraq, may now transfer their money abroad after producing relevant
official documents.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank will fix the interest rates on hard currency
deposits.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and Iraqi dinar
is 1:1,900, whereas, the petroleum-backed Iraqi dinar before the
1991 Gulf War fetched 3.2 dollars.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The Moroccan government has allocated 3.5 billion
dirhams (350 million U.S. dollars) to finance an emergency project
to alleviate the serious consequences of a drought that hit
several regions in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production has declined during the current farming
season by about 40 percent as compared to the previous years due
to the scarcity of rainfall, the rise in temperature and too weak
eastern winds, the Arab daily Al Hayat Monday quoted Agriculture
Minister Abdelaziz Belfkih as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that gross domestic product (GDP) would decline by
less than 0.2 percent by the end of 1999 due to agriculture which
depends on rainfall.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the wheat import bill will rise to about
400 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Shas: Coalition Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The coalition talks between One
Israel headed by Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak and the
Shas party have made progress and the two sides are expected to
reach an agreement soon, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shas's delegation met with One Israel's negotiating team again
Sunday night and the talks centered more on finalizing the
coalition policy guidelines than on the distribution of cabinet
portfolios, Shas's delegation head, Labor and Social Affairs
Minister Eli Ishai was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Shas negotiators are expected to report to party spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and the Council of Torah Sages later
Monday and the council is expected to make its final decision on
whether to join the coalition soon.
</P>
<P>
Shas is angry with Barak's earlier decision to let Yisrael
Ba'aliya's leader Natan Sharansky take the interior portfolio which
Shas has held for 15 years, threatening not to join Barak's
coalition.
</P>
<P>
But during Sunday night's meeting, Ishai told One Israel that
Shas wants to hold the National Infrastructure Ministry, including
authorities over the Public Works Department and the Israel Lands
Administration, both of which Barak have already removed from the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shas also wants to hold the Labor and Social
Affairs Ministry, the Health Ministry and a deputy prime minister
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Religious Affairs Ministry has not been settled so
far, with Shas refusing to accept it with a rotation with the
National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
One Israel's talks with the United Torah Judaism also ran into
Monday morning and the two sides are said to be very close to
signing a coalition agreement, having almost reached a compromise
on drafting religious students into the army.
</P>
<P>
Barak is also scheduled to hold talks with interim Likud
leader Ariel Sharon Monday afternoon to ask Sharon to give a
final say whether the Likud is to join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak only has until this Friday to present his coalition list
to the Knesset (parliament), under law that a prime minister has
45 days to form a government after elections.
</P>
<P>
Till now, Yitzhak Mordechai also has some problems within his
Center party over signing coalition agreement with One Israel.
</P>
<P>
Some key party members are said to be very angry that
Mordechai has already guaranteed himself the Transport Ministry
and deputy prime minister posts alongside a seat in the security
cabinet, but failed to win anything for his colleagues such as
the party's No. 2 figure Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian KR Leaders May Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia may need another two
months to try the detained Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok and jail
executor Duch, the military court's investigating judge said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sufficient document to try them now, so we need
more time to investigate, maybe at least two months," Ngin Sam Ann
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said, "more witnesses will be questioned to fill up the
investigation," but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Ngin Sam Ann said, so far, ten people have been questioned by
the court as witnesses of Ta Mok's case.
</P>
<P>
Under the Cambodia law, Ta Mok, 72, can only be legally
detained for six months before he faces trial. So far, Ta Mok has
already been detained in Phnom Penh Military Prosecution
Department for nearly four months since he was arrested on March
6.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Kaing Khek Lev, the 56-year-old security
services chief alias "Duch," was brought into protective custody
on May 9 and charged the next day.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen earlier said in a speech to Cambodian
ambassadors that "Ta Mok can be tried in two phases. In the first
phase, he would be tried under a law outlawing the Khmer Rouge so
that his detention can be continued."
</P>
<P>
"In the second phase," said Hun Sen "Ta Mok would face a law on
genocide that meets international standards."

<HEADLINE> China, Singapore Sign Document on Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and Singapore
working teams on Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) signed here Monday a
memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the further development of
SIP.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Chinese team leader Liang Baohua said
the two sides have resolved all outstanding commercial issues and
reached consensus on major issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Singapore team leader Khaw Boon Wan, permanent secretary of the
Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry, said the signing of the
MoU marks a new phase in SIP's development and has put the SIP
project on a more successful footing.
</P>
<P>
The MoU emphasized that SIP has made impressive progress in the
last five years and met the targets of the initial phase by
becoming one of China's fastest-growing and most competitive
development zones.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that positive results have also been achieved in
adapting Singapore's economic management and public administration
experience in developing the industrial park.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that these achievements of SIP are the result of
the friendly cooperation and joint efforts between China and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In the MoU, both sides agreed that the current priority of
China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Co. Ltd. is to
concentrate on developing the first eight square kilometers and
strive to complete it by January 2001 so that it can serve as a
model for the remainder of the 70 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed that CSSD will adjust the proportions of
shares held by the Chinese and Singapore consortiums respectively
from January 1, 2001, and at the same time the majority
shareholder's responsibility of large tract development will be
handed over to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Under the MoU, shareholding of the Chinese side will increase
from 35 percent to 65 percent while the shares held by the
Singapore side will come down from 65 percent to 35 percent after
the scheduled adjustment takes effect.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed that adaptation of Singapore's
experience will be accelerated so as to train and groom a team of
Chinese managers who are able to effectively take over the
management responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Residents Fight to Protect 600-Year Old Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 residents in this
capital of central China's Hunan Province have joined a volunteer
drive to protect a 600-year old well in the city.
</P>
<P>
A famous city trademark, the well was built in the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) and has since been used by local people. Every day,
more than 1,000 people still fetch water from the well.
</P>
<P>
But for the past several months, the area around the well has
been occupied by a construction company building a series of
apartment blocks in the area. And about 4.7 hectares of the land
around the well have been leveled and many trees cut down.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the city's 1,000 ancient wells have dried up owing to
the mushrooming of modern construction projects in recent years,"
said a resident, who explained that the well is the only one left
which provides drinkable water. More important, it is a historical
relic, he added.
</P>
<P>
The construction work around the well has stopped following
strong protests by local residents, who are still keeping an eye
on the well.

<HEADLINE> New Progress Made upon ARATS' President's Taiwan Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) made progress here today on the arrangements for
ARATS President Wang Daohan's autumn visit to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Li Yafei, ARATS vice secretary-general, and Jan Jyh-horng, SEF
deputy secretary-general, met in Beijing today and continued to
exchange views upon implementing the four point agreement reached
by ARATS President Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu during
their second meeting in Shanghai last October.
</P>
<P>
According to Li's and Jan's brief after the meeting, SEF
proposed a four point principle in receiving Wang in Taiwan, which
was interpreted as being "safe, comfortable, sincere and
constructive." SEF also named Wang's visit as "a trip to get to
know Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The ARATS pointed out that Wang's Taiwan visit would be a high
level dialogue between the heads of the two organizations, which
would include continued and deepened dialogue on politics and
economy.
</P>
<P>
"It was inappropriate, therefore, to simply define Wang's visit
as 'a trip to get to know Taiwan'," said Li, noting that
compatriots across the Straits hoped that Wang's Taiwan visit
would push forward dialogue and negotiations across the Straits,
and bring about improvements and developments of across-the-
Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the preparatory work for Wang's Taiwan visit should
focus on furthered dialogue between the heads of the two
organizations, which should consequently include scheduling.
</P>
<P>
SEF offered two choices for the timing of Wang's visit: from
September 12 to 19 or October 12 to 19. The specific date should
be decided after it was reported to ARATS President Wang Daohan.
</P>
<P>
On the duration of Wang's stay in Taiwan, SEF, which has
proposed nine days, agreed to ARATS plan of seven days.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations also agreed that the route of Wang's
visit would be from Taipei to Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
On other arrangements for Wang-Koo's meeting in Taiwan, ARATS
suggested two dialogues: one would be formal, the other exchanging
views with limited participation. The two organizations would
maintain communication in various forms so as to make proper
preparations for Wang's future visit.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Denies Possibility of Government Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinean (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate Monday refused to concede that he would lose
government after his major coalition partner deserted him and
joined the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press said Skate is facing defeat in
a no-confidence vote on or after July 13 after the largest party
in the ruling coalition withdrew its support for his already
shaky, 23-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
People's Democratic Movement (PDM) leader Mekere Morauta Monday
announced that his party would quit its partnership with Skate's
PNG First party, taking 40 defectors across to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Mekere, opposition leader Bernard Narokobi and the leader of
the Advance PNG party, Speaker John Pundari, said they would form
a new coalition to unseat what they described as Skate's
dictatorial and unpopular government.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders claimed that the opposition now numbered 81
in a parliament of 103 sitting MPs: 40 from the PDM, 25 from the
Advance PNG and 16 from other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders said they would discuss the leadership of an
alternative government over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
However, it was expected that Mekere, as the leader of the
largest party in the new-look opposition, would be offered the
prime ministership, the Australian wire service said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Skate told the wire service that the prime
minister was confident of retaining support and would not bow to
pressure to recall the parliament before July 13.
</P>
<P>
"The pm is continuing to work as normal," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the desertion by the PDM would make Skate
work harder to attract support over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On the weekend, six of Skate's cabinet ministers announced that
they were quitting PNG First -- five joined Mekere's PDM and the
other Pundari's Advance PNG.
</P>
<P>
Mekere was quoted as telling reporters Monday, "The People's
Democratic Movement can no longer be part of a government that is
dictatorial and generally incompetent."
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of failing to secure adequate
international funding or control the 22-percent inflation rate and
the plunging value of the national currency, the kina.
</P>
<P>
Mekere, who was fisheries minister in the Skate government, was
dismissed from the cabinet with three other PDM ministers earlier
this month but said at the time that the PDM would continue to
stay in the government.

<HEADLINE> 25,000 Tons of Crude Oil Leaked in Australian Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- About 25,000 tons of crude oil
leaked Monday into the sea from the offshore oil refinery at Port
Stanvac, south of the coastal Australian city of Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
In an 11-hour operation, emergency response crews attempted to
recover or disperse the one kilometer-long slick, which is up to
250 meters-wide and only three kilometers offshore, the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Mobil Oil Australia, which operates the refinery, said it
appeared the leak occurred early Monday morning after crude oil
carrier Chanda had completed its oil discharge through a floating
hose system.
</P>
<P>
"A full investigation into the incident has begun," the company
said.
</P>
<P>
"It appears at this stage that the oil did not leak from the
ship, but from the floating hose system."
</P>
<P>
About 100 people took part in the clean-up operation, with two
helicopters used to assess the extent of the slick.
</P>
<P>
Two aircraft sprayed dispersants on the oil while eight boats
scooped it up or broke it up through a process called mechanical
agitation.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, no oil has been found washed up the beach and no
wildlife is known to have been affected.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate index, which
is a pointer to the industry's health, reached 103.28 in May this
year, up 1.92 points from the same month in 1998, indicating that

indicating a booming potential for the industry.

PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Weakened by the European election two weeks ago, France's
Gaullist party, the Rally for the Republic (RPR), has designated a
team to decide its reconstruction program and will elect its new
general secretary by the end of 1999 to replace Nicolas Sarkoz,
who has resigned after the European election. The breaking away of
a group of RPR politicians led by former Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua has made the survival of RPR more difficult.
</P>
<P>
-- French troops deployed in Mitrovica, northern Kosovo,
intervened on Saturday to stop a confrontation between Serbs and
Albanians, now separated by a demarcation line along the Ibri
river which cuts the city into two parts. The Albanians tried
cross the river in a peaceful demonstration against the Serbs. The
Serbs denounced it as a provocation by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Gaullist Rally for the Republic remains divided over its
reconstruction program presented by the party's general secretary
Nicolas Sarkozy. Two weeks after the failure of RPR in the
European election, Sarkozy hopes to fix the program for
reconstructing the party at its congress in October, before the
election of the party's new general secretary.
</P>
<P>
-- The first summit meeting of leaders of European Union (EU)
countries and Latin America will open on Monday in Rio de Janeiro.
As the result of a French proposal, the Rio Summit should lay the
first stone of a free trade union between EU and South American
nations, to start with the Mercosur member countries.

<HEADLINE> NPC Approves Laws on Crimes by Minors and Macao Garrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislative body, the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, approved
three important laws here today at the end of its week long
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Legislation on the prevention of crimes by minors, the garrison
for the Macao Special Administrative Region and donations to
public welfare were passed, along with other decisions.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee who presided
over today's meeting, said that children make up nearly a third of
China's total population and the passing of the law dealing with
preventing crimes by minors is of great significance.
</P>
<P>
The law on the garrison in Macao, which will return to China on
December 20 this year, embodies the basic principle of "one
country, two systems", Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The legislation will play a major role in maintaining the
country's sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and the
security of the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the donation law, Li expressed the belief that the
legitimate rights and interests of both donors and beneficiaries
will be fully protected.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the NPC Standing Committee also made
interpretations of relevant articles of the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
"It is both necessary and appropriate for the NPC Standing
Committee to make the interpretations," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The move is in the overall interests of Hong Kong and will help
promote and maintain its long term prosperity and stability, he
added.

MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) - A cargo plane coming from Subic
overshot the runway upon landing at the Ninoy Aquino International
Airport Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, neither of the two pilots was reported hurt in the
accident, which involved an Airbus 310 and affected the flight

According to the initial investigation, the accident was
believed to have been due to the pilots' error.

The aircraft had its wings and one of its two engines
destroyed. So far, about 15 international commercial flights have

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Shanghai, China's
leading industrial and commercial city, are now keen to buy
housing, especially economical apartments, according to a recent
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Shanghai Branch of the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China, shows that more than 80 percent of
910 respondents have plans to buy housing within one or two years.
</P>
<P>
About 51 percent of the surveyed say they will purchase
apartments measuring 80 to 100 square meters each, and some 54
percent say they can afford prices of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan per
square meter.
</P>
<P>
As to the source of funding, more than 40 percent of the
respondents say they will use housing loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts point out that the survey indicates good prospects for
the development of the local real estate market which has been
sluggish for a few years.
</P>
<P>
All commercial banks in Shanghai have opened individual housing
loan services this year. The Shanghai Branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China alone has already lent 1.57 billion yuan
in such loans.

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Shows Moderate Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's exports were still
on the decline in May on a year-on-year basis but the rate of
decline moderated significantly from that recorded since the
second part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
These are shown in the external trade figures for May 1999
released Monday by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) in May 1999 decreased by 4.1 percent from a year earlier
to 108.6 billion HK dollars (13.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports was down by 2.3
percent to 94.8 billion HK dollars (12.2 billion U.S. dollars),
and that of domestic exports by 15 percent to 13.8 billion HK
dollars (1.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports in May 1999 fell by 12.5
percent from a year earlier to 108.9 billion HK dollars (14
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 300 million HK dollars (38.5 million
U.S. dollars) was recorded in May 1999, which was significantly
smaller than the deficit of 11.2 billion HK dollars (1.4 billion U.
S. dollars) recorded in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of 1999 as a whole, the value of
total exports was down by 7.8 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman pointed out that export
performance improved further in May 1999. With the continued
downward adjustment in export prices, the decline in the volume of
total exports should have largely bottomed out in May.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly due to a rebound in exports to a number of East
Asian markets as the regional economic situation recovered, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the visible trade deficit continued to
narrow so far this year mainly due to a decline in the intake of
goods for local use.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Seafood Sector Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The seafood sector of Bangladesh has
become the third major foreign exchange earner for the country as
it has been developing rapidly since the country won independence
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The number of fish processing plants has increased from 15 to
128 during the last 25 years and foreign exchange earnings from
the sector have increased from a trickle of 3.17 million U.S.
dollars in the 1972-73 fiscal year to 321 million dollars in the
1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The seafood sector now ranks third among the country's export
items, next to the ready-made garments and knitwear sectors in
terms of foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
As a riverine deltaic country, crisscrossed by several mighty
rivers such as the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Padma and numerous
canals, Bangladesh, with its tropical climate, is ideally-located
and offers a vast reserve of fresh water fish from its inland
water and shrimps and marine products from the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has 330,000 hectares of inland water, which includes
rivers, canals, marshy land, flood plain area and shrimp ponds, in
addition to 480 kilometers of coastline.
</P>
<P>
At present, this South Asian country produces 30,000 tons of
frozen foods annually and around 1.2 million people directly and
10 million people indirectly depend on the sector for their
livelihood. The sector also contributes about 4.7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Bangladesh held a two-day Dhaka International
Seafood Fair '99, first of its kind in the country, which drew as
many as 35 firms including two from India and one from Britain to
set up stalls at the fair. During the two days, Bangladeshi
seafood exporters received spot orders of about 10.32 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Being convinced of its great potential, the government has
attached due priority to this sector and included it in the
"thrust sectors" during the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The government has provided certain facilities and incentives
to seafood exporters such as import of duty-free refrigerated vans
and import of duty-free capital machinery by the processing
plants.
</P>
<P>
Under the current export policy (1997-2002), the government has
been taking such measures as scientific cultivation of shrimps,
necessary steps to allocate 40 hectares of land to each of the
owners of fish processing plants with a view to introducing modern
methods of shrimp culture, providing shrimp and fish processing
plants with bank financing in easy terms on a priority basis for
the implementation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control and
arranging for duty-free importation of indispensable
quality-control equipment for strengthening quality-control
measures for frozen food.
</P>
<P>
However, the seafood sector in the country is now facing some
problems in its effort for further development.
</P>
<P>
The existing processing plants in the country have a total
capacity of about 250,000 tons of fisheries products, but actually
about 40,000 tons are being processed by about 58 plants because
of the shortage of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the price fall in the international market has already
forced the sector to have a stockpile of shrimps worth about 82.5
million dollars and the sector has incurred huge losses due to the
declining prices, last year's severe flood and the European
Union's restrictions on import.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the price fall, the Bangladesh Frozen Food
Exporters' Association early this month demanded that the
government give a 15-percent cash subsidy on export earnings, but
till now, the government has not agreed to this. The association
has also urged the government to take steps so that the sector
could compete in the international market and called for the
implementation of a report of the Commerce Ministry's task force
to waive about 61.9 million dollars in penal interest on loans
obtained by producers and exporters in the sector.
</P>
<P>
With the concerted efforts of the sector as regard product
diversification and upgrading along with market expansion and
timely intervention of the government, the seafood sector is now
poised to increase its export to 1 billion dollars in the next
five years, the association said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Be Tougher on Car Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African Justice
Department has announced a new initiative aimed at more rapid and
efficient prosecution of car hijackers in Gauteng Province.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, led by Bulelani Ngcuka, national director of
Public Prosecution, has united existing police anti-hijacking
efforts with a team of prosecutors and detectives based in the
courts and offices around Johannesburg, the department said in a
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Car hijacking has become the most feared crime for South
African motorists, particularly those staying or frequenting
Gauteng province, to such an extent that, most night drivers
religiously choose to risk getting hefty traffic fines by ignoring
yield and stop signs for fear of becoming victims of this violent
crime," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Since March 1, all serious car related crimes from all
Johannesburg Police Stations and the police anti-hijacking unit,
previously split between multiple courts with little coordination,
are now directed to the Task Force for early case assessment, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Following assessment, the Task Force then directs further
investigation and prosecutes cases aggressively in regional
courts.
</P>
<P>
Finally, together with the police, the Investigating
Directorate on Organized Crime , and the community, the Task Force
analyses patterns of cases and engages in problem-solving efforts
with local communities, police, and other stake holders to develop
further strategies to prevent car hijacking.
</P>
<P>
The anti-car hijacking initiative brings in two new resources
to the prosecution of car hijacking cases in Johannesburg: the
Investigating Directorate on Organized Crime, which uses the new
powers of the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate and
bring the most serious car hijacking cases to trial; and the
Prosecution Task force on Hijacking, based at the Johannesburg
Magistrates Court which analyzes all new car hijacking and
car-related cases, and also investigate and work with prosecutors
on all cases that the IDOC does not handle.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Justice, the anti-hijacking
initiative was designed to develop the following:
</P>
<P>
-- communication systems between local prosecutors and their
supervisors;
</P>
<P>
-- case screening systems and information technology;
</P>
<P>
-- practical means for prosecutors to guide local police
investigators;
</P>
<P>
-- an automated system to collect statistics about conviction
rates, priority crimes, withdrawals, etc. as well as reduce fraud
and corruption;
</P>
<P>
-- a code of conduct for prosecutors; and,
</P>
<P>
-- practical methods to communicate more regularly with
witnesses, victims, and community structures.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative has been designed to demonstrate that a
replicable strategic enforcement effort, uniting prosecution,
police, and community, can achieve real reductions in crime," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is not just to reduce hijacking, but to inspire and
instruct similar strategic efforts against other crime problems,"
it added.

<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The renovation of the Tian'anmen
Rostrum, the most renowned ancient building in China, is nearing
its end with the approach of the 50th anniversary of the founding
of New China.
</P>
<P>
Located at the main gate of the Imperial Forbidden City, the
582-year-old rostrum was where the old emperors would make public
decrees. And it was there on October 1, 1949, that Chairman Mao
Zedong announced to the Chinese people the founding of the People'
s Republic of China. It has remained a place for important
ceremonies ever since.
</P>
<P>
The renovation project has involved many activities, including
painting the walls, renewing the lightning-prevention devices,
improving the electrical circuits and fire fighting equipment,
refurbishing wooden structures, replacing banisters on stairways
and cleaning tiles.
</P>
<P>
The reviewing stand of the rostrum has also been refurbished
along with a repaving of the street level. Even the red lanterns
hanging from the rostrum have been replaced by new ones, with the
lighting also improved to enhance the outlook of the building at
night.
</P>
<P>
The rostrum was first opened to visitors in 1988, and has
received more than 18 million domestic and overseas tourists since
then.

<HEADLINE> South China Province to Build More Youth Hostels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
plans to build 20 more youth hostels in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Weixiong, head of Guangdong Provincial Tourism
Administration, the province has led the nation by opening three
international hostels for students in Guangzhou, the provincial
capital, Zhuhai and Zhaoqing cities in the same province, in late
1998.
</P>
<P>
Administrators of the three hostels recently received a dozen
reservation letters from abroad via a room booking network through
the International Youth Hostel Federation.
</P>
<P>
Youth hostel administrative officials from 80 countries will
make an inspection tour to this south Chinese province in August.
In turn, Guangdong Province will send 80 Chinese students to
inspect youth hostels in Europe in a bid to improve youth hostels
in China.
</P>
<P>
Youth hostels are safe with proper sanitation facilities but
cost less than hotels. They first appeared in Germany in 1912.
The International Youth Hostel Federation now has 4,500 youth
hostels listed and has grown into the world's biggest
accommodation organization.
</P>
<P>
The federation now has 60 member countries and 40 non-member
countries also using the facilities, with the individual
memberships totaling 3.5 million people.

<HEADLINE> Residents Relocated Before Flood Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 57,700 residents
living in the reservoir area of the Xiaolangdi Water Control
Project, the second largest under construction after the Three
Gorges Project, have been relocated ahead of the expected flooding
season.
</P>
<P>
As the largest water control project on the Yellow River, China
's second longest, the Xiaolangdi project is designed to protect
the areas of the lower reaches of the Yellow River from flooding.
The project calls for relocation of nearly 200,000 residents in
central China's Henan and north China's Shanxi provinces, and 27,
233 ha of land is to be submerged within the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
With the flood season approaching, all the residents living 215
meters below the expected waterline will have to move to higher
land to avoid problems during the flood season.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels in Henan and Shanxi have taken a
series of measures to speed up the relocation work, including
allocating new lots of land for the residents, and ensuring
sufficient funding for the relocation project.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Factions Agree to Accept Vote Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's pro-integration and
pro-independence groups attending a reconciliation conference here
have expressed support for a peaceful reconciliation process and
acceptance of the vote results on self determination.
</P>
<P>
Opening the second session of the second round of the Dare
dialogue and reconciliation conference here Monday, Dili Bishop
Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo said the meeting is aimed at bringing
the East Timorese to an attitude of listening to each other and
respecting the result of direct balloting.
</P>
<P>
"Please avoid personal or group problems which could lead to a
conflict of interest in each party," Belo said.
</P>
<P>
Tamrat Samuel, assistant of Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. Special
envoy for East Timor, said the authorities should also take note
of human factors involved in the popular consultation, so both
pro- and anti-integration groups can accept the result of the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Anna Gomes, head of the Portuguese Interest Section here, who
represents the Portugal government, said the country has a
commitment to accept whatever the result is of the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Ambassador At Large FX Lopes da Cruz, representing
the pro-integration group, said if both parties could not find a
real solution for the territory, it will harm the East Timorese in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Jailed rebel leader Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao, who
represents the anti-integration group, has asked all East Timorese
to change the conflict into a new and better situation for peace
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The second-round meeting was a continuation of a successful
church-sponsored conference held in Dare village, west of Dili,
capital of East Timor, in September last year. Like the first Dare
talks, the second-round conference is jointly sponsored by Carlos
Filipe Ximenes Belo and Baucau Bishop Basilio do Nascimento.
</P>
<P>
The second-round conference is divided into two session. The
first session, held in the same hotel on Friday and Saturday,
involved only representatives from East Timor, without East
Timorese living in exile.
</P>
<P>
The second session is attended by 60 participants from both
groups, U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy, Australian Ambassador
John McCharty, some representatives from the European Union,
Japan, Italy, France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the talks will issue a joint communique on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The ballot will allow the territory's people to choose whether
their homeland should become an autonomous region within Indonesia
or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Tian'anmen Square Re-opens to Public (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The world's biggest square today
re-opened to the public after an eight-month renovation during
which time the work was carried out behind a high, metal barrier.
</P>
<P>
The massive face-lift of Tian'anmen Square began in October
last year but the fencing finally came down last night as more
than 5,000 people rushed to watch the traditional flag raising
ceremony at 4.00 am
</P>
<P>
Entering the new square, which is as big as nine football
pitches, the most eye-catching sight is the neat, pink granite
paving flags. And in today's early dawn dragonflies and swallows
hovered over the sweeping new lawns which are a feature of the
east and west sides of the square.
</P>
<P>
The crowd enthusiastically sang the Chinese national anthem and
the "East Is Red", a traditional song lauding late Chairman Mao
Zedong, who announced the founding of the People's Republic on the
Tian'anmen Rostrum on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Just before 8:00 am, thousands of tourists, in groups or
individually, arrived in the square which was soon buzzing with
different dialects and foreign languages; a once familiar babble
before it closed.
</P>
<P>
Among the crowds, there were urban youngsters in fashionable
clothes and farmers wearing traditional Chinese shoes made of
cloth. And then came the disabled in armchairs and babies in
handcarts pushed by their parents.
</P>
<P>
An 80-year old woman, who said her surname was Feng, had come
from remote Jiangxi province by airplane. "I have never visited
our capital before and I want to visit Chairman Mao's Mausoleum,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
There was an endless queue in front of the mausoleum and many
people explained that they knew the opening times from TV and
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Beirut's Power Generators Roar Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Like most of the residents in
Beirut and its suburbs, Ali Mohammed dusted off his old generator
and made it in order again to supply electricity for his cloth
shop.
</P>
<P>
"My business is already bad and I can't afford additional
expenses. The current two-hour electricity is not far enough for
me," Mohammed told Xinhua Sunday in his shop in the capital's
commercial street of Hamra.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't used generators for three years and the Israeli
attack brought us to the painful past overnight," the 50-year-old
businessman said with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
He thought of his eight-year-old daughter which was killed in
the 1996 Israeli "Grapes of Wrath" operations, which claimed at
least 200 people's lives, most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Israel launched the biggest air strike on
Lebanon since the 1996 onslaught, killing eight Lebanese and
wounding over 60 others.
</P>
<P>
Apart from three bridges linking the capital and its south and
a telephone relay station, the country's two power stations which
feed electricity to Beirut and its surrounding areas, were also
destroyed by the 10-hour blitz.
</P>
<P>
The strike plunged much of the capital into darkness and
electricity supply has to be limited to two or three hours a day.
</P>
<P>
As the temperature and humidity continue to climb, the city
will swelter because there is no refrigeration nor air
conditioning. Beirut citizens won't even be able to use electric
fans.
</P>
<P>
"We'll connect electricity lines from different areas to
supply Beirut with power before we can begin repairing the
plants," said George Mouawad, Director General of Electricite du
Liban (EDL).
</P>
<P>
"Our priority is to supply water pumping stations, telephone
exchanges, and the grain silos at the port," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss said the latest damage is practically
immeasurable since it coincides with the start of a promising
tourist season.
</P>
<P>
Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has promised to
cover the total cost of repairing the Jamhour and Bsalim power
plants, estimated at around 30 million U.S. dollars while Syria
offered electricity emergency supply.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis don't want to see Lebanese reconstruction go
forward. They want to see us pay billions of dollars to rebuild
our bridges and restore our electricity and never have the chance
to move forward," said the irate Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has spent hundreds of millions of dollars during the
1990s on restoring its electrical power supplies and grid from the
damages of the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"They're paralyzing the country when our economy is already
languishing," said Hussein Sami, 47, who runs a restaurant in
Arshrafieh, Beirut's another famous commercial area.
</P>
<P>
With the announcement by EDL that power supply will be
increased to 12 hours a day in Beirut from Monday, the clatter of
private generators will drop, but the effect of Israel's strike on
the country's economy is turning clearer.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed is sitting alone in his once crowded shop to wait for
the frightened customers, most of whom are staying at home.

"There are no stunning changes in the square," commented Yang
Shukun, who lives just behind the Great Hall of the People. "It is
still the familiar and amiable square. However, it looks wider and
more splendid."
</P>
<P>
"It is very beautiful, and it is the world's largest after all,
" said Michael Wechsler, from New York's Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of new lamp standards have been installed to
illuminate the square at night, the Monument to the People's
Heroes and other landmarks, which had become weather-beaten and
affected by pollution, have been cleaned up while powerful
loudspeakers have replaced the older tinny sounding ones.
</P>
<P>
Meng Wenqing, an architect from south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, said that after examining the joints of the
stones and the drainage systems, he found that state of the art
techniques had been used in the restoration work.
</P>
<P>
The original site of Tian'anmen Square was a courtyard of the
Imperial Palace where the ordinary people were not allowed to
enter. It was expanded into the existing vast area in 1959 and the
latest face-lift will enable it to proudly stage the grand Gala of
the 50th founding anniversary of New China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Wei Zhihe, a worker who was involved in the first renovation 40
years ago, said that it was right that the square should have been
renovated again so as to receive more tourists, hold bigger mass
activities and to demonstrate the pride of a rising China in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
For many years, Chinese people have regarded visiting Beijing
as one of the biggest pleasures in their lives. When they arrive
they almost invariably head for Tian'anmen Square which is known
as "The Heart of China".

TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty passengers were killed and
27 others injured in northern Iran on Sunday afternoon when a bus
plunged from a bridge.
</P>
<P>
The bus was on its way from Qouchan in northern Khorasan
province to Shiraz in southern Fars province when the accident
occurred in Damghan in the northern province of Seman, some 250
kilometers east of Tehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen women and six men and children were killed and the
injured passengers were rushed to hospitals and the Red Crescent
centers in the cities nearby, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Highway traffic experts said the steep road, negligence of the
driver in noticing traffic signs and high speed were reasons
behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, 21 people were killed and six others seriously
injured in the central province of Isfahan when a passenger bus
collided with a truck.
</P>
<P>
Iranian traffic officials have complained that the number of
traffic incidents in Iran is about 200 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Trades Fading Away (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Although business had been slack
for years, Zhang Fugen, a Chinese who had been making a living by
writing letters for the illiterate, felt it hard to face when it
really came to the time that he had to give up the job.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a resident in the city of Lianyungang, east China's
Jiangsu Province, closed his letter-writing business in 1994,
since few customers came to him for help.
</P>
<P>
"Who would have come to me?" said the man, 65, now owner of a
VCD shop. "Young people can all write, and there are telephones
and even computers everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Zhang now earns much more than he did before. "And I'm proud I'
ve been engaged in one of the newest industries," he said, while
presenting some newly released VCDs to customers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is only one of an increasing number of Chinese who have
lost their original jobs in some traditional trades that have been
fading away over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
There are no official figures as to exactly how many trades
have disappeared or are withering away across the country, but Tao
Siyan, China's first doctor of folklore and professor with the
Dongnan University in Jiangsu Province, lists about a dozen, such
as writing letters for illiterate people, supplying boiled water,
selling coffins, and repairing pans and bowls.
</P>
<P>
"These trades had played a big role in China for generations,"
Tao said. "But their functions have become less and less useful
due to China's rapid economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
"A trade disappears naturally if it is no longer needed by
society," Tao added. "And the faster the society progresses, the
faster new trades replace old ones."

<P>
According to Tao, the past two decades have seen the most
dramatic restructuring in China's lines of business as new ideas,
advanced technologies, as well as various new products were
introduced and developed during the country's reform, opening up
and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of China's telephone users has
topped 110 million, the second largest in the world, and that of
Internet users in the country has reached 2.5 million,
representing a great change in methods of communication.
</P>
<P>
The "tiger stove", which got its name because of its bulky
shape and a chimney like a tiger's tail, was a popular boiled
water supplier for some 200 years in many parts of east China,
when there was no convenient fuel available but wood and coal. In
Shanghai alone, there were 900 such stoves.
</P>
<P>
Yet they are rarely seen now because local residents use gas
and electrical stoves and no longer go to "tiger stove" shops for
boiled water.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have accelerated the elimination of "tiger
stoves", for the coal and wood that fueled them produced an
enormous amount of dust and sulfur dioxide, causing serious
pollution.
</P>
<P>
"What the nation has been encouraging is the development of new
and high-tech industries, and trades that are environment-friendly
or bring about marketable products," explained Shanghai Mayor Xu
Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
The tools of outdated trades are not all eliminated, however,
as museums are more than ready to accommodate them. The Nanjing
Folklore Museum, set up ten years ago in Nanjing, the provincial
capital of Jiangsu, has collected hundreds of such tools,
including those used for repairing "tiger stoves", cane chairs,
and wooden water buckets.
</P>
<P>
"These trades constitute a major part of Chinese history and
culture," said Yang Tianqi, deputy curator of the museum. "People
may learn something by looking at them."

<HEADLINE> International Volunteers Arrive in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-four international
volunteers arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, via special
flights from Darwin, Australia, on Monday to help conduct the
territory's August direct ballot, the Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The volunteers will be immediately posted in all districts of
East Timor to carry out their jobs, such as conducting the
registration of voters and making preparations for polling
stations," said David Wimhurst, spokesman of the United Nations
Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET).
</P>
<P>
He said the volunteers are experienced in carrying out
elections or plebiscites in many countries and they also attended
an intensive training course in Darwin for such purposes.
</P>
<P>
Wimhurst also said some 100 cars were unloaded in the Baucau
air base, East Timor, from a transport plane which brought them
from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Another delivery of 100 cars is also expected in East Timor
next week to help facilitate the work of UNAMET in the territory,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Wimhurst, some 70 U.N. civilian policemen who
arrived in Dili last week have now been assigned to several
district capitals, like Dili, Aileu, Liquica, Baucau, Maliana,
Ermera, Suai and Same.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the United Nations will send civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police maintain law and order. A
key function will be to disarm rival factions that are either for
or against the territory's independence.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered a two-week
delay of the ballot which was originally scheduled for August 8,
citing security and logistics concerns.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Spain to Seek Economic, Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A joint committee will soon seek
further cooperation between Egypt and Spain in industry, trade,
investment and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian economic sources said that the two sides will discuss
the possibility of setting up a joint business council when the
Egyptian-Spanish Higher Committee meets in the first half of
September in Madrid, Spain, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The business council is aimed at balancing the bilateral trade
by expanding trade volume, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that trade volume stood at 450 million
U.S. dollars between Egypt and Spain in 1998, with Egypt exporting
goods worth 92 million dollars, the pro-government newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said an agreement on prevention of dual taxation
and several accords on trade cooperation will be signed between
the two countries during the committee session.
</P>
<P>
Spain has agreed to sponsor two conferences in Madrid and
Barcelona on the sidelines of the committee meetings, which are
aimed at encouraging Spanish investment in Egypt, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Egyptian businessmen is expected to take part
in both conferences, during which the businessmen will highlight
the fields of investment in their country.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government is stepping up efforts to attract
foreign businessmen to buy state-run enterprises chosen for
privatization and invest in its industrial free zones and national
project, such as Toshka in the south, which is implemented to
reclaim desert land.
</P>
<P>
Spain has so far set up 15 joint ventures in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Export 160,000 Tons of Maize in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will have 160,000 tons
of maize and 27,000 tons of millet for export in 1998/1999
agricultural year ending June 30, 1999, Mozambican Minister of
Agriculture and Fisheries Carlos do Rosario has said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that Mozambique has so much surplus of
these two kinds of crops in two decades," do Rosario said
recently.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Monday quoted the minister as saying
that Mozambique is expected to harvest 1.8 million tons of grain
this year, a 10 percent increase over last year, although 63,000
hectares of farm land have been flooded this agricultural year.
</P>
<P>
However, do Rosario admitted that this year Mozambique needs to
import 64,000 tons of rice and 190,000 tons of wheat to cover the
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Yet the minister noted that the food shortage in Mozambique had
 gradually dropped to 201,000 tons from 490,000 tons in 1996,
680,000 tons in 1994 and 1.2 million tons in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increased grain production to a 300 million
U.S. dollars investment in agriculture under the National
Agricultural Development Program, good seeds offered to farmers by
his government and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, an
increased planting area of 3.5 million hectares and a favorable
climate.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- About 85 percent of Zambian
children of school going age are out of school, Zambian Education
Minister Godfrey Miyanda has said in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"About 85 percent of children of schools going age are unable
to enter into school or attend any type of formal education," the
Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted Miyanda as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted that in 1996, the government

which provided a policy framework and strategies to guide the
provision and delivery of education in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF)
report, Zambia and other developing countries spend 70 billion
U.S. dollars on education every year.
</P>
<P>
Over 8.2 million children aged 14 or younger have lost their
parents through AIDS and 7.8 million of these children are in
sub-Saharan Africa, said the UNICEF report.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Not to Participate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian sitting conservative Majlis
(parliament) Speaker Nateq Nouri will not take part in the next
Majlis elections slated for February 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the right-wing (conservative) factions have
confirmed Nouri's decision, citing tiredness and consolidating the
conservative political group, the Association of Militant Mullahs
in Tehran (AMM), as the main reasons behind his decision.
</P>
<P>
The unsuitable political situation for the conservatives and
Nouri's failure in 1997 presidential elections forced him to
change his mind, the pro-moderate daily Salam said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, born in 1943, served as Interior Minister in 1981-1985
and was elected Majlis Speaker for eight terms since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Following their failure in the February elections for local
city and village councils this year, the conservatives started
reorganization of their groups and parties, particularly the
prominent AMM, in which top Iranian conservative leaders have
memberships.
</P>
<P>
Both the moderates and conservatives have started their
campaigns for the sixth Majlis elections and pinned their hope on
the elections for a change in the country's power balance.
</P>
<P>
Some rumors said that the moderate factions have urged former
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to run for the Majlis speaker
in order to defeat the conservatives, who are dominating the
Majlis, and to ensure the majority for the moderates, the main
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani served as Majlis speaker for 9 years until he
was elected president for two four-year terms in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Shas: Coalition Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The coalition talks between One
Israel headed by Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak and the
Shas party have made progress and the two sides are expected to
reach an agreement soon, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shas's delegation met with One Israel's negotiating team again
Sunday night and the talks centered more on finalizing the
coalition policy guidelines than on the distribution of cabinet
portfolios, Shas's delegation head, Labor and Social Affairs
Minister Eli Ishai was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Shas negotiators are expected to report to party spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and the Council of Torah Sages later
Monday and the council is expected to make its final decision on
whether to join the coalition soon.
</P>
<P>
Shas is angry with Barak's earlier decision to let Yisrael
Ba'aliya's leader Natan Sharansky take the finance portfolio which
Shas has held for 15 years, threatening not to join Barak's
coalition.
</P>
<P>
But during Sunday night's meeting, Ishai told One Israel that
Shas wants to hold the National Infrastructure Ministry, including
authorities over the Public Works Department and the Israel Lands
Administration, both of which Barak have already removed from the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shas also wants to hold the Labor and Social
Affairs Ministry, the Health Ministry and a deputy prime minister
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Religious Affairs Ministry has not been settled so
far, with Shas refusing to accept it with a rotation with the
National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
One Israel's talks with the United Torah Judaism also ran into
Monday morning and the two sides are said to be very close to
signing a coalition agreement, having almost reached a compromise
on drafting religious students into the army.

<P>
Barak is also scheduled to hold talks with interim Likud
leader Ariel Sharon Monday afternoon to ask Sharon to give a
final say whether the Likud is to join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak only has until this Friday to present his coalition list
to the Knesset (parliament), under law that a prime minister has
45 days to form a government after elections.
</P>
<P>
Till now, Yitzhak Mordechai also has some problems within his
Center party over signing coalition agreement with One Israel.

Some key party members are said to be very angry that
Mordechai has already guaranteed himself the Transport Ministry
and deputy prime minister posts alongside a seat in the security
cabinet, but failed to win anything for his colleagues such as
the party's No. 2 figure Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Starts Quality Inspection of All Imported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Bureau of
Standards Monday started compulsory quality inspection of all
imported products in a bid to protect the health and safety of the
public.
</P>
<P>
Local media Monday reported that the bureau has decided to
enforce the import inspection regulations stipulated in Government
Notice No. 672 of December 25, 1998 so as to reverse the trend of
importing poor quality goods.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been nicknamed by the media as a dumping ground
for imported sub-standard and shoddy products for years.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that Tanzania is flooded with sub-standard imported
goods and the public outcry on low quality imported products is
now more evident than ever," said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory quality inspection is also expected to rescue
local industries which are subjected to unfair competition from
some imported products of poor quality.
</P>
<P>
"As an example, the government published a few months ago
several types of imported dry batteries because they did not meet
national standards and were selling at give-away prices which were
detrimental to locally made products," the statement noted.

NANNING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Forest workers in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region recently discovered nearly 3,000
Normal Dendroglossa trees which are believed to be close the
extinction.
</P>
<P>
The trees which belong to the tree-fern family are located in a
forest farm in Tian'e County in northwestern Guangxi. This kind of
tree is believed one of the oldest species in the world. It is
under state-level protection in China and known as a "living
fossil" similar to the ginkgo.
</P>
<P>
Some of the trees have a diameter of 30 cm and stand dozens of
meters high.
</P>
<P>
The county's subtropical climate provides favorable conditions
for the growth of the trees, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Now relevant departments in the autonomous region have taken
measures to protect the trees.

<HEADLINE> China's Service Industry Keen on ISO Certificates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's service industry is
becoming more aware of the need to obtain quality certificates
granted by the Organization for International Standardization.
</P>
<P>
People from the sector had formerly overlooked the necessity to
acquire the internationally-acknowledged certificate, because many
considered that it only affected those conducting foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Quality Certification Center for Import
and Export Commodities (CQC), over 7,000 Chinese firms have set up
ISO9000 quality systems and won certification, since the system
was introduced in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies are actually within the manufacturing
industries, especially those involved in foreign trade but as the
service sector gets bigger, it is facing a higher demand for
efficiency and quality, on which the ISO system offers a standard.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs from the sector in south China's Guangdong
Province, Hong Kong and Macao recently convened in this provincial
capital to exchange ideas about the ISO9000 quality system in
order to help firms to modernize their management, increase
efficiency and guarantee the quality of their services.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from a Bank of China's local office which is
the first service industry company to obtain ISO certification in
China, said that the bank has developed better inter-department
cooperation after the system was introduced.

<HEADLINE> Iran Has 3.2 Million Drug Addicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite Iran's large-scale
campaign against drug trafficking, there are 3.2 million drug
addicts throughout the country, a medical official has said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bahram Yeganeh, secretary of the national committee to
fight against AIDS, made the remarks at a seminar on AIDS and
narcotics in Ardabil in the northwestern Ardabil province, local
daily Iran reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 2,000 tons of various narcotics are consumed
in Iran every year, but the country's anti-drug forces can only
confiscate an average of 155 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures announced by the United Nations, drug
smugglers in Iran can fetch 1.6 billion U.S. dollars every year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, another daily Khordad reported, secretary of the
anti-drug headquarters at the Iranian Presidential Office,
Mohammad Fallah, rejected Yeganeh's remarks, putting the number of
Iranian drug addicts at 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Fallah also denied that some 2,000 tons of drugs are consumed
in Iran, adding that about 2,160 tons of drugs are produced in
Afghanistan according to U.N. reports.
</P>
<P>
Iran Saturday burned 55 tons of drugs in Tehran to show its
determination to fight against drug trafficking while calling for
international cooperation to uproot drug production.
</P>
<P>
The country started large-scale anti-drug campaigns in 1989,
but local press said the number of addicts in the country is still
increasing.

<HEADLINE> UAE Firm to Bid for Beirut Rebuilding Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A leading construction company
in Dubai of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will bid for the
rebuilding of two power stations and three bridges in Beirut
damaged by Israeli air strikes last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company did not want to be identified until the contract
was actually signed, said the Dubai-based Khaleej Times daily
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Abu Ali, manager of the company's technical
section, a team of engineers from the company is already in
Lebanon carrying out some infrastructure projects there.
</P>
<P>
"We are highly optimistic that we would bag the rebuilding
work, which is estimated to cost around 164 million U.S.
dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have already submitted the proposals with all the required
financial and other details to the authorities," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the usual lengthy process for signing
contracts cannot be applied in a situation like this when bridges
have been completely wrecked and the country is in the dark due to
disruption of power supply.
</P>
<P>
He said the company was ready to start rebuilding one of the
bridges immediately so as to restore access to all parts of
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The potential rival bidders might include a French power
construction firm, Belgium International Co. and a Saudi-French
construction company, he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Lebanon Construction and Development
Authority is expected to take an emergency decision on Monday
morning. The whole matter will be finalized before the end of the
week, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Should Develop Capital Market: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China should accelerate the
development of its capital market and industrial restructuring in
order to maintain sustainable growth in the 21st century,
according to a mainstream research institute.
</P>
<P>
A report just completed by the Macroeconomic Research Institute
under the State Development Planning Commission suggests the need
for the securities market to provide a larger share of financing
sources, according to today's China Securities.
</P>
<P>
The report focuses on studies of economic policies needed for
the beginning of the next century and notes that direct financing
should account for a quarter of total fixed-asset investments. It
also points out the need for an expanded market for stocks and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
The report outlines a number of detailed measures which include
encouraging public offerings for profitable state-owned
enterprises, providing companies with different forms of ownership
equal opportunities for listings and placing priority to initial
public offerings (IPOs) offered by high-tech firms in order to
promote technical innovations.
</P>
<P>
It also recommends that the government introduce pension,
insurance, trust and investment funds into the capital market in
conjunction with continued efforts to foster securities investment
funds and ensure more institutional investors enter the market.
</P>
<P>
Economists from the institute urged the government to exert
greater efforts to develop the money market in order to improve
implementation of the country's monetary policies and expand the
insurance and property rights trading markets.

KAMPALA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
will deliver 400 tons of relief food to some 146,000 displaced
people in the district of Bundibugyo in western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Apollo Katsigazi, WFP convoy monitor, said here at the weekend
that his organization had already delivered 280 tons of food to
the homeless.
</P>
<P>
Five health units had also benefited from the relief assistance
being offered by the WFP, the New Vision newspaper Monday quoted
Katsigazi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among the items given to the displaced are maize flour, maize
grains, soya beans, sugar, groundnuts and cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
In the district, local leaders commended the WFP assistance but
called for more help to the displaced people who were being
resettled in the protected areas.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Medicines sans Frontiers, an
international non-governmental organization, is also in the
district to treat the sick and avert the spread of communicable
diseases like cholera in the camps.
</P>
<P>
The local people were reportedly mainly displaced by rebels of
the Allied Democratic Forces active in the mountains in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has tried to flush out the rebels and
kill them, but with little success. The rebels camp in the bushes
and the government troops have difficulty in reaching them.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urges WTO to Phase Out Textiles Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will press the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement an agreement that
would phase out export quotas on textiles and clothing products,
Manila Bulletin reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This concern will form part of the government's "policy
statement" in relation to the 1999 trade policy review of the
Philippines in the WTO, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum, the nation's chief trade negotiator Edsel
Custodio said that developed countries have mainly chosen to delay
the removal of quotas from the coverage of textiles and clothing
products from the multilateral trading system (MTS) of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO agreements, the Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA) which
imposes export quotas on textiles and clothing products has to be
removed and this sector will be governed under the rules and
disciplines of the MTS.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines had anticipated favorable trading conditions
for its major garments and textiles exports," Custodio said.
</P>
<P>
However, he complained, halfway through the implementation, the
Philippines together with other developing countries is
"experiencing frustration over the slow phase of the integration
into the MTS."
</P>
<P>
The MFA imposes export quotas or the volume of textile and
clothing products that developing countries can ship to developed
economies.
</P>
<P>
The United States accounts for 70 percent of the total quota
market and 60 percent of the Philippines' exports of textile and
clothing products go to this market. Other quota markets include
the European Union and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines exports of garments continue to falter midway
in the implementation of the Agreement on textiles and clothing,"
Custodio added.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Garments and Textile Exports Board (GTEB)
reported having reached an exports target of 2.9 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Nelly Villafuerte said the
country's export revenues from garments and textile this year may
shrink from 2.9 billion dollars to 2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Tightens Security to Prevent Fishing Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Security has been beefed up in the
southern Thai province of Phuket to prevent possible clash between
rival fishing groups over nocturnal anchovy fishing, the Bangkok
Post said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
All marine police patrol boats in the province have been put on
alert to prevent protesting fishermen from blocking the Phuket
bays.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives Ministry has
imposed a ban on anchovy fishing at night using luring lights
following protests by inshore fishermen who blocked the Songkhla
deep-sea port for nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen argued that the practice is wiping out fish
stocks and threatening their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
However, rival fishermen, angered by the ban, are threatening
to launch their protest and block the Phuket port.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities are said to be optimistic that the rival
fishermen would be reasonable and resolve the fishing problem
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The two-week blockade of Songkhla port has caused millions of
baht in lost business. Exporters have had to pay higher shipping
costs to get freight trucked to Klong Toey port in Bangkok, for
onward shipping.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Three Express Trains Bringing Closer Mainland-HK Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- After Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, the three express cargo trains shuttle back and forth
between China's inland areas and Hong Kong as usual, helping bring
ever closer links between them.
</P>
<P>
The three express trains bound for Hong Kong from Changsha,
Shanghai and Zhengzhou have been operating for 37 years. Over the
past two years since Hong Kong's return to China, the trains have
carried to Hong Kong more than 2.35 million pigs, 65,000 head of
cattle and 90,000 tons of meat, 5,800 tons of eggs as well as a
large quantity of aquatic products, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
This has helped ensure an ample supply of goods in Hong Kong
and satisfied the daily needs of the local people.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 1,097 square km, Hong Kong's population now
exceeds 6.8 million. Due to Hong Kong's high population density
and limited cultivated land, it has long imported most of its
needs for farm produce.
</P>
<P>
In 1962, thanks to the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's
concern, the three express trains were launched to transport fresh
and frozen foodstuffs to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Now, over 95 percent of pigs and cattle that Hong Kong imports
come from the mainland and over half of frozen meat and aquatic
products are transported here by the trains.
</P>
<P>
The smooth operation of the three express trains across nine
provinces on the mainland all the year round is partly attributed
to the close cooperation between the railway and foreign trade
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The railway departments have formulated rules and regulations
to ensure the trains run smoothly all the time while the foreign
trade departments have set up bases for raising pigs and cattle
and built a dozen stations for services along the railway routes.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997, the three
express trains have been running as smoothly as before. The
operation remained uninterrupted even during the worst floods to
hit some mainland areas.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997 when an avian flu broke out in Hong Kong,
the local government adopted immediate measures to kill chickens
in Hong Kong. To compensate for the shortage, a batch of 38,000
live chickens were transported from the mainland to Hong Kong
during the 1998 Spring Festival.

<HEADLINE> Fund Raising Grows in Singapore Venture Capital Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 28 (Xinhua)-- A 1999 survey shows that
Singapore raised 1.1 billion Singapore dollars (647 million U.S.
dollars) of venture capital in 1998, an increase of 15 percent
over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The survey published by the Economic Development Board (EDB) of
Singapore Monday also indicates that Singapore currently houses 82
active fund management groups, both international and home-grown,
which employ around 360 investment professionals and manage a
cumulative total of 8.8 billion Singapore dollars (5.18 billion
U.S. dollars) as of January 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the findings of the EDB venture capital survey,
Singapore-based capital investors committed around 921 million
Singapore dollars (541.8 million U.S. dollars) in 341 investments
worldwide in 1998 while venture capital investments in Singapore
reached 160 million Singapore dollars (94 million U.S. dollars) in
40 companies, accounting for 17 percent of the total and doubling
the amount in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of these 40 Singapore-based companies that received venture
capital funding in 1998, 16 companies, or 40 percent, are in the
seed and early stages which absorbed 33.2 million Singapore
dollars (19.5 million U.S. dollars), or 21 percent of the total
venture capital investment in Singapore in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that 35 out of the 40 funded
Singapore-based companies were technology-related with over one
thirds being information technology companies.
</P>
<P>
Singapore first created its venture capital group in 1985
within the EDB in a bid to develop a vibrant venture capital
industry in the city state and it targets by 2005 to increase
venture capital professional number by at least 50 percent, and
expand the number of venture capital-backed seed stage companies
by at least 300 and double the fund managed out of Singapore.

WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Hosts the United States needed

at the 55th minute when Shannon MacMillan picked a cross in the left
and beat the DPR Korean goal-keeper with a sudden shot.
</P>
<P>
The Americans had a golden chance to enlarge the gap but

The DPR Korean team also missed a scoring chance as Kim Kum Sil
also hit the cross-bar.

and could barely followed the pace of the host team. At the 68th
minute, Tisha Venturini headed home a cross to put the American team
2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes later, Venturini headed home again to seal the 3-0

<P>
TIANJIN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city in
north China, has invested 320 million yuan in recent years to
develop seashore tourism programs for its bathing beach.
</P>
<P>
The city completed the bathing beach, the country's largest man-
made seashore holiday resort, some 10 years ago on Bohai Bay. It
has so far attracted over 4.5 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the beach, the local tourism department has
constructed a 3,000-meter-long dam which helps form a three sq.km.
lake at high tide, and two beaches covering about one sq.km. each.
</P>
<P>
The department has also developed a series of tourism venues in
the area, including a heated swimming pool and an aquarium.
</P>
<P>
The city has planted 20,000 sq.m. of greenery in the beach area,
and weeping willows and flower gardens along the roads from the
beach to the city proper, thus forming an "ecological holiday
resort" as local people put it.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREUX, Switzerland, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban women
became the champions of the 1999 BCV Volleyball Masters by
defeating the Chinese team in the final here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champions Cuba won 23-25, 25-19, 25-16, 25-17 to
repeat their feat at Atlanta in 1996, exploiting the injury of
star Chinese spiker Sun Yue in the second set.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic silver medalists China rallied from 9-13 down to
take the closely-combated first set 25-23.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, China and Cuba tied 14-all before captain
Sun collided with a Cuban player to injure her knees.
</P>
<P>
China, last year's runner-up here, suffered loss of both
attacking power and concentration after Sun was replaced and Cuba
apparently gained an upper hand through the rest of the match.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said Sun, who staggered back to hotel under the
assistance of two players after the game, would recover in several
days.
</P>
<P>
Altogether eight world leading women's volleyball teams
attended the yearly event from June 22-27, sponsored by BCV, a
Swiss cantonal bank.

In the match for the third place, Italy battled for five sets
to tame Brazil 25-16, 22-25, 17-25, 25-20, 29-27.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria fully recovered from a 7-1
defeat to the United States, beating Denmark 2-0 to boost their
chances of qualifying for the quarterfinals of the 3rd Women's World
Cup soccer tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian team, which beat DPR Korea 2-1 and lost to hosts
the United States 7-1 in their previous two outings, opened the
scoring at the 24th minute when Akide Mercy completed a quick
counter-attack with a fierce shot.
</P>
<P>
The Danish team fought hard in the second half, put much pressure
on Nigerian defence. But their scoring ability turned them down.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian team, which needed only a draw to secure a berth in
the quarterfinals, added one goal at the 80th minute when Nkiru
Okosieme took advantage of Danish defender's blunder and beat the
Danish goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
The win put Nigeria on the second place with 6 points. The
United States have already qualified for the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Now Nigeria pinned their qualifying hopes on the host team the
United States. If the American team beat or draw the DPR Korean team
in their last group match later on Sunday, then Nigeria will qualify.
</P>
<P>
If the DPR Korea upset the American at Boston, then they will
have six points, the same as the Nigerian team. The DPR Korean team
lost to Nigeria 2-1 and beat Denmark 3-1 in their previous group
matches.
