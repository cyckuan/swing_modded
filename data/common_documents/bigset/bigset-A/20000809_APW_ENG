<HEADLINE> Drug Smuggler Sentenced in Chicago  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who recruited women to smuggle infant
formula cans filled with cocaine was sentenced to more than six
years in prison Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Holmes, 27, pleaded guilty and admitted his role in the
scheme to bring the cans from Panama without inspection. He would
hold the babies for the women as they entered to lend a touch of
realism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crime itself is a horrendous crime considering the
methodology used,'' U.S. District Judge James Holderman said in
imposing a sentence of six years and three months.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also pleaded guilty to recruiting four young women to go
to Jamaica, swallow large capsules containing drugs and bring them
to Chicago. The capsules would have to pass through their systems
before the drugs were used.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes was stopped at O'Hare in 1998 after making such a trip
himself and taken to a hospital for stomach X-rays. At the
hospital, he overpowered an official and ran off but was later
recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested as part of an investigation that has led to
charges against 13 people.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Gives CNN Interview  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, on Tuesday dismissed the idea that
anti-Semitism could damage Al Gore's chances of winning the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't kid myself. I'm sure there are some anti-Semites out
there,'' the Connecticut senator said on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
''But you know, ... the American people are so tolerant, they're so
open, I'm just convinced that they're going vote for me or against
me, based, not on my religion, but based on how they judge me as a
person and whether they think I can do this job,''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who appeared on the show with wife Hadassah, said he
would not have made his momentous speech chastising President
Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky affair -- a pronouncement that
earned Lieberman a reputation as an independent moral crusader -- if
he were the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''That statement I made in the Lewinsky matter, as difficult as
it was, was something I simply would not have done if I were vice
president,'' he said. ''Not only do you have a loyalty to the
president, but you have a constitutional responsibility as the
successor to the president not to separate from him publicly or
create unprecedented problems in terms of the stability of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Jew ever picked to join a major party's
ticket, described his faith, saying he maintains a kosher diet at
home and keeps the Sabbath -- the traditional Jewish day of rest
from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But he sought to reassure voters that his observance would not
interfere with his duties as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt that -- and the rabbis have encouraged me in
this and Jewish tradition does -- when you have a responsibility to
people that can protect or advance their well-being or their lives,
then you've got to do it (work),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he voted on the resolution declaring the Gulf War
on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have ''not a moment's hesitation to be there
(work), not just in a national emergency, but whenever I am needed
to serve the interests of the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would be predisposed to favoring Israel in
negotiations with Arab states, he said his ''first and primary
loyalty is, of course, to the United States of America'' and added
that, as a Senator, he has had ''close relations'' with many Arab
leaders, including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea that he was chosen to bring morality to the
ticket, Lieberman said, ''I know this man (Gore) as a person of
extraordinary values and vision, committed to his family and his
faith and if I can help the American people see that side of him,
which is genuine, then I'll feel very proud about the role I play
in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if he has differences with Gore, they would discuss
them behind closed doors but that he would stand behind him
publicly. Not doing so, he said, could create a constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On the Lewinsky affair, Lieberman called the day that he gave
the speech on the floor of the Senate, Sept. 3, 1998, ''maybe the
hardest day that I've had as a United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was heartbroken. I was disappointed and I was angry,'' he
said, ''and I personally felt that it was never going to get better
unless somebody who was a friend and supporter of the president's
spoke out.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Raises Money at Va. Estate  </HEADLINE>
By DEB REICHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- After a long day inspecting
wildfires in Idaho, President Clinton changed from his khakis and
cowboy boots into a spiffy suit Tuesday night and hopped aboard a
helicopter bound for a fund-raiser at a posh brick estate in
Virginia horse country.
</P>
<P>
   While Vice President Al Gore spent the day in Nashville, Tenn.,
introducing his running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., to the
nation, Clinton spent the night feasting on roast lamb, beef
Beaujolais soup and peach cobbler with about 40 supporters who were
each asked to contribute a minimum of $5,000 to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained his party's fund-raising workhorse. The
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser hosted by wealthy
socialite Patricia Kluge was expected to raise $500,000 to support
the party's candidates, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave his standard pro-Gore speech, that there are stark
differences between the two presidential candidates on tax policy,
what they would do with a federal surplus and on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Republicans had ''presented themselves in a
very appealing way'' at their national convention in Philadelphia
last week, but later said ''there's a reason why they didn't tell
you details.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that I'm concerned about this year,'' Clinton
said, ''is whether or not the very success that we've worked so
hard to affect will put people in such a good humor that people
will be under the illusion that things are going along so well,
nobody could mess it up if they tried and that there aren't any
consequences to this election.''
</P>
<P>
   He lauded Gore, saying that ''no serious student of the
presidency, whether they agree with my policies or not, would
seriously dispute this -- there has never been a vice president who
did so much good as vice president and had this much
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest list included Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va.; gay and
lesbian activists; state Sen. Emily Couric, sister of television
personality Katie Couric; and friends of Kluge.
</P>
<P>
   Kluge is the ex-wife of billionaire John Kluge who, with an
estimated fortune of more than $5 billion, was ranked America's
richest man by Forbes magazine in 1989. When they divorced, the two
divided a 10,000-acre estate southeast of Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   The Kluges contributed heavily to the campaign of former
Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, giving his Democratic campaign two
$100,000 checks and then raising $500,000 more at a get-together at
the estate. Later, Wilder was criticized for using a state
helicopter to take personal trips with Patricia Kluge, who once
posed nude for a men's magazine. Wilder appointed Kluge, a high
school dropout, to the University of Virginia Board of Visitors.

Lebanese Forces Move Into Former Israeli Zone

   KFAR TIBNIT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese security forces moved into the former
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon early Wednesday, restoring a semblance
of state authority for the first time in 24 years to a region torn by conflict.
Before dawn, a force of soldiers and police officers headed down the coastal
highway from the capital, Beirut, in central Lebanon to the south and the border
areas Israel vacated in May. The first units were led by a military police
vehicle followed by four armored vehicles carried on two trailer trucks.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to Afghan
authorities on Tuesday to track down the gunmen who ambushed and killed seven
relief workers last week. The seven Afghans, who worked for the U.N.-supported
mine clearing program, were among 12 people shot and killed Saturday in western
Herat province. The Taliban religious militia that controls 90 percent of
Afghanistan and the opposition accused one another of carrying out the attack.
In a statement read by deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Annan said he
was ''shocked at the depth of the violence of this unwarranted attack on
humanitarian personnel that included the torching of the two vehicles being used
by the victims.''

Tuesday from the final run-offs in Haiti's drawn-out elections, confirming that
the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide won dominant control of the
legislature. The results came from run-off elections held July 30 for 10
lower-house seats in districts where balloting had been delayed. Aristide's
Lavalas Family party won five of the seats, according to the election council.
Opposition candidates took four while the determination of the final seat was

<HEADLINE> Alberto Weakens to Tropical Storm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The first hurricane of the Atlantic season weakened
Tuesday and was downgraded to a tropical storm as it headed on a
northward trek far out at sea.
</P>
<P>
   However, forecasters said they expected Tropical Storm Alberto
to return to hurricane strength in a day or two and it could become
a threat to Bermuda over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a not very favorable environment for the next
day or so, so (Alberto) might weaken a little more,'' hurricane
specialist James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center in Miami
said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto was about 1,360 miles southeast of Bermuda at 10 p.m.,
heading northwest at near 14 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto's top sustained winds dropped to 70 mph Tuesday night,
down from 85 mph Monday. The threshold for a hurricane is 74 mph.
The storm became a hurricane last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that Alberto will move generally northwestward over
the next two to three days, though we think there may be some
wobbles back to the west,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the people that should be most concerned would be the
people in Bermuda, because in three days Alberto might be in their
general vicinity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kans. Ed Board Member Begins Work  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A State Board of Education member started
his new job Tuesday with a promise to work to replace science
testing standards that de-emphasize evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that evolution should be included in the science
standards because it is the consensus of the worldwide scientific
community,'' Bruce Wyatt said during a break in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves on Monday appointed Wyatt, an attorney, to
complete the term of conservative Scott Hill, who resigned after
moving to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt, a moderate, won the Republican nomination for a full
four-year term in last week's primary by beating conservative Brad
Angell.
</P>
<P>
   He faces Democrat Eloise Lynch in the Nov. 7 general election,
when five board members will be elected.
</P>
<P>
   With the defeat of three conservative GOP candidates in the
primary, the board's majority is likely to be made up of moderate
Republicans or Democrats who have vowed to overturn the new
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The board approved the science standards a year ago on a 6-4
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt said he expects the board to reconsider the standards when
new members take office in January.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of evolution, developed by Charles Darwin and others,
holds that the Earth is billions of years old and that life forms
developed over hundreds of millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Among those disputing the theory are creationists, who maintain
that evolution cannot be proven and that the Earth and most life
forms came into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago, largely
as described in the Bible.

<HEADLINE> Discord Shadows Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Two days before its nominating
convention, the Reform Party split loudly Tuesday as supporters of
founder Ross Perot walked out of a closed meeting, leaving backers
of Pat Buchanan inside and the party's future in question.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have won,'' declared Buchanan's sister and campaign
manager, Bay, who saw the walkout as a defeat for opponents of the
Buchanan camp. ''It's Pat Buchanan's nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But the disputes had only just begun. Though the meeting they
left was chaired by a man who controls the party's finances,
leaders of the Perot faction said they would be presiding over the
real National Committee meeting at a hotel a block away. They are
considering a lawsuit against the Buchanan faction aimed in part at
blocking the conservative commentator from the party's $12.5
million in federal campaign funds if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime party members said the split also means two sets of
delegates could be facing off at the nominating convention that
opens here on Thursday. It was unclear which faction, if any, wins
the standoff and the millions of dollars in taxpayer funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan group said it had resolved one lingering question
by rejecting a charge by the Perot faction that Buchanan should be
disqualified from the party primary. But the Perot group
simultaneously took the opposite action, disqualifying Buchanan on
the charge that he had broken party rules in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   More disputes were expected on Wednesday as both groups attempt
to credential separate delegates to the convention that starts
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospect of the Perot group establishing its own
convention, chairman Gerry Moan replied, ''Yay for them. It's not
gonna be recognized by the'' Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The shouting and shoving that accompanied Tuesday's events
underscored the intensity of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is illegal!'' shouted Perot supporter Jim Mangia, the
party's national secretary, who objected to the meeting being
closed in contrast to Reform Party tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia and Perot aide Russell Verney, communicating over
walkie-talkies, led a walkout of about half those inside the
meeting, guiding them down the street to another hotel where they
planned their own proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan dismissed the uproar as sour grapes from the old guard
as its grip on the party weakens. The Buchanan campaign has amassed
a formidable majority of delegates to this week's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a last desperate effort on the part of the Perot
(supporters) to somehow hang on to the power in this party,'' she
said. ''They have lost. It is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Moan had closed the meeting, with the Buchanans' blessing, to
avoid distractions.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mangia conducted an additional meeting outside in an
adjoining parlor, a Buchanan supporter named Johnnie Jackson
shouted profanities.
</P>
<P>
   And when private guards tried to keep Verney out of the closed
meeting, Verney told them, ''You're going to have to arrest me, I
am going in.'' Shouting ensued, with Buchanan supporters drowning
out the others by chanting ''Go Pat Go!''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mangia and Verney led the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the tone as delegates began streaming into this
oceanside town for the four-day presidential nominating convention,
the party's third since Perot founded it eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, meanwhile, was staying away and silent. Convention
organizer Judy Duffy invited him by letter, but got no response.
</P>
<P>
   Threats flew in all directions. If the national committee
disqualifies Buchanan or if little-known challenger John Hagelin
wins the party primary, Buchanan's delegates might nominate him
anyway. If that happened, Perot's supporters could seek an
injunction to prevent Buchanan from receiving $12.5 million in
federal matching fees.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan says he is saving the party, rather than tearing it
apart. He has toured the country lining up convention delegates,
ousting hostile state party leaders and installing new chapters.
But his presence in the party and his outspokenness on social
issues have offended some party members, particularly leaders loyal
to Perot.

<HEADLINE> Former Newsweek publisher dies at 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Gibson McCabe, publisher and president of
Newsweek for almost 25 years, has died of a heart attack. He was
89.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, who lived in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., died at a hospital
in nearby Jacksonville Beach on Aug. 5, The Washington Post
reported in an obituary Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe worked in the circulation departments of The New York
Times and Young America magazine before joining the weekly news
magazine in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He held the titles of general manager, vice president and
director before becoming publisher in 1958 and president in 1959.
During his tenure, Newsweek was acquired by The Washington Post Co.
He retired in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe was known as ''Short-Copy'' McCabe due to his direct
demeanor, and remained a Newsweek consultant after his retirement.
He was primarily on the business side of publications, though
fiercely protected the editorial side when Newsweek stories
offended advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe oversaw huge circulation and monetary growth of Newsweek,
and in 1971 was named publisher of the year by the Magazine
Publishers of America. He was also awarded the Henry Johnson Fisher
Award, the industry's highest prize.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, he grew up in Boston and Baltimore, where his
father was a newspaper editor at the old Baltimore News. He
graduated from the Tome School in Port Deposit, Md., and Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after joining Newsweek, McCabe served in World War II in
the Navy. After leaving the service, he scooped other newsmagazines
in reporting the German surrender.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe's marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Fife ended in
divorce, and he was widowed by his second wife, the former Lydia
Knight Bassett, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include two daughters from his first marriage, six
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Texas Set for Double Execution  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- The nation's busiest death chamber was
set for a double execution Wednesday evening, including an inmate
opponents say is retarded and should not be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver David Cruz, 33, was condemned for the 1988 abduction,
rape and fatal stabbing of a 24-year-old woman stationed at Kelly
Air Force Base in San Antonio. His IQ tested as low as 63.
</P>
<P>
   The other inmate is Brian Keith Roberson, 36, condemned for the
1986 stabbing deaths of an elderly couple who lived across the
street from him in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back lethal injections -- Roberson first, then Cruz
about an hour later -- would be the first multiple executions in
Texas since June 1997 and mark only the third time since capital
punishment resumed in the state in 1982 that more than one inmate
was executed in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The execution dates are set by district judges at the local
level,'' said Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney
General's office. ''The fact that two executions are set on the
same date is just coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The double execution is a far cry from Feb. 8, 1924, when Texas
prison officials, taking over execution duties from the counties
for the first time, inaugurated the electric chair in Huntsville by
putting five inmates to death.
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid to the two inmates have paled in comparison
to the hoopla that drew the hundreds of protesters and media to
Huntsville in June for the lethal injection of Gary Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's claims of innocence and an unfair trial spotlighted
Texas as the nation's execution capital and support of the death
penalty by Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole, in twin 18-0 votes
earlier this week, refused to recommend to Bush that he halt
Wednesday's executions, the 27th and 28th in Texas this year. They
were the first of six scheduled this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not ready to die,'' Cruz said in an interview last week.
''That's what scares me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior airman who worked as a linguist at Kelly Air Base,
Kelly Donovan, 24, was taking a walk the night of Aug. 7, 1988,
when she was abducted by Cruz and Jerry Kemplin, who were driving
home after a drinking party. She was raped by Cruz, who then
stabbed her to death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a mistake. I don't blame nobody. I take full
responsibility,'' Cruz said. ''There's nothing I could do or say to
bring the person back. There's nothing I could do or say to her
family about how sorry I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz blamed the attack on drug use that began for him at age 13.
He said he and Kemplin, who testified against him in exchange for a
65-year prison term, had taken LSD and drank ''a couple of bottles
of liquor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She was just someone,'' he said of Donovan. ''I don't expect
nobody to have pity on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's attorney, Jeff Pokorak, argued that a jury was not given
enough information about his client's lifelong mental impairment.
An IQ under 70 is considered at least mildly retarded, but
prosecutors noted that Cruz had scored above 70 before.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 25 states that allow the execution of retarded
killers, some are considering laws prohibiting the practice. The
Texas Legislature, which killed a bill last session outlawing the
execution of someone whose IQ is below 65, will revisit the issue
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dallas case, Roberson fatally stabbed James Boots, 79,
and Boots' wife, Lillian, 75, during a home robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't in a solid frame of mind,'' he said, blaming the
attack on his use of PCP and liquor. ''I was just juiced up.''

<HEADLINE> Even Walesa Can't Escape Poland Law  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Few freedom fighters can claim better
credentials than Lech Walesa, the Solidarity founder who battled
Polish communism relentlessly for 20 years before seeing it
vanquished in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Walesa, still an ardent communist-basher, is now in a Warsaw
court fighting suggestions that he spied on fellow dissidents for
the old secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody believes it's true, but the spectacle has shocked
Poles. Not only is a national hero's reputation on trial, but also
Solidarity's often awkward crusade to settle scores with its old
communist tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa's predicament is the result of a new law requiring top
officials to declare past links to the secret police. A screening
court must vet their statements. There is no penalty for admitting
collaboration, but anyone caught lying is barred from office for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 law, which so far has cost at least two legislators
their jobs, is being applied to presidential candidates for the
first time. Walesa is among about 15 planning to run in the Oct. 8
election.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone before the screening court. President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, a widely popular ex-communist who defeated Walesa for
the presidency in 1995, is fighting similar allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Each man has a third, and possibly final, hearing this week --
Kwasniewski on Wednesday, and Walesa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations stem from old secret police documents -- some are
mere photocopies -- forwarded to the court by the Interior Ministry.
Walesa and Kwasniewski vehemently deny implications they worked as
agents. Each side accuses the other of abusing the law for campaign
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The screening court's rulings could have implications far beyond
personal reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we choose not to believe Walesa, but to trust former
security officers, it means we have embarked on a wrong path,''
said Krzysztof Kozlowski, who was interior minister in 1990. ''It
is the posthumous revenge of the communist security services.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of these dirty political games, Poland is being
humbled and humiliated in the eyes of the world,'' fumed Adam
Michnik, a former Solidarity activist and Poland's most prominent
newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   Even Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose Solidarity-led government
wrote the rules, calls it ''a dismal joke of history,'' but insists
the law must be followed.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa, 59, may have been asking for trouble. His popularity has
waned, and pollsters say he is no challenge for the telegenic
Kwasniewski, who at 45 is Poland's most popular politician.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa says he is confident he won't be shamed on the basis of
what he maintains are phony documents, perhaps written by communist
agents seeking to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always been and still am for the screening,'' he said.
''The point is in separating truth from lies. ... This is why I
humbly submit myself to the screening procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   While Poland is the darling of the old Soviet bloc when it comes
to economic reforms, this country of 39 million has trailed most of
the pack in ''de-communization.'' Most other post-communist
governments confronted the task much earlier and have worked out
the worst kinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs approved a screening law in 1990 -- and there was
never a suggestion that the leader of the country's anti-communist
Velvet Revolution, Vaclav Havel, be vetted in order to become
president.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Germany set up a special agency to discreetly
open old East German secret police files. Some political careers
were ruined and there were accusations of witch-hunting, but the
process has been regarded largely as fair and necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's screening law, passed in 1994, has embarrassed a few
politicians. But no officials have lost their jobs, and cases for
the most part are handled confidentially and discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   Poland has had a tougher time. Many trace the difficulties to
1992 when Walesa, then Poland's president, appeared on a supposedly
confidential list of alleged collaborators. It was compiled by
Interior Minister Antoni Macierewicz, a right-wing political enemy
of Walesa, and leaked to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-communists won parliamentary elections before the list could
be investigated, and efforts to deal with past communist crimes
were grounded until Solidarity regained control in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Solidarity's near obsession with catching up, it has
lacked the clout in parliament to accomplish much. Moreover, the
country seems to be losing its taste for anti-communist crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Last year legislators rejected a Solidarity bill that would have
banned all former communist officials from public office for 10
years. Even Walesa said that was going too far.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to allow Poles to see secret-police files on them bogged
down repeatedly in political wrangling over who should oversee the
process. People probably won't start seeing any files before next
year -- 12 years after the collapse of the old regime.

<HEADLINE> Four States Hold Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By JOE STANGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Voters cleared the way on Tuesday for a
fierce fall contest for Senate, nominating retiring Democratic Gov.
Mel Carnahan and first-term Republican Sen. John Ashcroft as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan and Ashcroft easily defeated little-known challengers
in their primaries. Term limits, which forced Carnahan to retire
after two terms, created an open race for Missouri governor.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a Michigan Senate race drew no primary opposition,
while Colorado and Georgia also held primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign between Ashcroft and Carnahan already has sparked
allegations of racism pegged to a 40-year-old photo of Carnahan in
blackface, and a battle over capital punishment after Carnahan
commuted a death sentence at the request of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   In other Missouri primary races, sons of two retiring members of
Congress ran in an attempt to succeed their parents, drawing
accusations they were trading on their family names. While each
candidate emphasized his record in office, some acknowledged their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that I inherit his friends as well as his enemies,''
William Clay Jr. said about his father, Missouri's first black
member of Congress, who is retiring after 32 years. ''Seeing as how
he's been elected 16 times, I think he's got more friends than
enemies in this congressional district.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay easily won the Democratic nomination to replace his father:
With 77 percent of precincts reporting, Clay received 57 percent of
the vote and county councilman Charlie Dooley 31 percent. The
winner is favored in the fall in this heavily Democratic district.
</P>
<P>
   ''We picked a new Democratic nominee for Congress, but his name
is still Clay,'' the 17-year state legislator said in declaring
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In another Missouri district, former state Sen. Steve Danner won
the Democratic nomination for the seat held by his mother, Rep. Pat
Danner, with 52 percent of the vote. His mother is retiring after
four terms. Danner faces a GOP opponent in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Missouri, freshman state Rep. Matt Blunt won a three-way
race for the GOP nomination for secretary of state, the office his
father, Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., held from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, freshman Republican Sen. Spence Abraham and
Democratic Rep. Debbie Stabenow moved ahead to their fall contest
without primary challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Four-term Rep. Jim Talent easily defeated two little-known
challengers for the GOP nomination for governor. Democratic state
Treasurer Bob Holden was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, lawyer Carolyn Cox won the GOP nomination to
challenge first-term Democratic Rep. Mark Udall. In Georgia,
millionaire businessman Roger Kahn won the Democratic nomination to
challenge GOP Clinton critic Bob Barr for his House seat.
</P>
<P>
   In Boulder County, Colo., the retirement of District Attorney
Alex Hunter, who was criticized for his handling of the JonBenet
Ramsey case, set off a three-way Democratic contest. His chief
deputy, Mary Keenan, won the nomination with 59 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Missouri, a husband and wife hoping to oppose each other
for an open state House seat were both soundly defeated. Republican
Jerry Riley and Democrat Jennifer Graham came under fire allegedly
sharing campaign donations.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Leader Angers Washington  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez professed his
friendship with Fidel Castro. The Clinton administration said
nothing. He refused to allow an American military team in last
winter to provide flood relief, and more recently rejected
President Clinton's personal plea to lower oil prices. Again, no
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Chavez has overseen a series of elections
since taking office 18 months ago that have won praise from
international observers for being free and fair. And, given the
administration emphasis on aboveboard election processes in the
hemisphere, officials have been willing to overlook the negative
aspects of Chavez's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the administration sees it, Chavez has stepped over the
line with his decision to go to Baghdad on Thursday to see Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. The visit will be the first by a foreign
head of government since United Nations sanctions were imposed
against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Tuesday it is ''particularly galling''
that the first such visit is being made by a leader who is
democratically elected. For Chavez, it said, this is a ''dubious
distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting last month on his prospective visit, Chavez said he
knew that some would be offended by the visit, and he seemed to
relish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine what the pharisees will say when they see me with
Saddam Hussein,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Latell, a former Latin Ameircan specialist at the CIA,
said the Baghdad visit by Chavez is ''a reflection perhaps of a
profound antipathy'' toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Says Otto Reich, a former ambassador to Venezuela, ''Chavez
risks diminishing Venezuela's good image by aligning himself with
rogue leaders like Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is on a tour of Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. His visit to Iraq is being preceded by stops in Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and Iran. And, bowing to a U.N. Security Council ban
on air travel to and from Iraq, Chavez plans to drive across the
Iranian border with Iraq and then head for Baghdad on Thursday,
Venezuelan officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the Baghdad visit, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose
Vicente Rangel said Tuesday Chavez is intent on strengthening the
oil cartel. He noted that Chavez, during his travels, will extend
invitations to OPEC leaders for a summit meeting next month in
Venezuela and must invite all OPEC heads of state, including
Iraq's. Venezuela, he said, ''can't discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Chavez's affection for Castro and his
disdain for the United States have been obvious. Last November,
Chavez said during a trip to Cuba that Venezuela is marching
''toward the same sea as the Cuban people ... a sea of happiness,
true social justice and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez ran afoul of the United States in 1992 when, as an Army
officer, he staged an abortive coup attempt against an elected
government.
</P>
<P>
   The United States revoked his visa afterward, and he saw this as
a source of pride. ''They honor us as rebel soldiers in not
allowing us to enter North American (U.S.) territory,'' he said in
1994. After his election in December 1998, Chavez's visa was
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has made it clear he doesn't want U.S. military personnel
operating anywhere near Venezuela. He has flatly ruled out U.S.
counternarcotics surveillance flights over Venezuela and even
objects to such flights operating from Dutch islands off
Venezuela's coast. Rangel, the foreign minister, says these islands
are in ''a security zone for Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez irritated the Pentagon last January by reversing a
Venezuelan Defense Ministry decision to allow 450 Marine and Navy
engineers to go Venezuela to work on a flood relief project. Chavez
said the American military presence would have violated Venezuelan
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   His pro-Cuban, anti-American stance may have alienated some
Venezuelans but certainly not the majority. Following a
constitutional revision that required a new election, Chavez won a
six-year term in elections on July 30th, running on a platform that
featured attacks on the elite and promises of support for the
country's majority poor population.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Czar Expects Change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The U.S. drug czar says he is confident the
next administration would change the way drug fighting efforts are
measured in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. anti-drug certification program ''will probably get
modified in the next administration,'' Barry McCaffrey said Tuesday
on a visit with officials of Mexico's incoming and outgoing
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the certification program will be supplanted by a
measurement of the drug-fighting efforts of all countries in the
Americas -- including the United States -- to be conducted by the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department annually evaluates the drug fighting
performance of other countries according to a congressional
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, economic sanctions could be imposed if Mexico's
performance is deemed inadequate. But officials acknowledge that
the possibility of a ''decertification'' is unrealistic even though
critics in Congress argue that Mexico isn't doing enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico and other countries resent the process, saying it is
unfair for the United States alone to decide.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that while Mexico has to do more to stop cocaine
and heroin entering the United States, the United States gets
''about a C minus'' grade on stopping guns and drug money entering
Mexico from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he was confident Mexico's newly elected
government of Vicente Fox would continue the battle. He said the
United States already has shared some classified drug intelligence
documents with Fox's transition team, which he called
''pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're looking for creative new solutions,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Colombia, where McCaffrey will accompany President
Clinton on an Aug. 20 visit, faces a huge challenge with ''a peace
process that is going nowhere, and a drug production problem that's
skyrocketing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said leftist rebels there ''are trying to roll up Colombian
police presence, and they're doing pretty good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCaffrey praised increased cooperation in the region
that has forced some traffickers to carry their drugs as far as 800
miles out into the eastern Pacific, in order to reach the Mexican
or U.S. coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's very difficult to get into Mexico, they will go to
Haiti, and that's already happening,'' McCaffrey said.

<HEADLINE> Delays Plague New Defense Plans  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's experimental missile defense,
already beset by high-profile test failures, must now deal with
longer delays from the contractor building new rocket boosters. The
setbacks could jeopardize the missile's readiness by the target
date of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday that Defense
Secretary William Cohen is not ready to abandon the 2005 goal, but
he conceded that delays in technical aspects of the project are
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always admitted that this was a high-risk program and
part of being high risk is the deployment date; whether we can meet
the deployment date of 2005,'' Bacon told reporters. ''We will try
our best.''
</P>
<P>
   What has become apparent, one month after a highly publicized
failure to shoot down a mock warhead in space, is that the
Pentagon's lead contractor on national missile defense, Boeing Co.,
is facing even longer delays than previously acknowledged in
building a booster for the new missile interceptor.
</P>
<P>
   The new rocket booster is designed to carry into space, then
release, a self-guiding ''kill vehicle'' that would maneuver in the
path of an incoming warhead and destroy it by force of impact.
</P>
<P>
   The new rocket would replace the old-generation rocket booster
used in an embarrassingly failed anti-missile flight test last
month. A 10-year-old electronic component failed to send a signal
to release the ''kill vehicle'' from atop the rocket, and the
''kill vehicle'' never attempted to intercept its target. The $100
million test was a washout.
</P>
<P>
   The new rocket poses one of several technical problems Cohen is
weighing as he considers whether to recommend to President Clinton
that he take initial steps toward deploying a national missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Monday he is postponing his recommendation for
several weeks, and Bacon said it probably would be made in early
September.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether 2005 was now an unrealistic target, Bacon said
Tuesday: ''That's exactly the type of question the secretary is
considering now.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains possible that even if Cohen were to decide to move
back the 2005 target by a year or two, he could recommend that
Clinton begin the first deployment steps now in order to ease the
overall schedule crunch. The first step would be awarding contracts
for construction of a new X-band radar on a remote island in the
Aleutians off Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The new rocket had been eight months behind in development, and
Bacon disclosed Tuesday that it is running an additional several
months late. He said department officials are still calculating an
exact timetable. It originally was to make its first solo flight --
without the ''kill vehicle'' aboard -- last April; then it was
delayed until November 2000, and Bacon said a further delay until
spring 2001 was now likely.
</P>
<P>
   The new booster's first flight in conjunction with testing the
overall missile defense system is officially scheduled for sometime
in the first three months of 2001, although it probably will not be
ready for at least another three months beyond that, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gap is getting longer,'' Bacon said, referring to schedule
delays for the new rocket booster. ''It has slipped. The question
is: Has it slipped by so much that it changes the schedule of the
program. That question has not been answered.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of delays in developing the rocket booster was
suggested in a June report to Cohen by a group of independent
advisers who reviewed technical progress in the missile defense
program. Their report said the Pentagon faced ''stressing
challenges'' to demonstrate in time for a 2005 deployment that the
rocket booster -- technically called a ground-based interceptor --
would perform reliably.

<HEADLINE> Giants 1, Brewers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Russ Ortiz pitched seven shutout innings
and drove in the game's only run as the San Francisco Giants beat
the Milwaukee Brewers 1-0 Tuesday night
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz (7-10) repeated the feat of teammates Shawn Estes and
Livan Hernandez, who each drove in runs the previous two days, by
singling in the fifth to score J.T. Snow, who walked to start the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers' left fielder Geoff Jenkins dove forward in an attempt
to snare Ortiz's hit, but the ball glanced off the top of his
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez and Robb Nen each pitched a scoreless inning of
relief to preserve the shutout. Nen recorded his 28th save in 33
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz retired the first 12 batters he faced, giving up a leadoff
double to Richie Sexson in the fifth. He allowed one other hit -- a
single by Milwaukee pitcher Jamey Wright in the sixth. He struck
out six and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who does not have a shutout in 68 career starts, won his
third straight at home after beginning the season 0-4 in eight
starts at Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Wright (6-5) was nearly as effective. He gave up four hits and
four walks in seven innings and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a one-out single to Bill Mueller in the first,
Wright retired 10 in a row before walking Snow. Three of his walks
came in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who lost his third straight road game, avoided further
damage in the seventh with two defensive plays. He fielded two
difficult comebackers, by Felipe Crespo and Marvin Benard, and
threw them out at first with two runners on.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers did not get a runner past second against Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brewers manager Davey Lopes missed the game with the flu.
Bench coach Jerry Royster ran the team. ... Giants RHP John
Johnstone threw 70 pitches on the side before the game, but there's
still no timetable for his return. ... The Brewers signed Matthew
Yeatman, their 13th-round selection in June's draft. ... Giants RHP
Joe Nathan threw five innings in a rehab assignment for Triple-A
Fresno on Tuesday in Tacoma. He allowed two runs on five hits with
three walks and five strikeouts.

and the Montreal Expos cruised to a 9-3 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome allowed San Francisco, which beat Milwaukee 1-0, to
widen its lead over the Diamondbacks in the NL West to a
season-high two games.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens also homered off Arizona starter Brian Anderson, who
lasted just 4 1-3 innings in his shortest outing since June 17.
Anderson (9-5), allowed seven hits and six runs, walking three
while striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit a two-run shot in the third inning and another --
his 28th -- in the fifth, giving him 90 RBIs. He also tripled in a
spectacular, 3-for-5 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stinnett, Greg Colbrunn and Danny Bautista had RBI singles
for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal starter Scott Downs, who sprained his left elbow in the
course of throwing 65 pitches, gave up three runs and five hits in
three-plus innings in his first appearance for the Expos since they
acquired him from the Chicago Cubs on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The team said the elbow was X-rayed and would be re-evaluated on
Friday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Lira (3-1) came in with the bases loaded in the fourth
and gave up Bautista's tying RBI single. Then he got Anderson to
hit back to the mound for a throw to home plate, forcing Colbrunn,
and Tony Womack to hit into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched three scoreless innings before handing over an 8-3
lead to Steve Kline in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took a 1-0 lead on Stinnett's RBI single in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Jose Vidro singled with one out in the third, and, after
Geoff Blum flied out, Guerrero pulled a pitch into the Diamondbacks
bullpen. Two pitches later, Stevens hit an opposite-field homer
into the left field grandstand for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona tied it in the fourth, Blum hit an RBI single
before Guerrero crushed another pitch by Anderson 422 feet onto a
picnic pavilion above the wall in right center.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens hit a sacrifice fly after Guerrero's leadoff triple off
Russ Springer in the seventh, and pinch-hitter Andy Tracy made it
8-3 with a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was Guerrero's fourth multihomer game this season and
eighth of his career. ... Arizona C Damian Miller was scratched
just before game time because of a left ankle sprain. ... Downs had
his fifth no-decision in his last eight starts. ... Anderson
dropped to 1-3 in his last eight starts.

<HEADLINE> Angels 2, Red Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie Ramon Ortiz pitched a two-hitter
to outduel Pedro Martinez, and Tim Salmon homered Tuesday night as
the Anaheim Angels beat the Boston Red Sox 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the second in a row for the Angels following a
season-long five-game losing streak, while the Red Sox lost their
fourth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (13-4) pitched his sixth complete game, allowing only
three hits while walking none and striking out nine.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortiz (4-2), who walked two and struck out six in pitching
his first career complete game, was just a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, entered with a 9-0 road record and 1.21 ERA in 11
starts as well as a big league-leading 1.42 ERA, and had won his
previous four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, a 24-year-old right-hander, was recalled from the minors
to make his first start since July 7 and eighth of the season. He
has often said that Martinez, a fellow Dominican, is his idol.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers were consistently clocked in the mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit a 2-0 pitch from Martinez over the left-center field
fence for his 25th homer to start the second, extending his hitting
streak to a career-high 16 games and giving the Angels a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was Anaheim's only baserunner until the fourth, when
Orlando Palmeiro blooped a leadoff single and scored from second on
a two-out RBI single by Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary doubled to open the fifth for the second Boston
hit, and came around to score on a pair of infield outs to cut
Anaheim's lead to complete the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek walked with two outs in the sixth before Ortiz
fanned Nomar Garciaparra, the majors' leading hitter, to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary reached second when center fielder Anderson dropped his
fly ball with one out in the seventh, but Ortiz retired the next
two batters including Ed Sprague on an inning-ending strikeout.
Ortiz finished by retiring his last eight batters.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez retired the final 13 Anaheim batters after Anderson's
fourth-inning single, a grounder up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra went 0-for-4 to drop his batting average to a major
league-leading .386.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game lasted just 2 hours, 2 minutes. Ortiz and Martinez
each threw 112 pitches. ... The Angels promoted first
baseman-outfielder Chris Hatcher, 31, from Triple-A Edmonton of the
PCL. Hatcher, acquired from the Chicago Cubs' organization July 28,
had 26 homers and 77 RBIs in 95 games at Edmonton and Triple-A Iowa
combined this year. ... Salmon has seven homers and 19 RBIs in his
last 18 games. ... Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant and his
fiancee, Vanessa Laine, attended the game and received a warm
reception from the crowd when shown on the Jumbotron. ... Anaheim
right-hander Matt Wise will make his first big-league start
Wednesday night against the Red Sox, becoming the 12th Angels'
pitcher to start a game this season. ... Anaheim left-hander Kent
Mercker, who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while pitching against
Texas on May 11, is scheduled to make his return Saturday against
the New York Yankees.

Delays Plague New Missile Defense Plans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's experimental missile defense, already beset
by high-profile test failures, must now deal with longer delays from the
contractor building new rocket boosters. The setbacks could jeopardize the
missile's readiness by the target date of 2005. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said Tuesday that Defense Secretary William Cohen is not ready to abandon the
2005 goal, but he conceded that delays in technical aspects of the project are
growing. The new rocket booster is designed to carry into space, then release, a
self-guiding ''kill vehicle'' that would maneuver in the path of an incoming
warhead and destroy it by force of impact.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to Afghan
authorities on Tuesday to track down the gunmen who ambushed and killed seven
relief workers last week. The seven Afghans, who worked for the U.N.-supported
mine clearing program, were among 12 people shot and killed Saturday in western
Herat province. The Taliban religious militia that controls 90 percent of
Afghanistan and the opposition accused one another of carrying out the attack.
In a statement read by deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Annan said he
was ''shocked at the depth of the violence of this unwarranted attack on
humanitarian personnel that included the torching of the two vehicles being used
by the victims.''

<HEADLINE> F-16 Crashes in Nevada Desert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- An F-16 jet crashed in the Nevada desert
Tuesday after apparently clipping another jet during a training
exercise, military officials said. The lone pilot ejected safely
and the other plane landed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed about 5 p.m. some 70 miles north of Nellis Air
Force Base, base spokesman Lt. Allan Herritage said. Another F-16
landed a short time later with minor damage, leading investigators
to speculate the planes struck each other in midair, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of damage to the second plane was not released, but
Herritage said the pilot was not hurt. A helicopter crew was
dispatched to rescue the downed pilot, who suffered scrapes and
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second jet crash in a week for the base. An F-15
crashed north of Rachel, Nev., on Thursday while the pilot was
leading seven other planes in a training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot ejected and was not injured. His plane crashed into a
dry lake bed 125 miles north of Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Golf: Hardin Leads Women's Amateur  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Leigh Anne Hardin birdied her final hole
to clinch medalist honors at the U.S. Women's Amateur on Tuesday at
Waverley Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Hardin, of Martinsville, Ind., made a 30-foot on the par-3 9th
hole, giving her an even-par 71 for the day and a two-day total of
2-under 140.
</P>
<P>
   Lorena Ochoa, of Mexico, finished one stroke back after a
second-round 69.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Hannemann of Brazil was third at 142, one stroke ahead of
Young-A Yang of South Korea, Jeanne Cho, of France, Fla., and Marcy
Newton, of High Point, N.C.. First-round leader Angela Stanford, of
Saginaw, Texas, who had a 68 Monday, and Aree Wongluekiet of
Bradenton, Fla., both had 144s.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Belskis, of Columbus, Ohio, had a hole-in-one on the
138-yard 14th hole in her round of 76 and was at 146.
</P>
<P>
   The 144-player field was trimmed to 64 for the start of match
play Wednesday. The final is Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a good way to finish,'' Hardin said of her closing
birdie. ''I wasn't focused on what other people were doing, I just
wanted to play my game. I wanted to hit as many greens as possible,
and I missed three today.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of those came on the back nine, which Hardin played first.
After a bogey on No. 12, Hardin birdied the par-3 14th with a
20-foot downhill putt before three-putting 17 for another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   On Nos. 2 and 3, Hardin missed birdies by inches. She then
bogeyed the par-4 4th, two-putting the small green after narrowly
missing the far bunker on her approach.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-5 5th, Hardin used a 3-wood to hit the back of the
green with her second shot, then two-putted for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Hardin just missed a birdie putt on the par-5 8th before
recording her third birdie of the round on her final hole of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really happy with the way I putted,'' Hardin said. ''I
didn't hit bad, but I had some bad pin placements.''

<HEADLINE> Reports: Braves, Jones Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   One of the biggest names in baseball has reportedly
been taken
off this year's free agent list.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones, last year's NL MVP, has
agreed to a $90 million, six-year deal to remain with the Braves,
Newsday and ESPN.com reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also would hold club options on a seventh and eighth
year that would make the contract worth $120 million in total, ESPN
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who don't return to Atlanta until Friday, declined
comment. Jones denied that an agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my agent's talking to (general manager John
Schuerholz), but I have not agreed to anything,'' Jones said,
following a 5-4 victory Tuesday over the Cincinnati Reds. ''Are we
close? I don't know. It could happen tomorrow, in a few days or
next spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, would be eligible for free agency after the season in
a class that could include Alex Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez, Manny
Ramirez, Mike Mussina and Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million per year average would equal the richest deal in
baseball: Kevin Brown's $105 million, seven-year contract with Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jones went 0-for-5 Tuesday night, extending the longest slump of
his career to 0-for-20. He's batting .303 with 24 home runs and 79
RBI.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 7, Cardinals 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jesus Sanchez threw a six-hitter for his second
career shutout and drove in a run as the Florida Marlins beat the
St. Louis Cardinals 7-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox had two hits and two RBIs as the Marlins beat the
Cardinals for the first time in five games this year. Florida has
won six of seven overall.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez (7-8) allowed five singles and a double, and only three
baserunners reached second base. He struck out seven -- including
two in the ninth -- and walked two to quiet the NL Central leaders,
who scored only two runs in the last 23 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Sanchez had a run-scoring single for his third
RBI of the season off an 0-2 pitch from Jason Christiansen as the
Marlins broke the game open with four runs. Preston Wilson added a
two-run single in the inning to chase Christiansen, who retired one
of the five batters he faced -- on a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez also shut out Baltimore July 18 and threw eight
scoreless innings July 3 in a victory over the New York Mets. He's
been involved in three combined shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox drove in the first two runs with a single in the fourth, and
tripled off Pat Hentgen (10-9) to start the seventh. He's 13-for-26
in his last nine games with five RBIs and eight runs. Mark Kotsay
added a run-scoring single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith hit his fifth homer in the ninth to give the Marlins
a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In six-plus innings, Hentgen gave up four runs on five hits. He
has lost three of four starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: St. Louis catcher Mike Matheny is in a 2-for-30 slump. ...
Wilson struck out twice, raising his major league-high total to
140. ... Henry Rodriguez left after being hit by a pitch on his
right wrist by Jason Christiansen in the seventh. X-rays were not
required. ... In three appearances covering 1 2-3 innings,
Christiansen has allowed five runs on six hits. ... Wilson made a
great running catch in center on Fernando Vina's drive to end the
seventh.

<HEADLINE> Astros 9, Mets 3  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Brian Powell won for the first time in nearly two
years and Richard Hidalgo had a pair of RBI doubles, leading the
Houston Astros to a 9-3 win over the New York Mets on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Powell (1-0) allowed one run and five hits in seven innings to
win for the first time since Aug. 25, 1998, with Detroit against
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He spent last season with Houston's Triple-A New Orleans
affiliate and was called up Aug. 1 to replace injured starter Shane
Reynolds. He got a no-decision in his NL debut last week against
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored three runs in the first inning off Al Leiter
(12-5) to give Powell the early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo reached on shortstop Mike Bordick's throwing error,
leading off the inning, moved to second on Lance Berkman's walk and
scored on Jeff Bagwell's single. Hidalgo added an RBI double and
scored on Chris Truby's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Powell doubled and scored on Berkman's triple in the second
inning to give Houston a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani drove in three runs for the Mets with a solo
homer in the sixth and a two-run single in the ninth. Bordick went
3-for-3 with two doubles for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo added an RBI double in the fifth. Leiter allowed five
runs -- three earned -- and six hits in five innings, his shortest
outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Houston got three more runs in the sixth with help from a
bases-loaded walk and run-scoring wild pitch by Pat Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell, out since June 18 with a strained right shoulder,
allowed Agbayani's hit in the ninth. Reliever Rick White, who
singled in the inning, made the second out when Berkman threw him
out from left field going from first to third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston's Tony Eusebio had two hits to continue his
career-high tying 13-game hitting streak. ... Berkman's second
inning triple was the first of his career. ... Leiter struck out a
season-low one batter. His previous low was three.

   Mazzone, 51, fainted as the inning ended, slid from the bench
and landed on the dugout floor. He suffered a scrape on the left
side of his face and a bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   Players gathered around Mazzone as Dr. Joe Chandler and trainers
talked to him and examined his face after the fainting spell. The
game was delayed briefly before Mazzone got up and walked to the
tunnel that leads to the clubhouse, the left side of his face
bright red.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox said Mazzone had worked out on a treadmill
before the game and felt weak because he hadn't eaten afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he hadn't eaten anything and I said, 'Why don't you go
into the clubhouse and get a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?' The
next thing I turn around and I heard a boom and he's on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Mazzone was back to normal when he reached the
clubhouse, but he was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital as a
precaution. It's the same hospital where Reds bench coach Ken
Griffey Sr. was taken last Sunday, when he suffered chest pains
during a game.
</P>
<P>
   Tests found nothing wrong with Griffey's heart and he was
released the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago, Reds pitching coach Don Gullett suffered chest
pains during a game in New York and was taken to a hospital for
tests that found nothing wrong with his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett rejoined the Reds on Monday for the start of a
three-game series against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Andy Ashby was getting a drink of water in the
dugout when Mazzone fainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man, that's scary,'' Ashby said. ''I haven't been here long
but it's a great bunch of guys. You get close to them in a hurry. I
hope he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves found themselves shorthanded when right fielder Brian
Jordan left the game after straining his groin while running out a
grounder in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan stayed in the game for another inning, but aggravated the
injury while chasing Dmitri Young's double in the fourth. He came
out for a pinch-hitter in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just one of those days,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Andres Galarraga also was out of the lineup for a
second day. Galarraga, who missed last season with a cancerous
tumor in his back, had tests Monday to make sure the disease hasn't
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommended the tests as a precaution after X-rays found
that he had a cracked bone in his left thumb and a cyst near the
fracture. Results so far have found no trace of cancer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Pat Burrell hit two homers, including a
grand slam, as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the San Diego Padres
10-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal (3-12) pitched six strong innings for the victory, his
first since May 25 when he was with Arizona, as the Phillies won
for the first time in five games against the Padres this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes, in his first appearance since July 6, pitched one
inning and gave up one run on one hit for the Phillies. Ed Vosberg
relieved Gomes in the eighth and walked two before giving up Damian
Jackson's RBI single to cut the Phillies' lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock came on and struck out Eric Owens with the bases
loaded to end the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Philadelphia broke it open in the eighth with five runs
off Kevin Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal hit an RBI infield single and then Burrell,
3-for-3 with two walks, hit the second grand slam of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell is 6-for-7 with 17 RBIs with the bases loaded. It was
his second two-homer, five-RBI game of the season, the last coming
June 20 against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored in each of the first four innings against
Brian Tollberg (2-2).
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Bobby Abreu took advantage of catcher Ben Davis'
throwing error to give the Phillies a 1-0 lead. Abreu singled,
moved to second on Scott Rolen's single, stole third and scored on
the errant throw.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu, 3-for-5, added an RBI double in the fourth and a solo
homer, his 17th, in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell's 12th homer of the season made it 2-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Anderson's RBI fielder's choice made it 3-0 in the third.
Second baseman Brett Boone prevented further trouble for Tollberg
as he made a diving stop up the middle on the grounder and made a
great backhand flip to shortstop Desi Relaford, who almost
converted an inning-ending double play on Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Daal cruised through the first five innings, allowing just two
hits. He struggled in the sixth when San Diego cut the deficit to
4-3 on Joe Vitiello's RBI double and Davis' two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Daal allowed three runs on six hits, struck out five and walked
three.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg gave up 11 hits and four runs -- three earned. He walked
and struck out one en route to his second loss in three starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burrell leads NL rookies with 13 homers and 32 extra-base
hits. ... Padres CF Ruben Rivera has struck out at least one in 24
of his last 32 games, and 45 times in that span. ... Rolen had a
career-high two stolen bases. ... Padres 3B Phil Nevin doubled in
the fourth, reaching base for the 30th straight game. ... Phillies
OF Doug Glanville had two singles, extending his hitting streak to
nine games. ... Jackson went 0-for-2 and is 1-for-19 against Daal
for his career. ... Tollberg has surrendered 33 hits over his last
three starts -- a span of 14 2-3 innings. ... Phillies 1B Travis Lee
stole second base in the seventh. He is 31-for-36 in stolen-base
attempts for his career. ... Of the 18 outs recorded by Daal, only
one was a groundout. ... The Phillies had a season-high four
steals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Brian Rose won his Coors Field debut and Jeff
Cirillo drove in three runs to lead the Colorado Rockies to a 6-1
win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds went 3-for-3 with a run scored and increased
his batting average to .370. Todd Helton went 2-for-4 to increase
his NL-leading average to .381 as the Rockies won for only the
ninth time in 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rose (1-0) allowed seven hits in five scoreless innings in his
second start since being acquired from Boston on July 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates stranded 14 runners and left the bases loaded three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Silva (7-6) three runs and 12 hits in 4 2-3 innings for
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Mayne gave the Rockies a 1-0 lead with a two-out RBI
single in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rose worked out of a bases loaded jam with one out in the fourth
inning by striking out Pat Meares and getting Silva to fly out to
right.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh left the bases loaded again in the fifth inning when
Larry Walker caught Warren Morris' fly ball at the wall in right
field.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Myers came on for the Rockies with the bases loaded and two
outs in the eighth and struck out Brian Giles looking.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo had an RBI single in the fourth inning. The Rockies
added three in the seventh on an RBI triple by Walker and a two-run
double by Cirillo.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall had an RBI single in the eighth for Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Enrique Wilson made his first start at third base since
coming to Pittsburgh on July 29 from Cleveland. ... The Pirates
turned four double plays. ... Rockies OF Juan Pierre had a bunt
single in his first major league at-bat. ... Colorado's RHP Pedro
Astacio will make his scheduled start in the makeup game Thursday
in St. Louis, but won't make the weekend trip to Montreal. Astacio
faces a deportation because he faces a trial in November on charges
of hitting his wife. He also skipped Colorado's first trip to
Canada. ... Kevin Jarvis (back) and RHP Mike DeJean (strained
oblique muscle) threw simulated games for Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Belt Cubs Rookie for 4 HRs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers hit four home runs in
the fourth inning of Tuesday night's game against the Chicago Cubs
-- including the first of two by pitcher Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   All four homers came off right-hander Phil Norton, making his
second major league start since being called up from Triple-A Iowa
on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Norton became the 18th pitcher in major league history to
surrender four homers in one inning, and the 10th in NL history.
The last one to do it was Andy Benes, on July 23 against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster, whose throwing error punctuated Chicago's
three-run third inning, led off the Dodgers' fourth with his 12th
home run.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, whose homer on July 5 at San Diego ignited a
come-from-behind victory, hit his second of the season and fourth
of his career to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs later, Gary Sheffield took over the major league home
run lead from the Cubs' Sammy Sosa with his 36th. Eric Karros' bid
for his 28th homer was 15 feet foul on Norton's next pitch, and he
settled for a single before Shawn Green capped the five-run inning
with a drive to right field that chased the 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who hit 25 homers during his three-year career at
Wichita State, homered again to left-center off Todd Van Poppel
with one out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who has three home runs this season, is the first
Dodgers pitcher to hit more than one homer in a season since 1984,
when Fernando Valenzuela hit three. Dreifort has five career
homers.
</P>
<P>
   His homers were measured at 441 feet and 462 feet, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The New York Mets activated outfielder Darryl
Hamilton from the disabled list and designated infielder Matt
Franco for assignment following Tuesday night's 9-3 loss to the
Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mattie has been a good contributor off the bench, but we're
getting Darryl back and we had to make a move somewhere,'' Mets
general manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton played in five games for the Mets this season and was
hitting .133 when he was placed on the disabled list April 7 with a
sprained left foot. He underwent surgery May 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hit .339 in 55 games with New York last season.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who played with the Mets the last five years, was
hitting .223 in 79 games this season.
</P>

Bobby Valentine said. ''He was really ready yesterday,''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A landlord was killed because his crack
addicted tenant couldn't pay her overdue rent, according to Albany
police.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Porter, 32, was charged Tuesday with second-degree
murder and second-degree burglary. She was arraigned in Albany City
Court and sent to the Albany County Jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Nellenbeck, 47, was sitting on his back porch July 2,
having just planted flowers in the backyard of the house he shared
with Porter, when his tenant approached him from behind, according
to Albany police.
</P>
<P>
   Porter struck him several times in the head with a hammer,
killing him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not know how much money Porter owed
Nellenbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ''People make rash decisions at times,'' said Detective James
Miller, a spokesman for the Albany Police Department. ''Who knows
what kind of mind-set she was in at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After killing Nellenbeck, Porter stole several items from him to
fuel her drug addiction, including a computer and a 1995 Chrysler,
according to Albany police. Both have since been recovered.

<HEADLINE> Canceled 'Christy' Lives With Fans  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOWNSEND, Tenn. (AP) -- Sunday morning awakens with a bagpiper's
refrain of ''Amazing Grace'' echoing through the Great Smoky
Mountains. An old steeple bell calls the faithful together for a
service at a small church on a hilltop.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than an abandoned set from a canceled, short-lived
TV series. It is the home of ''Christy,'' the family-friendly show
starring Kellie Martin and Tyne Daly that continues to command a
strong following six years after production ended in these
Tennessee hills.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 fans from across the country came here over a
three-day weekend in July for Christy Fest. The annual event keeps
the ''Christy'' story alive with cast and crew workshops, a stage
play by fans and a guided tour of the somewhat overgrown set on a
Townsend farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''How appropriate that each of you in your own personal
pilgrimage has found strength and sustenance and great joy in the
telling of this story,'' series executive producer Ken Wales says
from the church steps.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are the ones that have kept the flame going.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Christy,'' the series, was launched with a TV movie on Easter
Sunday 1994. Some 42 million people tuned in. It ran for barely two
seasons on CBS, but the show has remained popular in reruns and
videos.
</P>
<P>
   So has the 1967 book on which it was based. Catherine Marshall's
best seller tells the story of her mother's real-life journey as a
young woman going into the backwoods of Appalachia in 1912 to teach
mountain children.
</P>
<P>
   Fans at Christy Fest shared testimonials of the show's positive
influence on their lives. One woman said it helped her survive
cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is pretty amazing to see all the fans still supporting the
show,'' said Randall Batinkoff, who co-starred as young minister
David Grantland. ''It is great to see the effect the show had.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, a professor of film and television at Syracuse
University, said few old shows generate such devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing that turns a show into a lifestyle is
some way in which it creates a universe that seems real and fully
blown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Mayberry, N.C., in ''The Andy Griffith Show'' is a
classic example.
</P>
<P>
   '''Christy' was very much like that,'' Thompson said. ''It
wasn't shot in Los Angeles passing for the Smoky Mountains. It was
a real set. And that is what makes a great cult classic that people
continue to go back to.''
</P>
<P>
   For many ''Christy'' fans, the show's message was as important
as the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''What really grabbed me about the 'Christy' TV show was that it
was a Christian message on TV, which you really don't have very
often,'' said Susan O'Dwyer of Alpharetta, Ga. As a girl in
Washington, D.C., she attended a Sunday School class taught by
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Wales agreed that ''Christy'' broke ground in its open
expression of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the first time in network television that the heroine
did what she did because of what she believed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christy'' reruns, which have never stopped showing somewhere,
will air on the Odyssey cable channel this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the PAX network is putting ''Christy'' back into
production for a two-hour TV movie set for Thanksgiving and a
four-hour miniseries in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pick it up where we left off,'' said Tim Johnson, PAX
executive vice president for programming. ''But it will definitely
move it along.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the new production will strive for ''the same
integrity and the same values that the original had, then add more
and make it bigger. That is what this is going to be -- epic
'Christy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fans, cast and crew at Christy Fest were ambivalent about the
PAX production. The original was shot entirely on location in
Townsend, about an hour from Del Rio, where Marshall's mother
taught school. PAX plans to shoot in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   PAX has retained some of the original writers and actors, but
Martin will be replaced and producer Wales, who spent nine years
and his personal savings bringing the story to television, is not
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an uncertain future more personal and bigger than
television, Wales asked ''Christy'' fans to pause for a moment of
silence before they ended the short service with the Lord's Prayer
and a hymn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pray that the spirit of 'Christy' can live forever,'' he said,
''whatever form that is.''

<HEADLINE> James Brown Security Guard Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The former security chief of James Brown has
been charged with arson and theft for an April fire that destroyed
some of the singer's priceless mementos and music.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Glenn, 39, was indicted Tuesday on charges of
first-degree arson, theft and three counts of first-degree forgery.
He allegedly stole $75,000 and later set fire to Brown's office to
hide the theft.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began working on the case after the April 28 fire
at James Brown Enterprises destroyed the office. Investigators said
the fire also destroyed evidence concerning the April 11 theft of a
$75,000 check made payable to Brown that ended up in two bank
accounts the singer did not authorize.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a former backup singer for Brown has filed a sexual
harassment suit against him. Lisa Rushton filed the lawsuit Friday
in Richmond County, Ga., against New James Brown Enterprises. She
is seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Dallas, Brown's attorney, said he has not seen the lawsuit
and could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rushton alleges in the lawsuit that Brown started to demand sex
from her in 1994. When she refused, Brown began to retaliate by
reducing the number of her performances and cutting her pay,
according to the lawsuit.

   Or, at least, a technology stock.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems posted profits that slightly exceeded Wall Street
estimates. And in this day and age of worry about the corporate
bottom line, that could be enough to ignite a mini-rally in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is going for its eighth straight advance. It closed
yesterday at its highest level in four months.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Wednesday with technology
stocks surging on a positive earnings report from widely-held
bellwether Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 29.30 at 10,947.59.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes were all higher, however. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 66.27 at 3,914.82 and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 3.65 at 1,486.46. The Russell 2000 index of small companies was
up 3.41 at 512.13.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's quarterly revenues surged 61 percent as the Internet
networking giant beat Wall Street's earnings expectations by a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges, Cisco earned $1.2 billion, or 16
cents per share in its fiscal fourth quarter, up from $710 million
or 10 cents per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted the San Jose-based company would earn 15
cents per share. The per-share figures reflect the 2-for-1 stock
split on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter revenue was $5.72 billion, up 61 percent from
$3.56 billion in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cisco rose $3.156 to $68.156.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco serves as a bellwether for the technology sector, having
emerged as one of the most stable high-tech companies in the
nation. Soaring demand for its switches, routers and fiber-optic
equipment has turned it into one of the most valuable companies in
the world, vying with Microsoft as the company with the largest
market capitalization.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday with
technology stocks rising on a positive earnings report from
widely-held, bellwether Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 78.02 at 10,898.87.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also mixed. The Nasdaq composite

was down 2.63 at 1,480.18.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what I call the every-other-day theory. Yesterday
blue-chip stocks were up and the techs were down,'' said Ralph
Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in Tampa,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would would really be healthy is if both markets rose in
concert with one another. The fact that that isn't happening leads
me to think this is nothing more than a bear market rally,'' Bloch
added.

<P>
   Blue chip stocks fell despite a government report released on
Tuesday that showed Americans' productivity rose during the past
year at the fastest pace in 17 years while labor costs declined,
the first time they have dropped since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers were much better than expected, and economists
believe the encouraging figures made it unlikely that the Federal
Reserve will boost interest rates for a seventh time when the
central bank meets again Aug. 22.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Barbra Streisand plans to give
fund-raising efforts for the Clinton presidential library a boost.
</P>
<P>
   She has scheduled a benefit at her home during next week's
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles to raise money for
the library in Little Rock.

<P>
   Skip Rutherford, Clinton's chief library fund-raiser, said
Monday that tickets for the benefit are by invitation only.

   The library, with an estimated cost of about $125 million, is
being paid for with private donations, Rutherford said. He declined

raised.

   ''Covenant'' (Red House) -- Greg Brown
</P>
<P>
   Dark, full of pain and sorrow, sweet, wise and occasionally even
a touch optimistic, ''Covenant'' stands as a singular document. Of
course, each Greg Brown album seems, upon release, to be his best
ever. This guy has been turning out masterwork after masterwork,
each seemingly impossible to top. Then a couple of years later, he
outdoes himself.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the case with ''Covenant,'' which is a great,
great album. Producer-guitarist Bo Ramsey provides a perfect,
mostly acoustic setting for Brown's loose-limbed funkiness, strong
lyrics and deep, deep voice as Brown meditates on failed
relationships and the seeming impossibility of lasting love.
</P>
<P>
   The catchy, melodic ''Rexroth's Daughter'' is a gem, bursting
with great lines such as ''She'd stand there in my doorway,
smoothing out her dress/and say 'this life is a thump-ripe melon --
so sweet and such a mess.''' And don't miss the ''bonus'' track.
Just let the disc keep playing after the last listed song and enjoy
the hilarious ''Marriage Chant.''

   ''Time After Time'' (Blix Street) -- Eva Cassidy
</P>
<P>
   ''Time After Time'' is further evidence of what popular music
lost in 1996 when a virtually unknown singer named Eva Cassidy died
of cancer at 33. Painfully shy by all accounts, and seemingly
uninterested in stardom, Cassidy nonetheless was one of the great
singers of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies had no idea what to do with a woman who could
wail like Aretha Franklin in her prime on one song, then break
hearts with a whisper on the next; who didn't care if a song was
soul, pop, gospel, jazz, blues or folk as long as it moved her and
she could find its essence. And so when she died, Cassidy left
behind a slim body of recorded work and a growing base of fans in
her native Washington, D.C., area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time After Time'' follows a compilation, ''Songbird,'' with 12
previously unreleased songs, emphasizing ballads. Cassidy gets to
the core of each, with a voice that can be fragile or strong, edgy
or tender. She covers songs by writers as diverse as Cyndi Lauper
and Harlan Howard, making each distinctly her own. Her versions of
Paul Simon's ''Kathy's Song,'' which opens the album, and the
gospel ''Way Beyond the Blue,'' which closes it, are classic.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Rosellen Brown  </HEADLINE>
By DEBRA HALE SHELTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- It was June 1964. Freedom Summer, some called it.
It was also a deadly one. Three young civil-rights workers were
shot and later found buried in an earthen dam in Neshoba County,
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But two white graduate students from the North -- outsiders to
the locals -- did not let the activists' disappearance dissuade them
from teaching at the historically black Tougaloo College near
Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were profound cowards. We weren't planning to stand on any
picket lines or get hit on the head. ... But we thought that just
being there was a form of testimony,'' says author Rosellen
(pronounced Rose Ellen) Brown, who with her husband, educator and
author Marvin Hoffman, spent three years in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In her fifth novel, Brown recalls the politics of the civil
rights era and writes about how it converged with the very private
life of a young white woman to forever change her life and more.
</P>
<P>
   Like Brown's other works, this story focuses on family and moral
questions. In her best-selling ''Before and After,'' a couple
grappled with the knowledge that their son was a murderer. In
''Tender Mercies,'' a woman is left a quadriplegic because of an
accident caused by her husband. And in ''Half a Heart,'' Miriam, a
white Jewish woman, confronts the decision she made in 1960s
Mississippi to give up the baby girl she had with a black professor
and sets out to reunite with the child, now 17 and envious of her
mother's wealth and lifestyle in an opulent, white Houston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Brown views her books not as mere domestic novels, but books
that delve into larger issues though set in a family environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''All my work has really concerned the place where the public
and the private intersect,'' Brown says. Miriam's life ''is really
acted upon by the moment in history in which she's living. She has
this baby, and if that had happened in another time, very different
things might have happened to her. But given the times, there are a
lot of reasons why she has to give up this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Miriam, Brown is Jewish. Beyond that and the teaching
experience, the novel is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing in this book ever happened -- not one single thing,''
says Brown, sitting at the kitchen table in her large 16th-floor
apartment in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Casually dressed in blue jeans, a loose-fitting blouse and big
hoop earrings, Brown's youthful looks belie her 61 years.
</P>
<P>
   She surrounds herself in the apartment she and her husband share
with the things she loves: shelves and stacks of books galore; cats
Coriander and Joey; vintage family portraits; a view of Lake
Michigan's south shore; a tiny back porch resplendent in marigolds
and geraniums; and an old Baldwin piano where an opera score is
open to Schumann's ''Child Falling Asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   On first meeting, Brown might seem a woman of contradictions.
Her black hair is neatly pulled up, yet she is barefoot. She is a
proud mother of two adult daughters, showing off a brochure
promoting daughter Adina Hoffman's first book. She is the
intellectual who teaches in the Graduate Creative Writing Program
at The Art Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   She is the artist who writes with a pen and graph paper as she
stretches out with a cup of coffee on a big, blue sofa. (''I can't
imagine writing on a computer.'') But she is also the Internet
surfer who checks out Amazon.com's reader reviews of her new book,
and she even uses the computer to revise her writing.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Half a Heart,'' Brown writes from the mother's and the
daughter's alternating points of view and says the thought of
taking on the biracial daughter's point of view is terrifying,
''because I know there are going to be people who are shooting for
me no matter what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is comfortable with her decision. ''My feeling is that
it isn't colonialism to write in a voice that isn't yours and it
isn't poaching in somebody else's territory. ... It's trying to be
empathetic, responding to people who say so often, 'Why don't you
know what it's like to be me? You don't even try.'''
</P>
<P>
   The book also delves into racial misunderstanding in
contemporary America and explores how some of the old '60s radicals
now live very middle-class lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did something that was very dangerous and very useful for
a little while,'' she says, ''and then they kind of went back to
who they were and became more like their mothers than they ever
intended to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown seems to blend both worlds. She lives in a full-floor
apartment in an affluent neighborhood, has seen one of her books,
''Before and After,'' turned into a motion picture and awaits a
television movie based on her latest book. Yet she delights in
scouring thrift shops and hasn't let herself expand her exotic mask
collection because it means spending money on things not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her novels, Brown is the author of three collections of
poetry, including her favorite book, ''Cora Fry's Pillow Book.''
(''It's not highfalutin; it's easy to understand,'' she says.) She
also has a book of short stories and a book of poems, essays and
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who already has begun research on a possible sixth novel,
has been writing since she was 9. Her family moved often, and she
was lonely at school, so she began writing to look busy, to have
someone -- albeit herself -- to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was sort of like that pearl that grows around the bit of
sand that irritates the oyster. I surrounded this loneliness with
something that turned into the love of my life,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I think that if I'd been happy, maybe I would have never
started writing.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Rosellen Brown has written poetry, short stories, essays and
novels. Here are some excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   From ''Half a Heart,'' a novel published by Farrar, Straus and
Giroux:
</P>
<P>
   ''They were good souls, liberal, she supposed, by most
standards, 'social-justice junkies,' Ernie called them, when
clean-hands causes and political campaigns begged their support.
But they could not imagine lives very different from their own.
True, all of it true, but she had no right to take out after them:
her old activist's credentials were brown with age, and she hadn't
renewed them. Two years in Mississippi close to twenty years ago in
the long hot season of civil rights had prepared her for nothing,
now, but hypocrisy. There was no worse disappointment, Miriam knew,
than being stuck in the middle, neither this nor that. I am not one
of you, my friends, but neither am I so unlike you that I can
renounce a single thing we have in common.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   From ''Cora Fry's Pillow Book,'' a collection of poetry
published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux:
</P>
<P>
   ''What are friends for, my mother asks./ A duty undone, visit
missed,/ casserole unbaked for sick Jane./ Someone has just made
her bitter./ Nothing. They are for nothing, friends,/ I think. All
they do in the end --/ they touch you. They fill you like music.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   From ''How to Win,'' a short story published in ''The
Massachusetts Review'' and later in ''The Best American Short
Stories of the Century,'' edited by John Updike and Katrina
Kenison:
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how he dreams me. I know because I dream his dreams. He
runs to hide in me. Battered by the stick of the old dark he comes
fast, hiccoughing terror. By the time I am up, holding him, it has
hobbled off, it must be, into his memory. I've pulled on a robe, I
spread my arms -- do they look winged or webbed? -- to pull him out
of himself, hide him, swear the witch is nowhere near. He doesn't
go to his father. But he won't look at my face.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was you! He looks up at me finally and says nothing but I
see him thinking. So: I was the witch, with a club behind my bent
back. I the hundred-stalked flower with webbed branches. I with the
flayed face held in my two hands like a bloody towel. Then how can
I help him?''

<HEADLINE> Donal Logue Discusses 'Tao' Movie  </HEADLINE>
By MARK KENNEDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Single men, listen up.
</P>
<P>
   If you get tongue-tied picking up women, if your opening lines
fall flat as pancakes, if women giggle when you aren't being funny,
then heed the words of Donal Logue.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   Donal Logue, a 34-year-old journeyman actor who has popped up in
dozens of film roles, including those opposite Mel Gibson, Julia
Roberts, Wesley Snipes and Tom Cruise. He's currently starring in
the new romantic comedy, ''The Tao of Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, this guy stumbled over dating catnip.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself staring at an incredibly gorgeous woman at a
crowded Los Angeles bar. She had a cool car, fancy record deal and
sexy tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the tough guys were one-lining her to death,'' he recalls.
''I just said, 'I can't compete. So I'm just going to give up.' She
was out of my league.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a defining moment for Logue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because I was free, I could just be myself. I'd have
conversations with people around her, make them laugh,'' he says.
''I was the one guy in there who wasn't talking to her in a
contrived way to get in her pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Then something very odd occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boom! She just dug me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes those one-liners from cocky, superarrogant guys
work, but it's shallow,'' he says. ''The people who really get
under your skin are the people who don't have that fear of talking
to you as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that Logue has translated into celluloid for
''The Tao of Steve.'' The title comes from a heady brew of popular
culture and Asian philosophy. To be a Steve is good, like Steve
McQueen or Steve Austin. If you're not a Steve, you're a Stew -- or
dating roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   Logue plays Dex, a slacker who woos women by quoting Heidegger
and cooking mango mahi-mahi. Somehow, the ladies seem to swoon,
despite the pounds he's accumulated since college, the endless
games of Frisbee golf, the low-paying job and the morning bong
hits.
</P>
<P>
   That's because he's developed the three-step Tao of Steve.
Here's how it works: If you want to be a Steve, never act desperate
while on the prowl, make sure to do something excellent in front of
your prey, and then immediately beat a hasty retreat.
</P>
<P>
   According to Logue, this stuff really works.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened a lot in my life,'' he says with a wistful smile.
''The woman is thinking, 'All men hit on me! What's up with this
guy?' It's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Logue doesn't need it -- not any more, anyway. He stalls a
recent interview to make a phone call: He wants to check in with
his longtime girlfriend and baby son in Los Angeles. Both were with
him in New Mexico while the film was being shot, and the irony of a
new daddy portraying a lusty playboy wasn't lost on Logue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't like, 'Hey, let's cruise chicks and see if it
works!' It was, 'Oh, Jesus Christ! Go to sleep, please! The van is
going to pick me up in three hours!'''
</P>
<P>
   Director and co-writer Jenniphr Goodman cast several actors
before she found her leading man. Once Logue walked in, it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something uniquely ineffable about Donal. It's just an
alchemy of personality, intelligence, wit -- and something
elusive,'' she says. ''He has an alpha-male quality, a roguish
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   His work on ''The Tao of Steve'' earned him the Special Jury
Prize for Outstanding Performance at this year's Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Logue sees a strange link between his strategy for picking up
women and his snowballing career, which includes roles in ''The
Patriot'' with Gibson and the upcoming films, ''Steal This Movie!''
with Vincent D'Onofrio and ''The Opportunists'' with Christopher
Walken and Cyndi Lauper.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you give up the desire to be a successful actor, if you
really just go, 'I don't care, whatever God wants. I just want to
have a good life,' it has to be genuine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you really believe that, you're impenetrable. Because
then you're happy being who you are. And if you really believe that
... you'll probably get a bunch of acting roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Canada to Irish parents, Logue lived in the desert town
of Nogales, Ariz., during his teens. After attending Harvard, he
found his way to Los Angeles, and began acting.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I was addicted to was: Fly me to another city with a
hotel room and let me act in a movie. Sounds cool. Sign me up! It's
like a riptide. Then you start pursuing it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then a couple years later, you're like, 'OK. My friend just
graduated from law school. I'm 28 now. I can't go back. I'm too far
from shore. I might as well keep swimming.'''
</P>
<P>
   Logue has been swimming at a remarkable pace. He's played a
vampire who regrows an arm in ''Blade,'' a crude heavy in
''Reindeer Games'' and a Scotch-loving pal on TV's ''The Single
Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most notorious character was Jimmy McBride, a
greasy-haired Boston cab driver who delivered
stream-of-consciousness rants between MTV music videos in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first movie roles was in ''Sneakers'' with Robert
Redford. He has also appeared in ''Little Women,'' ''Jerry
Maguire'' and ''Runaway Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had lows, too. He endured a role in ''3 Ninjas Knuckle Up''
and was cut from ''The Thin Red Line.'' Two TV series -- ''Medicine
Ball'' and ''Public Morals'' -- were canceled. But Logue says that's
OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the camaraderie of the circus,'' he says. ''The scene
that's on the screen always is so much less important to me than
the experience of doing something.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Brownstone Singer Is Latest Buzz  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As a member of the trio Brownstone, Kina had a
taste of commercial success and fame. For many singers, who
struggle just to get a record deal, that would have been enough.
</P>
<P>
   But singing grooves that fit into the mainstream R&AMP;B market left
Kina in a deep funk. The Detroit-born singer, who grew up listening
to everyone from Led Zeppelin to Chaka Khan, felt stifled, unable
to do the kind of music she really wanted to do. So she took a
chance on herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed to be the artist that I am, and I left to do that, so
it was a relief, and exciting, because I was finally going to do
what I wanted to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Kina's gamble is paying off with the release of her
self-titled debut album, which features hard-driving rock tracks
against her gospel-like vocals. The album's first single, ''Girl
From the Gutter,'' an anthem for the scorned and the belittled, is
getting airplay on Top 40 radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   She is also the opening act for Savage Garden's current
nationwide tour. It's part of a multilayered strategy that has one
bold goal: to make her a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not be happy with a gold record quite honestly,'' said
her manager Benny Medina, whose clients include Jennifer Lopez and
Sean ''Puffy'' Combs. ''We shouldn't just break an artist here, we
should break barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kina to break barriers in sales, she will first have to
overcome obstacles in the world of commercial radio. As a black
female who sings something other than R&AMP;B, she faces similar
challenges of those who came before her.
</P>
<P>
   Most urban radio stations do not play songs that deviate from
the R&AMP;B format, which usually consists of hip-hop, dance beats or
silky soul songs. Meanwhile, it can be difficult for black
alternative acts to get airplay on mainstream or other radio
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   While Macy Gray's double-platinum debut is a success story,
there are many others -- including Billie Myers, Nicole Renee and
Joi -- whose sparkling albums do not garner commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was definitely worried about it, but so far, the response
has been amazing, at least on Top 40 radio,'' she said. ''I wish I
could be played on black radio, but there's nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the buzz is out there. In appearances prior to her
album's release, she drew audiences packed with celebrities and
industry executives hoping to get a glimpse of the singer being
hawked by DreamWorks Records as its next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   On a superficial level, Kina -- who is in her 20s -- has what it
takes to be a star: She is statuesque with stunning looks, and her
close-cropped blond hair is in sharp contrast to her dark-brown
complexion. She has already signed a contract with the Wilhelmina
modeling agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Medina was eager to sign her, Kina wasn't in any rush
to make him her manager, despite his successful track record in
Hollywood. (Besides Lopez and Combs, Medina was instrumental in
Will Smith's rise to stardom.)
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting, Kina's lawyer peppered him with dozens of
questions before dismissing him without giving him an answer,
Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like I had gone out on a first date and really hoped
that the girl would call me back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kina's approach to business comes from lessons learned the hard
way. She arrived in Los Angeles almost a decade ago at the urging
of a college friend, Nichole Gilbert, who was putting together a
singing group.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the group, but it disbanded two days later. She then
began working on her own music, taking various jobs to pay the
bills, including working as a clothed waitress at a strip joint.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gilbert formed Brownstone in 1994. The group was
signed to MJJ Music/Epic records and scored a Top 10 hit with ''If
You Love Me.'' Kina watched her friend's success from the sideline,
but with no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still wanted to do what I wanted to do. I had put a band
together, and I had my own thing,'' she said. ''I felt like it
still would have been drama.''
</P>
<P>
   When one of the trio became ill, Gilbert called on Kina, who
didn't pass up the opportunity. She had fun going on tour, but
''inner turmoil'' made her rethink her decision, she said. After
Brownstone's second release in 1997 was met with tepid fan
response, Kina left the group, which eventually disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody just wanted to go and do their thing, and I went
first,'' she said. ''We parted not as friends, but we didn't part
as enemies. There was no big explosion, no big fight, it was kind
of like, 'See ya.'''
</P>
<P>
   After Brownstone, Kina had to start from scratch. She found
herself rebuffed by record companies and producers who told her to
put some R&AMP;B grooves in her rock songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody had a vision for me, and everybody wanted to turn me
back to something I didn't want to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks gave her the opportunity to do what she wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent concert, she screeched out lyrics from ''Girl From
the Gutter'' with her rock band, spitting out the lyrics, ''I hope
your hell is filled with magazines, and on every page you see a big
picture of me.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been on the road since last fall, performing and
building a fan base. After one recent show, the singer appeared
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired now. I had a long last two days, a busy day the day
before,'' she said. ''It's cool though. I wouldn't want to be doing
anything else.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 68; Nasdaq Up 38  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday with
technology stocks rising on a positive earnings report from
widely-held, bellwether Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 67.76 at 10,909.13.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 38.38 at 3,886.93, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 4.11 at 1,478.70.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what I call the every-other-day theory. Yesterday
blue-chip stocks were up and the techs were down,'' said Ralph
Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in Tampa,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would would really be healthy is if both markets rose in
concert with one another. The fact that that isn't happening leads
me to think this is nothing more than a bear market rally,'' Bloch
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's quarterly revenues surged 61 percent as the Internet
networking giant beat Wall Street's earnings expectations by a
penny. Excluding one-time charges, Cisco earned $1.2 billion, or 16
cents per share in its fiscal fourth quarter, up from $710 million
or 10 cents per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted the San Jose-based company would earn 15
cents per share. The per-share figures reflect the 2-for-1 stock
split on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cisco rose $2.25 to $67.75.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco serves as a bellwether for the technology sector, having
emerged as one of the most stable high-tech companies in the
nation. Soaring demand for its switches, routers and fiber-optic
equipment has turned it into one of the most valuable companies in
the world, vying with Microsoft as the company with the largest
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that benefited from Cisco's solid earnings included
Internet parts makers JDS Uniphase, up 93.80 cents at $122.688, and
Sun Microsystems, up $1.625 to $112.813.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip stocks fell despite a government report released on
Tuesday that showed Americans' productivity rose during the past
year at the fastest pace in 17 years while labor costs declined,
the first time they have dropped since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers were much better than expected, and economists
believe the encouraging figures make it unlikely that the Federal
Reserve will boost interest rates for a seventh time when the
central bank's Open Market Committee meets again Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 469.89 million shares, up from
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.50 at 508.22.

<HEADLINE> Voting Down but Political Humor Up  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What if they gave an election and hardly
anybody voted but we all got a good laugh out of it?
</P>
<P>
   While Americans are going to the polls in fewer numbers, they
are casting their ballots for political humor on television and the
Internet -- and comedians are happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of late-night king Johnny Carson, Jay Leno of
NBC's ''Tonight'' and David Letterman of CBS' ''Late Show''
typically showcase political wisecracks in their monologues.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. See Bill Maher holding court on ABC's
''Politically Incorrect.'' Dennis Miller ranting on his HBO show.
Michael Moore playing radical prankster on Bravo's ''The Awful
Truth.'' Jon Stewart dishing as part of Comedy Central's ''The
Daily Show.'' Mark Russell belting out song parodies on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Will Durst and Louis Black, both commentators on ''The Daily
Show,'' are shopping a game show that would pit them against fellow
comedians Jeff Jenna and Tim Slagle in a comedic ''Crossfire.'' And
there's a band of traveling political humorists, including Al
Franken, Harry Shearer, Bob Harris and impressionist Jim Morris who
bring their perspective to television, radio and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention was the latest butt of jokes,
with the ratio of comics to delegates appearing perilously close to
even. The GOP lovefest was so tightly scripted, however, that the
comics' shots frequently hit the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   The largely white delegation and the racially diverse parade of
speakers was compared in various punchlines to a Utah Jazz home
game or to Harlem's old Cotton Club, where mainly white audiences
watched blacks on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Knives are being sharpened for the Democrats' convention next
week in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in a lot of what Gore says, until he says it,''
Durst offered as preview.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, author of ''Steal This Book and Get Life Without
Parole,'' took a dig at convention protesters: ''I'm not sure how
much real political debate you can begin when everything has to
rhyme with 'Hey, ho, (fill in the blank) has to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hit or miss, such humor can pay. Nearly 3 million people watched
Stewart's show during GOP convention week, 50 percent more than
watched Comedy Central's 1996 coverage, said Michele Ganeless, the
network's senior vice president for programming.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daily Show'' Web sites recorded significantly more traffic as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to election turnouts. In the 1996 presidential
election, 48.9 percent of the voting-age population went to the
polls, an all-time low based on Census figures dating back to 1930.
In 1998, 32.7 percent of potential voters cast ballots in the
midterm congressional elections, down 4 percent from four years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, politicians remain high profile and thus easy targets.
Leno performed a nightly Monica Monologue and audiences couldn't
get enough, at least for a while. Now George W. Bush and Al Gore
get to be roasted.
</P>
<P>
   This all has the feel of Democracy Lite, a way to be politically
engaged without really getting involved. Much of the late-night
comedy represents the lighter side of satire -- it's tasty but
doesn't weigh you down with serious content.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this GOP convention quip from Bill Maher: ''They
saluted the old war horses of the Republican Party. They had taped
packages on Ford, President Bush, Reagan, Dole. You've heard of
'Must See TV?' This was 'Musty TV.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or Dennis Miller, offering his caption for a photo of Sen. Ted
Kennedy wearing a fixed expression: ''Nothing is more amusing than
watching Teddy Kennedy try to catch the spots in front of his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran satirist Paul Krassner, founder of the alternative paper
The Realist, is unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really not so much political satire as celebrity jokes.
The celebrities happen to be politicians,'' Krassner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the last campaign, everything about Clinton was his
junk food or his philandering. Everything about Dole was ageist or
about his grouchiness. Everything about Gore now is his stiffness;
with Bush it's his (alleged) cocaine use or his dumbness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simplicity, but what happens is it trivializes and takes
the place of any point of view,'' Krassner said.
</P>
<P>
   A comic's outlet influences his content, suggested Durst,
comparing network shows to retail giants like Bloomingdale's and
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to make it for everybody from Peoria and worry if
they're not watching or if they'll get bored,'' he said. ''And then
there's the individual guys like me -- we're like the boutiques in
Soho.''
</P>
<P>
   Krassner, who soon will cease publishing The Realist, said he
plans to focus on writing novels. His first will examine what would
happen today to a controversial comic like the late Lenny Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   That requires imagination, Krassner said. While some talented
satirists are working, there's nobody like Bruce at the microphone.

<HEADLINE> Designer Rowley Puts Fun in Fashion  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynthia Rowley may be a serious designer in a serious business,
but the trick is never taking herself or her clothes too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Rowley -- responsible for some of the wittiest, wackiest
clothes on the market -- how she puts the fun in fashion and she'll
tell you about her line's ''twinkle, twinkle'' gowns powered by
battery-operated lights, or her handbags with webbing taken from
aluminum lawn chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Also reinvented for Rowley's runways in previous seasons:
curtains from her home that she turned into coats, thrift-shop
handkerchiefs reworked into halter tops and baby blankets reborn as
miniskirts.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should wear happy clothes that make them feel good,''
the New York-based designer says. ''It's funny how your mood can
totally be altered by what you're wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be in a good mood when your $40 million business
has Julia Roberts, Jennifer Anniston, Calista Flockhart, Meg Ryan,
Heather Graham and Bette Midler as customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's not to be happy about? It's about being thankful for
everything and keeping a sense of humor,'' says Rowley. ''Nothing
should be taken for granted. There is so much to be optimistic
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Rowley's good luck comes from practicing
superstitions like wearing lucky four-leaf clovers in her shoes
during fashion shows?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe she's lucky because she doesn't get riled by life's
little setbacks, like breaking a limb while jumping on her
trampoline, a gift from her employees.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Rowley will have a U.S. rollout of her cosmetics
line that is already selling in Japan. A jeans line will debut next
year. Also on Rowley's to-do list is a new book to follow last
year's ''Swell: A Girl's Guide to the Good Life'' (Time Warner),
which offers advice to 20-somethings on how to navigate life's
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley, who declined to give her age, says, ''Let's just say,
I'm younger than Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before a Sept. 21 preview of her spring 2001
collection during New York Fashion Week, Rowley will jump into a
high-gear, no-nonsense work mode.
</P>
<P>
   ''First step is to say goodbye to all your friends and family
and drop out of society,'' she says. ''Next, reality sets in: The
show is nearing. Lots of ordering in (meals) and scrambling around
to test all of my not-so-ordinary ideas. Before you know it, we're
working 9 a.m. to at least 9 p.m. right up to show time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard work is her ethic. ''One of my teachers once said, 'Don't
expect anything for 10 years.' It is really great advice because I
never became impatient. I just kept pushing ahead until I woke up
one morning and it had all happened,'' she says in her eclectic
showroom, where the walls are lined with tropical aquariums and the
ceiling is painted with constellations. After the workday, she
often schedules her employees for lessons in tap dancing, boxing or
Italian language.
</P>
<P>
   At her downtown Manhattan loft, which she shares with husband
Bill Keenan, who is a sculptor, and their 14-month-old daughter
Kit, Rowley projects movies outdoors on a large terrace wall. Their
getaway home on Montauk, Long Island, is a one-room former surfer
shack decorated with '50s flea market finds. An Airstream trailer
has been converted into a guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Originally from Barrington, Ill., she relocated to New York in
1983 with a $3,000 fellowship and a $1,000 gift from her
grandmother. Rowley had just graduated from The Art Institute of
Chicago, and she hired a rep to sell her eight-piece collection,
her senior project, to some of the finest stores in New York. A
week later, she had $30,000 in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley has freestanding stores in Beverly Hills, Calif., New
York, Miami, Chicago, Tokyo and Seoul. Boston and a second New York
location are up next. Her young, hip customers also buy her clothes
and accessories at stores including Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth
Avenue, Nordstrom, Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman. Silk shirtdresses
retail for about $325, cocktail dresses are about $500 and a plaid
mohair coat is $465.
</P>
<P>
   Her self-owned company is in discussions for a partnership with
The Pegasus Group, a fashion conglomerate looking to sign with
major designers. Yet Rowley, who owns farms in her hometown area,
says, ''I'm still a Midwest girl at heart. No matter where I go, I
will always be the girl from Barrington, Ill.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Jo Dee Messina  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- In Music City's extended family, Jo Dee
Messina is the little sister.
</P>
<P>
   She's plucky and likable, but insecure about measuring up to
Shania Twain and Faith Hill, her slightly older, more glamorous
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confidence is definitely not a word that I would use in
describing myself,'' said Messina, 29. ''I'm fashion illiterate. I
don't see myself as glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   But she had more radio airplay than any other female country
artist in 1999, according to Billboard magazine, and she's sold
more than 2 million copies of her latest album, ''I'm Alright.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Messina is one of the nominees for best female
vocalist at this year's Country Music Association awards. Hill,
Martina McBride, Lee Ann Womack and Trisha Yearwood have also been
nominated. The winners will be announced in October.
</P>
<P>
   Messina believes she has earned her success by the sweat of her
brow.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's never a day that goes by that I don't think, 'I got to
work, I got to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why Messina's music is dotted with as many
positive-thinking bromides as the songs of Clint Black, whose hits
include ''No Time to Kill'' and ''Something That We Do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new album ''Burn'' (Curb Records) is filled with advice and
encouragement for her young fans -- and herself. On ''Dare to
Dream,'' she urges everyone to ''seize the day.'' On ''These Are
the Days,'' she warns against letting time slip away. And she
offers advice to a promiscuous teen-ager on ''Angeline.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone did a survey, and they said 70 percent of my fans are
25 and under,'' Messina said. '''Angeline' is like a big sister
going, 'OK, you're in this, but I want you to know this isn't the
real thing. This is not as good as it gets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like self-help books, the song lyrics Messina chooses to record
are sometimes full of cliches. On one stretch of the hit single
''That's the Way,'' she offers them one after the other: ''That's
the way it is/You got to roll with the punches/That's the way it
goes/You got to bend when the wind blows/You live you learn/You
crash and burn/It's hit or miss/That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The saving graces are Messina's obvious sincerity, and crisp,
gorgeous pop productions, courtesy of her mentors Tim McGraw and
Byron Gallimore. The three became friends a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Messina, a native of rural Holliston, Mass., moved to Nashville
in 1990 after years as a club singer there. She met McGraw through
producer Gallimore, and the singer helped her get signed to Curb
Records.
</P>
<P>
   Curb wouldn't pay for an entire album, she said, so McGraw put
up the money with the provision that Curb would reimburse him if
executives liked the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was betting on me,'' Messina said. ''He'd only had a couple
of hits at the time, and he believed that much in me to risk his
own financial security.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 ''Jo Dee Messina'' album contained a No. 1 hit, ''Heads
Carolina, Tails California.'' But the singer was close to
bankruptcy two years later when a second album was delayed while
she looked for songs to record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between the first and the second album, all I felt was
pressure,'' she said. ''I kept thinking, 'I got to get it done, I
got to get it done, I got to get food on the table.' ... Since we
got five singles out of the 'I'm Alright' album, it gave me more
time without that pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Messina will stop touring temporarily -- her first
real break in five years -- and then return next year for her first
headline tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just become a big joke that I never take a day off,'' she
said. ''There's never a point where you can say, 'OK, it's smooth
sailing now.'
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want something, you've got to work for it. I just keep
working.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Sarah Brightman  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- English soprano Sarah Brightman sang in three
Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals: ''Cats'' in London, and ''The Phantom
of the Opera'' and ''Aspects of Love'' in London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber wrote the part of Christine Daae in ''Phantom'' for
his new bride, threatening to cancel the Broadway run in 1988 if
Brightman was not allowed to transfer with it from London alongside
Michael Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   She is best known for ''Music of the Night'' from ''Phantom''
and ''Time to Say Goodbye,'' her duet with Italian tenor Andrea
Bocelli. But, Brightman says, ''some English people remember my
first hit, a disco song, 'I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper,'
when I was 17.''
</P>
<P>
   After her six-year marriage to Lloyd Webber ended in 1990,
Brightman got offers for musical-comedy revivals. But she wanted to
work in a more classical repertoire. She studied with two Italian
voice teachers, an English voice teacher and American Ellen Faull.
</P>
<P>
   She is now in demand for concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Her list of successful records includes ''Dive,'' ''Fly,''
''Time to Say Goodbye'' and ''Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never felt more comfortable as I do now,'' she said. ''I
have control of my voice. It has depth and does what I need it
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Classical and pop tunes are interspersed on her new CD ''La
Luna'' (Angel Records). She sings ''Gloomy Sunday'' between ''Solo
con Te'' by Handel and ''La Luna'' by Dvorak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think music creates fantasy for us. We go into another place
when we listen. We're allowed to escape. On the album, some of the
songs are about the moon. Some just give the feeling of something
mystical and mysterious like the moon is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brightman lives in London and has a small apartment outside
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   When she does concerts, she puts classical music in the first
half. She recently sang solos and duets with Placido Domingo in a
Tokyo concert that was entirely classical. They met when they sang
in Lloyd Webber's ''Requiem.'' ''It was my first classical piece,''
she says. ''He was wonderful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She will tour 34 North American cities starting Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   1. What happened after you decided to become a concert artist?
</P>
<P>
   Brightman: I remember saying to my mother, 'I don't know if I
can keep it going. But I don't think I can go back, either.' I just
went ahead. I could have played it safe. I'm not a very
conventional person; I didn't have a conventional upbringing. I
trust my imagination and my ideas. I'm glad I had the courage to go
ahead and do it.
</P>
<P>
   11/2. What was the unconventional upbringing you mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   Brightman: I'm the eldest of six. My parents were free-thinking
and wonderful. They liked us to use our imaginations. My mother
took us to dance and painting classes. Her parents were frightened
of all that. She was fascinated by it and injected that into us. We
were given artistic freedom. We had loads of books in our house. We
were brought up in the countryside; I had a lovely childhood.
</P>
<P>
   2. Are you able to sing in the same style, whether the music is
pop, musical theater or classical?
</P>
<P>
   Brightman: Yes. I've got to the point where my voice has become
quite even. My voice has the same breath support and makes the same
sound; it has come into one natural whole. That has taken awhile to
get to, a lot of training and experimenting. I don't like playing
at things. I have to mean them.
</P>
<P>
   3. How will you travel when you tour the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Brightman: We travel on five buses. We go straight in after a
show. The bus has a kitchen, showers, books, a bedroom. I can hang
my clothes up. It's totally comfortable. You sleep on the move.
It's like being rocked around. At 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning, we
get to the day hotel, have a big breakfast and sleep until it's
time to get ready for the next performance or sightsee. I generally
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you enjoy touring?
</P>
<P>
   Brightman: Yes, I do, because I'm doing what I like to do. I
take a band, about six members, and probably four dancers with me,
and we'll use local orchestra musicians and, this time, choirs as
well. It's lovely in every new city to get an injection of
different people coming in.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you ever take a vacation?
</P>
<P>
   Brightman: I take a holiday once a year with my boyfriend Frank
Peterson, his family and my family around Christmas. He produces my
albums. We've been working together since the beginning of the
1990s. We worked together a year and a half or two years before we
felt it was nice to be together. So we are.

<HEADLINE> Response To US Missile Defense Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence officials have informed
President Clinton that China is likely to accelerate its nuclear
arms buildup if the United States erects a national defense against
long-range missiles, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction, in a classified report known as a National
Intelligence Estimate, is part of a broader assessment of how
foreign countries might respond to a U.S. decision to go ahead with
a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   It will be for Clinton to judge whether a faster Chinese nuclear
arms buildup is an acceptable price to pay for a national missile
defense that critics say is unnecessary in the short term and
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would decide soon whether to authorize the
initial steps toward deploying a network of missile interceptors,
missile-tracking radars and battle management computers to defend
all 50 states against a small-scale nuclear attack. China is among
the few nations capable of a nuclear strike on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In making his decision, Clinton has said he would take into
account four main factors: the urgency of the missile threat
against the United States, the cost of a missile defense, the
feasibility of building a reliable defense and the implications for
U.S. foreign policy, including responses from China and other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia are strongly opposed to the U.S. plan, arguing
that it would undercut the deterrent value of their nuclear
arsenals, violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and
undermine global stability. Many of the United States' European
allies also question the wisdom of a U.S. national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security aides have tried, with little
apparent success, to convince China's leaders that a U.S. national
missile defense would not be directed against China's nuclear
missile capability. The defensive system, they contend, is aimed at
''rogue'' nations like North Korea and Iran which are pursuing
intercontinental ballistic missile technologies and might not be
deterred by U.S. nuclear threats.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials who are familiar with the classified intelligence
report, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it states that
China plans to increase its nuclear arsenal regardless of U.S.
national missile defense plans. However, it adds that the increase
likely would be sped up if a missile defense were built.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would they probably accelerate it? Yes,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also affirms an intelligence estimate of September
1999 that the United States most likely will face a missile threat
by 2015 from North Korea, probably from Iran and possibly from
Iraq, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicts that Russia would continue shrinking
its nuclear force, which has been eroded in recent years by a lack
of money to modernize. Russian officials have warned that they
would feel compelled to respond to a U.S. missile defense, possibly
by withdrawing from major arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Additions to China's nuclear arsenal probably would be modest,
the report said, to give China a numerical edge over the U.S.
missile defense system, which in its initial configuration is
designed to defeat a couple of dozen incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said last year that China has about 20 long-range
nuclear missiles capable of reaching any part of U.S. territory. It
said then that China was likely to test within the next several
years a longer range missile capable of being fired from a mobile
platform, and that it would be targeted mainly at the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA also has reported that China is developing a
submarine-launched nuclear missile, the JL-2, which the
intelligence agency said was likely to be tested within the next
decade. It said the JL-2 probably will be able to target the United
States from waters near China.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cordesman, a national security expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said in a report last month on
likely Chinese reactions to U.S. missile defenses that Washington
might be able to negotiate ceilings on China's strategic force in
exchange for clear limits to the U.S. defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cordesman concluded, however, that China was more likely to
reject such a negotiation and instead would react to U.S.
deployment of missile defenses by ''systematically upgrading its
strategic nuclear forces to ensure that it can saturate and defeat
any national missile defense system the United States deploys.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Force Enters S. Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Church bells rang, drivers honked
their horns and women offered sweets and kisses to soldiers
Wednesday as Lebanese security forces moved into south Lebanon for
the first time in some 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of a mere 1,000 soldiers and police officers did
not convince officials in neighoring Israel that there would be
peace along the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese force's commander, police Brig. Gen. Nazih Abi
Nader, said his men would not take up positions at Fatima Gate, the
closed crossing point that has been the scene of stone-throwing and
occasional shots since Israel withdrew its troops on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had occupied south Lebanon as a buffer against
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said the Lebanese
forces weren't enough to contain the Muslim guerrillas who took
over southern Lebanon in the wake of the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as we withdrew to the last millimeter, the Lebanese army
needs to ensure security until the last millimeter of the border,''
Sneh said on Israeli army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Three guerrillas were eating breakfast at Fatima Gate, where
flags of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group flew. Elsewhere,
however, the guerrillas kept a low profile, appearing unarmed and
in civilian clothes, in compliance with their leaders' pledges to
recognize the Lebanese government's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deployment is the first step toward the gradual
restoration of Lebanese authority over southern Lebanon,'' U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Policemen in gray camouflage fatigues and soldiers in armored
vehicles drove into the former Israeli-occupied zone at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been waiting for you!'' Antoinette Shahin shouted as a
convoy passed through the Christian village of Qlaiaa. ''We haven't
slept all night!''
</P>
<P>
   Shahin went into her grocery store, grabbed a bag of rice and
ran out to toss it on the troops. Other villagers threw rose
petals.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no substitute for the army,'' said Jamil Jouki, 51,
as he pressed baklava, a sticky Middle Eastern treat, into the
soldiers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Two Muslim women in Bint Jbeil lunged at the soldiers, trying to
kiss them. Shouts of ''Allahu akbar,'' or ''God is great,'' rang
out as the first convoy went through the town followed by
townspeople in their cars honking the horns of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Church bells tolled in the nearby village of Ein Ibl when the
units arrived. Men performed the dabke, a foot-stomping dance, in
the square.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment particularly pleased Christians, who have been
worried about Muslim guerrillas taking control. Many Christians are
pro-Israel, and some 6,000 Lebanese, mainly Christians, fled the
zone to Israel just before the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In a move laden with symbolism, the security forces set up base
at the former Lebanese army barracks in the town of Marjayoun. The
compound had served as headquarters of the pro-Israel local
militia, now disbanded, and of the Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982, setting up an occupied
zone in the south in 1985 that it maintained with the militia's
help until May.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers moved into the former occupied zone Saturday --
a step that Lebanon had insisted on before its own deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's Interior Minister Michel Murr says it is up to U.N.
peacekeepers to police the border. But U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel
says Lebanon has not authorized the peacekeepers' deployment at
Fatima Gate.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were wounded near the gate Sunday and Monday when
Israeli soldiers fired at stone-throwers and youths preparing to
hurl a firebomb over the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has said it does not want to serve as Israel's border
guard in the absence of a peace treaty among Lebanon, Israel, and
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Russian Opposition Movement Planned  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Influential Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky
announced plans Wednesday to create an opposition movement, saying
the country was moving toward authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky and a group of actors, film and theater directors,
and public figures of contrasting political stripes signed an
appeal to the nation, saying Russia ''faces a new choice -- whether
to live in an authoritarian or a truly democratic state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice will very soon have a cardinal influence on the
lives of everyone, regardless of political convictions, financial
situation, social status, age or ethnic background,'' said the
statement released at a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the appeal elicits enough public support, Berezovsky said he
would form a movement.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is the most prominent of Russia's ''oligarchs,'' a
coterie of businessmen who concentrated vast wealth and political
influence during the 1990s. Berezovsky boasted that he orchestrated
some of Boris Yeltsin's sudden staffing changes.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is disliked by many Russians, who resent the
oligarchs for amassing wealth and political power in the years when
much of the nation was plunged into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to limit the
influence of the oligarchs over Kremlin policy. The tycoons seemed
to grow particularly nervous after Russian authorities began
investigating several leading businesses in recent months --
including the Avtovaz car maker, with which Berezovsky reportedly
has ties.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky has also criticized Putin's plan to rein in Russia's
independent-minded regions. He resigned his parliament seat last
month to protest the plan and apparent crackdown on big business.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Wednesday, Berezovsky said that while
Putin has not abolished democratic freedoms in Russia, he has
created a legal and political foundation for autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not effectively an authoritarian regime yet, but formally
it's already authoritarian,'' Berezovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky maintains that Russia no longer has any organized
political opposition to the Kremlin. The Communists, who dominated
Russia's parliament until last year, are no longer considered a
major force, while reformist parties have backed Putin on key
parliamentary votes, including his bills to exert more federal
control over the regions.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov criticized Berezovsky's plan.
''Nobody wants to join him, and nobody will,'' Zyuganov was quoted
as saying by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Others who signed the appeal include Alexander Yakovlev, the
architect of Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, hard-line
filmmaker Stanislav Govorukhin, and actors Oleg Menshikov and
Sergei Bodrov, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky also said he has withdrawn his offer to sell to the
state his 49 percent stake in Russia's leading television network,
ORT, saying he wanted to prevent a concentration of media in the
government's hands.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the ORT stake may only go ahead if the government
fails in its reported plans to take over another, independent
television network, NTV, Berezovsky said.

<HEADLINE> Brenda Reilly, pioneering athlete, coach dies at 62  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - Brenda Reilly, a founder of the
Connecticut Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and award-winning coach
at Central Connecticut University, has died. She was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly died of cancer Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in
Branford.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three decades she coached volleyball, softball and
basketball at Central and served as an athletic administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was my right hand person,'' Central Athletic Director C.J.
Jones said. ''She didn't have an enemy. You could always count on
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly pitched and played infield for the Raybestos Brakettes, a
fast-pitch softball powerhouse in the late 1950s and 1960s. She
later managed and played for the Falcons of the Women's
Professional Softball League in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Among her teammates was pitching legend Joan Joyce, who now
coaches at Florida Atlantic University. Joyce said Reilly learned
last summer she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''She fought it hard all the way until the end,'' said Joyce.
''That was Brenda.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York native, Reilly also was a basketball official and
served on several NCAA committees including equity, Title IX and
rules.
</P>
<P>
   She won several awards including the Division II coach of the
year in 1986. She was most recently honored for her lifetime
service to women's basketball, an award she received at the Women's
Final Four in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is survived by three brothers and 17 nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial Mass will be held 10 a.m. Saturday at the Church of
the Holy Spirit in Newington.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wahid Sheds Some Duties  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Embattled President Abdurrahman Wahid,
yielding to demands by senior legislators, on Wednesday handed the
daily running of the government to his popular deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, 60, who is nearly blind, told the 700-member People's
Consultative Assembly that Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri,
daughter of Indonesia's founding president, will run domestic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the need to change the management of the
government,'' Wahid said in a speech read by an aide. ''Because of
this I will ask the vice president to carry out daily technical
duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who earlier persuaded disgruntled legislators not to
launch impeachment proceedings against him, said he will take more
interest in foreign policy while Megawati will formulate Cabinet
agendas and decide priorities for government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said that under Indonesia's existing presidential form of
government, Megawati would remain accountable to him. He also said
he would trim his ineffectual Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, most factions in the assembly accused Wahid of
mishandling the nation's affairs during his first 10 months in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Senior legislators on Wednesday demanded Wahid to surrender
greater powers to Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   The job will be a major test for Megawati. Although her
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle has the largest number of
seats in the assembly and the national parliament, she rarely
speaks in public.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid and Megawati led a joint campaign to bring about
democratic reform after the downfall of ex-dictator Suharto two
years ago. But their relationship became strained last October when
he beat her in an election for the presidency by the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Wahid gave Megawati responsibility for ending
bloody fighting between Muslims and Christians in the eastern
Maluku islands, where thousands have died.
</P>
<P>
   She made several peace missions to the remote archipelago, also
known as the Moluccas, but the violence escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Wahid's aides revealed that the president had been
considering the appointment of a prime minister to work under
himself and Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to abandon this plan and empower Megawati instead
was warmly received by the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Tandjung, the parliament's speaker, said Megawati could
lighten the burdens of office now shouldered by the Wahid, who has
been weakened by a series of strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the vice president can take over the daily
operations of the government,'' said Tandjung, whose Golkar Party
controls the second largest number of seats in the legislature
behind Megawati's party.
</P>
<P>
   Golkar still wields extensive power despite its record as the
party that propped up the now disgraced Suharto during his 32-year
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is awaiting trial on charges of corruption.

<HEADLINE> Group urges stepped-up effort to find missing human rights activist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Concerned for his safety, a New York-based human
rights group urged the Indonesian government on Wednesday to
increase efforts to find a lawyer-activist who vanished five days
ago on a visit to the island of Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch said it feared Jafar Siddiq Hamzah, 35, may
have been kidnapped by Indonesian military or paramilitary troops
on Saturday, during a visit to Medan, Indonesia's third largest
city. He was known to have met that afternoon with a businessman
from Aceh but later failed to show up for a meeting with a Japanese
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzah, who lives in Woodside, Queens, recently returned to his
native Aceh, on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, where he
has worked on human rights issue since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He is the founder of two organizations, one of them the New
York-based International Forum for Aceh, to call attention to the
strife there between the Indonesian government and an armed
separatist group called the Free Aceh Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said
Hamzah's disappearance was noted when he failed to telephone his
family in the town of Lhokseumawe, which he normally did every few
hours as a safety precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Indonesia's regional military commander has denied
any knowledge of Hamzah's whereabouts, and appeals by the U.S.
embassy in Jakarta to the government and the Indonesian Commission
on Human Rights have yielded no results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing we've heard is a fourth-hand, unconfirmed
report from an NGO on non-violence that he is still alive,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it was possible that Hamzah was taken prisoner by
pro-government forces or one of several rival factions within the
separatist movement that has been fighting for independence for
more than two decades.

<HEADLINE> Lucent names John Dickson president and CEO of its microelectronics unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) - Lucent Technologies Inc. said Wednesday
that John Dickson will become president and chief executive of the
company's microelectronics business when it is spun off into a
separate company next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson, 54, is currently executive vice president and chief
executive of Lucent's microelectronics and communications
technologies group. The unit makes silicon chips and optoelectronic
components such as lasers used to build the telephone, wireless and
Internet communications systems that Lucent sells. The business,
which has 16,000 employees, generated $4 billion in the last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said last month it would spin off the microelectronics
unit by spring.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McGinn, Lucent chairman and CEO, said Dickson has the
qualities needed to develop the new unit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working with John for the past few years has given me enormous
respect for his business insight, operational experience and
disciplined management style,'' said McGinn. ''He has essentially
defined a new segment of the semiconductor industry - the
fast-growing communications space - which the microelectronics
group now leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson joined Lucent in 1993 as vice president of the
integrated circuits division. He nearly tripled the unit's revenues
before being promoted to chief operating officer in December 1997.
He was named group president a month later.

<HEADLINE> Che Guevara Photo Shown in Vodka Ad  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Images of the late revolutionary leader Ernesto
''Che'' Guevara, with his long dark hair and intense gaze, are as
much a part of the daily scenery in Cuba as 1950s American cars and
children in Communist Pioneer uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of the Argentine-born doctor who fought in Fidel
Castro's successful 1959 revolution hang in police stations,
schools, medical clinics and government ration stores.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Guevara is not a faddish icon but a national hero old
communists revere and young boys and girls emulate. Schoolchildren
begin their classes each day by declaring: ''We will be like Che.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Cuban photographer who captured the world's most
famous image of Guevara discovered the picture was being used to
sell Smirnoff vodka, he supported efforts by a Cuban solidarity
group to sue on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am indignant that they have used his image to sell alcoholic
beverages,'' Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, 71, said in brief comments
before hanging up the telephone at his home in Cuba. Guevara, a
devoted Marxist, opposed any kind of commercialization and did not
drink.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Gutierrez, who goes by the professional name Alberto Korda,
declined to give a full interview, saying he has been overwhelmed
by calls from all over the world since a group calling itself the
Cuba Solidarity Campaign filed a claim on his behalf in London's
High Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused advertising agency Lowe Lintas and picture
agency Rex Features of trivializing the photo's historical
significance by superimposing it with a hammer and sickle motif.
The advertisement for spicy vodka used a chili pepper instead of
the sickle.
</P>
<P>
   The case is to be heard in London in late September.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners Worldwide said the
company, then known as Lowe Howard-Spink, acquired use of the
Guevara image through the Rex Features image agency in good faith
and paid a fee to Rex Features based on its usage in a small print
campaign that ran last year. Lowe Lintas denied infringement of any
copyright or moral rights.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the same image has appeared on posters and
T-shirts, but as long as it was used to promote Guevara's ideals,
neither Cuba's communist government nor Diaz Gutierrez has seemed
to have a problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   And while Guevara's image has been commercialized in recent
years for Cuba's tourist industry -- printed on everything from
cigarette lighters to beach towels -- Cubans maintain selling Che at
home is different.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many tourists buy products with Che's image because they have
sympathy for him as a person, for his ideals,'' said Roberto
Rodriguez, 58, a painter who charges $10 for small paintings based
on the same photograph used for the vodka advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Che was untouchable, human, a revolutionary,'' said Rodriguez,
standing in the open air market where he sells his paintings in Old
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   But using a portrait of Guevara to advertise alcohol is
''disagreeable, denigrating,'' he declared. ''Using Che's image to
sell vodka is like using it to advertise a bordello.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It really isn't correct,'' said Gerardo Espina, a vendor who
sells old books several blocks away. Although Espina said he is not
communist and was never a follower of Guevara, ''I really don't
like the idea of Che to sell vodka. It's disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph was taken March 5, 1960, at a memorial service
for more than 100 crew members of a Belgian arms cargo ship killed
in an attack Cuba blamed on U.S.-backed counterrevolutionary
forces. Diaz Gutierrez covered the ceremony as a photojournalist.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Guevara, wearing a black beret and a steely
stare, later became the world's best-known image of the man who
went on to promote armed revolution across Latin America and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Guevara linked up with Castro and other Cuban revolutionaries in
Mexico in the mid-1950s, becoming Castro's chief lieutenant in the
final years before the rebel victory.
</P>
<P>
   Later granted Cuban citizenship, Guevara assumed a lead role in
transforming the nation's economy after the revolution. He headed
Cuba's agrarian reform program and was president of the Bank of
Cuba and minister of industry.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote several books on guerrilla warfare and communist
theory, used by revolutionary movements worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Guevara later returned to the business of revolution, helping
organize left-wing rebels in the Congo and in Bolivia. He was
captured and killed by the Bolivian army on Oct. 8, 1967; his
remains were found and returned to Cuba three decades later.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 17; Nasdaq Up 43  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday with
technology stocks rising on a positive earnings report from the
widely-held bellwether Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 16.83 at 10,960.06.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 43.43 at 3,891.98, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 2.26 at 1,485.07.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what I call the every-other-day theory. Yesterday
blue-chip stocks were up and the techs were down,'' said Ralph
Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in Tampa,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would really be healthy is if both markets rose in
concert with one another. The fact that that isn't happening leads
me to think this is nothing more than a bear market rally,'' Bloch
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's quarterly revenues surged 61 percent as the Internet
networking giant beat Wall Street's earnings expectations by a
penny. Excluding one-time charges, Cisco earned $1.2 billion, or 16
cents per share in its fiscal fourth quarter, up from $710 million
or 10 cents per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted the San Jose-based company would earn 15
cents per share. The per-share figures reflect the 2-for-1 stock
split on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cisco rose $2.438 to $67.938.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco serves as a bellwether for the technology sector, having
emerged as one of the most stable high-tech companies in the
nation. Soaring demand for its switches, routers and fiber-optic
equipment has turned it into one of the most valuable companies in
the world, vying with Microsoft as the company with the largest
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that benefited from Cisco's solid earnings included
Internet parts makers JDS Uniphase, up $3.375 at $123.25, and
Intel, up $2.25 to $63.875.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip stocks fell despite a government report released on
Tuesday that showed Americans' productivity rose during the past
year at the fastest pace in 17 years while labor costs declined,
the first time they have dropped since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers were much better than expected, and economists
believe the encouraging figures make it unlikely that the Federal
Reserve will boost interest rates for a seventh time when the
central bank's Open Market Committee meets again Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 822.71 million shares, up from
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.70 at 509.42.

<HEADLINE> State, GOP to pay legal costs to put McCain on primary ballot  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state and New York's Republican Party
have agreed to each pay $200,000 to cover John McCain's legal costs
to get on the New York GOP's March presidential primary ballot,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayer burden comes after Gov. George Pataki and state GOP
Chairman Bill Powers unsuccessfully attempted to use New York's
burdensome ballot access law to keep everyone off the Republican
ballot except Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement was reached by all parties,'' said Lee
Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a federal judge ordered state GOP officials to put
McCain and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes on the ballot. Alan
Keyes was also allowed on some ballots across the state.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP spokesman Dan Allen said Wednesday that the party had
been ''put in the position where we're defending'' New York's
complex primary procedures. True, but the procedures are determined
by party leaders in the state in consultation with the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the federal court ruling, McCain's camp was allowed
to recoup legal costs from the state and the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The payments will go to McCain's legal team, who will the share
the money with New York University's Brennan Center for Justice,
which also worked on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state Republican Party also agreed to pay
$50,000 to the Forbes campaign and $40,000 to lawyers for Keyes,
said Lawrence Mandelker, trial counsel for the Republican State
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelker said the amount covering Forbes' legal fees was
determined in February during the trial. The settlements with
McCain and Keyes were reached at the end of July, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The total of $490,000 to be paid by the state and the Republican
Party will cover the legal fees for all three candidates, Mandelker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The story was first reported by the New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office did not immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Following the primary, Pataki proposed simplifying the ballot
access rules to allow all nationally recognized candidates onto the
GOP ballot. The measure would also allow New York Republicans to
vote directly for the candidates, not delegates, and make the
state's primary a winner-take-all contest.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal passed in the Republican-controlled state Senate
but died in the Democratic-led state Assembly, which cited concerns
that the winner-take-all provision might violate the federal Voting
Rights Act designed to protect minority interests.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Tense After Bombing Kills 7  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Officials rushed to reassure Russia's fearful
capital Wednesday, a day after a downtown explosion killed seven
people and reawakened memories of a 1999 bombing campaign that left
hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin urged Russians to remain calm, saying
''hysteria and disorganization (would be) the best gift for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   But worries were heightened when authorities found a bag filled
with nine pounds of TNT and seven detonators in an office at
Moscow's Kazansky railway station on Wednesday. The explosives were
not wired for detonation, but police were investigating a possible
link to Tuesday's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing under Pushkin Square came 11 months after a series
of apartment building bombings killed 300 people in several Russian
cities. The attacks were widely blamed on militants from Chechnya,
the breakaway republic in the southern Caucasus where rebels are
fighting Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investigators announced that two suspects -- one
from Chechnya and one from neighboring Dagestan -- had been detained
for questioning in Tuesday's bombing. But they later said the men
had been cleared of involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Especially anxious about a renewed terror campaign were those
working in Moscow's underground passages and in outside markets,
where a bomb could be left unnoticed amid the crowds and refuse.
Underground passages such as the one bombed Tuesday are unavoidable
in many parts of Moscow, providing the only way to cross
traffic-choked streets up to 12 lanes wide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally, I'm afraid,'' said Ludmila Petrovna, selling
cigarettes from two shopping bags in a passageway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always hard here. ... Today, the mood is very
frightened,'' she said, glancing at other women standing along the
wall selling clothes, household goods and puppies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be here, but I would be without bread,'' said
Anna Bakhmut, dusting her small display rack of shoes in the
Vuikhino outdoor market.
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin Square is a popular area for tourists. The neighborhood
is home to theaters, spacious parks and the McDonald's restaurant
that captured world attention when it opened in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, an underground passageway there was thronged with
pedestrians when a blast ripped through it. Blood-soaked people
stumbled out into the street as terrified passers-by watched. Seven
people were killed and more than 90 hurt.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, people left flowers in the square to mourn the dead
as city workers washed blood off the walls of the passageway, which
was reopened. Hundreds of people went to hospitals to donate blood
for the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 11 of the 93 wounded were in serious condition.
Among the injured were at least two Americans of Russian descent.
The U.S. Embassy identified them as Natalya Yelina, 35, and her son
Ilya, 13, but did not release their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Blame for the blast focused on Chechen rebels who have been
fighting Russian forces for the past year, and who are also blamed
for last year's apartment bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But police also could not exclude the possibility of Russian
criminals, who frequently bomb rivals. And a leading Chechen rebel
figure, Mumadi Saidayev, denied rebel responsibility for the
bombing and contended Russian authorities committed it to feed
anti-Chechen anger and justify continuing the military offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is news to us. We were not planning such actions in Moscow.
Unlike the Russian military, we do not fight with women and
children,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   People in Moscow who appear to be ethnic Chechens or from
elsewhere in the Caucasus region worried that increased passport
checks would thicken the suspicion that hangs around them.
Dark-complexioned people have long complained that police harass
them with document checks and hostile attitudes, especially after
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, it's going to get worse,'' said Ruslan Ismailov, an
Azerbaijaini running a shoe stall at Vuikhino. On Wednesday, police
''asked 'what are you doing here?' I said it is my place of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin urged people not to blame ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong to brand a whole people,'' he told reporters at
the Kremlin. ''Criminal and terrorists have neither nationality or
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Deputy Mayor Valery Shantsev said police patrols had been
increased in residential areas. City police said officers were
checking all vehicles coming into the city and had been ordered to
step up identification checks.

<HEADLINE> Former prosecutor sues Hynes over courthouse arrest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An ex-prosecutor has sued Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes, alleging her former boss falsely accused
her of trying to steal a wallet while his spokesman trashed her in
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other defendants named in the lawsuit brought by the
plaintiff, Ingrid Wyllie, are the spokesman, Kevin Davitt, and two
court officers who arrested her inside Brooklyn Criminal Court last
July on larceny charges. Although a grand jury found no basis for
the charges, Hynes fired her in March, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's very upset over the way she's been treated,'' her
attorney, Daniel Bianca, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca said no dollar amount had been set for damages. The suit,
filed in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn on June 29, demands
compensation for ''severe and permanent emotional, physical and
financial injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office, which is defending the court
officers, the district attorney and Davitt all declined to discuss
the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Wyllie's arrest, Davitt told reporters that the
court officers said they had spotted her rifling a paralegal's
knapsack in a courtroom where suspects are arraigned - a charge she
immediately denied. The suit alleges the spokesman defamed her by
saying she ''was pretty much caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyllie, 35, joined the district attorney's office in 1992. She
was being paid $56,000 at the time of her dismissal.

<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Expert economists will share the spotlight
when testimony resumes next week in the second phase of the Cayuga
Indian Nation's land claim damages trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn on Wednesday ordered a brief
adjournment until Monday after listening for two days as lawyers
gave their analysis of the testimony of University of Toronto
anthropologist Alexander von Gernet, the state's expert historical
witness.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn is hearing the case without a jury. He has required
lawyers to summarize the lengthy testimony of each of the expert
witnesses as he weighs historical and economic factors. He then
will decide whether to add interest to the $36.9 million award a
jury granted in February.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn ruled in 1994 that New York illegally acquired 64,027
acres of the Cayugas reservation land in Cayuga and Seneca counties
in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the tribe in violation of
the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act. That act required
Congressional approval for all Indian land transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Round two of the damages trial started July 17 and so far McCurn
has been presented with conflicting testimony. Historical experts
and two Cayuga representatives differed about whether New York
officials dealt fairly with the Cayugas.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week, he will hear testimony about how much
interest to which the Cayugas are entitled and how it should be
calculated.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayugas' expert economist, Peter Temin, will testify that
the state should pay $1.74 billion in interest, according to his
report filed with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Temin said he reached his total by using the Consumer Price
Index for the period dating back to 1913. For the period from 1795
to 1912, Temin said he used an index developed by two economic
scholars at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Temin said interest should be compounded for each of 204 years
since 1795.
</P>
<P>
   Mark P. Berkman, the U.S. Justice Department's expert economist,
has filed a report saying the interest should be $527.5 million.
Berkman based his calculations on the interest rate of U.S.
Treasury bills from 1795 to 2000, with a factor added for
inflation. He, too, said the interest should be compounded, but
added that deductions should be made for previous state payments.
</P>
<P>
   The state's expert economist is Richard Grossman, who will
testify that the state should not pay any interest.
</P>
<P>
   But, if that isn't possible, Grossman calculated the interest at
between $2.6 million to $12.1 million, contending it should be
applied only from 1974 at the earliest. That date was the first
year the Cayugas could have filed their lawsuit in federal court.
The lawsuit was filed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman will testify that interest should be simple, not
compounded. He said there is no need to adjust the award for
inflation because the jury already has.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Trial Said Risky  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chilean military commanders warned
Wednesday that putting Gen. Augusto Pinochet on trial could hurt
efforts to uncover the fates of people who disappeared during his
17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Pinochet could deter soldiers and officers who
were ready to come forward with information under a guarantee of
anonymity, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is happening to Gen. Pinochet, people become
suspicious as to what could happen to them if they provide
information,'' navy commander Adm. Jorge Arancibia said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court disclosed Tuesday it voted 14-6 to lift
Pinochet's congressional immunity, clearing the way for the former
dictator to face trial on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives of the missing, jubilant over the ruling, said if
the military continues to refuse help in determining the fate of
the missing, it won't be because of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they want is total impunity,'' Viviana Diaz, president of
an organization of relatives of the missing, told The Associated
Press. ''We know they have the information.''
</P>
<P>
   A government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared at the
hands of Pinochet's secret police after he toppled the country's
elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's military commanders reached an accord in June to seek
information about those who were arrested by Pinochet's security
forces and never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders warned Wednesday the Pinochet case could
have a chilling effect on the agreement, which was the outcome of a
nine-month dialogue on human rights involving the military, the
government and human rights lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Army commander Gen. Ricardo Izurieta said the court decision
struck a blow to ''the confidence that people may have had.''
</P>
<P>
   While saying they will uphold their side of the agreement, the
commanders said soldiers and former security agents who were ready
to speak up may change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   However, government spokesman Claudio Huepe said Wednesday
''there is no relation whatsoever between the ruling on Gen.
Pinochet and the agreement reached in the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Two right-wing opposition parties disagreed, issuing a joint
statement saying the ruling ''introduces new hurdles to efforts to
overcome the pain of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both parties then went to Pinochet's home Wednesday
to express their support. After the 15-minute meeting, a smiling
Pinochet and his wife, Lucia Hiriart, appeared at the main entrance
to bid the visitors farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has not directly commented on the ruling. On Wednesday,
the Santiago daily El Mercurio reported that Pinochet told a group
of retired generals: ''I swear you they will not make me bend.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is now in the hands of Judge Juan Guzman, who is
probing 157 criminal complaints against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman said he must study the ruling before deciding on his next
move. But he acknowledged he is legally bound to have Pinochet
examined by doctors to determine whether he is mentally fit to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's family has warned it will fight medical testing. His
son, Marco Antonio, has argued any exemption from trial on medical
grounds would deny Pinochet the venue for ''demonstrating his total
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, family and lawyers vowed to fight in court if a trial
begins.

<HEADLINE> Bounty Offered For Missing Computer  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department announced Wednesday a
$25,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of a missing
laptop computer that contains highly classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the department hopes the award
offer will generate leads. The computer disappeared in late January
from a sixth floor conference room in the department's Bureau of
Intelligence and Research. The FBI and the State Department's
Bureau of Diplomatic Security have been investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the laptop's disappearance is a ''potentially
serious breach of security.'' Other officials have said the
computer contained information on the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and on technologies for launching such weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the computer is a black Dell with a five-digit
serial number ending in the letter ''Q'' located on a sticker in
the back near the ports.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not been sure whether the laptop was stolen or
misplaced or, if it was stolen, whether it was taken for the
information it contained or merely for the value of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher was asked whether the announcement of a reward was not a
tip-off to those who have the computer that it contains classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people with nefarious goals took it, they probably know
what they've got already,'' he said. ''If people thought they were
just swiping a laptop or pawning it or fencing it, it doesn't
really matter to them what's on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latter case, the offer of a reward might encourage them
to turn it in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The laptop's disappearance is one of several security lapses
that prompted a comprehensive review of State Department security
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the State Department expelled a Russian diplomat,
Stanislav Borisovich Gusev, who was caught gathering information
from the department with an eavesdropping device.
</P>
<P>
   Also in December, an internal State Department audit found that
the department let visitors, contractors and maintenance workers
roam its building unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information about the laptop is encouraged to
contact the State Department at 202-647-7277.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Looking For New Senate Pres  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigerian lawmakers worked Wednesday to
come up with a replacement for Senate President Chuba Okadigbo, who
was voted out of office a day earlier following a probe that
uncovered evidence of widespread corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A vote to elect Okadigbo's replacement was postponed until
Thursday when members of the ruling People's Democratic Party
failed to agree on a nominee at a caucus meeting. Talks continued
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we are now set to redeem our image and begin to play
the role the nation expects from us,'' Sen. Oserhiemien Osunbor
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, senators voted 81-14 to dismiss Okadigbo after he
refused to resign from the post. He retains his Senate seat. Two
other top officials, the deputy Senate president and the
parliamentary majority leader, resigned earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption allegations sprang from public hearings conducted
by a Senate committee set up to investigate its own members. A
63-page report documented a range of crimes, including inflated
bills for equipment and services, kickbacks, illegal contracts and
bonuses totaling $7.3 million. Criminal charges could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Okadigbo is accused of involvement in awarding illegal contracts
worth $2.7 million, charges he denied in testimony last month
before the committee. He admitted receiving a $220,000 Christmas
bonus, though he claimed he neither requested nor approved the sum.
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded purchasing $370,000 worth of furniture for his
official residence when the Senate had only approved $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly was inaugurated after elections last year
that restored civilian rule and brought President Olusegun Obasanjo
to power. Obasanjo, whose election ended 15 years of military rule,
has made fighting rampant corruption a major objective of his
government.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Kill Six Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops killed six Chechen rebels
in a running gun battle after federal forces stumbled on a group of
insurgents planting mines on a country road, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The clash Tuesday near the Chechen village of Samashki began
when two armored personnel carriers used by Interior Ministry
troops were blown up by mines, an administrator in the pro-Moscow
Chechen administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian paramilitary troops rushed to the scene and discovered
about 15 militants laying more mines, the administrator said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said a rebel commander, Abu Khadzhiyev, and
five fighters were killed in the shootout. About 10 rebels escaped
into nearby hills.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials did not say whether their forces suffered any
losses.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian commander told NTV television news that Khadzhiyev
specialized in ambushing troops on the road, and that he had
previously evaded arrest by using the identification documents of
slain Russian policemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bandit Abu Khadzhiyev was on the wanted list and committed
12 murders of Interior Ministry employees. On this road he
committed murder many times,'' said Interior Minister commander
Mikhail Labunets.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a bloodied police identification card allegedly used
by Khadzhiyev to masquerade as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman with the Kremlin's information center for Chechnya
said rebels were planning new attacks on the capital Grozny and
other major towns in the republic, the Interfax news agency
reported. The spokesman said rebels were gathering in Chechnya's
southeastern Vedeno district in preparation for new attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have boosted security after warning of possible
attacks since Sunday, the fourth anniversary of the day in 1996
that rebels recaptured Grozny from Russian troops during the first
Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said increased security measures would remain
in effect for the next several days, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen gunmen fired on Russian positions nine times in the past
24 hours, the Russian military said Wednesday. The attacks included
four on checkpoints in Grozny, which the Russians have occupied
since February but never fully controlled.

<HEADLINE> Murder Charges Vs 3 German Skinheads  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A German court on Wednesday ordered a trial on
murder charges for three skinheads accused of beating and kicking
an African immigrant to death.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Miethbauer and Christian Richter, both 16, and Enrico
Hilprecht, 24, were charged in the June 11 attack on Alberto
Adriano, a 39-year-old immigrant from Mozambique who worked in a
slaughterhouse in the east German city of Dessau.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the three had been parading drunk through the
streets after midnight shouting neo-Nazi slogans when they came
across Adriano in a city park.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do you want here in Germany?'' one of them yelled before
they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the head with
heavy boots, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   After Adriano lost consciousness, the three pulled his clothes
off to humiliate him further, prosecutors say. Adriano, who came to
what was then communist East Germany in the 1980s as a contract
worker and remained after the reunification of Germany, died three
days later.
</P>
<P>
   The killing is part of a recent outbreak of hate crimes that has
German leaders scrambling to rally citizens, local officials and
courts against extremism. Some conservative opposition politicians
have suggested speeding up proceedings against neo-Nazi suspects
and expelling extremists from civil service jobs -- including police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   But Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's spokesman said Wednesday that
existing laws, which make public use of Nazi symbols and slogans a
crime, were enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point is to keep a cool head,'' Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
''The rightist hoodlums and murderous gangs are clearly a challenge
for our law-based state, but it's not too much to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state security officials agreed Wednesday to study
whether to outlaw the small, far-right National Democratic Party
for its agitation against foreigners and other minorities. However,
Interior Minister Otto Schily has already voiced reservations,
saying it could drive members underground and make them even more
militant.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder this week interrupted his vacation in Spain to call
for ''the full force of the law'' to thwart far-right violence. The
government has also vowed to fight neo-Nazis sites on the Internet,
while pointing out that most are registered outside of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Reports this week that a German army staff sergeant had applied
for the Web address www.heil-hitler.de added to pressure on
officials. According to Wednesday's Bild tabloid, the 28-year-old,
identified only as Ralf K., denied all charges when questioned by
his superior officers.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Ministry spokesman called the incident an isolated
case. Reports of extreme-right activity in the military have been
declining since 1998, spokesman Wolfgang Fett said.
</P>
<P>
   In the slain Mozambican's case, federal prosecutors had sought
murder charges last month. The charges were approved Wednesday by
the state court in Naumburg, with the trial to begin Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The two 16-year-olds will be tried as juveniles, meaning a
maximum sentence upon conviction of 10 years. The 24-year-old could
get up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The first neo-Nazi killing in years was recorded in 1999, and
three have occurred so far this year: In addition to Adriano, two
homeless men were beaten and kicked to death last month by
neo-Nazis in northern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to get tough on violence against foreigners have mounted
in the two weeks since an explosion at a Duesseldorf train station
injured 10 recent immigrants, six of them Jewish. Police have not
yet offered a motive for the bombing, however.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Fail to ID Pope Gunman  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Two witnesses testifying in the robbery
trial of the gunman who shot Pope John Paul II said they were not
able to identify the defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the two men changed their story after
earlier identifying Mehmet Ali Agca, but one of the witnesses said
last month that he feared for his life if he named Agca.
</P>
<P>
   Agca is thought to have been close to an ultranationalist group,
the Gray Wolves, which has a history of violence. He is admired by
some right-wing extremists, who consider him a patriot who fought
leftists in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty years have gone by. I cannot remember,'' Yakup Altintas
told the court in the third session of Agca's trial on robbery
charges. Altintas was 15 when Agca allegedly robbed the jewelry
shop where Altintas worked.
</P>
<P>
   The second witness, Huseyin Gursoy, claimed he could not see the
men who robbed the soda factory where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was standing behind the door, I couldn't see anything,''
Gursoy said, although he had described the gunman and incidents in
detail during his police interrogation at the time of the 1979
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Both witnesses refrained from making eye contact with Agca
during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Agca was extradited to Turkey in June when Italy pardoned him
after he served almost 20 years for the 1981 shooting of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Agca has rejected accusations that he was involved in the 1979
robberies of a soda plant and a jewelry store and the theft of a
getaway car. Agca, who is already serving 10 years in prison for
killing a liberal newspaper editor, faces between 15 and 30 more
years in prison if convicted on the new charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that Agca released through his lawyers Wednesday,
Agca kept up his attacks against the Vatican, claiming the Holy See
had offered him money to publicly convert to Catholicism in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''They offered me $50 million to sell my freedom, belief... and
offered me a cardinalship if I became a Catholic in the heart of
the Vatican, where the Pope was shot, in front of the whole
world,'' Agca's letter read.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I did not betray God... I, Mehmet Ali Agca, would rather
be a monkey in the African jungles than a king in the Vatican,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Agca released during his hearing last month, he
accused the Vatican of being the ''enemy of God and humanity'' and
called on the pope to resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers said the outburst was a calculated attempt to
win favor with Turkish nationalists and fundamentalists in the hope
of receiving some kind of clemency. A far-right party is the senior
partner in Turkey's governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Agca was brought to court under tight security. Snipers guarded
rooftops, and armored personnel carriers were stationed around the
Istanbul courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected a demand by Agca's lawyers to halt that trial
for the jewelry robbery case. The lawyers argued that under Agca's
extradition agreement with Italy, the gunman can only be tried for
the soda factory robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Trial was adjourned until Sept. 8.

<HEADLINE> Jews Mark Destruction of Temples  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- History, religion and politics mixed
uncomfortably Wednesday as thousands of Jews gathered in the Old
City of Jerusalem for the annual day of sorrow over the destruction
of the biblical Temples.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is the Temple Mount, site of King Solomon's Temple,
destroyed by Babylon 586 B.C., and the Second Temple, ravaged in
the Roman invasion of A.D. 70. According to Jewish tradition, both
holy structures fell on the ninth day of the Jewish month of Av.
</P>
<P>
   The hill where holy Jewish temples once stood is now the site of
the Dome of the Rock shrine and Al Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest
site in Islam. The issue of control over Jerusalem and its holy
sites scuttled a summit meeting outside Washington last month
between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, who were trying to reach a
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jews chanted from the Book of Lamentations at the
Western Wall just below the hill, the last remnant of the Temple
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Green, an Israeli group that opposes any concessions to
the Arabs, led a march around the walls of the Old City, protesting
compromises Prime Minister Ehud Barak was reportedly willing to
offer the Palestinians in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The irony is that when millions of Jews are commemorating the
destruction of Jerusalem,'' said Nadia Matar, a leader of the
group, ''our Jewish political leaders are planning another
destruction of Jerusalem along with our enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-week summit outside Washington broke down over the issue
of Jerusalem. Barak reportedly offered the Palestinians control
over Arab neighborhoods in the city but not sovereignty over the
Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Israel took control of the hill in the 1967 Mideast war, along
with the rest of the Arab section of Jerusalem. Two weeks later,
the Israeli parliament annexed the newly captured areas and
declared all of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid confrontations with Muslims, the Israelis turned
day-to-day control over the Temple Mount to the Wakf, the Supreme
Islamic Council, which administers Muslim holy sites.

<HEADLINE> Elvis' Death Vigil Going Digital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The King is going digital on the 23rd
anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
   A global audience will be able to go online and tune in to the
annual candlelight vigil that commemorates the Aug. 16, 1977 death
of Elvis Presley, who died at age 42 of heart disease worsened by
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley Enterprises representatives say surveys show about
half of Presley's fans are under age 35 and are more likely to be
connected to the Internet than older fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday event, billed as a ''vigilcast,'' will be broadcast
on a Web site launched Wednesday (www.elvispresley.com). Cameras
will be set up on the grounds of Graceland and in the plaza across
the street from the Presley estate.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site welcomes visitors with a videolike montage of
Elvis performing decade-by-decade with introductory audio of his
'50s hit ''Hound Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The vigil attracts crowds of up to 50,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Anti-smoking activists, state react to surgeon general's report  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Activists critical of the state's
anti-smoking campaign pointed to a report released Wednesday by
Surgeon General David Satcher as evidence that Connecticut is not
spending enough of its tobacco settlement money on programs.
</P>
<P>
   But officials with the state Office of Policy and Management say
the state is doing more than its fair share of tobacco education
and prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on reducing tobacco use, Satcher said states should
be spending 20 to 25 percent of the settlement money on
anti-smoking campaigns. So far, states plan to spend about 10
percent of tobacco companies' first 25-year payment - $8 billion in
all - on smoking prevention programs, according to a report issued
last month by the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The report was unveiled at the 11th World Conference on Tobacco
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut has virtually no funding for any element of a
comprehensive tobacco control plan,'' said Ellen Dornelas,
co-chairman of Mobilize Against Tobacco for Children's Health, an
anti-smoking coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The state has spent just $5 million of the $150 million it
received in the 1999-2000 fiscal year on anti-smoking programs,
said Dornelas, director of behavioral health programs for
preventive cardiology at Hartford Hospital. The state will receive
a total of $3.6 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Moore, an OPM undersecretary, said $20 million of the
settlement money has been set aside for the anti-smoking campaign
in both the 1999-2000 and the 2000-01 fiscal years. A board of
trustees is in the process of being appointed to oversee how the
money is spent, she said. The panel is set to report its
recommendations to the Legislature in February.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, state education officials unveiled a new multimedia
anti-smoking program. Called Science, Tobacco &AMP; You, the program
incorporates digital photography, computer modeling and hands-on
activities to show students the effects of tobacco on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The optional program, which cost the state $1 million, will be
offered to schools at no cost and is expected to be in 1,100
fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state has stepped up to the plate in a more than adequate
fashion,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dornelas said the state has not done enough. She described
the school program as ''a little one-shot deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's designed to be added on to an existing curriculum,'' she
said. ''In Connecticut, that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornelas said a comprehensive plan would include insurance
reimbursement for smoking cessation programs, an anti-smoking media
campaign, enforcement of cigarette sales to minors and programs to
help pregnant women stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Between 33 and 35 percent of Connecticut high school seniors
smoke, Dornelas said, and 16 percent of fourth- and fifth-graders
in the state have tried at least one cigarette.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Pataki signs comprehensive gun law and raises age for permit  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday signed
into law a sweeping gun-control bill that requires mandatory
trigger locks, ballistic ''fingerprinting'' to better track weapons
and background checks on gun buyers at gun shows in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something the rest of the nation should take a look
at,'' Pataki said. ''I hope this serves as a model.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new law, New York becomes the first state in the nation
to deal with a loophole in the federal Brady Law, which requires
that gun sales by federally licensed firearms deals must be
accompanied by a background check. Sales at gun shows currently do
not require such checks, however, unless the firearms are sold by a
federally licensed dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The new state law closes the loophole, and violators will face a
misdemeanor charge and a fine of up to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called the new law ''a commonsense measure'' to keep New
York safer by helping to keep guns out of the hands of criminals
and children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each year more New Yorkers are killed by guns than die in car
crashes,'' Pataki said at the bill-signing ceremony in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The law's centerpiece, dubbed the ''Gun DNA'' program by the
governor, would require New York handgun dealers and manufacturers
who sell to dealers in the state to submit shell casings from the
test firing of guns in their inventories to the state police's
forensic lab. Computerized images of the casings would serve as
''fingerprints'' for firearms and be kept on file.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities would check the database against bullets and casings
recovered at scenes of gun violence to track the guns. The barrels
of +guns+ leave telltale markings on bullets and shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   The law also raises the legal age for purchasing handguns in New
York state from 18 to 21, bans all assault weapons listed under a
1994 federal law and makes it a Class D violent felony - punishable
by up to seven years in prison - to possess or sell any banned
assault weapon. In addition, all stolen or lost guns must be
reported to police within 24 hours of their disappearance
</P>
<P>
   Pataki stressed that the legislation is aimed at those engaged
in illegal activity and not those who own guns to protect their
homes, families or for hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor was joined at the news conference at the
Garden City railroad station by Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn
McCarthy, a strong advocate of stricter gun-control laws ever since
her husband was killed and her son critically wounded by a gunman
who went on a shooting rampage on a Long Island Rail Road train in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York has taken a courageous stand here,'' McCarthy said.
''Today is a victory for not only the victims of crimes but for
those who have not been victims.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan to hold up Governor Pataki's bill on the floor of the
House, and say, 'Look what can be done if we work together,'''
McCarthy said. ''The time has come for gun-safety legislation on a
national level and New York has shown the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Murphy, a New York City police officer whose
11-year-old son was accidentally killed in 1997 by a friend playing
with a gun, was present to show her support of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great day for me,'' Murphy said. ''It means my son did
not die in vain.''

<HEADLINE> CIA: China Expanded Missile Role  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China expanded its role in helping Pakistan
develop missiles last year and had a hand in missile development in
North Korea, Iran and Libya, according to a CIA report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the spread of technology for building ballistic
missiles -- especially to countries deemed hostile to the United
States -- is a major foreign policy goal of the Clinton
administration. The CIA report is a reminder that even economically
distressed countries such as North Korea are eager to acquire
missile know-how, and that major suppliers like China take a
different view of what constitutes prudent technology exports.
</P>
<P>
   China has pledged not to export whole missile systems and denies
selling them to Pakistan. But it has declined to sign the
international Missile Technology Control Regime or abide by its ban
on sales of missile components.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese have taken a very narrow interpretation of their
nonproliferation commitment,'' the CIA report said.
</P>
<P>
   In talks last month in Beijing, John Holum, the State
Department's top arms control official, failed to resolve
differences over Chinese aid to Pakistan's missile program. The
talks marked a resumption of an arms control dialogue that China
cut off after the United States bombed its embassy in Yugoslavia in
May 1999 during the Kosovo air war. China did not accept the U.S.
explanation that the attack was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said Wednesday
that senior U.S. and Chinese arms control officials resumed the
discussions this week in Honolulu. ''Some additional progress has
been made in these discussions, but I would say the missile issues
remain unresolved,'' Boucher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is growing in Congress for President Clinton to crack
down on China's missile technology sales. Proposed legislation in
the Senate calls for monitoring China's weapons proliferation and
for possible sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA report, first disclosed in Wednesday's editions of the
Washington Times, is the latest in a series required by Congress to
monitor the spread of technology useful for the development or
production of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The unclassified report covered the period from July 1 through
Dec. 31, 1999. It was submitted to Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese missile-related technical assistance to Pakistan
increased during this reporting period,'' the report said. ''In
addition, firms in China provided missile-related items, raw
materials and/or assistance to several countries of proliferation
concern -- such as Iran, North Korea and Libya.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinese Embassy in Washington, spokesman Zhang Yuanyuan
said ''China does not have a policy of exporting technology for
weapons of mass destruction.'' He questioned the reliability of the
CIA's intelligence. ''The CIA makes a lot of mistakes,'' he said,
noting the spy agency's role in the embassy bombing in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The report provided no specifics on Chinese assistance to
Pakistan. It noted that Beijing pledged in May 1996 to halt
assistance to Pakistani nuclear programs that are not under
international control, but added, ''We cannot preclude ongoing
contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, China pledged not to engage in any new nuclear
cooperation with Iran, beyond two ongoing nuclear projects -- a
small research reactor and a zirconium production facility at
Esfahan that the CIA said Iran intends to use to produce cladding
for reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pledge appears to be holding,'' the CIA report said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said it found evidence that Iran last year continued to
seek Chinese assistance for its chemical weapons program. ''It is
unclear to what extent these efforts have succeeded,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA report described Iran as one of the most active
countries seeking foreign technology for weapons of mass
destruction. Iran is trying to develop a home-grown capability to
produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and missiles to
deliver them, it said. Its chief suppliers during the second half
of 1999 were Russia, China, North Korea and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government says its nuclear program is for civilian
energy development, not military use. The CIA report called this a
''guise'' under which it is seeking to obtain facilities that ''in
fact could be used in any number of ways in support of efforts to
produce fissile material needed for a nuclear weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that although North Korea last year tried to buy
foreign technology that could have uses in its nuclear program,
''we do not know of any procurement directly linked to the nuclear
weapons program.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Mesh Better for Hernia Scar  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   When a surgical scar pops open in an abdominal
muscle, mesh is
better than new stitches to repair the damage, a new study says.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A break in an old surgical repair is among a number of reasons
that organs, usually the intestines, push out through the muscles
that usually hold them back, creating a bulge beneath the skin. The
condition is known as a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   If the intestines cannot be pushed back into place, they may
become twisted, cutting off the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Hernias at old incisions can be repaired by stitching them up
again, or by sewing a patch of surgical mesh on either side of the
break, overlapping the patches, and sewing them together.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in seven Dutch hospitals assigned 200 hernia patients at
random to get one operation or the other. Twenty-four had to be
dropped from follow-up for one reason or another.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, surgeons had to make yet another repair in
46 percent of the 95 patients who had been stitched together,
according to a study in Thursday's edition of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Only 23 percent of the 85 mesh repairs broke open again, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Heart Attack Approach  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   A clot-busting drug that is standard treatment for heart attacks
is less effective than a new technique in which surgeons put a
small mesh tube in an artery and give the patient ''super
aspirin,'' a study indicates.
</P>
<P>
   The new method worked better because it saved more of the heart,
doctors said, but it may not be practical in the United States
because few hospitals are equipped to insert the tube quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, published in Thursday's edition of the New England
Journal of Medicine, doctors at the Deutsches Herzzentrum (German
Heart Center) found that after six months, 8.5 percent of the
patients given the the two-part treatment had died or had a stroke
or another heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   That compared to 23.2 percent of those who got the clot-buster
ATP, Dr. Albert Schoemig wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The new treatment limited damage to an average of 14.3 percent
of the left ventricle, the muscular chamber that pumps blood out to
the body, compared with 19.4 percent damage in ATP-treated hearts.
</P>
<P>
   With only 140 patients, the study is small, but it was the first
ever comparing the treatments, and the results were ''very
provocative,'' said Dr. Eric Topol of The Cleveland Clinic
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it brings up now is whether we have reached a new
standard of care,'' he said. More and larger trials are needed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. hospitals may not be able to get the German team's
results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any U.S. hospital can give a dose of clot dissolver. But
far fewer are equipped to install stents -- small mesh tubes
designed to keep arteries open -- especially at off hours when
angioplasty and backup surgical teams are not available.
</P>
<P>
   Topol said most U.S. hospitals have to call in a special team to
insert a heart catheter and the stent. It usually takes 1&AMP;frac12; to two
hours after a heart attack patient shows up to unblock the artery,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, he said, it may make more sense to give a
half-dose of a clot-buster plus the ''super-aspirin,'' called
abciximab, when the patient arrives, with the stent inserted as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Like aspirin, abciximab keeps platelets and proteins from
clumping, but it is much stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Topol said his hospital is starting a 3,000-patient test
comparing Schoemig's treatment with his proposed refinement.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Very Premature Babies  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Half of all extremely premature babies who survive are mentally
or physically disabled, a quarter of them severely so, a new study
shows.
</P>
<P>
   As daunting as that sounds, it is better than most experts had
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The lead researcher, Dr. Neil Marlow of the University of
Nottingham, England, had expected to find that about 40 percent of
such premature babies wind up with severe disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He studied all 4,004 babies born before the 26th week of
pregnancy over 10 months in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Only 308 survived after being sent home, Marlow wrote in
Thursday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were able to follow 300 of the children about 2&AMP;frac12;
years after what would have been their birthdays had they been born
at full term. Another six were checked out a year after what would
have been their full-term birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The study said 155 had no problems -- though some problems caused
by prematurity, including hyperactivity and learning and motor
difficulties, may not show up until age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Since the babies all were born in 1995, Marlow and his
colleagues are about to start another round of assessment this
fall, when the children start school.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is when it starts to get really interesting,'' he said in
an interview. ''We don't have a huge amount of information on this
particularly immature group as they get older.''
</P>
<P>
   The disabilities shown by the children at age 2&AMP;frac12; included
general slowness in mental growth, seizures and problems walking,
sitting, using their hands, seeing, hearing and communicating.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of disability was no greater for the children born at
22 weeks than those born at 25 weeks -- another surprise for the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's quite useful to know,'' Marlow said. ''It means you
don't treat them differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys were more likely than girls to have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. F. Sessions Cole, a professor of pediatrics at Washington
University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study, said it
is the first report that lets parents know the chances of life for
a baby born before 26 weeks, as well as what happens to surviving
babies.
</P>
<P>
   He said many parents believe that babies below a certain weight
cannot survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents in general feel that if there's any chance that any
baby's going to be normal, it's going to be their baby,'' he said.
''It'll influence many parents to hope.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regrets End of India Truce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department expressed deep regret
Wednesday over the decision of a Kashmiri militant group to call
off a cease-fire with India.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire called July 24 by Hezb-ul Mujahedeen had raised
hopes for a peaceful outcome to the Kashmir conflict but the group
called off the truce on Tuesday, blaming India.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen may have been at fault by insisting on a new condition
after the cease-fire and offer of dialogue was announced and
accepted by India.
</P>
<P>
   ''Specifically, the August 8 deadline for tripartite talks
including Pakistan was added afterward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to urge all sides to resume this dialogue in the
interest of pursuing peace in Kashmir, and between India and
Pakistan,'' Boucher said. ''We believe that the Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen-Indian dialogue was simply not given enough time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there cannot be a solution to the Kashmir issue
without direct discussions between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order for such discussions to take place, however, a
climate of trust must be created through sincere efforts to end the
violence and, of course, taking the wishes of the Kashmiri people
into account.''

<HEADLINE> MRIs Can Help Plan Babies' Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   If a baby needs surgery immediately after birth,
doctors can
plan for it by using MRIs to produce detailed 3-D images that let
them look inside the womb, according to a new report in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors in Boston used MRIs to get images of twins joined from
chest to belly and see details unavailable by ultrasound -- details
needed to separate them quickly and save the one who had a chance
at life.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the use of the MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging,
could prove effective not only in preparing for successful twin
separations in the future, but for other operations immediately
after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound had shown doctors that only one of the conjoined
twins had a heart, and that their livers were fused together, Dr.
Errol R. Norwitz of Brigham and Women's Hospital wrote in
Thursday's issue of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   The MRIs showed details needed to separate the pair quickly
enough to save the twin with a heart, including precisely where the
babies were joined and the exact placement of internal organs.
Doctors successfully separated the twins' livers.
</P>
<P>
   Conjoined twins occur anywhere from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 100,000
births.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks prices were mixed Wednesday as a solid

</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 71.76 at 10,909.13,
according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 8.91 at 3,857.46, after rising more than 70 points early in
the session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 11.81 at
1,470.99.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what I call the every-other-day theory. Yesterday
blue-chip stocks were up and the techs were down,'' said Ralph
Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in Tampa,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would really be healthy is if both markets rose in
concert with one another. The fact that that isn't happening leads
me to think this is nothing more than a bear market rally,'' Bloch
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's quarterly revenues surged 61 percent as the Internet
networking giant beat Wall Street's earnings expectations by a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco serves as a bellwether for the technology sector, having
emerged as one of the most stable high-tech companies in the
nation. Soaring demand for its switches, routers and fiber-optic
equipment has turned it into one of the most valuable companies in
the world, vying with Microsoft as the company with the largest
market capitalization. Shares of Cisco rose $2.313 to $67.813.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that benefited from Cisco's solid earnings included
Internet parts maker JDS Uniphase, up $1.25 at $121.125.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet stocks took another hit Wednesday when an analyst
at New York brokerage house Sanford Bernstein opened coverage of
the online retailer at a rating of underperform, meaning the
analyst doesn't expect Amazon's stock to perform as well as the
broader market. Amazon's shares fell $2.063 to $30.875.
</P>
<P>
   Other big name Internet stocks followed suit, including
Priceline.com, down $2.375 at $25.625.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks helped drag down the Dow index after a court ruling
that could make it easier for a rival company to sell a generic
version of Eli Lilly's Prozac antidepressant drug. Shares of Eli
Lilly fell $30.923 to $77.625.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, blue chip stocks fell despite a government report
released on Tuesday that showed Americans' productivity rose during
the past year at the fastest pace in 17 years while labor costs
declined, the first time they have dropped since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers were much better than expected, and economists
believe the encouraging figures made it unlikely that the Federal
Reserve will boost interest rates for a seventh time when the
central bank meets again Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.05 billion shares, up from
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.08 at 507.64.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman criticized for support of military spending  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Peace activists critical of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman's support of the defense industry - a major Connecticut
employer since the Civil War - say his hawkish record may drive
left-leaning Democrats to Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that track defense-related voting records and campaign
donations give Lieberman poor to middling marks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no other Democrat within shooting range of Joe
Lieberman with the weapons lobby,'' said Van Gosse, organizing
director of Peace Action. ''Lieberman is the weapons lobby's best
friend in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The group gave Lieberman 38 out of 100 for his votes last year.
Lieberman, a supporter of a national missile defense program, voted
against Peace Action when it came to military spending but got
points for supporting nuclear test-ban treaty bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign
donations, reports Lieberman has received $100,700 for the 2000
election from defense industry employees and political action
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Second on his donor list with $33,500 in contributions are the
PACs and employees of Hartford-based United Technologies Corp. UTC
divisions make Black Hawk helicopters and Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet
engines for military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Also a top donor: General Dynamics, builder of the Seawolf and
other submarines with a shipyard at Groton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Another peace group, Council for a Livable World, has had a
change of heart about Lieberman since he was elected in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 100 percent with the group early, his score fell
as low as 15 percent in 1993, when he supported the Seawolf, loan
guarantees for exporting weapons, President Bush's Star Wars
defense program and the military budget.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the group gave him a 57 percent score.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was a hawk during the Gulf War in 1991 and called for
''final victory'' over Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is home to many small arms manufacturers, including
Colt Inc., which made firearms for the Union army during the Civil
War. The state has always been affected by the defense industry,
especially during the recession of the early 1990s, said Scott
McLean, a Quinnipiac University professor of political science.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for Lieberman, said the senator's
record reflects the wishes of his constituents and his desire for a
strong national defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's proud of the work he's done to preserve the high-paying,
quality jobs at several leading employers in this state. He's not
ashamed of that one bit,'' Gerstein said. ''These jobs are vital to
Connecticut's economy and critically important to national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's voting record on key defense issues is nearly
identical to that of his colleague, Sen. Chris Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   McLean said: ''Just because a politician in this state supports
the defense industry does not mean they're hawkish - it's just good
old-fashioned politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Marder of New Haven, the president of the U.S. Peace Council,
said talk of Lieberman's high moral standards does not wash with
his defense record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doesn't morality also include preventing the deaths of a
million Iraqi children from embargo and sanctions?'' Marder asked.
</P>
<P>
   For liberal Democrats who wanted Gore's vice presidential pick
to lean to the left, Lieberman disappoints.
</P>
<P>
   Some peace activists said they will urge the Gore-Lieberman
ticket to repudiate support for missile defense systems and other
big military projects.
</P>
<P>
   Others may go to Nader, a consumer activist and critic of the
major political parties who gets about 5 percent of the support in
national polls. That could take votes away from Gore and help Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in a close election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lieberman does not assuage the liberal part of the party,''
said John Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein said Gore and Lieberman ''are right where the heart of
the American people are.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to sacrifice national security to also invest
in education, the environment, health care,'' Gerstein said.

<HEADLINE> Stock fraud defendant indicted in hit plot on judge  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former brokerage executive who is in jail on
stock fraud charges has been indicted for allegedly hiring a hitman
to kill the Manhattan judge who is hearing his case.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, unsealed Wednesday, alleges that Stuart Winkler
of Morganville, N.J., arranged with a fellow jail inmate sometime
in June to have State Supreme Court Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder
slain.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, 47, wanted to get rid of Snyder, who is known as a
no-nonsense judge and a tough sentencer, so that another judge
could be assigned to his case, prosecutors said. They said Snyder
was told about the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was his view that if he had Judge Snyder killed, he could
get a judge who would set more favorable bail conditions,''
Assistant District Attorney Daniel McGillicuddy told Justice Arlene
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   In recorded conversations, allegedly between Winkler and the
informant-hitman, the defendant says, ''This is going to happen.
This is going to happen. I just don't want to screw this up,'' the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence against this defendant is rock solid,'' he told
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's lawyer, Jack T. Litman, suggested that the informant
could be lying. He said McGillicuddy was quoting ''an inmate who is
trying to work his way out of something by proposing something to
this man (Winkler).''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, already held on $1 million cash bail on the stock fraud
case, pleaded innocent Wednesday to murder conspiracy and criminal
solicitation. The judge remanded him without bail and set Sept. 12
as his next court date.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg also limited Winkler's contact with other inmates and
visitors, and restricted his telephone calls to his wife, three
children and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is the most protected judge in Manhattan. Due to threats
on her life during the trials of murderous drug gangs over the past
several years, court officers posted outside her courtroom search
everyone who enters.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had no comment on Winkler's alleged plot. David
Bookstaver, spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said
it is now unlikely that Snyder will preside over Winkler's stock
fraud case.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Winkler, his firm, and 48 other people were
indicted in July 1999 on a charge of enterprise corruption for
taking part in a massive securities fraud while he was chief
financial officer at A.S. Goldmen Co. of Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler and the others were accused of bilking investors, many
of them elderly, out of some $100 million by lying to them,
executing unauthorized trades, ignoring their sell orders, forgery
and outright theft.
</P>
<P>
   When Winkler was arraigned before Snyder in that case, she set
bail at $1 million bond. He posted the bond and was released.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler was rearrested for violating his bail conditions because
he chartered a private airplane during the 1999 Christmas holiday
period and took his family and some friends to the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder changed his bail to $1 million cash, which he was unable
to post, and he has been in jail since.
</P>
<P>
   While jailed, the indictment alleges, Winkler gave the intended
hitman the telephone number of a company that would arrange payment
for the murder, McGillicuddy said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Winkler also gave the would-be killer a code to use with
regard to the timing of the murder; provided him with information
about Snyder's security arrangements, and told him when her
vacation was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler in turn received the name and telephone number of a
third party who was to act as the hitman's intermediary for payment
and messages related to the intended murder.
</P>
<P>
   Under charges related to the securities case, Winkler faces up
to 25 years in prison for enterprise corruption, the top count in
that indictment, if he is convicted. He faces another 25 years in
prison if convicted on the murder conspiracy charge.

<HEADLINE> Arafat To Ask Iran Pres For Meeting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will ask
Iran's president Thursday to convene a meeting of Islamic states to
back him on the issue of Jerusalem, the official Iranian news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's visit to Tehran is his next stop on a rapid tour of
Middle Eastern states designed to garner support for the
Palestinian claim of sovereignty over east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, too, has been trying secretly to drum up support for its
position on the city by sending an envoy to Gulf states, an Israeli
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who met Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
in Cairo, was pleased with the substantial backing he had received
from Arab states so far, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa urged Israel to show flexibility in negotiations with the
Palestinians. Their talks at Camp David last month foundered on the
issue of Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war
and has vowed to retain as an undivided city.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one should imagine that an Arab or Islamic or any state
with a sense of justice would ask (Arafat) to relinquish Jerusalem
for the sake of Israel. Why?'' Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who will be making only his second visit Thursday to
Tehran in 20 years, will ask President Mohammad Khatami to call an
urgent meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to
discuss Jerusalem, the Islamic Republic News Agency said in a
report received in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami is the current chairman of the 54-state organization.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli newspaper Maariv said a top aide to
Prime Minister Ehud Barak made a secret trip last weekend to Gulf
countries to ask for help in negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yatom, Barak's chief policy adviser, spoke to officials in
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, asking them to press
Arafat to show more flexibility, Maariv reported.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office would not comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf states do not have diplomatic relations with Israel,
though some have opened trade missions in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak offered the Palestinians limited control
over areas of east Jerusalem, but Arafat demanded full sovereignty
over that sector of the city, which contains the third holiest
shrine in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have announced plans to declare an independent
state on Sept. 13 with east Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Navy simulator instructors end strike in Pensacola area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) - About 80 Lockheed Martin flight simulator
instructors began returning to work at two Navy bases Wednesday
after settling a monthlong strike over wages, guaranteed weekly pay
and scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors accepted a three-year contract raising pay a total
of 10 percent Tuesday night, said Jeff Smith, a district
representative for the Machinists union.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's a good, fair and equitable settlement for all
parties,'' said Wendy Owen, spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin
Technology Services in Cherry Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Hourly pay of $26.11 will increase 3.5 percent a year in the
first two years of the contract and 3 percent in the final year.
The agreement also guarantees pay for an average of 31 hours per
week in the first year and 32 hours in later years.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a guaranteed weekly wage was a key issue that led to
the walkout, Smith said. Another was that instructors had to wait
until 8 p.m. daily before getting final notification whether to
report to work the next day. The new contract changes the time to 4
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was not expected to reduce the number of aviators
getting their wings during the current fiscal year, but the effect
on the new year beginning Oct. 1 is still being assessed, said Jim
Rostohar, spokesman for the Naval Aviation Training Command in
Corpus Christi, Texas. Flight training can take a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy last year trained 900 navigators at Pensacola Naval Air
Station and 650 pilots at Whiting Field east of Pensacola. The
numbers include Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard students
who train at the two bases.

<HEADLINE> Burundians Bury Ambush Victims  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Thousands of Burundians, some sobbing
and others collapsing under the scorching sun, circled 27 freshly
dug graves Wednesday to mourn army cadets killed in a rebel ambush
that has dimmed hopes for a quick solution to the country's
7-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel attack Sunday on a truck and a bus carrying the cadets
back to the capital Bujumbura from a handball game in the country's
south, left 34 dead -- including six civilians -- and raised fears of
a renewed round of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush marked the first time since the start of the war
''the army has lost so many people at once, young strong people who
are the future of the country,'' Defense Minister Col. Cyrille
Ndayirukiye said at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead were Tutsis, who have controlled the army since
independence from Belgium in 1962, but Hutus were among the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in Burundi
since the war erupted in 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated
the country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hutu rebels have mounted a campaign of ambushes and
attacks that draw reprisals from the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
   Former South African President Nelson Mandela, who is mediating
peace talks, has proposed a power-sharing agreement to end the war
that he hopes will be signed by Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   But both the rebels and the government express doubts that an
accord can be reached that soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral for the 27 cadets, attended by around 5,000
people, including President Pierre Buyoya, there was little hope
that peace was coming soon to the tiny central African nation amid
bitterness over the killings.
</P>
<P>
   One Tutsi mother broke into tears as she buried two of her sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the Hutus) are killing us gradually. It would be best if
we could just die together,'' said a Tutsi school teacher, Phoebe
Gakima, who lost a cousin in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The six civilians slain in the attack were buried separately.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, more than 50 people, mostly Hutus, were killed in an
attack in Ruyigi in eastern Burundi, for which the rebels and the
army have blamed each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is quite surprising really. More than 50 people were killed
in Ruyigi and the government never condemned the killings. Now, a
few military officers die and everyone is outraged,'' said Gaudence
Nkundwanabake, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen Burundian political parties and interest groups met in
Arusha, Tanzania, this week to try to overcome differences and meet
the deadline set by Mandela for the signing of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal centers on making the army 50 percent Hutu and 50
percent Tutsi, an amnesty for those accused of killings and a
three-year transition period for implementing the changes.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It was the last night of Bruce Springsteen's
triumphant world tour - 16 sold-out months on the road with the
reunited E Street Band. The Boss and his sidekicks, teary-eyed,
held hands as the Madison Square Garden crowd screamed wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be seeing you!'' Springsteen proclaimed after playing
their last song - quite appropriately, ''Blood Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   But when?
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   On a live album? A new studio album? A DVD of the Garden shows?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? When it comes to Springsteen, who ever knows?
</P>
<P>
   ''Springsteen is certainly known for taking his time, changing
his mind frequently while he's at it, and often doing the last
thing you'd expect,'' says editor Chris Phillips of Backstreets
Magazine, which chronicles all things Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judging by all the song debuts toward the end of the tour,
he's certainly got some great material.''
</P>
<P>
   That material includes ''American Skin (41 Shots),'' the Amadou
Diallo-inspired song that prompted the silliest Springsteen
controversy since Ronald Reagan interpreted ''Born in the USA'' as
a paean to patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   There were other new songs, too: the nightly show-closer ''Land
of Hope and Dreams,'' and three rockers - ''Further On Up the
Road,'' ''Code Of Silence'' and ''Another Thin Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Five songs, for most artists, is the start of a new album. For
Springsteen, it could become the start of ''Tracks II'' - a
follow-up to the boxed sets of rarities and unreleased gems that he
put out (to great critical acclaim) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, through his publicist, has said nothing about
what's next. The lone hint about the future emanating from the
notoriously tight-lipped Springsteen camp came courtesy of Little
Steven Van Zandt, who took questions from fans on his web site.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 1: Would you like to see the E Street Band become a
recording act again?
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Van Zandt replied.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 2: What are the chances of that happening?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd take the odds,'' said Van Zandt.
</P>
<P>
   There were no more queries fielded about the subject, no more
clues offered. But given Springsteen's track record in the '90s,
anything seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking up the E Street Band in 1988, Springsteen
disappeared until releasing two albums simultaneously in 1992 -
''Human Touch'' and ''Lucky Town.''
</P>
<P>
   He then launched a tour with a new band, leaving fans to lament
the absence of the E Streeters. He dabbled in hip-hop music (the
result was ''Streets of Philadelphia''), and began writing music
strictly on his bass.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen returned in 1995 - but as a solo act, touring small
theaters in support of his mostly-acoustic ''Ghost of Tom Joad''
album.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed tour featured Springsteen channeling the spirits
of John Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie: he occasionally read an except
from ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' and performed Guthrie's ''Plane Wreck
at Los Gatos (Deportee).''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in was a brief reunion with the E Streeters to record four
songs included on a greatest hits package, followed by the
''Tracks'' collection. Fans were left wondering if Springsteen and
the band would ever get together for a larger-scale project.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce &AMP; Co. emphatically answered the question with their tour
of Europe and North America, selling out virtually every stop along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The North American leg of the tour began with an unprecedented
15 shows at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, and closed with 10
sold-out nights in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, after playing the tour-closing set, Springsteen
delivered his cryptic comment about the future.
</P>
<P>
   During the Garden shows, director Jonathan Demme - a Springsteen
pal - reportedly filmed some shows for possible release.
Springsteen, obviously aware of the filming, uncharacteristically
asked the audience to keep the noise down during the slow songs.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the band back together again is not as simple as it
was in days when everybody was a Jersey guy.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Max Weinberg has a regular job as band leader for Conan
O'Brien, while bassist Garry Tallent is a respected Nashville
record producer. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt has become an actor on
the hit HBO series ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Nils Lofgren and sax man Clarence Clemons have their
solo careers. There are wives and kids and commitments that once
were not once a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Will they be able to join Springsteen in the studio? Will
Springsteen instead put out a live album?
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows?'' asked Backstreets' Phillips. ''It's a wait and
see game at this point, and we're taking everything we hear with a
grain of salt.''

   ''They wouldn't let my mother see me and they wouldn't tell her
why,'' she said. ''After three days they decided to tell her that I
was a boy but I was terribly deformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase was what doctors call an ''intersex'' baby - meaning she
had ambiguous sexual organs. At least one in 2,000 infants is born
this way, with genitals that do not match their chromosomes or do
not conform to either male or female norms.
</P>
<P>
   In Chase's case, she was raised briefly as a boy, then - after
surgery - as a girl. It has been common for doctors to operate as
soon as possible on such infants, in some cases turning boys into
girls with surgery and female hormones. Traditionally, parents were
told to keep the operation a secret, even when the child grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the practice of early surgery - performed long
before the child can understand - is being questioned. Some
doctors, prompted by angry former patients, are urging a moratorium
on genital surgery that they regard as cosmetic. However, no
consensus yet exists as to when genital surgery is cosmetic and
when it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that I think is going to be argued for a long
time,'' said Dr. Justine Schober, a pediatric urologist in Erie,
Pa., who opposes much of the surgery done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Chase did not learn of her history until age 22 when she finally
succeeded in obtaining her medical records. She learned she had
been raised as a boy for a year and a half, after which her parents
''found their way to some doctors who were newly minted specialists
in intersex.''
</P>
<P>
   She was diagnosed as a ''true hermaphrodite'' with ovo-testes -
gonads containing both ovarian and testicular tissue. She also had
a uterus, a vagina and ''pretty typical female genitals except for
a large clitoris.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They determined that I had ovaries and could get pregnant,''
Chase said. ''Then they closed my abdomen and cut off my clitoris.
... They told my parents that they had discovered that I wasn't
really a boy but I was a girl. ... They told them they should
change my name, move to another town and not tell anyone where they
had gone.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning her past, Chase founded the Intersex Society of
North America in 1993, hoping to end the shame and secrecy
surrounding intersex and halt the type of surgery that had left her
scarred and unable to have an orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second half of the 20th century doctors have treated
intersex as something that is so freakish that it renders the
intersex person ineligible for membership in society,'' she said.
''And because it is so freakish, ordinary ethics don't apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Danette Ivey is trying to help others who, like her, were born
with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or CAH, an enzyme deficiency
that can be fatal without regular doses of steroids. The condition,
the most common intersex diagnosis, often causes a baby girl's
genitals to be ''virilized'' - to look something like a boy's.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1966 in Lubbock, Texas, Ivey had nine surgeries. She
says some were necessary - her urethra had to be repositioned - and
some not - her clitoris was either removed or ''buried so far that
it's not even possible to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You feel totally violated,'' she said. ''You lose all control
of your body because you have your parents and the doctor saying
'we're doing this to make you normal.' In my mind I was normal
until they started cutting on me.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of my life I wished I was dead,'' said Ivey, who lives
outside of Houston where she runs an Internet message board for
people with CAH and delivers pizza for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Her message to parents contemplating genital surgery for
children is: ''Don't do anything that is not medically necessary.
Let the child decide when they are older. Because once you do the
surgery you can't go back.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been medical practice since the 1950s to operate on a boy
who has a penis that doctors feel will be too small for intercourse
or a girl whose clitoris is regarded as too long.
</P>
<P>
   Medical textbooks say that at birth the penis should be at least
an inch long. If it's not, doctors remove the penis and testicles
and administer female hormones. The child is then raised as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors would reduce the size of a girl's clitoris if it's more
than 3/8 inch long. They also may enlarge a girl's vagina if they
think it will not comfortably accommodate a penis when she grows
up.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of CAH, the clitoris sometimes ''looks like a little
penis,'' said Dr. Ian Aaronson, a pediatric urologist at the
Medical University of South Carolina and the chairman of the North
American Task Force on Intersex.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most mothers intuitively say, 'Well, she doesn't look like a
little girl,''' Aaronson said. ''Most doctors would feel
uncomfortable leaving children with grossly ambiguous genitalia, to
grow up through school with something unusual between their legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Lee, a pediatric endocrinologist at Hershey Medical
Center in Hershey, Pa., said he strives for ''a balanced
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My position would be that if the clitoris is enlarged but
still has the structure of a clitoris, that one ought not to rush
into surgery,'' Lee said. But he said surgery may be indicated
''when the genitals are such that they do not look female or
male.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee conceded that years ago, doctors operating on a child's
clitoris made scant effort to spare nerve endings and preserve
orgasmic potential. ''The big emphasis was on the appearance of the
genitalia,'' he said. ''Sadly so.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, ''I'm confident that there is a better
result.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is we have no long-term outcome studies, so we
really don't know if surgery hurts or helps,'' said Schober, the
urologist from Erie, Pa. ''It may normalize appearance, but there's
more to sexuality than appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice of assigning female sex to boys with small penises
was pioneered by sexologist John Money at Johns Hopkins Medical
Center in Baltimore. It is easier to create a vagina and labia than
enlarge a penis, and Money believed gender in infancy was so
malleable that a genetic male consistently raised as a girl would
adapt to life as a female.
</P>
<P>
   The theory gained a boost from one highly publicized case of a
boy who was changed to a girl in 1967 after his penis was destroyed
in a botched circumcision. Money described the child as a typical,
well-adjusted little girl.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was discredited when that child, now an adult named
David Reimer, disclosed that he had reassigned himself as a male at
age 14 and was married and living happily as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the pediatric endocrinologist, said that when he received
his medical training in the late 1960s and early '70s ''the
recommendation was to reassign the sex of a boy with micropenis,''
but he thought the practice had gone out of fashion in the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. William Reiner, a psychiatrist and pediatric urologist
at Johns Hopkins, said it is still going on, even though recent
research indicates that men with small penises can function quite
well as males.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said he has found 36 children who were castrated and
assigned as girls either in his practice or in his research, and
two-thirds of them have switched back to being boys.
</P>
<P>
   He said that once the child is told what happened, ''not only
does the child himself recognize that he was male, but often his
classmates have always recognized he was male.''
</P>
<P>
   Schober said textbooks still recommend raising a boy with a
small penis as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the 1992 edition of Campbell's Urology advises
that ''if the penis does not respond to testosterone, gender
reassignment probably should be performed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like a quick fix,'' said Schober. ''A quick, easy
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase added, ''Part of the problem is that (doctors) wanted a
simple answer by which they could use the tools they like to use,
which is medical intervention and surgery, to make this go away.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the treatment of intersex children is in such a state
of flux that parents get opposite advice depending on which doctor
they consult.
</P>
<P>
   When Kelley Schultz's twins were born in 1998 she didn't notice
anything odd about her daughter Madison's genitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think I really knew what they were supposed to
look like,'' said Schultz, a corporate meeting planner from the
Seattle area. ''I never thought anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 months Madison was diagnosed with CAH. (Her twin
brother was not affected.) She had a mild case, but a team of
specialists at Children's Hospital in Seattle determined that her
clitoris was too large and she should have surgery to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
   ''My pediatrician was really against it,'' said Schultz, who
agreed to have the surgery performed when Madison was 18 months.
''It was a really hard decision because there wasn't anything wrong
with her in her functioning. ... But it did not look normal, and
they could fix it, so why not fix it?''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''I think it's fine if a child has big ears or a
funny-looking nose, but I think that when you are dealing with
sexuality and those type of things, if you wait for your 13- or
14-year-old child to make that decision, there could already be
psychological damage done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie, a Californian who asked that her last name not be used,
gave birth in 1993 to a son with a small penis, undescended
testicles and no fully formed scrotum. It took three or four weeks
to determine that he had XY chromosomes and was a genetic male.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie said one ''crotchety old urologist'' suggested raising
the baby as a girl. But he was overruled by doctors at the
University of California at Davis who advised that ''there's no
reason to turn this child into a girl just because he has a small
penis.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie, who counsels other parents through the Ambiguous
Genitalia Support Network, said her son is a happy 7-year-old boy
but if he decides to be a girl later on that will be up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal,'' she said, ''is for everyone to do what's in the
best interest of the child, to put the needs of their child ahead
of everything else.''

<HEADLINE> Con Ed to immediately replace old generators  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) - Con Edison announced Wednesday that it
will replace its aging steam generators at the Indian Point 2
nuclear power plant, relenting to pressure from neighbors,
politicians and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission following a
radioactive leak in February.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means the nuclear plant, which has been out of
service since the accident, will remain off-line at least until
November.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after Gov. George Pataki signed a
law barring Con Ed from collecting the costs of the outage from
customers. The measure, which Con Ed pledged to fight in court,
could mean $200 million to the utility, including refunds of $14 to
$21 per customer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's decision to sign that legislation pushed Con Ed
to do the right thing,'' said Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon.
''This is going to mean safer, more reliable power.''
</P>
<P>
   James Riccio, senior analyst at the consumer organization Public
Citizen, said the utility's decision ''is in the interest of the
public health and safety. It just shouldn't have taken them that
long.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had gone ahead and replaced the generators right after
the rupture, they would be back up and operating now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, one of the 13,000 nickel-alloy tubes in the steam
generators cracked and leaked gallons of superheated radioactive
water into the surrounding clean water, resulting in a tiny
discharge of radioactive steam into the atmosphere. There were no
injuries, but it was the worst accident in the 26-year history of
the plant, 35 miles north of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed resisted demands that it replace the original generators,
the oldest of their type still in service in the country. The
utility said it wanted to get the plant operating in time to feed
the summer's peak electricity demands and would make the
time-consuming replacements later. It estimated the cost of
installing replacement generators at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the utility needed NRC permission to restart, and the
commission repeatedly found flaws in Con Ed's repairs and plans. On
Wednesday, coincidentally, the NRC found three violations in Indian
Point 2's emergency preparedness program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We clearly had some concerns about the plant restarting with
repaired steam generators,'' said commission spokesman Neil
Sheehan. ''For us the bottom line has always been that if the plant
returned to service, there had to be no question about its safe
operation. If this decision on new generators achieves that goal,
then certainly we would welcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed spokesman Joseph Petta said the process had gone on so
long, ''We are now ready to begin the replacement and it would not
make sense to go ahead with a restart, then bring the plant down
for replacements, when the summer peak is effectively missed
already.'' He insisted, however, that the old generators could have
produced power safely this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, who was among the many politicians who
opposed restarting the reactor without new generators, said, ''Con
Ed has finally seen the light. This is something that should have
been done a long time ago to help families living in the shadow of
Indian Point rest easier at night.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our voice was finally heard,'' said Rep. Sue Kelly.
Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano said the decision was ''a
victory for the safety of the people of Westchester.'' And state
Assemblyman Richard Brodsky said, ''Con Ed acted negligently,
threatening the public safety and ratepayers' pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said the commission, which spent months inspecting and
analyzing the repaired generators, would now switch gears and begin
inspecting the newer ones, which have been stored at Indian Point
since the mid-1980s. Sheehan said that while the generators are not
the latest models, they do incorporate improvements made after the
nation's worst nuclear accident, at the Three Mile Island plant in
Pennsylvania in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed has used nitrogen to prevent corrosion of the new
components, ''so I understand they're in pretty good shape,''
Sheehan said. ''But nonetheless there's still quite a bit of
testing that has to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood Con Ed was considering late November as a
possible startup date. The utility said it anticipates power
production by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Indians Appeal To UN on Land Rights  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A group of American Indians said Wednesday they
have appealed to the United Nations to intervene to protect their
ancient land rights against the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Western Shoshone People said they hoped two U.N.
panels would back their case that the U.S. government is trying to
force them from ancestral territory, causing them physical,
economic and cultural hardship and violating U.N. human rights
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Their plea came as the United Nations commemorated the
International Day of the World's Indigenous People with ceremonies
in New York -- an annual event designed to raise awareness of the
discrimination faced by indigenous people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many, many years, the United States has been slowly trying
to squeeze us into smaller and smaller spaces until we no longer
exist as a people,'' said Kevin Brady, chairman of the Yomba
Shoshone Tribe, whose estimated 6,500 members are concentrated in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is forbidding us from hunting and fishing in our
traditional ways. We have been told we cannot graze the cattle
necessary to sustain our communities,'' he said in a speech to the
U.N. Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said the U.S. government has authorized the use of
environmentally damaging cyanide for gold mining and approved
military testing and nuclear waste storage on Shoshone lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada desert is a key U.S. weapons testing site. It also
has considerable gold deposits.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the so-called 1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley between the
Western Shoshone and the United States, which took 23.6 million
acres of land away from Native Americans. Shoshone leaders argue
the treaty is invalid and that the land was never ceded to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   They have rejected a long-standing government offer of $121
million in compensation and have slammed a recent proposal by Sen.
Harry Reid of Nevada to begin paying $20,000 to every Shoshone man,
woman and child for land taken in the 1863 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Traditional people will never accept money for their land,''
Carrie Dann told reporters. She and her sister Mary have been focal
points of the dispute since the government sued them in 1974 for
grazing their livestock on federal acreage at their remote ranch in
central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time a Western Shoshone delegation has come to
Geneva to lobby the U.N. human rights sub-commission. They also
addressed a separate panel -- the Committee on the Elimination of
All Forms of Racial Discrimination -- arguing that the U.S. land
claim amounts to racism.
</P>
<P>
   The committee ruled last year that Australia should suspend
implementation of new land rights laws since they discriminated
against Aborigines.

<HEADLINE> UN: Guyana Border Dispute Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- An American company's plan to build a
space launch pad in the mineral-rich territory separating Guyana
and Venezuela is refueling a long-standing border dispute, a U.N.
mediator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela warned recently that the United States risked opening
''a dangerous breach'' in relations by supporting a Texas company's
proposal to build the space port in Guyana's western Essequibo
region, the contested area.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rhetoric has indeed heated up,'' Oliver Jackman, a
Barbados diplomat appointed to mediate by the United Nations, told
reporters after meeting with Guyanese President Bharrat Jagdeo on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 76,000-square-mile Essequibo region covers three-fifths of
Guyana. But Venezuela has claimed the area since the 1940s. The
border was drawn in 1899 when Guyana was still a British colony.
</P>
<P>
   The Essequibo region has a wealth of gold, bauxite and diamonds
as well as lumber and oil. Last month, Venezuela said it would
consider issuing oil concessions in the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
   Guyana had already agreed to sell and rent a total of 100,000
acres to Frisco, Texas-based Beal Aerospace Technologies to build a
$100 million space port.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman met last weekend in Caracas with Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez who expressed hope that the nations could tone down the
rhetoric to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
   The mediator, who left Guyana Wednesday, will now be preparing a
report for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.

<HEADLINE> Vineland trucker charged in Ocean City boardwalk kidnappings, rape  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - A truck driver was charged Wednesday in
a brutal attack on two 17-year-olds who were kidnapped at
knifepoint while walking on the Boardwalk and then sexually
assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   James Randall Smith, 23, of Vineland, is charged with two counts
each of aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping. Identified by the
victims, he was arrested about 6 a.m. at a warehouse in Pennsauken
after completing a delivery to Canada, Cape May County Prosecutor
David Blaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the best of our knowledge, he was a complete stranger'' to
the victims, Blaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers - a boy and a girl from Perkasie, Pa., who were
vacationing here - were walking on the Boardwalk about 2 a.m.
Monday when Smith confronted them at First Street, forcing them
onto the beach, Blaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the boy's clothing, he tied him to a signpost and sexually
assaulted him before abducting the girl and driving her about 40
miles to a wooded area of Commercial Township, Cumberland County,
Blaker said.
</P>
<P>
   There, he allegedly raped the girl and tied her to a tree, using
some of her clothes, before abandoning her.
</P>
<P>
   She managed to free herself and was spotted walking barefoot
along Route 347, about one mile south of Port Elizabeth, about 9:20
a.m. Monday. A motorist, Joseph DeVitto, 55, saw her and asked if
she needed help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked her, 'Are you all right?' She said 'No, I'm not. I
think my boyfriend is dead,''' DeVitto told The Press of Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   She asked if she was still in Ocean City and he told her she
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was hysterical. She was just flowing out with what
happened. Very emotional,'' DeVitto said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was taken to State Police barracks in Port Norris. She
was treated at Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital and released
Monday. She led police back to the scene of her assault, where
investigators found a cigarette pack believed to have been left by
the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who freed himself and made a 911 call to police at 2:24
a.m. Monday, required no treatment, Blaker said. He would not
describe the nature of the sexual assault on the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither victim's name was released.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who works for a Franklin Township leasing company, has no
adult criminal convictions but has a juvenile record, according to
Cumberland County Prosecutor Arthur Marchand.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's no stranger to the system,'' Marchand said.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held on $200,000 bail pending a first appearance
Thursday before Superior Court Judge Carmen Alvarez in Cape May
Court House.
</P>
<P>
   News of the incident had rocked this popular southern New Jersey
vacation spot, which forbids liquor sales and markets itself as
''America's Greatest Family Resort.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first kidnapping to be reported here since 1991, when
9-year-old Samantha Russ of Ocean City was kidnapped and murdered,
according to Police Chief Robert Blevin.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Querns, 48, is serving 45 years in prison for that
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the south Jersey shore points, this is the one I'd
least expect something like this to happen,'' said vacationer Todd
DeWitt, of Valley Forge, Pa.

With BC-NJ--Whitman-Farmland
<TEXT>
<P>
   READINGTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman said farmers who
volunteer to work on land preservation boards must resign if any
deals are being considered that might involve their land.
</P>
<P>
   Several counties have been requiring farmers to resign from such
boards if their own land or land owned by a family member was being
considered for open-space preservation. But most others concluded
it was good enough simply for such farmers to recuse himself from
meetings at which their land or adjacent land was being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the tougher ethical standard was necessary
statewide to preserve the program's good image. She said there had
been no hint of prior wrongdoing or error to warrant ordering these
changes in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to go the extra mile to achieve our goal with the
utmost efficiency and integrity,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Under farmland preservation, the state or local agency purchases
the development rights on a farmer's land. The farmer gets the
money, keeps the land and may continue to farm it or even may sell
it provided that the property is never developed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the inception of farmland preservation in the 1980s, some
of the most active farmers in the various counties would be
recruited to join county development boards to assist officials in
mapping out regions for farmland preservation. They would also act
as ambassadors to convince hesitant farmers and landowners that the
preservation program was a good deal and no threat to their
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to an ethical quandary, however, in those cases
when farmers active with the development boards decided they wanted
to seek preservation funding for their own land.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two Britons and two Canadians denied
accusations of terrorism and possession of explosives Wednesday
during eight hours of questioning before a Yugoslav military court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the Canadians, Ivan Jankovic, denied any
wrongdoing by his clients and said ''they were just regular
tourists, spending a weekend at the seaside.''
</P>
<P>
   The court appearance was a pretrial hearing in which the court
will determine whether to press formal charges against the men. The
group was arrested a week ago in Montenegro, when a search of their
vehicle uncovered what the military said were dangerous explosive
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say explosives were discovered is a gross mistake. What was
found was remnant material which is used together with explosives,
fuses and detonators,'' Jankovic said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the material was worth less than $50 and was used
in construction. The Canadians ran a construction company that used
explosives to demolish ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The four could be charged with attempted terrorism and if tried,
face up to 15 years in jail each. However, Djordje Djurisic, the
lawyer representing the two Britons, said it would be at least a
week or two before the military prosecutor decides whether to level
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Djurisic said Britons Adrian Prangnell and John Yore -- who both
worked for the international police force in Kosovo -- looked well,
as did the two Canadians, Shaun Going, and his nephew, Liam Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the prisoners will be allowed visits by British
and Canadian diplomats Thursday morning. Representatives of the two
governments have protested being denied consular access to the men.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats were allowed into the court building during the
preliminary hearing Wednesday, but were not allowed to actually see
the four men.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of their arrest, the four were en route from
Montenegro, the smaller republic in the Yugoslav federation, to
Kosovo, the province taken over by NATO-led peacekeepers after a
78-day bombing campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's state-run Politika daily reported Wednesday that what
was found in the group's car ''could kill at least 150 people'' and
that the men allegedly tried to prevent the military police from
searching their car.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's military prosecutor demanded they be charged with
possession of arms and explosives, attempted terrorist acts,
illegal entry into Yugoslavia and ''violent behavior toward
military personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Serbia, where Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic has his power base, and much smaller Montenegro have
become increasingly strained ahead of Sept. 24 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two republics formally make up the Yugoslav
federation, independence-minded Montenegro has virtually severed
all ties with its larger partner, including allowing foreigners to
enter without a visa required by Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Crash victims include a Mercer County police officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A flight instructor who died in Wednesday's
plane collision was also a nine-year veteran of the Washington
Township Police Department in Mercer County.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Robinson, 28, of Hamilton Township, was one of 11 people
killed when two small planes collided over Burlington County
shortly before 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Washington Township department as a dispatcher in
1991 and was promoted to police officer in 1994, according to
information released by the department.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a flight instructor for Hortman Aviation. Its
owner, Herb Hortman, said he knew Robinson well, and spoke to his
family after hearing news of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hortman said Robinson was an experienced pilot and had between
1,800 and 2,000 hours of flying time. The student with him was also
a licensed pilot who was working on his commercial license, he
said. His identity was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Hortman Aviation is located about two miles from Northeast
Philadelphia Airport, where Robinson and a student took off
Wednesday morning, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aviation is like any other industry. It has its pleasures, and
it has its dangers,'' Hortman said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is survived his wife and a son, who is less than a year
old, police said.

<HEADLINE> Quake Hits West of Mexico City  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake rocked Mexico's Pacific
coast Wednesday, sending frightened residents scrambling from their
beds and into the streets, but doing little damage.
</P>
<P>
   The quake's lone apparent casualty was a man recovering from a
heart operation who died -- possibly of fright -- in the town of
Huetamo, 100 miles to the northeast of the city of Lazaro Cardenas,
Nahum Cortes of the state civil defense agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6:42 a.m. quake's offshore epicenter was 30 miles from
Lazaro Cardenas, a port about 210 miles southwest of Mexico City,
where it toppled bookshelves and scatted goods from supermarket
shelves. The large quake was followed by two aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   It swayed buildings in Mexico City and led officials to close
the capital's airport for 10 minutes as a precautionary measure,
but no significant damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's National Seismological Service calculated the magnitude
at 7. The U.S. Geological Survey put it at 6.4. The was no
immediate explanation for the discrepancy
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt it strong,'' said civil defense worker Marlene Ramos
in Lazaro Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   But by the afternoon, officials had only received reports of
four people injured, none critically, besides the death in Huetamo.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of a wall at a hotel under repair fell on a man who
suffered broken bones and three children suffered light bruising
from other debris, said Carlos Mora, another civil defense worker
in Lazaro Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   A magnitude-6 quake is capable of causing considerable damage.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the beach cities of Zihuatanejo and Acapulco to the
southeast said the quake was felt only lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has recorded 38 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater
over the past decade, with just a few of them causing major damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most quakes in the area where Wednesday's hit are moderately
deep, blunting some of their force, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   An aftershock of magnitude 4.6 was recorded at 8:02 a.m. and a
second of magnitude 4.1 occurred at 8:19 a.m., according to the
Mexican service.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's most deadly quakes strike the Pacific coast. Among
those was the 8.1-magnitude 1985 quake that killed thousands in
Mexico City.

<HEADLINE> IRS: PACs Should Reveal Soft Money  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many political action committees created by
congressional leaders should have to disclose their ''soft money''
contributions under a new campaign finance reform law, the Internal
Revenue Service announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at some of these leadership PACs and other
''nonfederal accounts'' created under Section 527 of the tax code
had argued that the new law did not apply to them because they
already publicly report other ''hard money'' contributions to the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hard money'' refers to federally limited donations to
candidates or parties. ''Soft money'' refers to unlimited donations
by unions, corporations and individuals for party-building
activities. Soft money is not supposed to be used to directly aid
an individual candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress have started raising soft money for
their leadership PACs. In many cases, they do not have to report
these donors because the donations are not covered by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   But in proposed rules, the IRS said Congress clearly intended
that the now-secret ''soft money'' contributions to these PACs
should be covered under the new law -- a decision that drew praise
from a prime Senate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ''A simple principle was at stake here: It was a question of
disclosure versus secrecy, and now the IRS has joined Congress in
coming down firmly on the side of disclosure,'' said Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis. ''I am pleased that the IRS has acted quickly to
affirm that view so that these secret slush funds finally will be
disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which went into effect July 1, requires all
organizations given tax-exempt status under Section 527 of the tax
code to disclose their officers, address and other identifying
information, along with donor names, size of donations and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Wednesday means that House Republican Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, for example, would have to report any soft money
contributions to his Americans for a Republican Majority PAC.
</P>
<P>
   Congress rushed to pass the measure earlier this year after
numerous groups from across the political spectrum began using
Section 527 to shield contributions and expenditures for ad
campaigns and other activities that appeared designed to influence
elections.
</P>
<P>
   As a bipartisan group of senators put it in a late July letter
to the IRS, ''the law was intended to put a stop to the shameful
practice of self-proclaimed, election-related organizations taking
the public subsidy of a tax exemption ... while claiming a right to
hide.''
</P>
<P>
   IRS officials plan to take public comments on the proposed rules
through Sept. 8, with a final decision expected shortly thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STROUDSBURG, Pa. (AP) - Two Monroe County residents were
arrested by state police and charged with murdering a former
Johnstown resident whose burning corpse was found on a country road
in the Poconos.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers at the Swiftwater barracks said they arrested Michelle
Anne Landolfa, 17, of Kunkletown, and Davon J. Collins, 22, of
Tobyhanna, Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They were arraigned before District Justice Thomas Olsen on
criminal homicide and criminal conspiracy charges in the death of
Brianna Nicole Whetstone, 19, of Tobyhanna.
</P>
<P>
   Collins faces additional charges of aggravated assault and abuse
of a corpse, and Landolfa was also charged with criminal
solicitation. They were jailed in the Monroe County Correctional
Facility without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Whetstone and Collins had recently ended their relationship and
Collins had begun seeing Landolfa, who became jealous of Whetstone,
officials from the Monroe County District Attorney's Office said at
a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Collins told Whetstone that he would meet her at her
current home in New Jersey and that the pair would then travel to
Florida. Police said when Collins arrived at Whetstone's home, he
told her they had to return to Tobyhanna for his bags.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took her to Hialeah Airfield, where she was
assaulted, bound and gagged and placed in Collins' trunk, police
said. She was then brought to National Park Service land nearby,
doused with gasoline and set aflame, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Service ranger found Whetstone's body burning
last Thursday in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.
The Monroe County Coroner's Office conducted an autopsy and ruled
she died of asphyxiation, but released no other details.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Mark Pazuhanich said it appears Whetstone was
dead when her body was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Whetstone had gone to court for a protection-from-abuse order
against her boyfriend, stating last November in court papers that
he had hit and threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   The order was still in effect at the time of Whetstone's death;
it was to expire on Nov. 22.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Near on Poland's President  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A special investigator said Wednesday
there was insufficient evidence to prove that President Alexander
Kwasniewski worked as an agent for the former communist regime's
security services.
</P>
<P>
   Boguslaw Nizienski, the official collecting evidence of
collaboration, recommended at a court hearing that the case against
Kwasniewski be closed -- which would remove a lingering threat to
his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Several former security officials testified earlier Wednesday
that they did not believe Kwasniewski was a police agent under the
Soviet-backed communist regime, which fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing statement, Kwasniewski once again denied working
for the secret services, which suppressed political opposition
using informers. The court said it would issue a ruling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kwasniewski's second hearing before the court, charged
with determining whether he told the truth under a new law
requiring senior officials to disclose past links with the secret
services.
</P>
<P>
   The law is being applied for the first time to presidential
candidates, who must file declarations. Kwasniewski, a former
communist party member, is heavily favored to win a second
five-year term in the Oct. 8 election.
</P>
<P>
   There is no penalty for admitting collaboration, but anyone
found by the court to have lied is barred from office for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Recently discovered police documents suggested that Kwasniewski
might have worked as an agent under the code name Alek when he ran
a youth magazine in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But a former senior Interior Ministry official, Krzysztof
Majchrowski, told the court that ''it was forbidden to recruit
party members as secret agents'' without special permission.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have known of any efforts to recruit
Kwasniewski, who also headed the government sports committee in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A former police captain, Zygmunt Wytrwal, testified that he
supervised an agent called Alek, but insisted it was not
Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
   Wytrwal's superior officer, Florian Uryzaj, also said he was
certain that agent Alek could not have been Kwasniewski. ''If
Kwasniewski were our source, I would know it and would remember
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court has cleared most of about 15 presidential candidates
who filed statements, but both Kwasniewski and Solidarity founder
Lech Walesa have had to face public hearings because of old police
documents suggesting they might have worked as agents.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehemently deny any such links and suggest the evidence has
been fabricated by political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa is due for his third hearing on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Group: Zimbabwe Workers Destitute  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The occupation of white-owned farms by
ruling party militants has impoverished hundreds of farmworkers and
their families, the workers' union said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Agricultural and Plantation Workers Union warned the
situation will worsen for the farm workers if the government goes
ahead with its program to nationalize the white-owned commercial
farms without making provisions for the hundreds of thousands who
work and live there.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, militants and squatters have illegally occupied
more than 1,600 white-owned farms, demanding they be seized,
divided up and turned over to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe has described the occupations as a
justified protest against unfair ownership of huge swaths of
Zimbabwe's best farmland by a few thousand white descendants of
British and South African colonial era settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Farm disruptions by the militants have driven some 5,000 workers
from their homes in the past six months, said Philip Munyanyi, the
union leader.
</P>
<P>
   At least another 10,000 jobs were in immediate jeopardy on
hundreds of farms that the government plans to seize and
redistribute to landless blacks over the next few weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In most districts, workers were told they would not receive any
of the redistributed land.
</P>
<P>
   Around the town of Bindura, 50 miles northeast of Harare,
militant squatters on the occupied farms seized workers' houses for
themselves, forcing the displaced to erect makeshift shelters of
plastic sheets and straw.
</P>
<P>
   Police failed to restore order and farm owners were powerless to
intervene, Munyanyi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people have no place to stay anymore. They are desperate,
they are just wandering about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Farmers Union, which represents most of the
country's white farm owners, said government officials told them
that 214 white farmers were scheduled to receive confiscation
orders by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing labor laws, departing farmers are not obliged to
pay off their workers, Munyanyi said. New occupiers are required to
take over responsibility for the workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has not been addressed at all. We must have legislation
to provide for workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has listed 800 white-owned commercial farms it
has targeted for confiscation and announced earlier this month it
is selecting another 2,300 properties, making up about half the
nation's white-owned land, for resettlement by landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   That plan threatened the jobs of at least half the 700,000
workers employed by white farmers, Munyanyi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While there has been talk of compensation to farmers, there
has been no talk of compensation for workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic crisis since independence
in 1980 and farm disruptions have cost the country up to a quarter
of its crops of wheat and tobacco, Zimbabwe's biggest source of
desperately needed hard currency, according to farm union
estimates.

<HEADLINE> Plight of mentally ill inmates remains state secret  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A schizophrenic inmate in solitary
confinement set himself on fire, spent months in a hospital burn
unit and was then ordered back to a specially designed cell, where
he remained alone, untreated and at times incoherent for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old inmate lived most of five years in isolation, his
multiple mental illnesses treated with medication. The official
penalties for repeated suicide attempts: being shackled into
''restraining chairs'', ordered naked into ''strip cells'' or
locked in a ''dry cell'', a room without lights or running water
where urine and feces were removed once a week.
</P>
<P>
   A public advocacy group reported these cases and others in a
class-action lawsuit seeking better treatment for mentally ill
state prison inmates. Prisoners whose illnesses caused outbursts or
other behavioral problems were disciplined, not treated, the
lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials last year agreed to almost all demands in
the lawsuit, promising changes at every level in the system
treating mentally ill inmates. The Department of Corrections said
it would hire more staff, offer better training, build treatment
facilities and rewrite disciplinary procedures to consider an
inmate's illness.
</P>
<P>
   But the outside review of treatment programs required by the
deal that settled the lawsuit is shrouded in court-sanctioned
secrecy. The suit was filed by the Inmate Advocacy Clinic at Seton
Hall University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey might have had one of the worst records on inmate
treatment in the country. Now it might be leading the way in terms
of things they agreed to do. We don't know,'' said lawyer Bruce
Rosen representing the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration paid $16 million this year for
improvements ordered by the settlement and budgeted $17.7 million
for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The state also agreed to pay $1.2 million in legal fees,
according to a copy of the settlement summary.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said a forensic psychiatrist would visit state
prisons four times a year, interview inmates and review procedures.
According to court documents, his reports determine if the state is
complying with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Human Rights Watch asked a federal court to allow
those progress reports to be inspected by the public as well. U.S.
Magistrate Judge John Hughes plans to issue his ruling this month
on that request.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which Hughes approved, allows those reports to
be seen only by the state, the private contractor that provides
inmate medical services and the Inmate Advocacy Clinic, all
original parties in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch plans to include New Jersey in its national
review of prisons and mental health treatments, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see nothing. We get nothing. All we get is a stone wall,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other inmate advocate groups disagree with the fight to keep the
status reports private.
</P>
<P>
   ''How are you going to monitor compliance if you keep it under
wraps,'' said Ed Martone of the Association on Correction.
</P>
<P>
   There is a need to preserve patient confidentiality, but
taxpayers who paid for the improvements deserve to know how the
money is spent, Martone said. So do legislators who approved budget
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the same token, we're not talking about two companies
involved in a copyright spat. We're talking about public policy.
We're talking about human beings who are wards of the state,''
Martone said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Patricia Perlmutter, who headed the fight for the Inmate
Advocacy Clinic, could not be reached for comment. A secretary said
she is on sabbatical. But after the July 17 court hearing,
Perlmutter said, ''We continue to have tremendous concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said the
confidentiality agreement is simply part of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides agreed to it. It was settled that way,'' Katherine
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials estimate 2,600 inmates - approximately 10
percent of the total prison population - are being treated for some
form of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1999, the state has built treatment centers at four
prisons to treat inmates as well as 418 new cells, said chief of
staff Mary Ellen Bolton. Guards now get 10 hours of training, with
half a day dedicated to dealing with mentally ill prisoners, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have to be given the appropriate level of care for
their particular disease,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some inmates are still ordered to ''administrative segregation''
or solitary confinement, Bolton said. If inmates are ill, they are
supervised by medical staff, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said she could not ''confirm or substantiate any
allegations made'' before she and Commissioner Jack Terhune took
office in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors know the changes are working, Bolton said. Assaults
on staff members are down 37 percent since the settlement and many
of the solitary confinement cells are empty, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But an independent assessment from the forensic psychiatrist is
not available, Bolton said. That review could continue for at least
a year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we get through that transition period, we really need to
be cooperating with all the requirements of the settlement,''
Bolton said.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A selloff in shares of big drug companies
dragged down blue-chip stocks Wednesday after a court ruling that
could speed up the sale of a generic version of the antidepressant
drug Prozac in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 71.06 at 10,905.83.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 4.95 at 3,853.50, after rising more than 70 points early in
the session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.93 at
1,472.87.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of drug company Eli Lilly fell 29 percent, or $31.859 to
$76.688, on news that a federal appeals court had overturned an
earlier ruling that kept Eli Lilly's Prozac patent in place until
2003.
</P>
<P>
   The patent is now set to expire in February 2001; generic
versions of Prozac may appear on the market as early as August
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent other big-name drug stocks lower, including
Pfizer, down $2.188 to $42.75, and Schering Plough, down $1.547 to
$41.438.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's quarterly revenues surged 61 percent as the Internet
networking giant beat Wall Street's earnings expectations by a
penny. The solid earnings report helped lift the technology focused
Nasdaq into positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cisco rose $2.313 to $67.813.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco serves as a bellwether for the technology sector, having
emerged as one of the most stable high-tech companies in the
nation. Soaring demand for its switches, routers and fiber-optic
equipment has turned it into one of the most valuable companies in
the world, vying with Microsoft as the company with the largest
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that benefited from Cisco's solid earnings included
Internet parts maker JDS Uniphase, up $1.25 at $121.125.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet stocks took another hit Wednesday when an analyst
at New York brokerage house Sanford Bernstein opened coverage of
the online retailer at a rating of underperform, meaning the
analyst doesn't expect Amazon's stock to perform as well as the
broader market. Amazon's shares fell $2.063 to $30.875.
</P>
<P>
   Other well-known Internet stocks followed suit, including
Priceline.com, down $2.375 at $25.625.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what I call the every-other-day theory. Yesterday
blue-chip stocks were up and the techs were down,'' said Ralph
Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in Tampa,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would really be healthy is if both markets rose in
concert with one another. The fact that that isn't happening leads
me to think this is nothing more than a bear market rally,'' Bloch
added.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, blue-chip stocks fell despite a government report
released on Tuesday that showed Americans' productivity rose during
the past year at the fastest pace in 17 years while labor costs
declined, the first time they have dropped since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers were much better than expected, and economists
believe the encouraging figures made it unlikely that the Federal
Reserve will boost interest rates for a seventh time when the
central bank meets again Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.26 billion shares,
up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.22 at 507.50.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.36 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.44 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.88 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.58 percent.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Milosevic To Try Vote Rig  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Wednesday it is a foregone conclusion that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic will try to rig next month's national election
to ensure he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that Milosevic will cheat and he already has used
violence and suppression of the independent media to ensure that
elections are not free and fair,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Yugoslavs in the Sept. 24 election will have the
opportunity to choose ''freedom, prosperity and the West and to
turn their backs on Milosevic's policies of isolation and ethnic
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke at a ceremony at which she received the Badge of
the Grand Order of Queen Jalena, the second-highest award of the
Croatian government.
</P>
<P>
   The award was presented by Croatian President Stjepan Mesic, who
received warm praise from Albright for his efforts to achieve ''a
fully integrated partnership with the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have looked with special delight at Croatian democracy as an
example to people throughout the Balkans, especially Yugoslavia,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving awards of junior rank at the ceremony were Leon
Feurth, national security adviser to Vice President Al Gore, and
Capricia Panavic Marshall, White House social secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mesic and Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan met
with President Clinton at the White House for about 45 minutes.
Clinton praised them for moving Croatia away from its authoritarian
past ''at a breathtaking pace,'' and encouraged them to continue
with tough economic reforms, according to a senior administration
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also discussed three packages of assistance for Croatia:
$21 million in seed money for reconstruction efforts, $4.5 million
to house returning refugees and $4 million in foreign military
financing, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Columnist jumps to NY Post  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Columnist Sidney Zion has defected from the
Daily News to its rival tabloid the New York Post, the paper
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Zion's first column for the Post will appear in Friday's
edition. Post editor-in-chief Ken Chandler said he was delighted to
have Zion as part of the Post team.
</P>
<P>
   Zion, a Yale law graduate and former federal prosecutor, spent
the last six years as a Daily News columnist. Before that, he
worked as a reporter for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Zion's final column for the News appeared in Tuesday's paper,
writing about how his mother's belief that that would never be a
Jewish vice presidential candidate was undermined by the Democratic
choice of U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Awards Medals of Freedom  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An emotional President Clinton praised the
''keen intellect and loving heart'' of sometime political rival
Rev. Jesse Jackson, and the leadership of the iconoclastic general
who disagreed with his strategy during the Kosovo air war, as he
bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 15 people Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's voice grew thin as he listed the accomplishments of
Americans as diverse as Jackson, retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
economist John Kenneth Galbraith, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman retired Adm. William
Crowe and former Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the founding of our nation it has been the duty of each
generation to achieve freedom all over again, to expand it, to
deepen its meaning, to widen the circle of those who are included
as full citizens,'' Clinton said at a packed ceremony in the East
Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we honor 15 men and women who have done exactly that,''
Clinton said. ''They have helped America to achieve freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is considered both a Clinton ally and a fly in the
presidential ointment. The civil rights leader is a frequent sight
at the White House, even though he flirted briefly with the idea of
challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson prayed with the Clinton family after the president
disclosed his extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, but defied
Clinton advisers last year by going to Yugoslavia to retrieve three
American soldiers held as prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   An orator at least as gifted as Clinton, Jackson sometimes
outshines the president. Clinton jokingly acknowledged the
rhetorical rivalry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are now about to witness one of the best things about this
ceremony,'' Clinton said. ''For a change, I don't have to follow
Jesse Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Jackson praised the Clinton administration
for promoting ''the most inclusive America,'' but did not paper
over his differences with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those of us who would dare be change agents, who lead by
molding opinion and not following opinion polls, always rub the
edges of our society,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark commanded NATO during the 78-day air war against Yugoslav
forces last year that forced the retreat from Kosovo. During the
war Clark made little secret of his belief that the alliance must
actively consider a ground invasion, and he chafed at the graduated
air campaign prosecuted by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was replaced early, but professed no bitterness. Clinton
said last year that the selection of another general for the job
had nothing to do with Clark's conduct during the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton noted many experts thought the Kosovo
operation was ''mission impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead, thanks to Gen. Clark, we now can declare it mission
accomplished,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees, who also include a pioneering AIDS researcher, a
crusading Hispanic legal activist and others known mostly for work
among the poor or disadvantaged, ''have helped us to secure the
blessing of liberty, by acts of bravery, conscience and
creativity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The medal, the nation's highest civilian award, was established
by President Truman as a wartime honor. President Kennedy
reintroduced it as way to honor civilian service.
</P>
<P>
   Only the president may award the medal. White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said Wednesday's awards are the last Clinton will do
as a group, although he may award others individually if he
chooses. Typically, the ceremony is a once-a-year affair.
</P>
<P>
   The medal may be awarded to citizens of other nations and may be
awarded posthumously, as was this year's medal for Rhode Island
Republican Sen. John Chafee, who died last year.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut politicians welcome Gore  </HEADLINE>
rhstmflspr
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Crowds of people gathered near Joseph
Lieberman's boyhood home Wednesday, to welcome their favorite son
and Al Gore to Connecticut for the first time since Gore picked the
state's junior senator to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman were to appear at a rally Wednesday evening
at the Italian Center, where about 800 people had gathered,
including a who's who of Connecticut Democrats. Earlier Wednesday
the two visited Gore's hometown of Carthage, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   As the motorcade drove by Lieberman's mother's home, Lucas
Isidro, a 55-year-old Stamford police officer, put up a 4 foot by 8
foot American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love Joe Lieberman,'' he said. ''I'm very proud of him. I
think he stands for everything I believe in - the American dream,
home, family values, integrity''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds on both sides of the street chanted ''Go Joe, Go Joe,''
and screamed when Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah waved from their
car.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Frantin, 68, said she is Republican, but is leaning
toward voting for Lieberman, known for his stands against violence
and sex in the entertainment industry, and his public rebuke of
President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need somebody like that, after the administration we've
had,'' she said. ''As a matter of fact, I with he was running for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally had the feel of a rock concert, and those attending
waited in lines up to a half-hour long just to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Connecticut, this is a magic moment, everybody feels it,''
said Ed Marcus, the state party chairman. ''There's been a great a
sense of pride in the entire state of Connecticut. History has
truly been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's elevation to Gore's running mate has energized
Connecticut politics, particularly as the fate of Lieberman's
Senate seat remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Lieberman can run for both offices
simultaneously. If elected vice president he would have to resign
from the Senate and Republican Gov. John G. Rowland would appoint a
replacement, who would serve until the next statewide election in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman could also quit the race as late as Oct. 27 and
still be replaced by a Democratic Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian Center of Stamford is no stranger to national
political figures: President Nixon dedicated the center in 1970 and
President Reagan visited it.

<HEADLINE> 7M Kids Eligible for Health Program  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three of five parents whose children lack
health insurance don't know they could get coverage through free or
low-cost government programs, leaving about 7 million eligible
young people outside this critical safety net, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   The government created the Children's Health Insurance Program
(CHIP) in 1997 to help kids whose families earn too much to qualify
for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. About 2 million
children were enrolled in the program in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The study released Wednesday found that most parents of eligible
children said they would enroll their children if they knew they
could, said Sarah Shuptrine, head of the Covering Kids program of
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropic group devoted
to health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many families really believe that they have to have very low
incomes or have to be on welfare in order for children to be
eligible,'' Shuptrine said. ''It's critically important that we try
to reach these families and let them know about these
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   About 11 million children and 33 million adults in the United
States have no health benefits, according to government studies.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stovall, 23, a portrait photographer from Boise, Idaho,
signed up her 2-year-old son, Tyler, for CHIP coverage only three
days before he suffered a serious asthma attack requiring medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''With everything we've gone through with his health, it's
really helpful to have something that helps to pay,'' Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   Stovall and her husband didn't have private insurance for their
son and earned too much to continue receiving Medicaid. She didn't
know she could be eligible until she heard some radio commercials
about her state program and a friend encouraged her to go.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility for programs varies among states, with most setting
the income level for a family of four around $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found households with two working parents or with
income above $25,000 were most likely to mistakenly believe their
children wouldn't qualify for aid.
</P>
<P>
   Social stigma often is considered a deterrent to getting
families to sign up for government assistance, but that doesn't
seem to be a problem with the health program, the survey found.
Three out of four parents of children eligible for Medicaid or CHIP
believe that government health programs are ''a good thing to help
people take care of their families,'' the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The introduction of health care for working families is a
relatively new concept,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna E. Shalala, who attended a ceremony at a District of Columbia
elementary school to help launch a national Covering Kids campaign
to educate families.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation already has awarded $47 million in state and
local grants for outreach efforts, and the new campaign will target
more than 20 states to encourage families to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, schools will include brochures about the program in
back-to-school packets. In Salt Lake City, local groups plan events
promoting the program in 20 elementary schools and all the city's
secondary schools. In Atlanta, children will be enrolled during a
back-to-school immunization drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''States have been working hard to streamline application and
re-enrollment processes to make them more family friendly,''
Shalala said, describing a Georgia program that distributed
Medicaid fliers in pizza boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said money is available to cover 5 million kids under
current programs and more funding would be available if needed. She
advised parents who want to know if their children are eligible to
call toll-free 1-877-543-7669 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. local
time Monday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The national telephone survey of 1,066 eligible but uninsured
parents was conducted between June 8 and July 6 by Wirthlin
Worldwide and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Children Evacuees Hold Reunion  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Peter Soundy was 12 when he arrived with his two
younger brothers in North Canton, Ohio, in 1940, part of a group of
small evacuees fleeing the war in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   They were all children of British employees of the Hoover Co.,
the famous kitchen goods manufacturer, which brought them across
the ocean to the company's hometown for what would become a
five-year sojourn to sit out the war.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, the remaining Hoover evacuees gathered
Wednesday to quaff champagne and rhapsodize about the delights of
escaping British rationing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was too exciting for us to be sad about leaving our
parents,'' said Soundy.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Robert Soundy, who was 8 at the time of the
evacuation, enthused: ''The ice creams were 10 times bigger and the
hot dogs were about a foot long. We hadn't seen hot dogs before.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ah, soda fountains,'' added Peter Soundy, a look of sheer
wistfulness stealing over his face.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, which prided itself on its socially enlightened
policies, sent 83 employees' children, aged 5 to 15, to North
Canton, where local people sheltered them for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover paid for their crossing, but foster parents were
responsible for their upkeep. Back home, their own parents
contributed to European children's relief funds.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty former evacuees made it to Wednesday's reunion, where
they toured the flamboyant, Art Deco Hoover building -- now owned by
supermarket chain Tesco -- and drank champagne among the roses on
the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It is from here on Aug. 9, 1940 -- the day before the Battle of
Britain began -- that the evacuation party set out, spending a night
in London with their parents before heading north to Liverpool to
board the Sameria, which took 10 days to zig-zag across the
Atlantic as it dodged submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very hard to let them go,'' said Charlotte Carter, 94,
whose daughter Eileen was on board. ''But we felt we had no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Vina Williams, organizer of the event, who was 10, remembers her
father running after the children's coach as it inched through

   ''It was a difficult time, and in 1941 the British parents
signed consent forms that if the Germans overran Britain our
American parents would look after us indefinitely,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a lot for the American parents to take on. But there
were far more people willing to help than there were children,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the youngsters returned with American accents and
dazzling tales of the relative lavishness of American life. Most
have kept in touch with their American families in the succeeding
decades.

   ''My initial memories were very good, lovely houses, beautiful
cars,'' said Fred Tilsley, now 73. But later on, he said, ''it just
faded a bit. The novelty of being English had worn off and we were
just foster children.''
</P>
<P>
   For Barbara Cramp, now 73, there is still no place like home.
''You got care, wonderful care,'' she said. ''But not love -- I used
to go to the cinema all day by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruthe Palmer, 11 when she left, said five years ''was a long
time to be away from home. There has always been an aspect in my
life which has never felt truly English.''

<HEADLINE> In closing arguments, lawyers ask jury to send a message to the world </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A jury began deliberations Wednesday to decide
how much a former Serbian wartime leader should pay for atrocities
committed by his soldiers in Bosnia as they tried to rid the
country of people unlike themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations started after lawyers for several woman who
were raped and brutalized during the war urged jurors to send a
message to the world that the horrors the women were subjected to
should never occur again.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you destroy the women of a community, you are destroying
that community,'' said Catharine A. MacKinnon, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs. ''When you destroy the women of a people, you destroy
that people.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments capped a week of testimony in a civil trial that
carried a potential for a mammoth jury verdict but little
likelihood that any money would be collected.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, is
an international fugitive. He was previously indicted by the U.N.
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, on charges of
genocide against other communities in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, he was represented in the case by lawyers until
he sent a letter to U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure, who was
presiding over the case. In the letter, Karadzic said he would not
defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you really hope to find truth or do justice or protect
rights for people in distant nations?'' he wrote. ''Do you really
believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy around
the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a step
toward peace or justice?''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the letter, Leisure found Karadzic in default,
leaving the jury only to determine the value of damages.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the trial, lawyers for the victims taped a
photograph of Karadzic to a chair at the defense table and put a
large poster of him in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   They took the poster down, however, after the first witness
fainted in front of the jury after telling how she and her two
children were taken from their home by soldiers who wore
photographs of Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon recalled for the jury in arguments Wednesday how the
woman was brutalized, undergoing repeated rapes over several months
in front of her children in ''a remote private concentration camp,
a shack for animals.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon described again the testimony of each of several
witnesses, all of them identified only by initials. As she spoke,
one jurors dabbed tears from her cheeks with a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was raped by Serbian soldiers only to be later denied
an abortion by a Serbian doctor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another, she added, was taken to a mine that was converted into
an underground makeshift theater where women were summoned by
number to be raped in front of a crowd of Serbian military men and
a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   There, the woman was raped and was forced to watch others die as
she was warned by guards that nobody would ever believe there was
an underground death camp, MacKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prove them wrong,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   She told the jurors that the tearful plaintiffs ''cannot go back
to what they were but they can go from this court better and more
whole than when they walked in.''

<HEADLINE> Titans' Thigpen Practices  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The long wait finally ended for Yancey
Thigpen on Wednesday when the wide receiver practiced with the
Tennessee Titans for the first time since last season.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen broke a bone in his foot in the AFC championship game
and he was forced to watch the Titans' 23-16 loss to the St. Louis
Rams in the Super Bowl. But it was his other ankle that had kept
him watching every practice during the first two weeks of training
camp as he had surgery on his left ankle in April and had been slow
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he finally passed his physical and was cleared to
practice. He caught a couple of passes, lined up beside new
receiver Carl Pickens for a few plays and even returned a punt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just kind of glad to be finally back on the field,''
Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a little ovation when I first got to the huddle. It was
fun to be back in the huddle with those guys. We have a lot of fun
on the field, and I miss it and didn't realize actually exactly how
much I missed it until I stepped into the huddle today.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Fisher said Thigpen looks like he might be able to
play in the Titans' exhibition game Monday night with the Rams.
Team officials had hoped Thigpen would be ready by then but had
held out the possibility that he might not be available until their
final exhibition game on Aug. 25 at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Thigpen nor Pickens caught a pass when lined up beside
each other on the left side during a 2-minute drill at the end of
practice. But it's a pairing, with Kevin Dyson on the other side,
that could be a potent combination for the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen said he isn't ready to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to talk about what we can do or what we will do.
I'd just like to go out and do it,'' Thigpen said. ''When the time
comes and we start to put up numbers and make some good plays, then
we'll talk about what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because the Titans signed Pickens, a two-time Pro Bowl
selection like Thigpen, as insurance. Thigpen has missed 13 games
during his first two seasons with the Titans with a variety of
injuries. Pickens missed only nine games in his eight seasons with
the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the receivers find themselves playing for a job. The
Titans kept seven receivers in 1997 but only six in 1998 and 1999,
and they need to impress since tight end Frank Wycheck has led the
team in receptions the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a change for the better,'' receiver Joey Kent said of
Pickens' arrival. ''I think now we have one of the best receiving
corps in the NFL. We have quality and depth.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' K. Smith Mulls Retirement  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys cornerback Kevin
Smith was looking forward to this season. After pushing his body
hard for months, he came to training camp healthier and stronger
than he had been in years.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Smith's optimism is gone and so is he. He
spent Wednesday at his Dallas-area home deciding whether to retire
after a nine-year career that began with Super Bowl titles his
first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kevin came in here with hopes of playing. At this point, he's
making some decisions based on how he feels,'' coach Dave Campo
said. ''I think he'll make a relatively quick decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team is making plans assuming
Smith is gone for good; however, if Smith does return, he would be
welcomed back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's his decision,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas already was in a bind at cornerback by having to replace
Deion Sanders. Veteran Ryan McNeil was signed to start on one side
and coaches were hoping Smith could hold down the other while three
draft picks cut their teeth in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Larrimore, a fourth-round pick, is the early frontrunner.
Seventh-rounder Mario Edwards also will see some action.
Second-rounder Dwayne Goodrich is nursing a hamstring injury, but
had fallen behind the other two anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year cornerback Duane Hawthorne is sidelined with a
strained left shoulder. Veteran Charlie Williams is still at least
a week away from returning to practice following offseason knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not at the point where I can say, 'We're going to line
up with this guy and this is what we're going to do.' But I feel
like whoever we line up there with, we're going to be able to get
the job done,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a first-round draft pick from Texas A&AMP;M in 1992. He
became a starter late in his rookie year and was part of Super Bowl
champion teams his first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won another Super Bowl his fourth year, but Smith
tore his Achilles' tendon in the opener and hasn't been the same
since.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before the injury, I considered him on the road to maybe being
a Pro Bowl player every year,'' said Campo, who was the secondary
coach Smith's first three years, forging a relationship that
remains close.
</P>
<P>
   Playing opposite Sanders the last four seasons exposed Smith's
weaknesses. Quarterbacks picked on him and he struggled to keep up,
often blowing assignments or getting flagged for pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   Smith reported to training camp last season with a back injury
and never got on track. He missed eight games because of the back
and other problems that stemmed from it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 30, was fresh and ready to start this camp, then hurt his
knee. He still started both preseason games, but quickly gave way
to the rookies who needed the playing time more.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he was out there he actually did a pretty good job,''
Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Smith met briefly with Jones and Campo and said he
was leaving. He cleaned out his dorm room and was gone before the
afternoon workout.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would consider offering Smith a position in the
organization and Campo said he thought Smith would be interested in
coaching. Larrimore, Edwards and Goodrich all have said that he did
his best to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was like a mentor,'' Larrimore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still could be in the market for veteran help. If
Smith retires, Dallas would have his base salary -- around $750,000
-- to use elsewhere. However, there would be a big hit on next
year's salary cap for the remainder of his signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's departure also leaves the Cowboys without yet another
link to their glory days of the mid-1990s. Michael Irvin and Daryl
Johnston retired this summer and offensive tackle Erik Williams
also is away from camp mulling retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Should Smith and Williams leave, only eight players would remain
from the Cowboys' most recent Super Bowl team in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Wright Done for Year  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jaret Wright's season is over, and the
Cleveland Indians are wondering when or if they'll have him for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wright will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder
next week in Los Angeles, the latest setback for a young pitcher
who just three years ago owned October.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Wright has a frayed labrum in his right
shoulder, and after getting a second opinion Tuesday from Dr. James
Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., the right-hander will have surgery on
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure will be performed by Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Anaheim
Angels' team physician, an Indians spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a setback for Jaret and a setback for the organization,''
Cleveland general manager John Hart said before Wednesday night's
game against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said Wright's injury appears to be isolated to only the
labrum and that the rotator cuff is sound. However, Hart said it's
impossible to predict when Wright may be back until after the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' Hart said. ''If it's
anything bigger than the labrum then obviously it's something that
goes into next year.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility that if Wright's surgery is more
extensive he might not be ready for the start of training camp,
Hart said. That will make it tough on the club should it look for
pitching help during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''It puts us in a situation that we don't know if we can count
on him for next year or at least the beginning of next year,'' Hart
said. ''We have other holes to fill. There are other places we
would like to put our money other than starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the injuries we've had this year, I'm not optimistic
about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's shoulder problems put him on the disabled list twice
this season. He has been on the DL four times since last year's
All-Star break. He tried to avoid surgery and was making his third
rehab start for Double-A Akron on Monday night when he had to leave
the game after throwing just 51 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Charlie Manuel said he spoke with Wright the
next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was down,'' Manuel said. ''He really didn't want to talk
about it. He's still a young guy and he has all the promise in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure seemed that way in the fall of 1997 when a 21-year-old
Wright, after beginning the year in the minors, twice beat the New
York Yankees in the AL playoffs and nearly pitched the Indians to
their first World Series championship since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He went 12-10 in 1998 -- his first full major league season -- and
looked as if he could become the No. 1 starter the Indians
desperately needed. But Wright had a disastrous '99 season, going
8-10 with a 6.06 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Wright only made eight starts in the second half last season and
got just one win as he was placed on the DL twice. His season also
included a five-game suspension for hitting Boston's Darren Lewis,
and he was summoned into then-AL president Gene Budig's office to
discuss his reputation as being a headhunter.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said Wright's shoulder problems could be traced to his
delivery, which is a bit stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've said for some time that Jaret's delivery is a little
violent,'' Hart said. ''It always has been. He's a bit of a
recoiler. But things happen. That's just the hazards of being a
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright went 3-4 with a 4.70 ERA in nine starts this season.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Soldiers Raid Chiapas Town  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARAISO, Mexico (AP) -- Hundreds of soldiers and federal agents
streamed into this tiny Chiapas village Wednesday with guns drawn,
looking for a shadowy paramilitary group that expelled about 90
residents and seized the village several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The agents searched the wooden shacks and fields for weapons and
about 20 men in blue uniforms who expelled sympathizers of the
leftist Zapatista rebels last week, accusing them of stealing local
land.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary fighters apparently fled the village when army
helicopters began scouting missions, and frightened villagers who
supported them streamed into the hills Wednesday morning when the
army raid began.
</P>
<P>
   ''The armed men went running up into the hills to avoid getting
arrested,'' said Diego Arcos, one of the expelled rebel
sympathizers who have been living in the hills out of fear of the
paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are dying of hunger. There are no tortillas and we're just
eating oranges and bananas,'' Arcos said. ''We're afraid to go back
to our shacks because the paramilitaries might attack us.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary fighters, who carried assault rifles and wore
black berets, blue shirts and bandanas, had warned villagers who
support the rebels against returning to Paraiso.
</P>
<P>
   A detachment of soldiers remained in the town to discourage any
further confrontations, and a representative of the pro-government
villagers began meetings in the nearby town of Yajalon with
pro-rebel residents in a bid to resolve their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas state Attorney General Eduardo Montoya had earlier
denied the existence of armed groups in the area, and accused The
Associated Press of fabricating articles and photographs from
Paraiso. On Wednesday, he said further investigation had confirmed
the authenticity of the AP reports and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The armed men -- like residents of Paraiso, mainly Chol and
Tzeltal Indians -- are apparently residents of a nearby village who
have been locked in a dispute with the pro-rebel villagers for
years over about 500 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, government commissions have given both groups title
to the disputed plot in Paraiso, 45 miles north of San Cristobal de
las Casas, the main city in the Chiapas highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Armed vigilante and paramilitary groups sprang up among
government supporters in Chiapas after the 1994 uprising by
Zapatista rebels, who demanded more democracy and Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
   The largest pro-government vigilante group in the area, Peace
and Justice, denied involvement in the expulsions, but said a
split-off group might have participated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't found any weapons, nor made any arrests,'' said
federal police officer Jorge Conejo Corona, the commander of
Wednesday's raid, but added: ''some people have volunteered to
testify.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a pro-government paramilitary group massacred 45 rebel
sympathizers in the Chiapas hamlet of Acteal.

<HEADLINE> Morris Agrees to Deal With Chiefs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVER FALLS, Wis. (AP) -- First-round draft pick Sylvester Morris
arrived at the Kansas City Chiefs' training camp Wednesday, giving
him five practices before his first exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Morris ended a 20-day holdout by agreeing to a seven-year
contract. Terms of the contract were not released but are reported
to be about $9 million for the first five years, including a
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew this day was going to come, and I couldn't wait,''
Morris said. ''I'm thrilled to be a Chief and to actually finally
get out here and get in my uniform and play with my teammates, get
hit a couple of times, and make some catches.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gunther Cunningham said he was pleased that Morris,
Jackson State's leading career receiver, was finally in camp and he
planned to put the rookie right to work.
</P>
<P>
   Morris will get five practices before the Chiefs break camp,
return to Kansas City on Saturday and then play San Francisco on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said Morris will see some action against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ''No question about it. That's why we drafted him,'' Cunningham
said. ''We're not going to play him a quarter, but we need to get
him as part of the team. (Wide receivers coach) Richard Mann has
been in touch with him a lot and Sylvester feels good about where
he is mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris's agent, Tom Condon, was reportedly seeking a four-year
deal, but the Chiefs wanted to sign the rookie to a five-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides eventually reached agreement on a seven-year deal
that can be voided in years 6 and 7 based on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs president Carl Peterson said he is confident Morris can
live up to the team's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not asking him to carry this football team, but we are
asking him to contribute and I know that he's going to do that,''
Peterson said. ''He's a tremendous young man with great ability and
he's got a great family, and as I told him, I'm looking forward to
seeing his folks in Arrowhead dressed in red.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 6-foot-3 and 205 pounds, could add a threat to a group
of receivers that has caused some doubts. Andre Rison had a subpar
season last year on the field and then ran into legal problems in
the off-season. Derrick Alexander emerged as the big play threat --
catching 54 passes for 992 yards -- but was inconsistent at times.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Tony Gonzalez has become quarterback Elvis Grbac's
favorite target -- he beat triple coverage Saturday for the Chiefs'
only touchdown in a 14-10 loss to Tennessee -- but is not a deep
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he has been working out on his own while his
teammates have been in camp and is familiar with the Chiefs
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''By me coming to mini-camps and the rookie camps, I was able to
get a pretty good foundation of what the offense was and what
they're doing with the calls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they've put a few new things in, but I'm just ready
to get in the meetings and get back into it. I don't think it will
take too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, the 21st overall pick, caught a school-record 175 passes
in four years at Jackson State. He also ranks second in school
history with 3,188 receiving yards and 36 touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Creates Sports Doping Panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton established a White House
panel on doping in sports Wednesday that will recommend ways the
federal government can combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of drugs in sports has reached a level that endangers
not just the legitimacy of athletic competition but also the lives
and health of athletes,'' an executive order signed by Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year found the rate of steroid use among young
people has risen 50 percent among young people of both sexes,
Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
   The task force members will be appointed by White House drug
policy chief Barry McCaffrey, various federal agencies and advisory
boards. It will include members of a separate study panel on the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton created the panel by executive order, meaning he does
not need approval from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the former anti-doping official for the U.S. Olympic
Committee accused his former colleagues of hampering his fight
against drugs. Dr. Wade Exum also claimed he was denied promotions
and opportunities because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   Exum alleged in a federal lawsuit that the committee evaded its
responsibility to screen and discipline athletes for drugs in its
quest to produce medal-winners. Without naming names, Exum claimed
to know of competitors who tested positive for
performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic trials and went on to
win medals at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating allegations he made when he resigned in protest in
June, Exum said in the lawsuit that about half the American
athletes who have tested positive for prohibited substances have
gone unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   USOC chief executive officer Norm Blake said those allegations
have not been documented.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Romanowski Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski
has been charged with using diet drugs prescribed for his wife and
a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The four felony charges were announced Wednesday at the team's
training camp in a case that dates to 1998 and also includes
Romanowski's wife, Julie.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Romanowski declined comment, but his lawyer, Harvey
Steinberg, said they will fight the charges, which he said
''concern a medication that is routinely prescribed and was
prescribed for Bill after consultation with his doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a benefit to us,'' Steinberg added. ''There has been
a cloud of suspicion over Bill, and this will give him the
opportunity to clear his name once and for all and put the rumors
and innuendo that have been circulating to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Springer, Romanowski's other attorney, said, ''We're
confident that when the truth comes out, Bill will be vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski could receive between two and nine years in prison if
convicted on all four charges, although probation would also be
possible, said Mike Knight, spokesman for the 18th Judicial
District.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is Phentermine, which some doctors believe helps
athletes by speeding up their metabolisms. Others, however, say the
drug is of little or no use to athletes wishing to enhance their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan defended Romanowski, saying
the prescription drug he was taking ''is not against any NFL
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said he doubted Romanowski would be subject to any
immediate NFL sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you were accused of something, wouldn't your employers wait
to see what happens, if you were guilty or not guilty? Let's let
due process take care of itself,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone is guilty, he'll pay the price. If he isn't, he can
clear himself instead of having those innuendoes of what did or
didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing his impatience with the legal system, Shanahan said,
''This has been going on since September '98. It seems like it
takes a little while to get things done around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski was indicted by a grand jury on Tuesday with one
count each of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and
obtaining a controlled substance by fraud and deceit and two counts
of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Romanowski will be issued a summons requiring him
to appear in court, probably in Douglas County, on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a street drug and it's not a drug that has any
value,'' Steinberg said. ''Interesting enough, for the first time
in any reported case we could find, Mr. Romanowski is charged with
conspiring with his doctor to possess Phentermine. It's pretty
clear that Phentermine was prescribed by his doctor based on his
doctor's evaluation of Mr. Romanowski's needs. So we have a
situation that's never occurred before.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg called the case a ''witch hunt'' by a ''DEA agent who
just wouldn't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer called the charges ''bizarre and unusual'' and
questioned both the timing and the nature of them. He insisted
Romanowski would not accept a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four other people were indicted in the case,
including Julie Romanowski. She faces eight counts of fraudulently
obtaining a controlled substance and conspiracy and will be
arraigned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities contend Julie Romanowski and others conspired to
obtain Phentermine for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Bill Romanowski worked with his
wife; a friend, Loretta Johnson; Dr. Randall Snook; and possibly
other, unnamed people to get Phentermine seven times between
September 1998 and January 1999. Snook pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor and received 18 months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says Romanowski and the others agreed to
cover up their alleged actions if questioned by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pleaded guilty in January to conspiring to illegally
obtain a prescription drug. If she complies with court orders and
stays out of trouble for a year, the conviction will not go on her
record permanently.

<HEADLINE> Web sports gambling defendant sentenced to 1 year and 9 months in prison </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A San Francisco man who operated a sports
betting business on the Internet was sentenced Wednesday to one
year and nine months in prison after a judge rejected a request by
his lawyer that he serve no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Cohen, 33, formerly of Woodmere, N.Y., was sentenced for his
jury conviction on charges that he violated the U.S. Wire Wager Act
by accepting bets and wagers on sporting events from Americans over
the Internet and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Wire Wager Act prohibits using telephone lines in
interstate or foreign commerce to place sports bets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your honor, I did not mean to violate the law and I'm asking
that you don't send me to prison. That's all I'm going to say
today,'' Cohen told U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa just
before he was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Griesa briefly considered imposing less prison time as he heard
Cohen's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, argue that his client thought he
was acting legally when he set up the business in Antigua in time
for 1997's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said he could not stray from the low range of what
federal sentencing guidelines required because he believed Cohen
either knew what he was doing was illegal or he purposefully failed
to consult lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He also imposed a $5,000 fine, saying he did not fine Cohen more
because he believed the prison sentence was enough punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case should
serve as a lesson to anyone operating an offshore sports betting
service that an Internet communication is no different than a
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law criminalizes taking bets from Americans using
interstate and international phone lines, whether those phone lines
are connected to regular telephones or to personal computers linked
to the Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As this case demonstrates, persons convicted of operating
Internet sportsbooks offshore face very serious consequences -
imprisonment and thousands of dollars in fines,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, 10 defendants had pleaded guilty in connection with the
same prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was president of World Sports Exchange, a sports betting
company that advertised for customers in U.S. newspapers and
magazines, inviting gamblers to visit its Internet site or call a
toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was among 22 defendants charged in March 1998 with
operating offshore companies which took bets from Americans over
the Internet or on telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 10 who plead guilty in connection with the original
cases, three others have pleaded guilty to related misdemeanor
counts and seven - including three alleged coconspirators of
Cohen's - remain fugitives.

<HEADLINE> Volcano South of Tokyo Erupts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A volcano on an island off Tokyo erupted Thursday,
belching black ash into the sky but causing no immediate injuries
or damage, a local observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of Mount Oyama on Miyakejima island, the fourth in
a month, began at 6:59 a.m. and shot up a column of dark smoke and
ash as high as 2,000 yards, said local observatory official Shinji
Takase.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,670-foot volcano last erupted on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The ash was blowing northeast away from the island, 120 miles,
south of Tokyo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Island authorities ordered residents on the northern part of
Miyakejima to evacuate to a public community center, said municipal
official Izumi Asanuma. She said she didn't know how many residents
were affected by the order.
</P>
<P>
   She some island roads were cordoned off because falling ash
reduced visibility. But there were no immediate reports of ash
causing injuries or damage to housing or automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of recent volcanic activity on Miyakejima began
June 26. More than 2,000 people were ordered to evacuate for a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanologists said an undersea eruption occurred off Miyakejima
on June 27. Mount Oyama then erupted July 8, July 14 and 15. No one
was injured in those eruptions. The island has about 4,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Since late June, Miyakejima and nearby islands have been jolted
by tens of thousands of earthquakes, including more than 11,900
strong enough to be felt by humans.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, a man was killed by a landslide following a magnitude
6.4 earthquake on the nearby island of Kozushima.

<HEADLINE> Giants 9, Brewers 3  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jeff Kent hit a grand slam and put his RBI
total over 100 for the fourth straight year as the San Francisco
Giants swept the Milwaukee Brewers with a 9-3 victory Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Rueter (8-7) scattered five hits over seven innings and
drove in his first run of the season as the Giants won their fourth
straight.
</P>
<P>
   With San Francisco up 1-0 in the second inning, Paul Rigdon
(0-2) walked Marvin Benard, Bill Mueller and Barry Bonds to load
the bases for Kent, who hit the first pitch into the left-field
bleachers for his 27th homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kent's first grand slam this season and the ninth of his
career. His last came Sept. 3, 1999, at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The home run also gave Kent 102 RBIs, putting him past the
century mark for the fourth straight season. He is the seventh
player in the history of the franchise to record four consecutive
100 RBI seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller hit a solo home run off Rigdon in the first inning that
bounced along the walkway atop the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter's RBI single in the third inning off Everett Stull put
the Giants up 6-0. San Francisco pitchers have driven in runs in
four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Snow added an RBI double for the Giants in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' first run came on Jose Hernandez's RBI double off
Rueter in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard hit a run-scoring triple and Richie Sexson added an
RBI grounder for the Brewers in the eighth inning off reliever Doug
Henry.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the eighth, Felipe Crespo's sacrifice fly
scored Ramon Martinez before Armando Rios' RBI triple brought home
Snow, who had three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter, who lost two of three previous starts, last won on July
20 against the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, acquired by the Brewers in a July 28 trade with the
Cleveland Indians, was making his third start with the Brewers. He
lasted just two innings, allowing five runs on three hits and six
walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brewers manager Davey Lopes was back in the dugout
Wednesday after missing Tuesday night's game with the flu. Bench
coach Jerry Royster had replaced him. ... The Brewers have been
swept four times this season, including the three-game series
against the Giants. ... Kent joins six other Giants with four
consecutive 100 RBI seasons: George Kelly, ''Irish'' Meusel, Bill
Terry, Mel Ott, Willie Mays and Barry Bonds. ... Giants starters
have 24 RBI. ... The Giants finished their homestand 6-1 and have
won 17 of their last 20 home games. Their 39-18 record at Pacific
Bell Park is best in the majors. ... Kent has hit safely in nine
straight games. ... Shawn Estes leads all Giants starters with 10
RBIs, and Livan Hernandez has eight.

<HEADLINE> Giants Sign Rueter Through 2003  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants signed left-hander
Kirk Rueter to a new three-year contract on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter (8-7) got news of the deal after he pitched the Giants to
a 9-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. He scattered five hits
over seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it here,'' he said. ''My family is comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rueter's 78-46 lifetime record gives him the third-highest
winning percentage, at .629, among left-handers in the major
leagues since 1980. He trails only Arizona's Randy Johnson and the
Yankees' Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter was acquired by the Giants with pitcher Tim Scott in a
July, 1996 trade with the Montreal Expos for pitcher Mark Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter is San Francisco's first left-hander since Vida Blue to
win at least 13 games in three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Report: Most Day Traders Lose Money  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few people ever make money in day trading and
most of those who lost, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars,
didn't know beforehand how risky the practice is, Senate
investigators concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on
investigations was based on the panel's eight-month inquiry into
the day-trading industry. It was released Tuesday by Sen. Susan
Collins, R-Maine, the subcommittee's chairman, and Sen. Carl Levin
of Michigan, its senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Day trading clearly is a gamble for most traders, but
certainly not for the (day-trading) firms,'' Collins said in a
statement. ''They make money whether their customers do or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee held hearings on day trading in September and
February, which showed that day-trading firms often accept people
as customers who shouldn't be trading and improperly raid
customers' accounts to make loans to other investors to keep them
trading.
</P>
<P>
   One of the witnesses was Alyce Wenzel, who testified that before
her son Scott Webb was shot and killed by fellow day trader Mark
Barton in Atlanta in July 1999, she was unaware he had borrowed
$30,000 from another investor. Barton shot and killed nine people
at two day-trading firms before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Glued to their computers, day traders ride the stock market's
ups and downs, trying to squeeze out profits by rapidly buying and
selling shares electronically. Host firms provide trading
facilities, computers and specialized software for their customers,
who pay the firms a commission on each trade.
</P>
<P>
   The day-trading industry has defended its practices, maintaining
that most day traders can make money after six months or so.
</P>
<P>
   The new report notes that the subcommittee was not proposing a
ban on day trading but was seeking to make day-trading firms more
accountable and the public more aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, also has criticized practices of the day-trading
industry and has said some firms have used deceptive advertising to
lure investors.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC recently approved a rule requiring day-trading firms to
warn investors in writing of the risks before they open an account.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a self-policing brokers' group filed a complaint
against All-Tech Direct Inc., one of the biggest day-trading firms,
and three of its top executives.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the SEC sued All-Tech and four executives of the
firm in federal court for allegedly making trading loans to
customers that exceeded legal limits.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech, based in Montvale, N.J., is contesting the SEC lawsuit
and disputing the complaint by the National Association of
Securities Dealers.

<HEADLINE> Food Agency Leaves Sudan After Bomb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A new bombing attack Wednesday on relief facilities
in a rebel-held area of southern Sudan has led the World Food
Program to evacuate its workers from the area, the U.N. agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   A top Sudanese official, however, immediately denied that his
government's forces were behind the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nine bombs were dropped by low-flying aircraft near the facility
in Mapel in the latest attack, the Rome-based food agency said. No
injuries were reported. The agency said the facilities were
''targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-led relief flights in southern Sudan were also temporarily
suspended following the bombing of the aid base Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These violent attacks are totally unacceptable and we strongly
condemn them,'' said the WFP's executive director, Catherine
Bertini, in a statement. ''They show there is no respect for aid
workers trying to help innocent Sudanese.''
</P>
<P>
   The WFP said eleven aid workers would be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Mapel is some 37 miles southeast of Wau, the
government-controlled capital of Bahr al-Ghazal province.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese officials said they were not behind the bombings, but
claimed that some Western aid groups are using the relief operation
as cover to provide assistance to the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our government honors all clearances it issues for relief
flights,'' Sudanese Commissioner for Relief, Sulaf Eddin Saleh,
said. But he added that ''it has the full right to defend itself
after the U.N. and the world community failed to halt the
violations by the rebel movement of the cease-fire in the south.''
</P>
<P>
   The SPLA is seeking autonomy for the largely Christian southern
part of the country from the predominantly Muslim and Arabized
north.

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Seven of the 11 people killed when two
airplanes collided in midair over a Burlington County neighborhood
Wednesday were civilian employees of the U.S. Navy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim was a police officer who also worked as a flight
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy identified its seven employees as: Angelo George of
Toms River, a program manager; Cynthia Kovacs of Robbinsville, a
mechanical engineer; Robert Polo of Barnegat, a logistics
management specialist; Michael Simodejka of Toms River, a logistics
management specialist; John Vail Jr. of Howell, a program manager;
John Zukow of Toms River, an engineering technician; and David
Dahlen, a contractor. The Navy did not release their ages.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were pilots Daniel Groff and Joseph Mari, who worked
for Patuxent Airways, of California, Md., the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight instructor Craig Robinson, 28, of Hamilton Township, also
was a nine-year veteran of the Washington Township Police
Department in Mercer County.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the department as a dispatcher in 1991 and was
promoted to police officer in 1994, said Lt. Ralph Fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson worked as a flight instructor for Hortman Aviation. Its
owner, Herb Hortman, said he knew Robinson well, and spoke to his
family after hearing of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hortman said Robinson was an experienced pilot and had between
1,800 and 2,000 hours of flying time. The student with him also was
a licensed pilot who was working on his commercial license, he
said. His identity was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Hortman Aviation is located about two miles from Northeast
Philadelphia Airport, where Robinson and the student took off
Wednesday morning, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aviation is like any other industry. It has its pleasures, and
it has its dangers,'' Hortman said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is survived his wife, Tara, and a 7-month-old son,
Fiasco said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our thoughts and prayers are with the family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   George, 39, managed engineering programs at the Lakehurst
facility, said a family friend, Dennis McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a wonderful son, friend, brother and father,'' McCarthy
said. Survivors include his wife and children, McCarthy said, but
he would not be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlen, 57, of Warminster, Pa., retired in 1989 after spending
26 years as a career officer in the U.S. Navy, where he was a
commander in the supply corps. He then went to work for Information
Spectrum Inc., a defense contractor based in Annandale, Va., said
co-worker Fran Poole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to distill somebody's life in a few sentences, but
he was a good man. I know everybody says that, but when you really
think of a good man, you think of David. I've never seen him upset.
Whatever you asked him to do, he did. He was very friendly, one of
those good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlen was an avid NASCAR fan, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lived and breathed NASCAR. He was a diehard Jeff Gordon
fan. But his first hobby was his family. He was a devoted father
and devoted grandfather. They were a very close-knit family.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlen is survived by his wife, Gail; a daughter, Debbi Kirsch,
of Lansdale, Pa., and his 2-year-old grandson, Andrew Kirsch.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the home at the Simodejka residence
Wednesday evening declined to talk to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at the Polo residence said it was
''not a good time to talk.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rewards Prompt Loan Payment  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will reward students who pay
their government loans on time by lowering the interest rate on
some loans, saving students and their parents an estimated $600
million over the next five years, the White House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which Clinton will detail in an address Thursday at
DePaul University in Chicago, has two components.
</P>
<P>
   First, those making new loans directly from the federal student
loan system will receive an immediate interest rebate equal to 1.5
percent of the loan. The White House estimates that will affect 1.7
million students in this coming academic year.
</P>
<P>
   The average undergraduate could save $150 on every $10,000 in
student loans, the administration said. Over a standard 10-year
loan, this rebate amounts to an interest rate reduction of 0.24
percentage points per year, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Students and parents must make their first 12
payments on time to retain this benefit, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, students who consolidate existing loans under the
federal student loan system will get a 0.8 percentage point break
in their interest rate. That would save more than $500 annually for
a student with $10,000 in loans, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   As with the interest rebate, borrowers must make the first 12
payments on time to keep the better rate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can make those changes simply by telling the Education
Department to comply. He does not need congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''These new steps reflect the president's commitment to making
college more affordable and to insuring college debt is not a
barrier to community service,'' said White House spokesman Elliot
Diringer.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that good payment habits in the first year help
keep students on pace to repay their loans on time. Students who
make their first 12 payments on time are three times more likely to
repay than other borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   A government report last fall found defaults on federal loans to
students were their lowest in more than a decade of tracking: 8.8
percent in fiscal 1997, down from 9.6 percent the year before. The
loans go to students at more than 7,000 vocational schools, college
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent data available show federal student loans in
1999 totaled $42.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Students often take out a combination of federal and private
loans to get through college and advanced schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after receiving their college diplomas, only 16
percent of student borrowers were debt-free, a new federal study of
1993 graduates has found. About half of those surveyed -- 51 percent
-- incurred debt averaging $10,000 each. The debt averaged $66,200
for those who completed a professional degree by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also announce Thursday that starting next year,
teachers can get a break on their loans if they stay in inner
cities, isolated towns and other places where teacher retention can
be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers could write off up to $5,000 in loans after five
consecutive years of teaching in a school the Education Department
classifies as needy.
</P>
<P>
   The new benefit, which will take effect six months after Clinton
leaves office next year, will only apply to new teachers. Those
with loans taken out before Oct. 1, 1998 are not eligible.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge says town law unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge has struck down a town
law regulating adult entertainment that was drawn up specifically
to conform to the standards approved by New York's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Barrington Parker found that the Town of Ramapo, in
Rockland County, ''effectively prohibits a constitutionally
protected activity'' - nude dancing. Its law differs from New York
City's, which was upheld by the state Court of Appeals in 1998,
because in forcing its only adult establishment to move, it left
hardly any place in town for it to go.
</P>
<P>
   He also ruled that because the local law was not specific enough
about which sort of businesses were to be regulated, it gave too
much discretion to the town's Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
   Ramapo's law was adopted in 1997 after rabbis from the town's
large Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish community complained to town
officials that T&AMP;A's, a nude dancing establishment, was ''an
inappropriate distraction to the men,'' Parker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance was based on New York City's, which had recently
been upheld in state Supreme Court in a case brought by the topless
club Stringfellows. That law, designed to decentralize adult
entertainment, was a key weapon in the movement to make Times
Square more presentable.
</P>
<P>
   When the Court of Appeals also upheld it, it also effectively
approved laws in Albany, Rochester, Binghamton, Yonkers and
Peekskill.
</P>
<P>
   Ramapo's law prohibited adult entertainment within 1,000 feet of
a school or church or within 500 feet of a day care center,
residential district or another adult business.
</P>
<P>
   T&AMP;A's, on Route 59 in the unincorporated hamlet of Monsey, would
have had to move because it was only 800 feet from a school. But it
was granted an injunction while it challenged the law. A non-jury
trial was held last December.
</P>
<P>
   Parker found that while New York City's law left 4 percent of
the city's land available to adult establishments, Ramapo's left,
at most, 0.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amount of usable land reserved by Ramapo is ... far
smaller than the amount that passed constitutional muster in
litigation involving other municipalities and consequently denies
T&AMP;A the reasonable alternative avenues of expression to which it is
entitled,'' Parker wrote. In effect, he said, it bars adult
entertainment entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Town Supervisor Herbert Reisman and Town Attorney Alan Simon
said that because they had not discussed the ruling with each
other, they could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Clark, who represented T&AMP;A's, said the decision was the
first to strike down an adult entertainment law since New York
City's was approved and ''affirms that local officials cannot
trample upon the First Amendment merely because they don't like or
approve of certain types of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision closes the floodgates that were opened in
Stringfellows,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 5, Tigers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Jose Mercedes pitched into the eighth inning to
win his fourth straight decision as the Baltimore Orioles beat the
Detroit Tigers 5-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes (7-4) limited the Tigers to two runs on five hits with
six strikeouts and a walk in seven-plus innings. Mercedes is 6-2 as
a starter -- the only Baltimore starter with a winning record. He
rejoined the rotation when Scott Erickson went on the disabled list
July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Ryan Kohlmeier got the last three outs for his second
career save.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (8-3) had a three-game winning streak snapped after
he allowed five runs on 10 hits in seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Macias homered for the Tigers, who have lost five of six to
Baltimore and are 2-4 with one game left in their homestand.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles took a 5-1 lead, with a three-run sixth, on
consecutive run-scoring singles from Delino DeShields and Albert
Belle and a bloop RBI double from Brook Fordyce.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Minor doubled and scored on Luis Matos' triple up the
right-field gap before Brady Anderson's sacrifice fly gave the
Orioles a 2-1 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit led 1-0 after an inning as Damion Easley scored from
second when shortstop Melvin Mora couldn't handle Juan Gonzalez's
hard smash for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Macias hit a solo homer, his second, in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Belle was 0-for-10 in the series before his single in the
sixth. He's batting .188 (12-for-64) in his last 16 games. ...
Easley has batted leadoff in Detroit's last four games and reached
safely in the first inning every time. ... Tigers LF Bobby
Higginson was 0-for-4 with three strikeouts Wednesday and is just
4-for-23 (.174) in the current homestand. ... Kohlmeier, recalled
from Triple-A Rochester on July 28, earned saves in both Orioles
wins this series.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Astou Ndiaye-Diatta scored 19 points
and Wendy Palmer added 17 Wednesday night as the Detroit Shock
closed the season with a 66-63 victory over the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The victory wasn't enough because Washington beat Cleveland
earlier in the evening to clinch the final Eastern Conference
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock and Mystics finished with identical 14-18 records, but
Detroit lost all three meetings to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   New York's loss didn't mean anything either, as it won the East
with a 21-11 record. Tari Phillips led the Liberty with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit led 33-29 at halftime behind 14 points from
Ndiaye-Diatta and 11 from Palmer, then increased the margin to 10
by scoring the first six points of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock led 49-42 when word reached the bench that Washington
had won.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty later went on a 9-0 run and tied the game at 57 on
Crystal Robinson's 3-pointer with 4:10 left.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer made one of two free throws to give the Shock a 62-61
lead with 1:19 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Ndiaye-Diatta blocked Vickie Johnson's layup at the other end,
and Elena Tornikidou increased the margin to three with a short
jumper with 27 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Teresa Weatherspoon's layup made it a one-point game, the
Liberty fouled Tornikidou, who made both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Hammon's 3-point attempt missed at the buzzer.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Democrats welcome Gore  </HEADLINE>
by DENISE LAVOIE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Vice President Al Gore held a rally in
town Wednesday, but the appearance belonged to his running mate,
favorite son Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman appeared together at the Italian Center of
Stamford, where more than 1,000 people listened as Gore introduced
a ''son of Stamford'' to a raucous crowd in the city where
Lieberman grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of people also lined the streets near Lieberman's
boyhood home to welcome the Democratic ticket to Connecticut.
Earlier Wednesday the two visited Gore's hometown of Carthage,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   As the motorcade drove by Lieberman's mother's home, Lucas
Isidro, a 55-year-old Stamford police officer, put up a 4 foot by 8
foot American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love Joe Lieberman,'' he said. ''I'm very proud of him. I
think he stands for everything I believe in - the American dream,
home, family values, integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds on both sides of the street chanted ''Go Joe, Go Joe,''
and screamed when Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah waved from their
car.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the overflowing banquet room, the rally had the feel of a
rock concert, and those attending waited in lines up to a half-hour
long just to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a point of reading signs such as ''Joe Rocks'' and
''Al's got great taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree with that,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman appeared choked up on several occasions as he spoke
about being back home. He held up the front page of the local
newspaper, The Advocate, which had a banner headline reading,
''He's coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was introduced by Vida Lionetti, his former high
school girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like the homecoming king,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Connecticut, this is a magic moment, everybody feels it,''
said Peter Kelly, a Democratic fund-raiser and longtime supporter
of both Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Marcus, the state party chairman, said the excitement over
Lieberman's choice extended beyond Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a great a sense of pride in the entire state of
Connecticut,'' Marcus said. ''History has truly been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech was briefly interrupted by a Ralph Nader
supporter, who held up a Nader for President sign and called the
election a ''sham.'' The crowd drown him out by chanting ''Joe,
Joe, Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman replied that he also is a fan of Nader, whom he called
''another son of Connecticut.'' Lieberman said he admires Nader, a
Winsted Native, ''in general, but not in particular in this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Police led the man away and Lieberman resumed speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's elevation to Gore's running mate has energized
Connecticut politics, particularly as the fate of Lieberman's
Senate seat remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Lieberman can run for both offices
simultaneously, and he has said he intends to do so. If elected
vice president he would have to resign from the Senate and
Republican Gov. John G. Rowland would appoint a replacement, who
would serve until the next statewide election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman could also quit the race as late as Oct. 27 and
still be replaced by a Democratic Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats at the rally made a point of saying they want
Lieberman to run for both offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut residents will be honored to have the opportunity
to vote twice for Joe,'' said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal,
who is considered the leading Democrat to replace Lieberman if he
decides not to run.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of hometown pride reverberated over and over during
the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sends tingles down my spine to think that a kid can grow up
in Stamford, attend public schools, and through sheer grit and
intelligence grow up to become the next vice president of the
United States,'' said Senate Majority Leader George C. Jepsen,
D-Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   The pride in the choice of Lieberman led a local Democratic
leader to predict that many people in her Republican-dominated town
would vote Democratic this year.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Tuck, the Democratic first selectman in the town of
Sherman, said her husband, a Republican, giggled when he heard that
Gore had chosen Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he thought the Democrats would win now. Even he said
he might vote for Gore-Lieberman,'' she said.

<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Trans World Entertainment Corporation, a
specialty retailer of music, outpaced analysts' predictions and
increased earnings 27 percent in the second quarter, the company
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the quarter that ended July 29 was $6.7 million,
or 14 cents a share, compared with a net income of $5.7 million -
11 cents per share - in the comparable 1999 quarter. Analysts had
predicted the earnings would remain at 11 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter that ended July 29, Trans World had total sales
of $285.5 million, compared with $277.3 million for the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company credited part of the upswing to the integration of
its mall and freestanding stores with its Internet business,
according to Robert J. Higgins, chairman and chief executive
officer. In the second quarter, traffic on the company's e-commerce
site increased more than 70 percent to 1.9 million visitors, up
from 1.1 million in 1999.

<HEADLINE> UN OKs S. Leone Diamond Certifying  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sierra Leone's government won approval
from the U.N. Security Council late Wednesday to start certifying
diamonds, clearing the way for the African nation to leagally
export its precious gems.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the council banned the purchase of Sierra Leone
diamonds without a government certificate in a bid to strangle the
ability of the rebel Revolutionary United Front to finance the
country's nine-year civil war using so-called ''blood diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   During a two-day U.N. hearing last week, the Sierra Leone
government outlined a proposed new regime for the legal mining and
export of diamonds -- and the Security Council committee monitoring
sanctions against the rebels approved it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a major step,'' said Bangladesh's U.N.
Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, who chairs the sanctions committee.
''It will really bring in hopefully some legitimate earnings into
the coffers of the Sierra Leone government, which hopefully will be
used for the well-being of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who relaunched the war in May, still control about
90 percent of Sierra Leone's diamond mining areas. The ban on rebel
diamond exports is part of a Security Council campaign to help the
government reassert its control over the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions committee wants the new certification program to
start operating as soon as possible although the Sierra Leone
government said it could take 90 days, Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will send the government letters asking it to
speed up the process and to report back in 90 days on the system's
effectiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's hearing, Sierra Leone's Minister for Mineral
Resources Mohammed Deen said the certificates of origin -- developed
with the United States, Britain, Belgium and Israel -- would be
numbered, on forgery-proof security paper. A matching numbered
label on the sealed parcel of rough diamonds, with a warning that
any tampering is a violation of the Security Council resolution,
must be returned by the recipient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Diamond High Council in Antwerp, the world's
largest diamond trading center, has offered to design and set up a
new electronic database of Sierra Leone diamond exports, with
electronic confirmation of their arrival at the destination. New
digital photographs of the diamonds will also accompany the
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Antwerp last month, the international diamond
industry adopted strict new measures that track diamonds from mines
in conflict areas to the jewelry store and announced a ban on
dealers that buy or sell ''blood diamonds.''

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Fuad Serageddin Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Fuad Serageddin, the grand old man of
Egyptian politics and leader of the biggest opposition party in
parliament, died Wednesday of a heart attack. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Serageddin was admitted to hospital on Monday for low blood
pressure and diabetes, his al-Wafd party said in a statement. He
died in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Serageddin's career dated back to before the 1952 revolution,
when al-Wafd frequently was part of the government. He rose to
leading positions in the party while still in his 30s, and served
in the Cabinet five times between 1942 and 1952.
</P>
<P>
   After the Free Officers' coup toppled the monarchy and abolished
all political parties, Serageddin became a tireless campaigner for
democracy.

<P>
   President Gamal Abdel Nasser's government detained him several
times and he served three years in prison before being put under
house arrest, Serageddin's longtime deputy in the party, Nooman
Gomaa, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Serageddin revived al-Wafd in 1978 when President Anwar Sadat
allowed the formation of parties. But he fell out with Sadat within
a year and froze the party's activities. He was detained on Sadat's
orders in 1981, Gomaa said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he revived the party again under the administration of
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Serageddin regenerated the party to ''lead the battle for
democracy and fight corruption in Egypt,'' al-Wafd said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The party has only five members in the 455-seat People's
Assembly, but this is the largest single opposition group.
Serageddin was not one of the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Gomaa said the funeral will take place on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Serageddin is survived by two daughters.

<HEADLINE> 11 dead in collision of two small planes over southern New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Two small planes collided over
a southern New Jersey suburban neighborhood Wednesday, killing 11
people and sending part of the wreckage plunging onto a house,
setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The couple inside the house, about 10 miles south of Trenton,
fled unharmed after the 8 a.m. crash, and no injuries were reported
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Five bodies and the fuselage of the larger plane landed in the
garage of that house, and another victim fell through the roof of a
garage two blocks away, police said. Three more bodies fell from
the sky into nearby athletic fields, some still in their airplane
seats. The bodies of a flight instructor and student pilot from the
second plane fell into a soybean field, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 searchers combed a 2-square-mile area looking for
airplane debris and body parts, and planned to continue until dark,
said New Jersey State Police Maj. Barry Roberson.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time we are classifying this as a midair collision,''
said Arlene Salac, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators examined sections of the larger aircraft before
dark, but were not able to visit the area where the smaller plane
fell, said Robert Benzon, the investigator in charge for the
National Transporation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in radar, aircraft performance and operations will
join representatives from the U.S. Navy and from the plane
manufacturers, Benzon said. The planes involved did not carry
flight recording devices commonly known as ''black boxes,'' Benzon
said. Benzon said NTSB investigators would interview witnesses to
try to determine the angle the aircraft came together.
</P>
<P>
   Seven passengers, all civilian Navy employees, and two crew
members were on a chartered Piper Navajo from the Lakehurst Naval
Air Engineering Station, Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   The second plane, a Piper Seminole from Northeast Philadelphia
Airport, carried a flight instructor and a student, officials said.
The instructor was identified as Craig Robinson, 28, of Hamilton
Township, who also worked as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Lakehurst spokesman Lawrence Lyford said the plane from
Lakehurst was a daily shuttle flight, operated by a private
contractor. The plane goes to Trenton, then to the Naval Air
Engineering Systems Command at Patuxent River Naval Air Station,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   Five passengers boarded at Lakehurst. Two others got on when the
plane landed at Trenton-Mercer Airport, Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on board the Lakehurst plane were identified by
Navy officials as Angelo George of Toms River, a program manager;
Cynthia Kovacs of Robbinsville, a mechanical engineer; Robert Polo
of Barnegat, a logistics management specialist; Michael Simodejka
of Toms River, a logistics management specialist; John Vail Jr. of
Howell, a program manager; John Zukow of Toms River, an engineering
technician; and David Dahlen, a contractor with Naval Inventory
Control Point, of Warminster, Pa. Their ages were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members were identified as Daniel Groff and Joseph Mari,
employed by Patuxent Airways of California, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said it was cloudy with 10-mile
visibility at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of the house that was hit by the falling wreckage
ran out as it caught fire. Homeowner Ed Trzaskawka said he was in
bed, and his wife, Cathy, had just gotten out of the shower when
the plane crashed into their garage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another few feet and it would have been in my ear,''
Trzaskawka said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud explosion, then a roar and the house shook,
then immediately ignited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife ran out the front door, saw that their front
lawn was ablaze, and escaped out the back, taking their dog with
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Antoinette Carnivale said she saw the two planes
collide. ''I saw smoke and flames and pieces coming down,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Janet Brown, said she heard a neighbor
screaming. When she ran out, Brown said she could see smoking
pieces of a plane scattered in a soybean field behind her
condominium and could feel the heat from the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was horrible. It's so close to home,'' she said. ''It could
have landed on the condos and engulfed more homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman visited the home hours after the crash.
Cathy Trzaskawka is a former employee in the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can look for a bright side to all this, it is a miracle
no one on the ground was hurt. It's a miracle they survived,''
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Piper Navajo was registered to Tigress Aviation, Inc. of
California, Md., according to FAA spokesman John Clabes.
</P>
<P>
   FAA records show no accidents or incidents involving that plane,
Clabes said.
</P>
<P>
   The second plane was a 1978 Piper Seminole owned by Paul W.
Adams, of Seaford, Del., according to FAA spokesman Roland Herwig.
FAA records report one ''minor'' incident involving the plane's
landing gear in 1989, Herwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was aboard that plane, had been a patrolman with
the Washington Township (Mercer County) Police Department since
September 1994, according to Washington Township police Lt. Ralph
Fiasco. He was hired as a dispatcher in 1991, Fiasco said.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a flight instructor for Hortman Aviation, based in
northeast Philadelphia. He was an experienced pilot with 1,800 to
2,000 hours of flying time, company owner Herb Hortman said.
</P>
<P>
   The student also was a licensed pilot working on his commercial
license, he said. He was not immediately identified.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Military Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed into law a bill
raising military pay by 3.7 percent and increasing Pentagon
spending for next year by $20 billion. ''Our high military
readiness must remain our top national security priority,'' he said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act
without fanfare. The bill, passed late last month on a 90-10 Senate
vote, allots $288 billion for military needs.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was disappointed that the legislation did
not address some of his priorities, such as money for a facility to
destroy chemical weapons in Russia, while reducing funds for other
key programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The resulting cuts are troubling,'' Clinton said. But he said
he was pleased that lawmakers did provide military personnel with a
pay increase and military retirees with prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have signed this bill because, on balance, it demonstrates
our commitment to the military, meets our obligations to the
troops, maintains readiness and funds modernization efforts that
will ensure our technological edge into the 21st century,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pay raise, the bill includes a 9 percent
increase in funds for military health care. Spending on those two
items alone would be $988 million above this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the bill includes $75.8 billion for military personnel;
$100 billion for operations, maintenance and working capital funds;
$59 billion for weapons procurement, $41.4 billion for research and
development; and $14 billion for other Pentagon programs and
classified amounts for foreign intelligence activities by the
department, the CIA and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4576.

<HEADLINE> Jury Rejects Padre Island Damages  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A jury that determined a New York
lawyer had swindled a Mexican-American family out of the riches of
Padre Island said Wednesday the aging lawyer doesn't owe punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the all-Hispanic jury agreed that Gilbert Kerlin, 90,
had cheated the Balli family out of the island's oil profits. It
awarded the family $1.1 million in compensatory damages, then
return Wednesday to determine possible punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 family members had asked for a $25 million chunk of
Kerlin's $68.3 million fortune, but the jury decided not to punish
Kerlin with further fines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already won and money was never the issue. We need to put
this haunting past behind us,'' said Rebecca Gomez Sexton, a
plaintiff in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Balli heirs sold their stake in the tropical island to
Kerlin in 1938. An ancestor had inherited it from Padre Nicolas
Balli, the island's namesake, who received it in a 1765 Spanish
land grant.
</P>
<P>
   In the sale, Kerlin agreed to share the island's oil riches with
the family, but the relatives said they never heard from the lawyer
again.
</P>
<P>
   Balli attorney Britton D. Monts said Kerlin ''cast aside the
Balli family. He lived it up and he grew his wealth while many
members of this family lived in abject poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerlin's lawyer M. Steve Smith said: ''It has been very, very
difficult for him to defend his name.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final plea, Monts asked the jury to change the fortunes of
a family that for generations complained of land loss to Anglo
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you do now is for all time,'' Monts said, ''what you are
doing is about to become a part of history.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Judicial Watchdog Quits  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A top official who spearheaded an
overhaul of Venezuela's court resigned Wednesday, saying cronyism
within a commission hand-picked by President Hugo Chavez's
coalition has corrupted efforts to reform the country's courts.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Molina, Inspector General of the Courts, said a judicial
reform commission has repeatedly thwarted his attempts to remove
corrupt or negligent judges. He also accused the commission of
purging the nation's courts of corrupt judges only to appoint their
own political allies to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''By staying in this office I would be a lame duck within a
process in which I no longer believe. This process in the hands of
this commission has no hope,'' Molina told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation casts a shadow over a key component of Chavez's
so-called revolution to end corruption in the poverty-stricken but
oil-rich South American country of 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Molina headed up an investigation that lead to the dismissal of
more than 100 of Venezuela's 1,300 judges on charges ranging from
embezzlement to nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the commission often refused to approve his
recommendations to sack corrupt judges who have personal ties to
some of the panel's members.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Molina and members of Chavez's leftist
political movement erupted two months ago, when Molina asked the
commission to fire a judge who ordered the arrest of a newspaper
editor for defaming the president of Congress, Luis Miquilena.
</P>
<P>
   Miquilena, who is Chavez's political mentor, asked Molina to
stay out of the case. The commission then absolved the judge and
allowed him to stay in place.
</P>
<P>
   Molina said the commission's ruling was ''the last straw'' that
prompted his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Dallas NAACP Head Quits on Remarks  </HEADLINE>
By APRIL CASTRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The president of the Dallas branch of the NAACP
resigned Wednesday after he was suspended for criticizing Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, the first Jew on a major political party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Lee Alcorn, said on Monday that Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore's selection of the Connecticut
senator as a vice presidential running mate was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   The comment sparked outrage from Jews and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume suspended Alcorn on Wednesday
morning, saying he found the comments about Lieberman to be
''anti-Semitic and anti-NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Alcorn resigned and said he had anticipated
breaking with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't support the leadership of the NAACP. Large amounts of
money are being given to them by large corporations that I have a
problem with,'' said Alcorn, who announced the formation of his own
civil rights group, the Coalition for the Advancement of Civil
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   He later apologized during an interview on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have used a poor choice of words in my expression that came
out of frustrations with both the Democratic and Republican
Party,'' Alcorn said. ''In retrospect, I do see that this was an
instance of me misspeaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a KHVN talk radio show Monday, Alcorn said: ''If we
get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this
movement for, you know? Does it have anything to do with the failed
peace talks?''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn continued, ''So I think we need to be very suspicious of
any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level
because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money
and these kind of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume had condemned the remarks as ''repulsive'' and
''anti-American.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are proud of our long-standing relationship with the Jewish
community,'' he told The Dallas Morning News in Wednesday's
editions, ''and I personally will not tolerate statements that run
counter to the history and beliefs of the NAACP in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including George W. Bush's rival presidential campaign,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Jewish groups, also condemned the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to fighting anti-Semitism, Governor Bush and
Secretary (Dick) Cheney stand shoulder to shoulder with all
Americans in condemning such foolish utterances,'' said Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''NAACP National President Kweisi Mfume
deserves praise and credit for immediately leading the condemnation
of Mr. Alcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, where he received the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, Jackson said he strongly supported Lieberman's addition to
the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we live our faith, we live under the law. He is a
firewall of exemplary behavior,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn said Tuesday that his comments were ''taken pretty much
out of context.'' In an interview with The Associated Press, he
said the statements were his and not the NAACP's and were not
intended to be ''anti-Jewish, but anti-Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not excited about Lieberman for those reasons. It has
nothing to do with him being Jewish. The (school) vouchers is the
No. 1 thing, and he has a real conservative record as we look at
his political history,'' Alcorn said. ''I don't see where he has
been a champion for African-American concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his statements reflected ''something that is generally
known about Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a second-term senator from Connecticut, has advocated
some test use of vouchers to allow poor children to attend private
school.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Kill Spanish Army Officer  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Basque gunmen shot and killed a Spanish
army officer Wednesday, authorities said, less than 24 hours after
car bombs blamed on the separatists killed one person and injured
11.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim, 2nd Lt. Francisco Casanova Vicente, was shot
twice in the back of the head as he drove into the garage of his
house on the outskirts of the northern city of Pamplona, according
to local Interior Ministry official Miguel Angel Baron. Casanova's
11-year-old son reportedly found the body.
</P>
<P>
   No group claimed responsibility for the shooting, but Defense
Ministry officials in Pamplona attributed the attack to the Basque
group ETA. The shooting followed a spate of attacks blamed on the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Basque business federation leader Jose Maria Korta
was killed when a car bomb exploded outside his factory in the
Basque town of Zumaia. ETA has frequently targeted the region's
business sector with shootings and extortion threats.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, 11 people were injured when a car bomb exploded in
a residential area of the Spanish capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a car laden with 55 pounds of explosives blew up in
the Basque city of Bilbao in northern Spain, killing four suspected
ETA terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Euskal Herritarrok, a party closely linked to ETA, expressed its
regret Wednesday to Casanova's family but called for talks, not
condemnations, to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If ETA's responsibility in Wednesday's shooting is confirmed,
the soldier will be the organization's ninth victim since it ended
a 14-month truce in December. Casanova, 47, was married with two
children, a 17-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ETA normally claims responsibility for its attacks weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed his condolences to the families of
the victims of the latest wave of attacks. ''We stand with the
people of Spain who condemn these cowardly acts, and hope the
perpetrators will be brought swiftly to justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid and other cities across Spain, thousands of people
took part in five-minute silent protests outside city halls
Wednesday in condemnation of Tuesday's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors, meanwhile, filed charges of advocating
terrorism against a spokesman of Euskal Herritarrok who praised
four suspected ETA members who died in the Bilbao explosion Monday
as ''patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors asked the Basque region's Superior Court to
order Arnaldo Otegi in for questioning to consider whether to
prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   A single round of talks between ETA and the government of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar during the truce last year proved
fruitless. ETA insisted on negotiating independence while the
government would only discuss disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said the renewed violence
was aimed at forcing the government to declare a state of emergency
in the Basque region ''to bring the conflict to a head.''
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose initials are a Basque language acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom, is blamed for nearly 800 deaths since 1968 in
a campaign to create an independent state.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 12, Athletics 1  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tino Martinez hit a grand slam and an RBI double
as the New York Yankees dealt Kevin Appier his worst loss ever,
routing the Oakland Athletics 12-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (13-6) took a shutout into the eighth inning and
won his fourth straight start. Jorge Posada and Bernie Williams hit
solo home runs as New York sent the A's to their fourth loss in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   A night after Williams and David Justice homered on consecutive
pitches for a ninth-inning win, the Yankees went to work early on
Appier (10-9).
</P>
<P>
   Appier gave up a career-high 10 runs in only 3 2-3 innings.
Making his 303rd lifetime start, he allowed seven hits and hurt
himself with six walks.
</P>
<P>
   Appier was 3-1 with a 2.27 ERA in seven previous career starts
at Yankee Stadium. Among those was a victory May 30 in which
Martinez homered.
</P>
<P>
   Posada hit a solo homer in the second, then the Yankees added
five runs in the third. A bases-loaded walk to Justice set up
Martinez's eighth career slam -- New York was 1-for-25 with runners
in scoring position over five games until that drive to right
field.
</P>
<P>
   Appier retired the first two batters in the fourth before
Williams singled, Justice walked and Martinez doubled home a run.
After an intentional walk loaded the bases, Doug Jones relieved and
gave up Scott Brosius' three-run double that made it 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 earned runs were charged to Appier, who twice permitted
nine runs in a game since breaking into the majors in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Williams homered into the black-painted section beyond the
center-field fence in the sixth. It was the 19th ball hit into that
area since the remodeled Yankee Stadium opened in 1976, including a

nifty plays. In the sixth, he made an outstanding stop of Luis
Sojo's grounder and flipped to 2B Frank Menechino, trying for a
force play on Brosius. Menechino thought it was the third out and
rolled the ball toward the mound, but umpire Mark Carlson called
Brosius safe. Pitcher T.J. Mathews had to scramble for the ball to
prevent Clay Bellinger from scoring from third. ... The Yankees
have averaged 8.3 runs in Pettitte's 22 starts.

<HEADLINE> 16 Former Pinkerton Guards Accused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Sixteen security guards who worked for a
security company that made its name chasing down Wild West train
robbers have been accused of stealing more than $1.5 million in
merchandise from trains they were hired to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ''These officers were operating outside the course and scope of
their employment by us,'' said James Fox, a spokesman for Westlake
Village, Calif.-based Pinkerton.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were padding the (theft) reports,'' U.S. Customs Service
special agent John Kelley said at a Wednesday news conference. ''If
there were 100 TVs missing, they took 20 more and then they
reported that 120 were missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The stolen items included computer components, stereos,
microwave ovens, televisions, cellular phones, automotive tool
sets, fax machines, and even pistachios and cheese balls. Some of
the items were recovered in the former security guards' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 15 of the former security guards have been
convicted and are serving sentences ranging from 18 months in
prison to three years of probation.

<HEADLINE> US Jury Debating Serb Leader's Pay  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury on Wednesday began deliberations to
determine how much former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, who
remains a fugitive, should pay for atrocities committed by Serbian
soldiers in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Ten women who were raped and brutalized during the war sued
Karadzic under a 221-year-old U.S. law that allows foreign citizens
to sue foreign officials and citizens for violating the law of
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the women on Wednesday urged jurors to send a
message to the world that such horrors can never occur again.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you destroy the women of a community, you are destroying
that community,'' said attorney Catharine A. MacKinnon. ''When you
destroy the women of a people, you destroy that people.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments capped a week of testimony in a civil trial that
carried a potential for a mammoth jury verdict but little
likelihood that any money would be collected.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic was indicted five years ago by a U.N. war crimes
tribunal on charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil case, U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure found
Karadzic in default after receiving a letter in which Karadzic said
he would not defend himself. The ruling left only the question of
damages for the jury to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you really hope to find truth or do justice or protect
rights for people in distant nations?'' Karadzic wrote. ''Do you
really believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy
around the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a
step toward peace or justice?''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the trial, lawyers for the victims taped a
photograph of Karadzic to a chair at the defense table and put a
large poster of him in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The poster was removed after the first witness fainted after
telling how she and her two children were taken from their home by
soldiers in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon repeated the woman's story during closing arguments
Wednesday, describing how she was repeatedly raped over several
months in front of her children in ''a remote private concentration
camp, a shack for animals.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon told the jurors that the plaintiffs ''cannot go back
to what they were, but they can go from this court better and more
whole than when they walked in.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Cabinet Offers To Resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- President Gustavo Noboa's 14-member
Cabinet offered to resign late Wednesday to give him more options
in dealing with a leadership battle among lawmakers, the
presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has split the legislature into two factions.
Congresswoman Susana Gonzalez, a political independent, won the
congressional presidency in a vote by lawmakers last week, but the
conservative Social Christian party has challenged her victory in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Alfredo Negrete did not say if Noboa had
accepted the resignations, nor did he explain how the move would
help resolve the leadership battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet members ''considered it necessary to provide the
president full political leeway by presenting their collective
resignations,'' said Negrete.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis worsened as the opposing factions of lawmakers held
separate congressional sessions Tuesday, each group the accusing
the other of convening illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa has told both groups he will not recognize any new
legislation until the leadership issue is settled by the court.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 3, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal's ninth-inning sacrifice fly
scored Doug Glanville with the winning run as the Philadelphia
Phillies beat the San Diego Padres 3-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Eric Owens made a strong throw to the plate, but
Glanville got his left hand around the glove of catcher Ben Davis
to score.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville led off the ninth with a triple down the left-field
line off Heathcliff Slocumb (2-4). Owens had a chance to make a
play on Glanville's hit, but crashed into the wall and let
Glanville reach third safely.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu and Scott Rolen were then walked intentionally to
load the bases for Lieberthal.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock (6-5) Pitched a hitless ninth for the victory. All
of his wins have come in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Witasick threw seven strong innings and left with a 2-0 lead
but got a no-decision in his second start with the Padres. He
yielded five hits -- allowing just one baserunner past second base --
walked two and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Donne Wall surrendered a RBI triple to Rolen, who
also singled and doubled in a 3-for-4 night. Rolen scored the tying
run on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   John Mabry's double off starter Kent Bottenfield gave San Diego
a 1-0 lead in the second inning. Dave Magadan hit a two-out RBI
double off Vicente Padilla in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield threw seven strong innings, allowing just one run on
three hits, in his second start since being obtained from Anaheim.
He struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   After the Boone double, Bottenfield retired the final 12 batters
he faced.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Padres 3B Phil Nevin was a late scratch from the starting
lineup because of tightness in his right groin. ... Pat Burrell
made his debut in left field for the Phillies and collected an
assist in the eighth inning, throwing out Magadan at home plate.
The rookie played 63 games at first base. Travis Lee started at
first. ... Third baseman Rolen hasn't committed an error in 26
games. ... Glanville's fifth-inning single extended his hitting
streak to 10. ... 2B Bret Boone made a great running basket catch
to rob Glanville of a hit in the seventh. ... Witasick was 3-8 with
a 5.94 ERA in 22 games (14 starts) with Kansas City.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 5, Twins 4, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Miguel Cairo scored on shortstop
Cristian Guzman's error in the 10th inning as the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo opened the inning by drawing a walk off LaTroy Hawkins
(2-3) and went to third on Fred McGriff's one-out single. Cairo
scored when Guzman mishandled Jose Guillen's grounder, on which
Guillen was credited with an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Taylor (1-1), the fifth Tampa Bay pitcher, allowed one hit
in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays nearly won it in the ninth. Jason Tyner had a
one-out single and stole second but he was thrown out at the plate
by left fielder Jacque Jones on pinch-hitter Aubrey Huff's single.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff hit his 20th homer, marking the 13th season he has
reached at least 20 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay right-hander Dave Eiland, activated from the disabled
list before the game, allowed two runs and seven hits in six
innings in his first outing since May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota starter Eric Milton went seven innings, giving up
three runs and seven hits. He won his past three starts, allowing
just three runs in 23 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays took a 3-2 lead in the sixth inning on Russ
Johnson's two-out, two-run single. The Twins tied it in the seventh
on Guzman's eighth homer of the season off Doug Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded runs in the eighth. Jay Canizaro had an RBI
single for the Twins, while Greg Vaughn hit his 21st homer off Bob
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins opened the scoring on Torii Hunter's RBI single in the
second inning. Hunter is 13-for-24 during a seven-game hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   A run-scoring single by Ron Coomer put Minnesota ahead 2-0 in
the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff homered in the fourth to make it 2-1. He went 72 at-bats
since his last homer, a July 17th shot off Atlanta's John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Canizaro appeared to get hit in the face by a piece of a
bat he shattered during a fifth-inning at-bat. ... To make room for
Eiland, LHP Mike Duvall was optioned to Triple-A Durham. ...
McGriff has 410 career homers. ... Former Twins C George Mitterwald
threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

<HEADLINE> Bargaining continues as restraining order goes into effect  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Verizon Communications said picket lines in the
New York area were quieter Wednesday, one day after a Manhattan
judge issued a restraining order against striking workers.
</P>
<P>
   But police also reported several new isolated incidents of
vandalism and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 50 to 60 phone lines were cut at the State
University of New York's Maritime College at Fort Schuyler. The
incident disrupted phone service to the college, on-campus state
police and some Coast Guard lines, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Workers of America spokeswoman Candice Johnson
said it was ''unfair'' to blame the union for ''every record of an
outage. Cables are cut everyday by construction workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some type of inert substance was also thrown from the roof of
Verizon's headquarters on 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue Wednesday.
No one was injured, but several police officers' uniforms were
stained by the material, which a police report described as ''fluid
containing bird excrement.''
</P>
<P>
   Union and management blamed each other for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Michael Brody of Manhattan, was arrested at the request
of management for trespassing inside a Verizon facility Tuesday
night, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County police said they had arrested a man, who they
identified as Bell Atlantic employee Joseph Ventimiglia of
Hicksville, in Roslyn Wednesday morning for slashing the tire of a
Bell Atlantic van.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester, state police announced the arrest Wednesday of
Verizon field technician David Taylor Brown, of Pound Ridge, for
allegedly severing wires in a telephone connections box on Tuesday
morning. The damage left customers in Pound Ridge without phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Smith, a Verizon spokesman, said a restraining order issued
Tuesday by state Supreme Court Justice Louis York, which requires
pickets to stay at least 10 feet from Verizon facilities, had given
police the ability ''to manage some of our more troublesome work
sites. Picket lines are much quieter and incidents with rocks and
bottles being thrown have diminished dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside a Verizon facility near Police Headquarters in downtown
Manhattan, about 50 protesters walked a picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we want is job security. Why can't they (Verizon)
understand that?'' said Joan Murray, 32, a customer service rep.
''We're not here to make trouble. We're out here to make a point.
Most of us know how to behave properly, but there's a few bad
apples.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to take our jobs someplace else when there's
plenty of qualified people here,'' said Robert Johnson, 34, a CWA
electrician. ''The bosses don't understand that we do all the hard,
manual work that makes money for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed in June by the merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE Corp. Unions fear the company could move work to areas that are
cheaper or have less of a union presence or force employees to
relocate. The company says it needs flexibility to distribute calls
depending on the level of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Some 72,000 CWA workers and 14,700 International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers struck Verizon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile bargaining continued in Washington in the four-day old
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall framework for an agreement seems to be in place,''
Smith said. ''The devil is in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The union, in a statement, said: ''Members' most important
issues haven't been addressed yet and the strike continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides New York, the strike affects Delaware, the District of
Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West
Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Noted French Writer Killed by Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Louis Nucera, a noted French writer impassioned by
cycling and winner of the Grand Prize of the Academie Francaise,
was struck and killed by a car while riding his bike on Wednesday
in southern France. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Nucera was cycling on a small road in the Mediterranean village
of Carosse, near Nice, on Wednesday morning when he was hit by a
car trying to overtake another vehicle, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the driver of the car, an unidentified 30-year-old
man, could face charges of involuntary homicide. An investigation
was opened into the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1928 in Nice, Nucera turned to writing late in life
after working as a bank receptionist and a journalist among other
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   His career as a prolific writer of books began after he joined
the publishing house Jean-Claude Lattes as literary director, in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1976 book ''King Rene,'' dedicated to cyclist Rene
Vietto, Nucera began a series of works dedicated to his passion for
cycling. ''Path of the Lantern'' won the Interallie prize in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   For his works, the Academie Francaise awarded Nucera its Grand
Prize in 1994 and he was decorated in May with France's National
Order of Merit.

<HEADLINE> International Custody Case Ends  </HEADLINE>
By GIOVANNA DELL'ORTO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- An eight-month international custody standoff came
to an end Wednesday when Italian officials escorted a woman and her
two ailing daughters on a flight home from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The three had holed up at the Italian Embassy in Kuwait in
defiance of a court order there awarding custody to the father.
</P>
<P>
   A Kuwaiti court finally agreed to allow their return Wednesday
after Italy said the girls had grown seriously ill during their
months at the embassy, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry official accompanied the three home Wednesday
on a special flight that arrived in the northern Italian city of
Turin just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Stefanina Atzori, had charged that her former
husband abused her and her daughters, a charge the man -- a citizen
of both Italy and Egypt -- denies. They were divorced in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the eldest daughter fled to the Italian Embassy
after a court placed her in her father's custody. In June, the
mother and her other daughter also took refuge in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not specify the ailments of the girls, who have
been identified only by pseudonyms. But published photos show the
oldest daughter, 13, looking very gaunt.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has lived in Kuwait for 12 years, Atzori said in
June that she wanted to return to Italy, ''where women are
protected by law and where we have the same rights as men.''
</P>
<P>
   In a June statement, the father wrote that the Kuwaiti courts
did not think it in the interest of Muslim girls to grow up in the
West. The mother said she converted to Islam three years after she
was married.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the father on Wednesday.

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kenny Lofton's three hits sparked the top of
Cleveland's batting order Wednesday night and the Indians inched
closer in the AL wild-card race with a 6-4 victory over the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton went 3-for-3, drove in two runs and scored twice in the
leadoff spot as the Indians won for the seventh time in eight
games. Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar, Cleveland's Nos. 2 and 3
hitters did their share, as the trio went 5-for-7 with five RBIs,
three runs, three sacrifices and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   The win, coupled with Oakland's 12-1 loss at New York, moved the
Indians within 1&AMP;frac12; games of the Athletics for the playoff wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland will play three games at Oakland next week and three
more at Jacobs Field on Aug. 22-24.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Gabe Kapler extended the AL's longest hitting streak this
season to 23 games with a bad-hop RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's streak is one shy of matching Arizona's Tony Womack for
the longest in the majors this season, and one short of the
Rangers' club record.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Speier (3-1) relieved starter Dave Burba in the fifth and
pitched two perfect innings, striking out four. Bob Wickman worked
the ninth for his fourth save in five tries since joining the
Indians last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians got to Matt Perisho (2-4) for two runs in the third
inning on Vizquel's RBI double and David Segui's run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, Vizquel and Alomar all drove in runs as Cleveland added
three more in the fourth to chase Perisho, who allowed five runs
and seven hits in 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and second, Lofton doubled to score Wil
Cordero and Vizquel followed with a sacrifice fly, scoring Jolbert
Cabrera. Alomar's single scored Vizquel, and for one of the few
times all season, the Indians' 1-2-3 hitters were clicking on all
cylinders offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Burba pitched out of a two-on, none-out jam in the second inning
but found himself in trouble again the third.
</P>
<P>
   As the skies darkened around Jacobs Field, Texas loaded the
bases with two outs and had Kapler, riding his hitting streak,
coming up when a severe thunderstorm stopped the game for 43
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, Burba struck out Kapler on a 2-2 pitch to
keep the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   But Burba, whose was originally scheduled to start Monday but
was pushed back because of a blistered index finger, couldn't get
out of the fifth as the Rangers cut it to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto, who went 4-for-4 Tuesday, hit an RBI double
and Rusty Greer followed with a two-run single to end Burba's
night.
</P>
<P>
   Speier came to the rescue, though, popping up Rafael Palmeiro
and striking out both Kapler and Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler kept his streak alive in the seventh, hitting a chopper
toward second that bounded over Alomar's head and into center.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mickey Rivers hit in 24 games in a row for Texas during the
1980 season. ... Former Cleveland Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar
attended the game. ... Beginning Friday, the Indians will play 12
straight games -- six each -- against the Seattle Mariners and A's.
... The Indians are now 18-9 in games where Lofton gets more than
one hit. ... The Cleveland bullpen held Texas to one hit over the
last five innings.

<HEADLINE> Royals 5, Blue Jays 3  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Mike Sweeney had three hits, including a
three-run homer, as the Kansas City Royals beat Toronto 5-3
Wednesday night, the Blue Jays' eighth loss in nine road games.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who has 39 singles and three homers in his last 42
hits, connected off Steve Trachsel in the third for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A batter earlier, Toronto shortstop Alex Gonzalez failed to
touch second and threw wildly to first on a potential double-play
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel (6-11) went five innings, giving up five runs on eight
hits, and remained winless in eight starts. His last victory was
with Tampa Bay on June 27 when he beat Toronto. He is 0-1 in two
starts with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Suppan (6-6), who is 4-0 in his last six starts, got the
victory. He went eight-plus innings, allowing 11 hits, three runs
and no walks, striking out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez had an RBI single in the first for Toronto, which
got another run in the third on Shannon Stewart's 15th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon singled leading off Kansas City's fourth and Rey
Sanchez grounded to second baseman Mickey Morandini. But Damon was
safe at second when umpires said shortstop Gonzalez did not touch
the bag after taking Morandini's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Damon then got up and sped to third as Gonzalez's throw to first
sailed over Carlos Delgado's head.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who hadn't homered since July 18, then hit a 1-1 pitch
over the fence in left. With two outs, Todd Dunwoody's RBI single
made it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista added an RBI double in the ninth for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Byrdak got two outs in the ninth before Andy Larkin got the
final out for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals got a run in the first on Joe Randa's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Carlos Febles and shortstop Sanchez bailed Suppan
out off a jam with a beauty of a double play to end the seventh.
With a runner at third and one out, Morandini hit a sharp grounder.
Febles made a good stop to his right near the bag and flipped the
ball backhanded to Sanchez, whose strong throw barely nipped the
runner at first.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Blue Jays plan to bring RHP Joey Hamilton back on
Sunday from his Triple-A rehab assignment in Syracuse. They are not
certain when he will rejoin the roster. ... Febles made a fine play
in the first when he dived to his left and did a bellyflop to stop
Delgado's grounder. ... Three of Stewart's 15 home runs have been
off Suppan, who leads the majors with 30 homers allowed. ...
Toronto CF Jose Cruz robbed Gregg Zaun of extra bases when he ran
down his liner in the gap. ... The Blue Jays have homered in 96 of
116 games.

<HEADLINE> 'Daughter of God' Gets 25 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who called herself the
''daughter of God'' was sentenced Wednesday to 25 years in prison
for masterminding a string of New Year's Eve armed robberies to
support an opulent lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Richelle Denise Bradshaw, self-proclaimed Queen Shahmia, denied
ever telling her ''manservants'' to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ''God is going to have his way. If prison is where he chooses I
go, I go with a beautiful smile,'' Bradshaw told Circuit Judge
Thomas Reese before sentencing. ''I have not deceived. I have not
lied. I am Queen Shahmia.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Felicia Wilcox disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendant is without remorse and does not accept
responsibility for her behavior,'' Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors had convicted Bradshaw of seven felony counts on July 3
after a follower testified Bradshaw directed her entourage to go
out and ''plunder the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw, 34, could have been sentenced up to 85 years in prison
for conspiracy to commit robbery, five counts of robbery and grand
theft. Investigators said two convenience stores, two restaurants
and a theater were held up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw's nomadic ministry group included her husband, Phillip
Bradshaw, four followers and eight children. They traveled around
Florida living on donations and staying in luxury hotels,
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek Forces Kill Up to 15 Militants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Uzbek forces have killed up to 15
Islamic militants from a group that crossed into a remote region of
the Central Asian nation, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The militants crossed into Uzbekistan from Tajikistan over
several days, and so far have killed and wounded 10 at least Uzbek
soldiers. They are believed to be followers of an Islamic
separatist movement aiming to create a religious state in the
mountains where Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan merge.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman with the Uzbek Defense Ministry said the borders of
all three countries are sealed and the remaining militants are
trapped in a gorge 300 miles southwest of the Uzbek capital,
Tashkent. It was not immediately clear how many militants remained
there.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbek forces are pounding the militants with air and artillery
raids, but will not launch a ground attack to avoid any more
government casualties, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The government's claim that the militants were surrounded was
impossible to verify, but militants have repeatedly avoided
government troops in the past by sticking to remote mountain paths
linking Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Central Asia has struggled to stem a flow of militants, arms and
drugs across its borders, which sit on a major smuggling route from
Afghanistan to Europe. Last year, militants occupied mountainous
areas of Kyrgyzstan near Uzbekistan for over a month before some
were killed and the rest scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Tajikistan also remains gripped by violence and poverty,
following a five year civil war between government troops and the
Islamic opposition.

<HEADLINE> OAS Mission Meets With Peru Sides  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A high-level mission from the Organization of
American States brokered an agreement Wednesday for negotiations
between President Alberto Fujimori's government and its opponents
to push forward democratic reforms in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, led by OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria, said
both sides have agreed to begin face-to-face talks in two weeks.
Eduardo Latorre, the outgoing foreign minister of the Dominican
Republic, will mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has arrived for the government and the opposition to
sit at the table,'' Gaviria told reporters. ''I would say that for
the first time, we have as much of a government proposal as a
proposal from the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition held huge protests after Fujimori won an
unprecedented third term in a May 28 runoff boycotted by his
opponent, Alejandro Toledo, who charged that results were being
rigged. OAS monitors refused to observe the ballot, calling the
election far from ''free or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The OAS, an organization of 34 countries in the Western
Hemisphere, is pressing Fujimori for guarantees of press freedom
and judicial independence and reforms to the electoral process. It
also is calling for oversight of the armed forces and intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Gaviria and Latorre met Wednesday for more than an hour with
Fujimori, who has promised to loosen his authoritarian grip.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo told reporters Wednesday that a three-hour meeting with
the OAS mission and other opposition leaders was marked by ''points
of agreement and disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This process of democratization inevitably will lead to new
elections,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has said he has no intention of stepping down before
his five-year term is through. His ministers say they expect to
have the bulk of OAS reforms in place before 2002 municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports said Wednesday that under a proposed government
timetable the military and intelligence service will be
restructured within seven months.

<HEADLINE> Oil Washes Up on Florida Beaches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- U.S. Coast Guard investigators boarded
ships Wednesday in Miami and Port Everglades, trying to determine
which crew dumped oil off the South Florida coast, creating the
area's worst oil spill in at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The oil contaminated 15 miles of beach. It has not injured any
wildlife but the long-term environmental effects are undetermined,
Coast Guard Commander Richard Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   Some endangered and threatened sea turtles are about to hatch,
and oily debris block their path to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Some beaches reopened to swimming Wednesday after officials
determined the oil is not too toxic. All beaches along the 15-mile
stretch were closed Tuesday when the oil was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard investigators took oil samples from about a dozen
recently arrived ships to try to match its chemical composition to
the dumped oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every oil has a unique fingerprint,'' said Brad Benggio, a
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist. For
example, he said traces of nickel and other metals found in a
ship's oil could match quantities in the oil that was spilled.
</P>
<P>
   If the investigation identifies any suspects, the crew and the
ship's owner could face criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous volunteers came Wednesday to John U. Lloyd Beach State
Recreation Area near Hollywood to clear oil-covered seaweed from
sand where thousands of green and loggerhead sea turtles are about
to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 nests, each containing about 110 eggs, are expected to
hatch within the next week, with another 150 nests expected to
hatch in the next month. The mothers buried the eggs in sand about
20 yards from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials fear the turtles could get stuck in the gooey
seaweed and die. Green turtles are an endangered species, while
loggerheads are threatened, meaning their possible extinction is
slightly less imminent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soccer Shakes Up Lineup  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   Needing a win to get out of last place in its World Cup
qualifying group, the United States will bring back two forwards
and change its goalkeeper for its game against Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore and Brian McBride, who missed the first two
qualifiers last month because of injuries, were among 18 players
picked Wednesday by U.S. coach Bruce Arena for the game at Foxboro,
Mass., on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we fall short of three points in either game, our task will
be increasingly difficult,'' U.S. coach Bruce Arena said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Keller, the top U.S. goalkeeper, was dropped so he could
concentrate on UEFA Cup qualifiers for his Spanish team, Rayo
Vallecano.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Brad Friedel, who is with Liverpool but didn't play much
for the team last season, probably will start. Tony Meola of Kansas
City, the starter for the Americans at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups
and the top goalkeeper in Major League Soccer, also was picked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brad had played a number of games with us the last year and he
was in the last camp,'' Arena said during a conference call. ''He's
obviously more familiar with our players, what we're trying to do
tactically, and that gives him an edge on Tony at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Arena picked six new players, also adding defenders
Gregg Berhalter and Carlos Llamosa, and midfielder John O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Dropped were Keller; defenders Chad Deering and Robin Fraser,
midfielders Frankie Hejduk and Ben Olsen; and forward Jason Kreis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the strongest roster we've fielded in a long time,''
Arena said. ''It gives us some very good players coming off the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States opened with two games on the road, tying
Guatemala 1-1 and losing to Costa Rica 2-1. In both games, the
Americans gave up a goal in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had to do it again, I would have picked more MLS
players,'' Arena said. ''The European-based players we had in the
first two games weren't as fit as they needed to be, simply because
they were out of season. You could see they hit the wall after 60,
65 minutes. That's a mistake on my part. I know the players gave
everything they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was somewhat of a sensation last spring, scoring eight
goals in 19 games for Everton, one of England's top teams, before
injuring a ligament in his right knee on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a guy who hunts for goal,'' Arena said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who hasn't played for the United States since November,
said the recovery has taken him longer than expected, but he has
been starting in Everton's preseason games and will head to the
United States after Everton's final exhibition game, this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   All the Americans realize the pressure they're under. Guatemala
(1-0-1) leads the group with four points, Costa Rica and Barbados
(each 1-1) have three apiece and the United States (0-1-1) is last
with one.
</P>
<P>
   The top two teams in the group advance to next year's six-nation
finals in the North and Central American and Caribbean region,
which will produce three qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team obviously needs a win,'' Moore said. ''To me, we've
got to win all our home games. To me, this first game in Boston is
crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States also has home games against Guatemala (Sept. 3
at Washington) and Costa Rica (Oct. 11 at Columbus, Ohio) before
finishing at Barbados on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Arena must try to integrate Moore and McBride, who broke a
cheekbone playing for Columbus on June 19, with Chicago's Ante
Razov, who has scored in three of the national team's last four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Having a choice among good forwards is an unusual experience for
a U.S. coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, over 90 minutes, they'll all have time to shine,''
Arena said.

<HEADLINE> Worker Killed in Crane Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A piece of a crane that was being erected to
build a dormitory at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee hit an
iron worker Wednesday, killing him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old man and four other workers were on top of the
crane trying to secure its final section, said John Rodell, a vice
president of operations for Findorff Construction, the equipment's
owner.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-foot section swung back and hit the man in the chest,
Rodell said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and a paramedic climbed the 220-foot crane to get
to the man, who was lying unconscious on the crane's platform, said
Milwaukee Fire Department Lt. Terry Lintonen.
</P>
<P>
   They lowered the man using a basket from another crane. He was
pronounced dead soon afterward, Lintonen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating the accident, said agency spokeswoman Bonnie
Friedman. The construction site will be closed for the rest of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-story dorm is scheduled to be completed in September
2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Rick Reed pitched seven strong innings and Mike
Piazza returned to the New York lineup with a three-run homer as
the Mets beat the Houston Astros 12-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reed (7-2) won his third straight decision by allowing four runs
-- three earned -- on eight hits. He struck out four and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, 2-for-5 including his 30th home run in the eighth
inning, missed New York's previous three games with a mild knee
sprain. He was injured running to first base at Arizona on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile went 3-for-5 to lead a 16-hit New York attack.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima (4-14) lost for the first time since July 4. He was
3-0 with two no-decisions since the All-Star break. The
right-hander went 3 1-3 innings and allowed seven runs on seven
hits -- four for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton's home run in the second was the 36th allowed by Lima
this season, extending Lima's major league-leading total and club
record.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo, who was 3-for-5 with a home run, led off the Houston
first with a single to left and stole second. He went to third on a
Jeff Bagwell's single and scored on Lance Berkman's sacrifice fly
for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets answered in the second when Todd Zeile's triple drove
in Robin Ventura, who walked. Zeile scored on a wild pitch with
Payton at the plate. Four pitches later, Payton hit his 10th homer
to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Benny Agbayani led off with a double and scored on
Derek Bell's triple. Edgardo Alfonzo singled in Bell to give the
Mets a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio hit his sixth home in the fifth to pull the Astros
within 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton's two-run homer off a 2-2 pitch drove in Reed to
make it 9-2 in the sixth. It was Hamilton's first home run of the
season and first career pinch-hit homer.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's hit also was the first to hit the left-field
scoreboard wall and careen into the visitors' bullpen. Under Enron
Field ground rules that is a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros made it 9-4 in the seventh on Lugo's third home run
of the year. Daryle Ward hit his 16th home run off New York
reliever Turk Wendell in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Astros OF Roger Cedeno, out since May 26 with a broken left
hand, will begin a one-week rehab assignment Thursday at Triple-A
New Orleans. ... Eusebio extended his career-high hitting streak to
14 games, the longest by a catcher in franchise history. ... The
Mets have at least one home run in 18 of their last 26 games and 27
total during the span. ... Hamilton was out since April 7 with a
sprained left foot. ... The Mets have six pinch-hit homers this
season.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 19, Mariners 3  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Hold on there, Seattle Mariners. The Chicago
White Sox aren't ready to give up their claim to the best record in
the AL.
</P>
<P>
   With their lead in the AL down to a half-game over the Mariners
and bragging rights at stake Wednesday night, Frank Thomas led an
offensive explosion, homering in his first two at-bats as the White
Sox routed Seattle 19-3.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas came close to homering a third time, doubling off the
center-field wall. He drove in five runs, one shy of his career
high, and finished 3-for-4 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graffanino hit the first grand slam of his career, and Ray
Durham homered and drove in another run for the White Sox, who
scored at least one run in each of the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 runs were the most for the White Sox this year. Their
previous high was 18 against -- guess who? -- the Mariners. Chicago
also had a season-high 24 hits.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox battered Jamie Moyer (11-5), who'd won eight of
his last 11 starts, for a career-high 11 earned runs and 13 hits in
3 2-3 innings. His ERA ballooned from 4.50 to 5.30.
</P>
<P>
   It was his shortest outing for baseball reasons since he went 3
1-3 on June 21, 1997, against Texas. Moyer went one inning on July
4, 1998, against the Rangers, but that was because of a rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka (10-9) was solid on the mound, allowing three runs
and allowing eight hits over seven innings. He pitched four shutout
innings before giving up a leadoff homer to Chris Widger in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over Houston on June 2 gave the White Sox the best
record in the AL, and they've held it ever since. But losses in 12
of their first 25 games since the All-Star Game and a surge by the
Mariners -- they've won 16 since the break, including a sweep of
Tuesday's doubleheader -- whittled Chicago's lead to .005 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Mariners in town for another two games, that lead
was looking very precarious, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wake up! Wake up! Let's win some ball games around here!''
pitcher James Baldwin yelled as he walked in the clubhouse before
the game, smacking a bat on the metal picnic table.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were obviously listening. Thomas, batting third,
hit a two-run homer to left practically one-handed in the first
inning. It was his 78th career first-inning home run, and third in
the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas wasn't done. With two runners on, he homered into the
pitcher's backdrop in the second inning to give Chicago a 7-0 lead.
He hit another solid ball to center in the fifth, but settled for a
double instead when it dropped at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Durham hit a solo homer off Moyer in the third. Moyer gave up
three more runs in the fourth on Herbert Perry's RBI single and
Chris Singleton's two-run single before manager Lou Piniella
finally took him out.
</P>
<P>
   But his replacement, Robert Ramsay, didn't fare much better,
giving up seven runs -- four earned -- in the sixth inning alone. He
walked Durham to load the bases and then gave up the grand slam to
Graffanino.
</P>
<P>
   After Paul Konerko, Carlos Lee and Singleton drove in runs to
give Chicago a 19-2 lead, Piniella had enough, replacing Ramsay
with Jose Paniagua. Charles Johnson popped up to third, finally
ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners are in discussions with the Orix Blue Wave to
send a team of minor leaguers to Japan for exhibition games when
the season ends. ... When Joe Oliver entered the game in the fifth
inning, the Mariners had three catchers on the field. Starting
catcher Dan Wilson was playing third and Widger moved from first to
behind home plate. ... With a crowd of 24,497 Wednesday, the White
Sox surpassed last season's total attendance of 1,338,851.

<HEADLINE> Alberto Called a Hurricane Again  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Alberto, the first named tropical storm of the
season, returned to hurricane strength deep in the Atlantic Ocean
on Wednesday, but forecasters predicted it would stay far from
land.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters also were tracking a small system east of Florida
that they said could develop into a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto intensified during the day as it moved on a
northwesterly course. It is expected to swing northward later in
the week and pass well east of Bermuda, National Hurricane Center
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   With 75 mph winds, Alberto was just over the 74 mph threshold
when a tropical storm becomes a hurricane. It had reached 85 mph on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was about 815 miles
southeast of Bermuda. It was moving northwest at about 23 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forecasters were puzzled by a small tropical
depression about 110 miles east of Cape Canaveral, off central
Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   One computer model predicted a hurricane would form, but the
center's three-day forecast keeps the system nameless, meaning
steady winds below 39 mph. If the system's winds reach 39 mph, it
will be classified as a tropical storm and named Beryl.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., the depression was edging west, with steady winds
near 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November,
peaking around Labor Day.

<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Tina Thompson scored 25 points, including
14-of-16 shooting on free throws, as the Houston Comets defeated
the Minnesota Lynx 77-64 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (27-5) scored 27 points off a season-high 19 steals, and
shot 26-for-31 from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Smith had 22 points -- 14 in the first half -- and Betty
Lennox added 20 points and eight rebounds for Minnesota (15-17).
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes had 17 points for the Comets, and finished with a
20.7-point average to beat Smith (20.2) for the scoring title.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx were in control for most of the first half, using a
15-2 run to take a 14-point lead with 5:13 remaining. However, the
Comets responded with a 13-4 spurt to cut the deficit to 33-28 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's run continued in the second half as the Comets scored
the first eight points after the break until Minnesota finally
scored after nearly five minutes had elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx never regained the lead, as the Comets used runs of
10-2 and 15-4 to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's defensive effort overcame its 1-for-15 shooting on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets open the first round of the playoffs at Sacramento on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Puts in Word for Wife, Gore  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton did some stumping for his
vice president and his wife Wednesday night, saying the best way to
ensure continued prosperity was to send Al Gore to the White House
and Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is a very big deal,'' the president told 30
people who paid $10,000 each to help Mrs. Clinton's campaign for
the Senate from New York. ''How you use your prosperity is as
important a test as how you deal with a crisis. You have to go
around and convince people of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ''flattered'' that some Republicans borrowed his
words at the party's convention last week but said their policies
are still the ones failed during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a difference between changing the rhetoric and
changing the policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the ''clarity of choice'' in this fall's election
will help Democrats because people will realize which party has the
best policies.
</P>
<P>
   He said the major difference is that Democrats ''want us all to
go along for the ride'' and said their policies would enable the
people serving the meal to have the same chance to send their
children to college as those eating it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised his wife for being an advocate of children's
issues before it became fashionable to do so. He added that she had
helped make Arkansas a role model in neonatal care while she was
first lady there.
</P>
<P>
   Electing her to the Senate would give her the chance to keep
working on these and other issues and support broader policies that
will keep the country's prosperity on track, Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Gore for being an early advocate of strong measures
to protecting the environment and of programs to make technology
more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the home of Al and Claire Dwoskin, who are
friends of the Clintons, at their home in McLean, an affluent
Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a second $10,000-per person event for his wife,
Clinton said she has the ''best blend of mind and heart and
knowledge'' of anyone he knows. That event was at the Washington
home of Clinton's friend Tom Quinn.

<HEADLINE> Reds 10, Braves 6  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Pete Harnisch's second career homer finished a
five-run rally off Tom Glavine and powered the Cincinnati Reds to a
milestone 10-6 victory Wednesday night over the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took two-of-three for their first winning series
against the Braves since September 1996. They'd lost their last
eight series against Atlanta and are only 7-25 against the Braves
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati pulled off a mistake-aided comeback after a severe
storm dumped rain and hail on the field, delaying the start by an
hour and 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning bolts flashed throughout the game, drawing repeated
oohs from the 31,098 fans and quick glances from the players, while
rolling thunder rattled the suite windows.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd relished Glavine's meltdown after seven straight wins,
waving goodbye and jeering as he walked off the field with his head
down after giving up eight runs -- the most he'd allowed since
Milwaukee scored nine off him May 24 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (14-6) lasted only four-plus innings against the team he
has beaten more than any other in his career. The left-hander is
21-9 career against the Reds, including 14-4 in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. had three hits, including a solo homer, and Alex
Ochoa had a single, double and triple as the Reds overcame a 6-2
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Misplays abounded on both sides, fueling one spurt after another
through the first five innings. Two by Braves center fielder Andruw
Jones helped the Reds pull off a five-run rally in the fifth that
decided it.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey led off with a single and paused at second on Dante
Bichette's single to center, then took off for third when Jones
made a half-hearted lob to the infield. Dmitri Young's double tied
it and ended Glavine's outing.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa hit a sinking liner to center that shot past Jones for a
two-run triple off reliever Stan Belinda. Two outs later, Harnisch
hit a 2-2 pitch over the wall in left for a 376-foot homer, pumping
his first at first base in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch (4-6) held on for his third complete game in his last
six starts, giving up nine hits as he beat the Braves for the first
time since 1993. The right-hander had gone 0-4 in his last seven
starts against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones ended an 0-for-23 slump, the worst of his career,
with a triple that bounced past a charging Ochoa in left field in
the seventh. Jones had two throwing errors and only one hit in 13
at-bats during the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves appeared to be in control when they scored five runs
in the third with the help of Bichette's misplay in right. He tried
to make a sliding catch of Bobby Bonilla's liner on the wet turf
and missed the ball, letting it roll to the wall for a two-run
triple. Bonilla scored on Harnisch's wild pitch for a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Final test results found no trace of cancer in Andres
Galarraga's left thumb, which has a hairline fracture and a cyst.
He could be back in the Braves' lineup Friday. ... Pitching coach
Leo Mazzone was released from a hospital, where tests found nothing
wrong. He fainted during Tuesday's game. ... RF Brian Jordan was
out of the lineup, a day after pulling groin muscles. ... Reds SS
Barry Larkin plans to be back in the lineup Friday in Chicago, one
week after he strained a knee ligament. ... Harnisch's other homer
was off San Diego's Heath Murray on May 22 last year. ... Griffey's
homer, his 33rd this season, was the 431st of his career. He's 26th
on the career list, with Andre Dawson next at 438.
