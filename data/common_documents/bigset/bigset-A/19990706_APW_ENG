<HEADLINE> U.S., China Set for World Cup Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- After playing five World Cup games in  
two weeks, the U.S. and Chinese women won't be complaining about 
four straight days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll practically relish the break from competition.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, who have been the strongest team in the tournament,  
crisscrossed the country so often they probably have enough 
frequent flyer miles to get back home for free. The Americans 
didn't have such travel woes, but they had far more difficult 
knockout-round games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are these teams used to such a frenetic playing schedule.  
Indeed, the women will have played six games in three weeks to 
decide their title. The men play seven games in more than four 
weeks in their World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't rested very often,'' China Coach Ma Yuanan said.  
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't seem to be dragging in a 5-0 victory over  
defending champion Norway in the semifinals. That rout was the most 
impressive win in what has been a terrific year for the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	So they've earned their respite, although Ma has promised their  
practices ``will be like matches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, whose advancement to the finals has featured some  
brilliant play and some very spotty moments, particularly on 
defense, did look exhausted in their 2-0 win against Brazil on 
Sunday. Not surprisingly, coach Tony DiCicco canceled Monday's 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely were a little tired, and so was Brazil,'' U.S.  
star Mia Hamm said. ``We weren't as sharp as we can be, and maybe 
that was a little fatigue playing a part. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've got five days between games, and we'll be ready by  
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Chinese, who also won the prestigious Algarve Cup over  
the Americans this year before splitting two games in the United 
States, don't appear to need much work on anything, Ma decided to 
nitpick. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we led 2-0, some of the team members were making  
constant errors,'' Ma said. ``In the first half, there were two 
opportunities which the players didn't maximize. If we did, the 
game would have been easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco won't be nitpicking when he brings up the gaps in the  
defense that have given all but one U.S. opponent ample opportunity 
to score. Only the steady and sometimes spectacular work of 
goalkeeper Briana Scurry has kept the yield down to three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will have the Americans working on shooting more quickly  
when they get into position. Hamm, the international career goals 
leader who hasn't scored in three games, was especially hesitant 
about shooting against the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the players who can find the back of the net  
consistently,'' DiCicco said. ``We'll be calling on them to do it 
one more time on Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One aspect in which the Americans have excelled is set pieces  
such as corner kicks and free kicks. Because of their height 
advantage over China, look for Michelle Akers and Cindy Parlow, in 
particular, to be heavily involved in those plays -- throughout the 
week of practice and in the sold-out Rose Bowl on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that by Saturday, we're going to be dying to get out  
on the field and play,'' co-captain Julie Foudy said. ``By then 
we'll have had enough practice and will want to get on with what we 
came for, the chance of winning the World Cup.''

	Barak Sworn In As Israeli PM  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Ushering in a new government he said would seek  
peace with the country's Arab neighbors and the Palestinians, Ehud 
Barak took the oath of office today and became Israel's new prime 
minister. ``From here and today, I call on all the region's leaders 
to stretch out their hands to meet our outstretched hands and forge 
a peace of the brave,'' Barak said in an inaugural speech. The 
Knesset overwhelmingly approved Barak's Cabinet, a mostly dovish 
assembly committed to his vision of ceding territory for peace.

	Guns Provided by Illegal Dealer  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The white- supremacist suspect in last weekend's  
deadly two-state shooting spree got his guns last month from an 
illegal gun dealer, a federal agent said today. Benjamin Nathaniel 
Smith bought the guns from an unlicensed gun dealer in the Peoria 
area, said Jerry Singer, a special agent for the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The rampage, which killed two and 
included shootings of minorities in several Illinois cities and in 
Bloomington, Ind., ended Sunday with Smith committing suicide as 
police tried to arrest him in the southern Illinois town of Salem.

	Bin Laden May Be Receiving Donations  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The alleged mastermind in last year's U.S.  
Embassy bombings in Africa may be receiving million of dollars in 
donations from Mideast businessmen to fund his campaign against the 
U.S. Sources say Osama bin Laden may have received more than $50 
million before Saudi authorities uncovered the donations and 
stopped the transfers. Meanwhile, President Clinton has imposed 
financial sanctions against the Taliban religious militia that 
rules Afghanistan in retaliation for its reputed support of bin 
Laden.

	Heat Wave Plagues East Coast  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The mercury climbed toward 100 again in the East  
for the third day in a row today as people returning to work after 
the holiday weekend changed out of their shorts and into their 
business wear. At least eight deaths were blamed on the heat. Heat 
advisories and warnings were posted from Illinois to the East Coast 
and from southern New England to North Carolina. Utilities urged 
customers to turn off unneeded appliances to conserve electricity 
and some had scattered blackouts as air conditioners outpaced 
generators.

	First Lady Forms Senate Committee  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton filed papers today  
with the Federal Election Commission to set up a committee to 
explore a race for a Senate seat from New York. The filing allows 
Mrs. Clinton to raise and spend money in preparation for the race 
for the Democratic nomination. She would become the only first lady 
ever to run for public office. On the Republican side, New York 
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has already formed a Senate exploratory 
committee and raised almost $3 million toward the race.

	NATO Detains Bosnian Lawmaker  
</P>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- NATO soldiers arrested a former  
Bosnian Serb Cabinet minister today on charges that he planned the 
forced removal of non-Serbs from northwest Bosnia in 1992. Radislav 
Brdjanin is the most senior Bosnian Serb civilian official yet to 
be arrested and transferred to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The 
Hague, Netherlands. Brdjanin has been charged with persecution, a 
crime against humanity, for planning ethnic purges of Muslims and 
Croats from the Prijedor and Sanski Most regions of northwest 
Bosnia. He faces a life sentence.

	Honda Unveils Fuel Efficient Car  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Honda, Japan's third-largest automaker, said today  
it has developed a low-pollution car that is also the world's most 
fuel efficient mass-production vehicle. The automaker said it will 
equip its ``Insight'' cars, scheduled for release later this year, 
with a so-called Integrated Motor Assist System, a motor and a 
battery that help propel a 1 liter gasoline engine. The technology 
will allow the car to drive 84 miles per gallon of fuel -- the 
highest in the world for a gasoline-powered consumer car, the 
company said.

players in the starting lineup. Mike Piazza of the New York Mets 
will be at catcher, Mark McGwire of St. Louis at first and Barry 
Larkin of Cincinnati at shortstop. Chicago's Sammy Sosa, Colorado's 
Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn were elected to start in 
the outfield.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Sink on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures plummeted early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as good growing weather boosted 
chances for bumper fall harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans quickly posted new life-of-contract lows, with  
corn tumbling below $2 a bushel, as investors bet that rainfall 
across the Midwest would relieve crops that had baked under 
blistering heat over the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across Illinois and Iowa are expected to rise again  
later this week, but forecasters said it was unlikely they would 
rise into the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops are particularly vulnerable to high heat and low  
moisture during the month of July, a period in which a crucial 
pollination stage begins to form kernels. Soybeans enter their 
crucial flowering stage later this month and into August. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures tumbled in sympathy with corn and soybeans and  
amid perceptions dry weather over the weekend helped speed 
harvesting of the winter wheat crop that had been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.48 a bushel;  
September corn fell 9 3/4 cents to $1.92 1/2 a bushel; September oats 
fell 4 cents to $1.04 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 16 3/4 cents 
to $4.23 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose 0.17 cent to 62.67 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 0.58 cent to 76.90 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 0.87 cent to 43.70 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
fell 0.35 cent to 36.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Shooting Spree Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ill. (AP) -- Shattered glass, tire marks and a piece of  
orange plastic from a tail light are all that show where a deadly 
two-state shooting spree ended with the death of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	White supremacist Benjamin Nathaniel Smith fatally shot himself  
Sunday night as he led police on a chase that was headed toward 
2,000 people gathered for a Fourth of July celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main target was to get him stopped before he got there,  
but fortunately he did that for us,'' said Marion County sheriff's 
deputy Todd Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Coroner Tom Nicolay said Monday that he was treating Smith's  
death as a suicide, although an official inquest will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicolay said Smith, 21, shot himself three times.  
</P>
<P>
	The first time was in the chin, and police believe that happened  
after they spotted the minivan Smith had carjacked at gunpoint at a 
gas station in Ina, about 35 miles south of Salem and 270 miles 
south of Chicago. The woman who was driving the van and her 
13-year-old daughter were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The minivan went off the side of the road and into a culvert,  
hitting a metal pipe and causing the air bag to inflate. Smith 
refused officers' orders to put his hands up, so several entered 
the van. 
</P>
<P>
	As he struggled with five sheriff's deputies and police officers  
who tried to subdue him, Smith shot himself in the chest and leg. 
None of the officers fired and Smith didn't appear to shoot at 
them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was still combative even after being handcuffed and put in an  
ambulance but said nothing, police said. He bled to death from the 
chest wound a short time later in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed during the drive-by spree, including  
former Northwestern University men's basketball coach Ricky 
Byrdsong, who was black, and a Korean student in Bloomington, Ind. 
At least eight others were wounded, one seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, staying in Memphis, Tenn., during his  
four-day trip to poverty-stricken areas, called Byrdsong's widow 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our prayers are with you and I just wanted to say we're  
thinking of you,'' Clinton said. ``God bless you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they believed Smith began his spree in Chicago  
on Friday by wounding six Orthodox Jews leaving synagogue. Within 
an hour, Byrdsong was shot to death in nearby Skokie and two 
Asian-Americans were shot at, but not hit, while driving in 
Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter also fired at Asians and blacks in two Illinois  
cities on Saturday, seriously wounding one man, before the 
Bloomington shooting on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also believe the gunman also wounded a black  
minister in Decatur, Ill., on Saturday, but they were waiting for 
ballistics tests to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	A .22-caliber handgun and a .380-caliber handgun found with  
Smith were consistent with the guns used in the shootings. 
Authorities were trying to trace the source of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the World Church of the Creator, a  
white-supremacist organization, and distributed anti-minority and 
anti-Semitic literature while he was a student at Indiana 
University in Bloomington.

<HEADLINE> Rudy Tomjanovich To Miss Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich is taking  
a month's vacation from the Olympic qualifying tournament to 
recover from exhaustion. However, he's not giving up his duties as 
coach of the U.S. men's basketball team for the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown, an assistant, will replace  
Tomjanovich for the qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico from July 
14-25, but Tomjanovich hopes to retake the reins next year in 
Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich spent Friday and Saturday night in the hospital  
after experiencing dizziness and weakness. Team physician Jim Muntz 
diagnosed Tomjanovich with extreme physical exhaustion and 
suggested the coach take a month off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have advised rest, and in light of this he will not be able  
to coach the USA men's senior national team in the pre-Olympic 
Tournament of the Americas,'' Muntz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich reluctantly decided he should take the doctor's  
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent a couple of days in the hospital and conferred with  
my doctor and the prescription is three or four weeks of rest,'' 
Tomjanovich said. ``I'm really disappointed, and I'm going to do my 
best to recharge myself and get ready for the upcoming season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich appeared tired when he made the announcement late  
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a great honor and something I was looking forward  
to,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But I've overworked myself and I find 
myself really physically and mentally exhausted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets coach has been working almost constantly the past  
two years. When NBA players boycotted the 1998 world championships, 
Tomjanovich led an underdog group of minor-league players to a 
bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, Purdue's Gene Keady and Kentucky's Tubby Smith are  
assistants for the U.S. men's team. Brown has worked on three USA 
Basketball coaching staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The team starts workouts in Orlando, Fla., this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was excited about working with Rudy,'' Brown said. ``He's a  
phenomenal coach and a great guy. And I thought the staff assembled 
with Tubby and Gene would just be a lot of fun. I'm hoping Rudy 
will get back. I'm just holding the fort until he gets well. This 
is his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be in constant contact with him to get a feel for  
what he wants us to do until he can get back,'' Brown said. ``I 
think when they picked the team, Rudy had a lot of input and we're 
all hopeful he'll be back real soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which has won gold medals in the last two  
Olympics, must finish among the top two teams in the 10-team 
pre-Olympic tournament to earn a berth in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 4.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks gave up early gains and closed lower  
Tuesday as optimism about second-quarter earnings gave way to 
profit-taking from last week's stunning rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.12 to close at  
11,135.12. During the session, the blue-chip index rose more than 
97 points above Friday's record close of 11,139.24. That record 
capped an extraordinary week, as the Dow advanced 586.68 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended lower Tuesday after a late  
selloff. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.10 to 1,388.12, and 
the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.24 to 2,736.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks faltered as weakness in the bond market and a desire to  
lock in profits outweighed the strong outlook for second-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped, pushing the  
yield to 6.03 percent, up from 6 percent late Friday. Traders 
consider bond yields above 6 percent a threat to stocks, in part 
because at that level, they present a more attractive alternative 
to volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse  
First Boston, said the higher interest rates implemented by the 
Federal Reserve last Wednesday set the stage for a market drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The equity market is substantially overvalued for a rising  
interest rate environment,'' she said. ``The small new highs are 
generally not sustainable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With interest rates set for now, analysts said investors have  
turned their focus to corporate earnings. Initially, rosy forecasts 
attracted buyers Tuesday, but analysts said some traders ultimately 
decided to sell, perhaps worrying that results will miss the 
mounting expectations of Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet search engine provider Yahoo! rose strongly for much of  
the session in advance of its second-quarter earnings report, due 
Wednesday. But Yahoo! faltered in late afternoon, ending down 3 1/8 at 
175 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for equities at State  
Street Research and Management Co. in Boston, said the high 
valuations of many stocks could create a punishing environment for 
companies that fare poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a very skittish state,'' he said. ``There's no room  
for disappointment, and great potential for volatility.'' 
</P>

	Favorable reports on Intel fed excitement in the Nasdaq market  
Tuesday. Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Prudential Securities raised 
their ratings on Intel stock, saying the chip maker is successfully 
managing stiff price competition. Intel rose 5/16 to 63 13/16, 
although it pared early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Internet companies rose on announcements of new  
ventures. AOL, up 5 11/16 to 120 15/16, and drkoop.com, up 13 1/4 to 
36 7/8, both got a boost from a deal that makes drkoop.com the primary 
provider of health information to AOL users. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were mostly higher as the price of crude oil briefly  
topped $20 a barrel for the first time since November 1997. 
Chevron, a Dow component, rose 2 1/16 to 98 5/16. TotalFina SA's 
unsolicited takeover bid for Elf Aquitaine also helped boost the 
sector, as Elf soared 16 1/16 to 90 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, Prudential's famously bullish technical analyst,  
said in a research note Tuesday the Dow could hit 13,000 during 
1999. Acampora's most conservative estimate for the year is in the 
range of 12,000 to 12,300. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be aggressive because we believe that this summer season will  
be a very exciting and bullish affair,'' Acampora said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume 
totaled 889.96 million shares, compared with 753.20 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.35 to 654.77, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.47 to 804.89. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.04 to 456.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.47 percent.  
Germany's DAX index fell 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.1 
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.1 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Computer Programmer on Trial in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A Chinese programmer who pleaded guilty to  
taking restricted information from an Air Force computer system has 
returned to court, proclaiming his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Liu, 25, a Chinese national who worked for a military  
contractor in Dayton in 1996, is accused of downloading passwords 
from the $148 million computer database near Wright-Patterson Air 
Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the information on this computer system belonged to  
the defendant,'' assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Chema said Tuesday 
during opening statements of Liu's trial. ``This is important 
military information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The data in the computer system is not classified. It contains  
maintenance and failure-rate information about aircraft and weapons 
systems. It is used to determine which systems are available for 
missions and when parts need to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu pleaded guilty in 1997 to two misdemeanor counts of  
intentionally accessing a computer without authorization. A 
magistrate sentenced him to six months in a halfway house and 
$5,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu later asked to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that he had  
new information that would benefit his case. His defense attorney 
said Tuesday that Liu never was told what areas of the computer 
system he wasn't allowed to access.

<HEADLINE> Brown To Plead Innocent to 2 Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Brown, a Hall of Fame football player and  
actor, will plead innocent Friday to two misdemeanor charges for 
allegedly threatening to kill his wife and breaking her car windows 
with a shovel, according to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cleveland Browns star faces one count of making a  
terrorist threat and one count of vandalism. He could receive up to 
18 months in jail and a $2,000 fine if convicted on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, his lawyer and his 25-year-old wife, Monique, were in  
court Tuesday and told reporters afterward the case had been 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point we tried to make was that Monique was never harmed  
in any way,'' said William Graysen, a Century City criminal defense 
lawyer. ``Since the O.J. Simpson case, if there's a family argument 
and police are called, someone will get arrested. We want everyone 
to know it's not a violence case, it's a threat case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was arrested June 15 at the couple's Hollywood Hills home  
after his wife of two years reported the alleged incident. He was 
booked at the Hollywood station and posted $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown later held an impromptu news conference outside their  
home and denied that threats were made against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown retired from pro football in 1966 with many NFL rushing  
and scoring records. He also has appeared in several Hollywood 
films, notably ``The Dirty Dozen.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign Pro Bowl Fullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Redskins signed free agent  
fullback Larry Centers, a two-time Pro Bowl player and one of the 
league's premier pass-catching running backs, to a one-year 
contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Centers, entering his 10th season, has spent his career with the  
Arizona Cardinals. He has 535 career receptions, including 101 in 
1995 and 99 in 1996. His 1995 production broke Roger Craig's 
running-back record of 92 catches in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the Pro Bowl in 1995 and 1996, and had 69 receptions  
for 559 yards and two touchdowns last year for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins coach Norv Turner said Centers ``brings versatility at  
fullback'' to the club. ``He's an outstanding receiver, a good 
blocker and a proven player in this league,'' Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charley Casserly, the Redskins' general manager, said Centers is  
``a talented runner with exceptional pass-catching skills and will 
be a great asset to our offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Washington Times reported Tuesday that the  
Redskins' new owner, Daniel Snyder, intends to replace Casserly 
when he takes control of the club next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner will get more power over personnel decisions in the  
shakeup, the Times said, and Snyder will create a ``director of 
football operations'' to oversee player contracts and scouting. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, a businessman who lives in suburban Maryland, said  
shortly after the league accepted his $800 million offer for the 
team and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium that Casserly and Turner would be 
retained at least for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times, quoting further unidentified NFL and team  
sources, said Snyder has concluded that Casserly was responsible 
for the team's recent poor drafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly joined that Redskins in 1977 as an unpaid intern. He  
was promoted to general manager in 1989 and has three years 
remaining on a contract believed worth more than $500,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> China Shuts Down Investment Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Another Chinese state investment trust  
has been quietly closed by regulators because of heavy losses in 
Shanghai's sluggish real estate market, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pudong Lianhe Trust and Investment Corp., set up to develop  
Shanghai's Pudong financial district, was shut down several months 
ago, a spokeswoman for the trust told Dow Jones Newswires. She said 
its $300 million in assets as well as its debts were turned over to 
the state-run Agricultural Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are trying to clear up heavy debts among China's 240  
investment trusts without spooking investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision in January to force the second-biggest trust into  
bankruptcy with $1.9 billion in foreign debts made creditors more 
reluctant to risk money in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment trusts were set up over the past decade to finance  
economic development. But many have gone into debt by speculating 
in stocks or wasting money on luxury hotels and other dubious 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pudong trust spokeswoman, who gave only her surname, Ma,  
would not say how large its debts were. But she said bad real 
estate loans led to the closure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invested a lot of money in the Pudong property market, but  
many of the buildings are still empty and we have no way of 
recovering those loans,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how large the firm was, but it appeared to rank  
among the top 50 Chinese trusts. Ma said it was the second-biggest 
in Shanghai, after Shanghai International Trust and Investment 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers say dozens of smaller mergers and closures are under  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say they are acting gradually for fear a wave of  
bankruptcies could undermine confidence in the economy and lead to 
a bigger crisis.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Sink on Outlook / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures plummeted Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as good growing weather boosted chances 
for bumper fall harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans posted new life-of-contract lows, with corn  
falling to its lowest in nearly 12 years, as investors bet that 
rainfall across the Midwest would relieve crops that had baked 
under blistering heat over the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across Illinois and Iowa are expected to rise once  
more later this week, but forecasters said it was unlikely they 
would rise into the 90s. The National Weather Service on Monday 
called for above-normal rainfall and below-normal Midwestern 
temperatures through mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops are particularly vulnerable to high heat and low  
moisture during the month of July, a period when they are in the 
crucial pollination stage in which kernel begin to form. Soybeans 
enter their crucial flowering stage later this month and into 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said unless an early frost decimates production, crop  
size could exceed current government forecasts for record soybeans 
and the fourth-largest corn crop in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures tumbled in sympathy with corn and soybeans and  
amid perceptions dry weather over the weekend helped speed delayed 
harvesting of the winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for December delivery, accounting for prices after the  
harvest, fell 7 3/4 cents to $2.04 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans 
tumbled 18 3/4 cents to $4.21 1/2 a bushel, while prices for immediate 
delivery tumbled to their lowest since November 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	December oats fell 4 cents to $1.08 a bushel; December wheat  
fell 4 3/4 cents to $2.63 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
lean hogs finished mixed and pork bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .37 cent to 62.87 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 1.03 cents to 77.35 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .07 cent to 44.50 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
1.33 cents to 35.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> 2 All-Star Starters From D-Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Just 1 1/2 seasons old, the Arizona Diamondbacks are  
the only National League team with two starters in next week's 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams and Jay Bell, who struggled through rocky seasons  
a year ago with the expansion Diamondbacks, were elected Tuesday 
and could be joined in the starting lineup by Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some satisfaction for me because I got to see  
first-hand what they went through last year,'' manager Buck 
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Bell were the first ``name'' players acquired by  
the Diamondbacks before the team played a game. Bell signed a $34 
million, five-year contract as a free agent, and Williams agreed to 
a $45 million, five-year after he was acquired from Cleveland in a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Both went through horrible 1998 seasons for the last-place  
Diamondbacks, widely criticized by local fans, sports talk show 
hosts and columnists as over the hill and overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Williams and Bell bounced back with seasons that rank  
among their best. Williams is batting .321 with 21 home runs and an 
NL-leading 75 RBIs, four more than he had all of last year 
</P>
<P>
	``He's playing as good a third base as anybody I've ever seen,''  
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is hitting .279 and is second in the league in runs with  
70. On Tuesday night, he hit his 23rd home run, two more than his 
previous career high and one more than the most by an Arizona 
batter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think back to over a year ago, when Matt Williams and Jay  
Bell were two of the first Diamondbacks and the pressures they were 
under to carry a tremendous load,'' owner Jerry Colangelo said. 
``They struggled along with the rest of our roster getting through 
that first season. ... To see them rewarded the way they have been 
is a real tribute to their perseverance, hard work and 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was the runaway winner at third base, while Bell came  
from behind to nudge Houston's Craig Biggio at second base by 
30,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely, extremely surprised,'' Bell said. ``Craig has  
been the fair-haired second baseman in the National League. He's 
deserved it. He's been a great player over the years. For me to be 
elected over him is a great honor and truly unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the fifth time Williams has been selected to the  
All-Star team, the last four times as the starter. But he missed 
his last two chances, in 1995 and 1996, because of injuries. Bell 
has appeared in one All-Star Game, in 1993. A shortstop throughout 
his big-league career until he switched to second base late last 
season, Bell played second base in that 1993 game because of the 
injury situation. This will be his first All-Star start. 
</P>
<P>
	`It's great to be selected but it's especially nice when you're  
voted in,'' Williams said. ``To have people put your name on that 
ballot and put it in the box, it's quite an honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Bell benefited from a strong marketing effort that  
included a strong emphasis on voting via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggio, in Phoenix as the Astros began a three-game series with  
the Diamondbacks, was not optimistic that he would be added to the 
team as a reserve because each team must have at least one 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had the opportunity to go before. It's a tremendous  
experience,'' he said. ``I definitely would love to be going. But 
Jay's a tremendous player. It was a close race. I'm happy for him 
and I hope he goes up there and plays well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biggio said he thinks another five spots should be added to each  
roster to make room for deserving players who are left out each 
year because of the requirement that every team be represented. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those players could be Arizona's Luis Gonzalez. With  
Johnson considered a shoo-in as a pitcher, Gonzalez would be the 
fourth Diamondback on the team when reserves are chosen by NL 
manager Bruce Bochy on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gonzalez knows that many of the teams with poor record have  
outfielders who are likely candidates to be selected. That could 
leave out Gonzalez, who is third in the NL in hitting with a .364 
average and has a 30-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez rated his chances of being chosen for his first  
All-Star appearance as ``probably 50-50.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Sanctions on Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has imposed financial  
sanctions against the Taliban religious militia that rules 
Afghanistan in retaliation for its reputed support of Osama bin 
Laden, the alleged international terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed an executive order Monday imposing the sanctions.  
Bin Laden was placed on the FBI's ``Ten Most Wanted List'' last 
month with a $5 million reward offered for information leading to 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this day, bin Laden and his network continue to plan new  
attacks against Americans without regard for the innocence of their 
intended victims or for those non-Americans who might get in the 
way of his attack,'' Clinton said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his executive order ``will deepen the international  
isolation of the Taliban, limit its ability to support terrorist 
networks and demonstrate the need to conform to the accepted norms 
of international behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In practical terms, the impact of the sanctions probably will be  
modest, a senior administration official acknowledged, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. It is not clear what assets might be 
affected, the official said, but declared that the action sends a 
clear message that the United States will not tolerate those who 
shelter international terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade with Afghanistan totaled $24 million in 1998. The  
United States has sanctions in effect covering more than two dozen 
countries, from Angola to Zambia, accounting for half of the 
world's population. 
</P>
<P>
	The order freezes any property of the Taliban within U.S.  
jurisdiction. It also prohibits transactions and trade with the 
Taliban or in territory controlled by the Taliban, preventing any 
U.S. investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States demands that the Taliban expel bin Laden to  
the United States for trial or to a third country where he would 
face justice for alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration accuses bin Laden of masterminding  
the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 
which killed more than 200 people and injured thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says bin Laden is still hiding in Afghanistan. Others  
suggest he is on his way elsewhere -- Somalia, Chechnya, even Iraq -- 
preferably somewhere gripped by anarchy and rife with anti-U.S. 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Taliban leaders have insisted they do not know where he is.  
</P>
<P>
	In London, the Observer newspaper reported Sunday that bin Laden  
moved two months ago into a new base in Afghanistan, into an old 
collective farm in the village of Farmihadda, a few miles south of 
Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border.

<HEADLINE> Money a Top Issue in Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of course George W. Bush is going to skip the  
federal campaign subsidies that would limit him to spending less 
than he's raising to run for the White House. His opponents, of 
course, will try to make an issue of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Bush has raised an extraordinary $36.3 million for his  
Republican presidential campaign, federal funds would be a 
liability because of the restrictions that go with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Steve Forbes, whose own no-holds spending is one of the  
perils awaiting the front-running governor of Texas, said Bush is 
beholden to lobbyists and the establishment because of their role 
in his fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaigns largely on his own fortune, making him the only  
other candidate who can afford to run outside the matching funds 
system, in 2000 as he did in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said that by bypassing that system and its  
limits, Bush would be siding with Republican congressional leaders 
``unanimously hostile'' to campaign finance reform. Clinton backs 
reform legislation that has been blocked in Congress, although his 
own 1996 campaign got the benefit of illicit foreign donations to 
the Democrats, and his Lincoln Bedroom visits for big contributors 
became a symbol for reformers 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, sponsor of campaign finance reform  
legislation he seeks to make an issue in the Republican campaign, 
said ``it certainly is unfortunate'' that Bush and Forbes 
apparently are going to run without federal funds to avoid the 
spending limits. ``Because the whole intent of the law was to 
prevent ... what they may do,'' McCain said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Still the 1974 law doesn't require any candidate to take the  
money and run within the restrictions attached to it. And it holds 
all candidates to the same contribution limits -- $1,000 for an 
individual. Political action committees can give up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign said his funds so far came from more than  
75,000 donors, in contributions averaging $480 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is second among Republican candidates in 1999 fund  
raising, at $4.1 million plus $2 million transferred from his 
Senate campaign fund. He said he is taking matching funds, 
acknowledging that he couldn't afford not to anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, a candidate who signs up for the matching funds and  
qualifies for the maximum can get $16.75 million, and in the 
bargain is limited to spending about $40 million, for campaigning 
and for fund-raising expenses. There are state-by-state spending 
ceilings; avoiding them will be a major advantage in a nomination 
campaign likely to be settled in the first six weeks of the 2000 
primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said he'd never considered forgoing the  
matching funds to avoid the spending limits. ``I support the system 
of campaign finance reform and I think our reforms should go 
further,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He's raised about $18.5 million so far.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore could have leftover problems, given his role in the 1996  
drive for campaign money. ``I don't see how they can make fund 
raising an issue when they're backing up trucks loaded with cash in 
Austin,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant backing Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain, campaigning in New Hampshire, taunted Gore for his  
appearance at a Buddhist temple in California to raise money for 
the 1996 campaign. ``Most Americans care very much when monks and 
nuns abandon their vows of poverty and pay tens of thousands of 
dollars to have spiritual communion with the vice president,'' 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spent early and heavily in the last campaign on  
television attack ads that hit Bob Dole hard before he won the 
nomination. It was costly and damaging to Dole. The Bush campaign 
is wary of facing the same tactics, and that was one of the reasons 
his strategists set out in the first place to try to run without 
accepting matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Dole effectively clinched the nomination by mid-March,  
but only after a costly campaign that put him up against the legal 
limit on spending. He had to scrimp while Clinton, unopposed for 
renomination, had money to spend all spring. Dole said at the time 
that Clinton should give back the federal matching money because he 
didn't have a primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The current reform debate is over unlimited donations to  
political parties, so-called soft money. It does not involve the 
limited contributions that can be made to individual candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bush -- who said anybody who thinks a candidate can be  
bought for a $1,000 donation should vote for somebody else.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Gulfstream Park agreed Tuesday to sell  
the track to MI Ventures Inc. for $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made in a news release by Gulfstream, where  
the Breeders' Cup will be held Nov. 5-7. The 2000 meeting will run 
from Jan. 3 through March 16. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indians Send Whiten, Tam to Buffalo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mark Whiten's return to the Cleveland Indians  
didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiten was optioned to Buffalo of the Triple-A International  
League on Tuesday along with right-handed pitcher Jeff Tam. The 
Indians recalled outfielders Jacob Cruz and Alex Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiten, who broke his right foot during spring training in  
February, was activated from the 60-day disabled list on June 23. 
But the outfielder went just 4-for-25 in eight games for the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Tam appeared for Cleveland for the first time in Sunday's 10-9  
loss to the Kansas City Royals. He lasted just a third of an inning 
and gave up three runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz and Ramirez both hit better than .300 for Cleveland in  
short stints with the Indians earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests How Kids Should Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Children gain strength faster by repeatedly  
lifting moderate weights rather than working out with heavy 
weights, according to a new study in the July issue of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach is different than that recommended for adults, who  
build muscle most effectively by doing a few repetitions with heavy 
weights. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study suggests that lighter weights with moderate load  
are not only safer but will make children stronger,'' said the lead 
author, Avery Faigenbaum, an exercise physiologist at the 
University of Massachusetts, Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's muscular endurance also improved, Faigenbaum  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 43 children ages 5 through 11 who trained  
twice weekly for eight weeks in a supervised YMCA after-school 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Until about a decade ago, it was feared that pumping iron might  
damage the bones and stunt the growth of children so young, 
Faigenbaum said. But research shows children benefit from lifting 
weights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of  
Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning 
Association all support appropriately designed and supervised 
resistance training, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Faigenbaum said after-school programs, community centers, YMCAs  
and school physical education teachers ought to include such 
instruction in their programs. He said weight lifting could help 
America's increasingly overweight and out-of-shape children get 
ready for sports that demand fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	``A growing body of evidence suggests that strength training can  
help to decrease injuries in youth sports,'' Faigenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert who was not involved in the study disagreed with many  
of Faigenbaum's conclusions, saying children under age 8 ``have 
better things to do'' than lift weights. He said he doubts that 
small youngsters will avoid injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think at that age, they should be in programs designed to  
help develop their movement skills ... running, jumping, throwing, 
catching, skipping and so on,'' said the expert, Robert Malina, 
director of the Institute for the Study of Youth Sports at Michigan 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's 32 boys and 11 girls were randomly divided into  
three groups. In one, the children did 11 strength-training 
exercises using heavy weights (80 percent of their maximum ability 
on one try) for five to six repetitions. In another group, the 
youngsters did the same exercises with moderate weights (68 percent 
of their maximum) for 13 to 15 repetitions. In a third control 
group, no exercise was prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the eight weeks, the moderate lifters were 16  
percent stronger in the upper body, compared with 5 percent for the 
heavy lifters and 4 percent for the control group. 
</P>
<P>
	In leg strength, moderate lifters had improved 41 percent,  
compared with 31 percent for heavy lifters and 13 percent for the 
control group.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Plot Strategy for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For the first time since they chose  
Philadelphia for their 2000 national convention, Republicans from 
across the country will gather here this week to plot strategy for 
next year's presidential and congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The 165-member Republican National Committee will identify the  
issues they believe can lead them to victory and craft ways to 
deliver the party's message state by state, Republican spokesman 
Mark Pfeifle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working to make sure that when our candidate has been  
nominated by Republican voters, the RNC has the infrastructure set 
up and ready to take that candidate to the White House, whoever he 
or she may be,'' Pfeifle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day meeting begins Wednesday with gatherings of  
Republican women and the RNC's Committee on Arrangements, the group 
planning the presidential convention, followed by a reception and 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the RNC rules committee will discuss a trend among  
states to hold presidential primaries earlier and earlier. RNC 
Chairman Jim Nicholson expressed concern last week that the 
``front-loading'' of the campaign calendar means ``not enough 
people get involved in this process of choosing who the nominees 
will be for the most important job on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Learning to communicate effectively will be the topic of a media  
seminar Thursday called ``Making News and Moving the Republican 
Message in your State.'' Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who has been 
mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, will speak on 
the topic that night, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson, co-chair Pat Harrison and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.,  
will address committee members Friday, after which the party will 
also hold a seminar on targeting women voters. 
</P>
<P>
	All 12 Republican presidential candidates were invited to  
address the RNC. As of Tuesday, only Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes had 
said they would attend.

	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Former Connecticut Gov. Lowell P.  
Weicker Jr. is again considering a third-party run for the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura encouraged Weicker to offer himself  
as a Reform Party nominee. Weicker, who also considered running in 
1996, said Tuesday he is interested in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us who are independents have a common bond, in that we  
feel that the Republicans and the Democrats have had a monopoly for 
too long and it's beginning to wear rather thin,'' Weicker told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to have competition in anything, and you had no  
political competition for decades,'' Weicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker, 68, said he expects to make a decision within the next  
few months, after considering the effect on his family. He has four 
children ranging in age from 16 to 21, three older children from a 
previous marriage and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's sailing together ... or being together at a  
family picnic, those are the things that go out the window, and I'm 
not so sure I want to revert to that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wodele, a spokesman for Ventura, said the governor  
encouraged Weicker to run during a three-hour meeting in New York 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker left the Connecticut governor's office five years ago  
after a long career in politics. He ran for president once before, 
in 1980, as a Republican. But he dropped out of the race before the 
primaries when it became clear Ronald Reagan would win the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker said he is considering a run in 2000 to encourage a  
national dialogue on issues such as poverty, children, violence and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are all items that should be the real agenda of this  
country,'' he said. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole named  
Kathleen Harrington, a longtime adviser, as her deputy campaign 
manager Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington will be primarily responsible for overseeing finance  
operations for Mrs. Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington will take time off from her position as a lobbyist  
for an insurance company to work for Mrs. Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Dole was labor secretary under President Reagan,  
Harrington worked for her as assistant secretary of labor for 
congressional and intergovernmental affairs. She has also worked as 
assistant administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and 
was chief of staff for Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Starts Vote Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Nearly a month after Indonesia's  
parliamentary elections, the vote-counting process moved into a new 
phase today while electoral officials admitted they still do not 
know when they will release final results. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, vote counting for the June 7 elections has been  
conducted on a provincial level. Provincial results started being 
tallied on the national level today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the National Election Committee said they had  
gathered results from just 17 of the country's 27 provinces, and 
could not say when all results would be reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know when it will be finished, but soon we  
might know how many seats each political party will have in the 
national assembly,'' said Sulastri, an election worker who, like 
many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie, whose ruling Golkar party trails in  
unofficial results, announced last week that the selection of the 
next president could be delayed until December. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballot was Indonesia's first democratic election in 44  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	An electoral college of 500 parliament members and 200  
representatives of provincial assemblies and special interest 
groups will choose the next president. That ballot is scheduled for 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakob Tobing, head of the National Election Committee, insisted  
that problems with the vote count would not delay the presidential 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges of fraud and manipulation have delayed many provincial  
vote tallies. Several local election officials have refused to 
submit vote counts until the government pays their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobing has also blamed the slow tally on incompetence and  
inexperience within the vast national electoral network. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest unofficial results, based on a count of almost 80  
percent of the vote, show the opposition Indonesian Democratic 
Party of Struggle -- led by Megawati Sukarnoputri -- in first place 
with about 35 percent. Golkar trails with 22 percent.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Energy Rebuffs MiSource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Energy Group's board rejected the  
latest $5.7 billion takeover offer from NiSource Inc, saying it is 
not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The NiSource offer to buy all of Columbia's outstanding stock  
for $68 per share is inadequate and likely would be rejected by 
federal and state regulators, Columbia officials said today. The 
board urged Columbia shareholders to oppose NiSource's takeover 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have told you on several occasions, Columbia is not for  
sale,'' Columbia chairman Oliver Richard told Nisource chairman 
Gary Neale in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will resist any attempts to take for the benefit of  
NiSource shareholders the value of Columbia's assets and strategic 
growth plans,'' Richard said. ``Columbia's value rightfully belongs 
to Columbia's shareholders, not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, the parent company of Northern Indiana Public Service  
Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts, would become one of the 
nation's biggest natural gas companies if it succeeded in the 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., began the unsolicited  
buyout offer after Columbia officials refused to schedule merger 
talks. NiSource officials said today they were undeterred by 
Columbia's response and would continue with the takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Columbia management feels the price is unfair, let's sit  
down and talk about price,'' spokeswoman Maria Hibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy, based in Herndon, had 1998 revenues of nearly  
$6.6 billion. It is involved in natural gas exploration, 
production, transmission, storage and distribution as well as 
propane sales and electric power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Columbia were down 50 cents to $64 in late morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of NiSource 
were down 12 1/2 cents to $26.43 3/4

<HEADLINE> Illegal Dealer Sold Suspect His Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Benjamin Nathaniel Smith bought the guns he used  
in his racist shooting spree from an illegal street dealer after he 
was turned away by a gun shop that did the required background 
check, investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The background check showed that an ex-girlfriend of Smith's had  
taken out a protective order against him because of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control activists said the case demonstrates the inadequacy  
of the nation's gun laws, while the gun lobby said the problem is 
lax enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, killed himself during a struggle with police Sunday  
night after a series of drive-by shootings of Jews, blacks and 
Asians in Illinois and Indiana that left two people dead and nine 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The white supremacist had tried to buy two 9 mm handguns and a  
shotgun on June 23 at a licensed gun shop in Peoria Heights, said 
Jerry Singer, an agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	After being rejected, Smith bought a Bryco .380-caliber  
semiautomatic handgun on June 26 and .22-caliber pistol on June 29 
from an illegal dealer who already was being investigated by the 
ATF, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both guns were found with Smith's body after he killed himself  
near the southern Illinois town of Salem. Tests showed that weapons 
of those calibers were used in the spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the unlicensed dealer who sold Smith the guns has  
been turned over to federal prosecutors for possible charges, 
Singer said. The dealer's name and other information about the 
purchases were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Schneider, owner of the Heights Gun and Hunter Supplies  
shop in Peoria Heights, confirmed in an interview that Smith had 
been at his store. He said Smith was calm when told he couldn't 
have the guns and several boxes of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said he'd check it out and left,'' Schneider said.  
</P>
<P>
	The denial was based on a two-year order for protection filed by  
former girlfriend Elizabeth Sahr that took effect in April 1998. 
Ms. Sahr had accused him of severely beating her and said she 
feared for her life because of his white supremacist connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted felons and people with orders of protection against  
them are prohibited under state and federal law from buying guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Dave Sanders, a spokesman for the Illinois State Police,  
said the state issued Smith a firearm owner's ID card on June 18 
because of errors in the order for protection, which -- among other 
things -- listed Smith's middle initial as ``A.'' His eye color and 
weight also didn't match, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the card was revoked June 30 after Smith was rejected by  
the gun shop. ``The system did work and prevented him from actually 
getting the guns,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that apparently didn't prevent Smith from going to a street  
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	A search Monday of an apartment Smith rented in Morton, just  
outside Peoria, turned up receipts for ammunition, boxes for two 
guns and stacks of hate literature, said Skokie police Sgt. Michael 
Ruth, a spokesman for the task force overseeing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had been a member of the World Church of the Creator, a  
white supremacist organization based in East Peoria. He had 
regularly distributed hate literature while he was a student at the 
University of Illinois and, most recently, at Indiana University in 
Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists on both sides of the gun control debate said the story  
of how Smith got his guns supported their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Morel Las, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun  
Violence, said the case shows a need for more oversight in the 
secondary gun market -- including gun shows, street dealers and 
Internet sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all the people who argue gun control doesn't work, it  
actually did because it kept him from purchasing a gun through 
legal methods,'' she said. ``However, it pushed him right into the 
unlicensed gun market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Baker, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle  
Association, said federal authorities should have arrested Smith 
when he attempted to buy a gun at the licensed shop despite the 
protective order. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system works,'' Baker said. ``If we're not going to arrest  
people who violate federal laws, why are we passing them?''

<HEADLINE> Court Restores Motel 6 Bias Verdicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court restored $358,000  
in damages Tuesday for two Idaho couples who were abruptly fired as 
Motel 6 managers and replaced by younger, lower-paid couples. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge should not have overturned jury verdicts of age  
discrimination because there was ample evidence to support them, 
said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases involved ``the same pattern of furtive inspections  
followed by instant terminations,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Motel 6 attorney Michael Marino said the Dallas-based chain of  
750 low-priced motels plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both couples, longtime Motel 6 managers, were fired by the same  
area manager, Doug Massman, after they returned from vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	One couple, Art and Donna Huttinger, had been Motel 6 managers  
for eight years and ran a motel near Pocatello, Idaho when they 
were fired in 1993. Mrs. Huttinger, 55, had the manager's title and 
had gotten merit pay raises each year. Her husband was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Massman, who had inspected the motel during their vacation,  
accused them of mishandling room keys and discriminating against 
Indians from nearby reservations, based partly on accusations by a 
disgruntled employee, the court said. He gave them no chance to 
respond and did not review their personnel files before firing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The other couple, Delores Fennern, 58, and her husband, James,  
60, managers of an Idaho Falls, Idaho Motel 6, had been managers 
for 13 years when Massman fired them in early 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Massman and another supervisor had inspected the motel and found  
several cleanliness violations. Motel staff said Massman had 
insisted on getting a room immediately, before anyone could clean 
it, and noted that relief managers were responsible for cleanliness 
in the Fennerns' absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Massman did not look at the Fennerns' personnel files, which  
would have shown that they had successfully cleaned up motels in 
other cities, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both couples were replaced by younger husband-and-wife teams who  
had less experience and made substantially less money. The 
Huttingers have retired, and the Fennerns now work for a local 
school district, said their lawyer, James Holman. 
</P>
<P>
	A single jury heard both cases and awarded $128,000 to the  
Huttingers and $230,000 to the Fennerns for lost pay and punitive 
damages. But U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled that the 
verdicts were not supported by the evidence, ordered dismissal of 
the Huttingers' suit and granted a new trial in the Fennerns' suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In overturning his decision, the appeals court said the evidence  
would have supported a verdict for either side but was more than 
adequate to justify the jurors' findings of willful discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate court ruling was issued by Judges Betty Fletcher,  
Stephen Reinhardt and Sidney Thomas.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Seeks New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terry Nichols, who claims the FBI improperly  
withheld information on the Oklahoma City bombing that could have 
helped his defense, headed back to court in a bid to win a new 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, was convicted in 1997 of conspiracy and involuntary  
manslaughter in the bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building. 
He is serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy McVeigh, his former Army buddy, has appealed his death  
sentence on murder and weapons convictions. Prosecutors claimed 
Nichols helped McVeigh finance the plan, gather the ingredients and 
mix the bomb used in the 1995 blast that killed 168 people and 
injured hundreds of others. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols' hearing was to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
	At issue are dozens of FBI lead sheets given to defense  
attorneys on Dec. 11, 1997 -- just 12 days before Nichols was 
convicted. The sheets are used to record information from informal 
interviews or from callers during an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Michael Tigar has argued that several lead sheets  
contained helpful information that the defense would have pursued. 
</P>
<P>
	One sheet, written shortly after the bombing, reported that  
Michael Fortier ``advised that McVeigh purchased racing fuel at a 
race track in Kingman (Ariz.) and had rented his own shed there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar told U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch that he never  
challenged the prosecution's contention that the racing fuel was 
purchased at a Texas track because prosecutors never acknowledged 
they had conflicting evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors spent a lot of time at Nichols' trial trying to  
prove that he was in Texas at the time the fuel was purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar claims he has other sheets showing that McVeigh plotted  
the attack with a group of associates operating around Kingman, 
rather than with Nichols, and evidence that Roger Moore, a gun 
dealer who claims he was robbed, had changed his testimony. 
Prosecutors contend the guns were stolen by Nichols and McVeigh to 
finance the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier pleaded guilty to having advance knowledge of the plot  
to bomb the building. He testified against McVeigh and Nichols, 
admitting he helped McVeigh move and sell stolen weapons and lied 
to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The 10th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals recently ordered a new sentencing hearing 
on the grounds that the lower court used sentencing guidelines that 
were too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar argued that the information the government withheld could  
have been crucial to his case, especially the report about other 
fuel purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors rejected the claim, saying ``the information in this  
lead sheet, even assuming it accurately reported an early statement 
by Fortier, would not warrant a new trial.''

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Cos. Go by Own Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whether it's local or long distance, home phone  
or pay phone, it's understood: A call starts with ``hello.'' If 
there's no answer, there's no charge. 
</P>
<P>
	With mobile phones, the situation can be quite different.  
</P>
<P>
	Most mobile phone companies charge from the moment the caller  
hits the ``send'' button. One industry leader, Sprint PCS, charges 
for calls even if there's no answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Since companies generally charge for a full minute even when  
less than a minute is used, those few seconds when the phone is 
ringing could inflate a monthly bill quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	This is especially true if the caller is paying extra fees for  
peak-hour usage, long-distance or calls made far away from home 
that trigger ``roaming'' charges of 60 cents or more a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The only nod to conventional telephone wisdom is that most  
companies don't charge if there's a busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
	These billing policies are spelled out in the contracts signed  
by today's 76 million cell phone users -- but even some experts and 
careful shoppers were surprised to hear of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea, and I would consider myself as astute on my  
telephone charges as anybody,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, an 
telecommunications industry analyst with Banc of America Securities 
in San Francisco and a former executive with the regional phone 
company U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Occasionally, when I'm out of town, I will make a call and  
look at the second hand on my watch to keep it under a minute 
because I'm paying long-distance or roaming charges,'' said 
Mitchell. ``But I've been timing it from `hello' instead of from 
`send.' I won't make that mistake now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of first-minute billing policies caught the public eye  
in recent weeks after Cellular One tried to reduce the free 
``ringing time'' it gives its New England customers to 15 seconds 
from 30. The carrier was bombarded by customer complaints, and 
quickly scrapped the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the million or more people signing up for wireless  
service each month focus less on when the call begins and more on 
how many minutes are included in their monthly calling plan or the 
fees for long-distance and peak-hour calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Litwinski, 26, an independent film maker from New York,  
disconnected his home phone and uses his wireless for all calls, 
but he had no idea he could be charged for unanswered calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really paid much attention to it, honestly. I just  
assumed,'' said Litwinski. ``It kind of stinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's rationale in treating mobile phones differently  
from regular phones is that every wireless call uses the airwaves 
regardless of whether the call is successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, regular calls also use resources such as space on a  
fiber-optic cable. But the companies argue that they have far 
greater capacity in their cables than their wireless channels, and 
that the demands of carrying a regular phone signal are negligible 
compared with a wireless signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're occupying a channel. So when you make a connection, you  
get charged from the inception of when you seize that channel,'' 
explained Jeff Battcher, a BellSouth spokesman. ``For the most 
part, it's always been that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS is only major company that charges from  
``send-to-end'' regardless of whether there's an answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Even among companies that only charge when a call goes through,  
including AirTouch, Bell Atlantic Mobile, BellSouth Mobility and 
Nextel Communications, the meter starts running from ``send,'' not 
from ``hello.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leader AT&AMP;T Wireless also starts the clock from  
``send,'' but doesn't charge for incomplete calls made from within 
a customer's home region. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, since many calling plans come with hundreds of  
minutes to burn each month, a lot of mobile phone users rarely 
reach their limit and don't need to pay additional charges for 
calls that don't go through. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwinski, for example, pays $100 a month for a Sprint PCS plan  
with 1,000 minutes of air time so he won't have to worry about how 
long he talks or how many calls he makes. ``I never go over,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for those who frequently exceed their monthly allowance or  
sign up for cheaper plans with smaller time allotments, those 
first-minute charges can be substantial since the average user 
racks up 100 minutes a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Adkins, spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business  
Bureaus and a Cellular One customer, was also surprised to hear 
about ``send-to-end'' charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't tell you these things. I read my bill. I read all  
the flyers. It goes to show, you really have to read your 
contract.''

<HEADLINE> AOL, Koop in $89 Million Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Just as any good doctor knows when a  
patient needs a specialist, the Internet company led by former 
Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop is reaching out to an online 
veteran to help care for its young business. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop's company, drkoop.com, has agreed to pay $89 million over  
four years to form an alliance with America Online Inc., the 
dominant provider of Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Tuesday will give AOL, based in Dulles, a  
link to one of the most widely respected names in medicine, while 
drkoop.com hopes to build up advertising and electronic sales by 
attracting AOL's millions of users. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity,'' said Emily Meehan, an analyst with  
the Yankee Group in Boston. ``Nobody else has done anything like 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the reach of AOL and its CompuServe and Netscape  
Netcenter brands, however, some analysts wondered whether the 
health care service would be able to produce enough business to 
meet the four-year schedule for paying AOL $89 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Internet health care ventures have unlimited potential  
because the market applies to everyone, it remains to be seen 
whether the public will flock to drkoop.com and other such sites as 
investors have swarmed to online brokerages, Ms. Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of hype,'' she said. ``But right now,  
two-thirds of American homes are not using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will sell ads for drkoop.com, which, like many Internet  
ventures popular on Wall Street, has yet to turn a profit. The 
company lost $4.1 million on revenue of $404,000 in the three 
months ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, health care is a $1 trillion industry and more  
consumers will look to the Internet for help and savings, said 
Donald Hackett, president and CEO of drkoop.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this partnering enables us to reach critical  
mass,'' Hackett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal between drkoop.com and AOL is not exclusive; drkoop.com  
also is found on the GO Network, owned by The Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to Koop's site can get information on a range of  
products and services such as insurance, interactive support 
groups, vitamins and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more people are turning to the Internet for health  
information,'' AOL spokesman Tom Ziemba said, adding that Koop is 
the most ``widely recognized and trusted'' voice for this 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary competition will come from Healtheon, which recently  
bought WebMD. The site is accessible through Microsoft's MSN. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales over the Internet have expanded rapidly, but the  
sale of health products by computer is still relatively untested 
and is considered an emerging market, Ms. Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity is certainly there,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Koop, 82, who has a 7 percent stake in the company, spent seven  
years as surgeon general in the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<HEADLINE> Health Plan Drug Coverage Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: My health insurance plan will no longer pay for my  
prescription drug. What should I do? 

</P>
<P>
	A: For starters, complain.  
</P>
<P>
	Appeal to your doctor, health plan provider and possibly your  
employer if it's paying for your insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're in a Medicare health maintenance organization, you  
might want to switch to a health plan that does cover the drug you 
want. Unlike those who have HMO coverage in the private sector, 
Medicare enrollees can change health plans every 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	No solution is guaranteed success, but HMOs often will relax  
their rules if you can show why you really need a certain 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescription drug coverage has been a key reason why consumers,  
especially senior citizens, join managed care plans. But to contain 
costs, HMOs have begun to reduce the number of drugs covered. 
</P>
<P>
	If an HMO covers a drug, it often requires consumers to pay a  
nominal co-payment such as $5 or $10 -- which is a great deal 
considering many prescriptions cost more than $100 for a month's 
supply. When a drug is not ``preferred'' by the HMO, the health 
plan either will charge the consumer a higher co-payment -- 
typically $25 or $30 -- or provide no coverage at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Many HMOs have started using a three-tiered drug coverage system  
in which the plans charge consumers a small fee for a generic 
medication, a higher fee for a preferred brand-name drug and a 
still higher fee for a non-preferred brand name drug. But while the 
three-tiered program means you'll have at least some coverage for 
all drugs, it can be pricey for those non-preferred brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Before launching into a tirade against your HMO for not covering  
the drug you want, talk to your doctor to see if one of the HMO's 
preferred drugs would work for you. 
</P>
<P>
	If that isn't the case, most states and industry accrediting  
bodies require HMOs to have an internal complaint system to hear 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	``These appeals are generally successful, especially if you and  
your doctor can show this is the only drug that works for you,'' 
says Charlie Inlander, president of People's Medical Society, a 
consumer health group in Allentown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside to the appeal system is that it can take weeks or  
months to play out. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO consumers also should tell their employer's benefits  
department if they're unhappy with their health plan. HMOs often 
don't want to upset big companies, so they may change policies if 
enough people from one company complain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, it's the employer paying the bill,'' Inlander says.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mob Associate Get 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A reputed associate of the Bonanno crime family  
who used mob clout to force Wall Street brokers to promote an 
Arizona company's stock was sentenced Tuesday to eight years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Lombardo, 47, apologized for his role in a 1997  
conspiracy that made participants more than $1.3 million in illicit 
profits. The case was the largest ever to involve mobsters trying 
to manipulate stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to apologize to the courts and my family for putting  
them through all of this,'' Lombardo said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin's 8-year sentence fell in  
the mid-range of federal sentencing guidelines. Chin also ordered 
Lombardo to pay $200,000 in restitution and to stay clear of 
organized crime members. Lombardo must surrender on Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardo was one of four men who admitted a role in attempts to  
manipulate the price of HealthTech International Inc., a Mesa, 
Ariz., owner of health and fitness centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the company's stock rose after the participants  
made a deal with the company's chairman and then brokers convinced 
unwitting buyers the company's stock was worth eight times more 
than it was. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a federal jury convicted HealthTech chairman Gordon  
Hall, 45, of racketeering, securities fraud and wire fraud. He is 
awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall's lawyer, James McGuire, had argued at trial that his  
client was victimized by mob-tainted promoters he met in December 
1996. The lawyer said the promoters never told Hall they had mob 
ties when he signed a consulting agreement with them.

<HEADLINE> Honda Unveils Fuel Efficient Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Honda Motor Co., Japan's third-largest automaker,  
said on Tuesday it has developed a low-pollution car that is also 
the world's most fuel efficient mass-production vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker said it will equip its ``Insight'' cars, scheduled  
for release later this year, with a so-called Integrated Motor 
Assist System, a motor and a battery that help propel a 1 liter 
gasoline engine. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology will allow the car to drive 84 miles per gallon  
of fuel -- the highest in the world for a gasoline-powered consumer 
car, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars' exhaust emissions will also be much cleaner than  
required by planned regulation, Honda said. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers around the world take steps to protect the  
environment, automakers have sought ways to reduce the pollution 
released by their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1997 conference on global environmental issues held in  
Kyoto, Japan, 38 countries promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions 
-- mainly carbon dioxide -- to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2008 
to 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	The Honda technology ``is part of the company's overall thrust  
to develop environment-friendly autos,'' said Yuriko Yabe, a Honda 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will also use aluminum in the car's body,  
making the body at least 40 percent lighter than one made of steel 
and helping reduce fuel consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has developed a new catalytic converter, a device  
that neutralizes toxic exhaust fumes, that will make vehicle 
emissions 50 percent cleaner than required by Japanese regulations 
slated for next year, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Citrus Industry Faces Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Art Freeman knows his years are numbered as a  
citrus grower. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman owns and tends a 300-acre spread of lush-green groves  
some 20 miles east of downtown Phoenix, far removed from the urban 
sprawl. But that may not be the case much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The development that has swallowed up so much of the surrounding  
desert is steadily advancing on the farm he established 30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farming is done here, but we have no place to go,'' he  
lamented. ``We don't fit in anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus for much of the 20th century was a cornerstone of the  
state's so-called ``Five C's'' economy, along with cattle, climate, 
copper and cotton. Yuma and the Phoenix area communities of 
Gilbert, Mesa and Queen Creek are primary growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groves in south Phoenix are also still in use. But on the  
brink of a new millennium, the industry is shrinking, leaving 
growers, shippers, scientists and agricultural officials to ponder 
the fate of Arizona citrus growing. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Freeman and other growers have managed to survive in an  
industry under constant attack from foreign competition, government 
regulations, Mother Nature and, of course, subdivisions. They're 
not optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a lot of personal hope in the next 40 or 50  
years,'' said James Truman, farm manager of the University of 
Arizona's Citrus Agricultural Center in Waddell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the South American countries come on line, there will be  
even more fierce competition,'' said Glen Curtis, a Yuma citrus 
grower in business for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics are telling: From 1994 until 1997, the value of  
Arizona's citrus crop -- grapefruits, lemons, oranges and tangerines 
-- declined from about $79 million to $46 million. Also in that 
time, the number of acres harvested fell from 37,600 to 33,100, 
according to the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Within Arizona's $6.3 billion agriculture industry, citrus  
doesn't even rank among the state's top 10 cash crops. Cotton is 
king in Arizona and hay, wheat, lettuce, cantaloupes and broccoli 
are more valued than citrus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason the citrus industry is smaller now is because of  
urban growth,'' said Andy Kurtz, executive director of the Arizona 
Farm Bureau. ``Many new homes are built in former citrus 
orchards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the east Mesa area, the conversion of orchards into  
subdivisions is evident to anyone driving by. Among the miles and 
miles of dark-green groves sit sections of concrete sewer mains 
awaiting burial. Some homes are surrounded by citrus trees that 
have been left unmolested. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blame these guys for selling out. Money is slim  
these days,'' said Terry Tipton, whose uncle's 80-acre Mesa citrus 
orchard will soon have a rendezvous with the bulldozer. ``The way 
of life for the farmer is disappearing. The industry seems shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, however, the citrus industry contraction was reversed  
temporarily thanks to a freeze that nearly wiped out California's 
citrus crop. The freeze helped drive up prices and increased demand 
for Arizona's harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ironic, growers say, the two things that made Arizona so  
attractive for citrus growing -- a good climate and lots of cheap 
land -- are helping to undo the industry. Those factors, among 
others, are luring record numbers of people to Arizona who need new 
homes and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Development, that's what it gets down to, said Jim Mast, a  
small Mesa grower and manager of Mesa Citrus Growers. ``What can 
you do about it?''

<HEADLINE> Senior Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Byers might have to back off  
on his prediction that 5-under par would be good enough to win the 
U.S. Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Byers, course superintendent for the Des Moines Golf and Country  
Club, had said the par-72 layout was challenging enough that a 
four-round total of 283 could win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching defending champion Hale Irwin attack the course  
in practice, he's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``My 5-under prediction has probably changed,'' Byers said  
Tuesday. ``He started out just missing a birdie putt on the first 
hole, then he birdied the second hole and third hole. After that, I 
went back to the maintenance center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byers said he was pleased with the condition of the course and  
said the staff was able to get things back in shape after an 
overnight thunderstorm dropped an inch of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain did cool things off, though. After Monday's steamy  
93-degree weather, the humidity dropped and the temperature peaked 
in the mid-80s. It was so pleasant that when asked if he could call 
the weather for the rest of the week, Byers replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``Exactly like this morning -- the lower temperatures, lower  
humidities. This is excellent. I think everyone will enjoy the 
weather today.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUVAL DOUBLE:* It will remain a moment that Bob Duval remembers  
forever. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 28, the day Duval won the Emerald Coast Classic near  
Pensacola, Fla., for his first victory on the Senior PGA Tour, his 
son, David, won The Players Championship on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before had a father and son won on the same weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	``The win was really important to him, but I think David was  
more proud of me for winning,'' said Bob Duval, who's playing in 
this week's Senior Open. ``Here I'd been a club pro all my life. 
That was his 11th win and my first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval was the top money winner on the PGA Tour in 1998 and  
already has earned more than $3 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval, 52, did not play on the PGA Tour, spending most of  
his career as the head pro at Timuquana Country Club in 
Jacksonville, Fla., and The Plantation in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. 
He joined the senior tour in 1997 after earning a conditional 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think David knew how hard it was for me to win,'' Bob said.  
``Your window is pretty short out here. You've got about five or 
six years and then you don't play very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FORMER CHAMPS:* The withdrawal of Jack Nicklaus and Miller  
Barber leaves the Open field with seven former champions. 
</P>
<P>
	That group includes last year's winner, Hale Irwin. Also entered  
are Graham Marsh (1997), Dave Stockton (1996), Simon Hobday (1994), 
Larry Laoretti (1992), Dale Douglass (1986) and Arnold Palmer 
(1981). 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PERSONALITY TEST:* Vicente Fernandez says you learn a lot about  
a person playing golf with him. That's why he's so disappointed 
that Jack Nicklaus withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, a two-time Senior Open champion, pulled out of the  
tournament to continue resting his aching left hip. Fernandez 
recalled the few times he played with Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play much. But I played enough to meet a real  
gentleman,'' he said. ``Golf is a sport that shows you what kind of 
person you are. Every time I played with him, he showed that kind 
of person he is -- a very nice person.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUESDAY GOLF:* Larry Rinker left no doubt Tuesday's action was  
just for practice -- and sometimes fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Rinker hit his tee shot on No. 16 into the rough on the right  
side of the fairway. Fans started to back off as Rinker approached 
his ball, but he told them, ``Stay right where you're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whereupon Rinker picked up the ball and flipped it back into the  
fairway. Before hitting his next shot, Rinker turned the crowd and 
said, ``That's the advantage of Tuesday golf.''

<HEADLINE>  Gamblers Wary of Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Lem Banker once picked the winner in 13  
straight Super Bowls and has bet on almost every sport ever played. 
When asked to pick a side in the women's World Cup final, though, 
he didn't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think the Chinese will steal any of our secret plays?''  
Banker asked, only partly in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the young girls who scream for their favorite players and  
the fans who will fill the Rose Bowl on Saturday, those who make a 
living betting on sports aren't quite sure what to make of the 
World Cup final between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, wagering on the biggest woman's soccer game  
ever played will probably draw only about the same amount of money 
as a weekday baseball game might in the sports books that line the 
Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a long way from a Super Bowl,'' said Pete  
Korner, who sets odds for Las Vegas sports books. ``Compared to 
mainstream sports, the betting is not much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the city's legal sports books are offering bets on the  
game, with most making the United States about an 8-5 favorite to 
beat China and win the World Cup. Norway is about a 2-1 favorite to 
beat Brazil for third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the wise guys aren't likely to be putting down wagers,  
the game is attracting attention among small bettors who like to 
have a little something riding on a game they plan to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of women are coming by asking about it, and some of  
them are betting $10 or $20 on the game,'' said Jay Kornegay, 
manager of the Imperial Palace sports book. ``But the real bettors 
have no idea. I couldn't name one player on the Chinese team and 
its hard to bet on something when you can't name a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Betting on the Women's World Cup was almost nonexistent until  
the semifinals because the U.S. team was such a prohibitive 
favorite that bettors would have had to wager $10 to win $1 on its 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Caesars Palace, though, betting was good on the semifinals,  
which were shown on the main big screen television in the casino's 
lavish and sprawling sports book. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the United States beat Brazil the other day, the book was  
full,'' said Vinny Magliulo, sports book manager Caesars Palace. 
``Baseball took a back seat to our girls that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magliulo said he plans to show the final on the same screen  
Saturday, and expects plenty of small bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of it is the casual patriotic support but there have been  
some four-figure wagers on the ladies,'' he said. ``Personally, I 
think the games are very exciting. These girls have done a great 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korner, oddsmaker for Las Vegas Sports Consultants, said  
gamblers who might wager $50,000 or $100,000 at a time will stay 
away from the game because they don't know the sport or the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Korner noted that the World Cup teams don't have a long history  
of statistics and have played very few actual games, making it 
difficult to handicap a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a token play just for the interest of a bet, if that,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what Banker, a longtime sports bettor plans to  
do with the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a patriotic kind of guy so I might make a little wager,  
nothing serious,'' Banker said. ``But my heart is with the USA. 
I'll be rooting for the girls.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Issued Weapons Deal Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department cautioned Russia it could  
be denied U.S. assistance if it concluded new weapons deal with 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be very concerned about any new Russian arms sales to  
Syria or to any other designated state sponsor of terrorism,'' 
spokesman James Foley said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria has been listed by the department as a sponsor of  
terrorism for 20 years. At the same time, the United States has 
been courting Syria to negotiate a peace treaty with Israel in 
which Syria hopes to recover lost strategic territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley cited a law that authorizes withholding U.S. assistance to  
any country that provides lethal military equipment to a sponsor of 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian President Hafez Assad is visiting Moscow. That has  
stirred speculation he is seeking new Russian weapons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Laments Midwest Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) -- President Clinton urged all  
Americans to ``rid our hearts of hatred, immediately'' in response 
to the deadly drive-by shootings in Illinois and Indiana apparently 
carried out by a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting here Tuesday as part of his national poverty tour, the  
president said the shootings were driven by ``blind racial hatred 
against anybody who didn't happen to be white,'' and underscored 
the need for the United States to strengthen its hate crimes laws 
and continue striving for racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have work to do here at home,'' Clinton told a crowd  
of about 1,000 outside a Walgreen's drug store. ``We must search 
the hearts of our citizens and search the strength of our 
communities. The Congress should pass the hate crimes legislation, 
but we should rid our hearts our hatred, immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people were shot during the weekend shooting spree, all  
of them either Jews, blacks or Asians. Two people were killed and 
nine wounded. Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, shot and killed himself 
during a struggle with police Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that the shootings took place during the July  
Fourth holiday weekend, as Americans were honoring the founding of 
their democracy. ``That action was a rebuke to the very ideals that 
got us started,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> McGwire, Sosa To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who led baseball's  
resurgence with their home-run race last summer, will be starting 
together in the All-Star game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs last year, and Sosa, who  
leads the major leagues with 32, were elected Tuesday to start for 
the National League at Boston's Fenway Park on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the 11th appearance and seventh start for McGwire,  
and the third appearance and first start for Sosa, whose first 
career home run came at Fenway against Roger Clemens on June 21, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say thank you to all the people who voted for me,''  
Sosa said. ``I feel pretty proud of myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Arizona Diamondbacks were the only team to place  
two players in the starting lineup: Matt Williams won at third base 
and Jay Bell overtook Houston's Craig Biggio in the final week to 
win at second. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza of the New York Mets will start at catcher for the  
sixth straight season and make his seventh appearance overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never get tired of going there,'' Piazza said. ``As long as  
I am elected or selected, I will feel honored to go. It is probably 
the most fun you can have as a player, hanging out with the rest of 
the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Barry Larkin held off the Mets' Rey Ordonez at  
shortstop, and Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn 
were elected to join Sosa in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, elected to his 15th All-Star game and 11th starting spot,  
won't play because of a calf injury that has put him on the 
disabled list for the second time this season. But he will make the 
trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted a chance to play in Fenway, but being on the  
DL, I can't,'' he said. ``It's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, one of the few bright spots in the Chicago Cubs' dismal  
season, was the NL's leading vote-getter with 2,315,204, finishing 
third overall in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (2,918,055) led all players  
for the fourth straight year and fifth time overall and was 
followed by Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar (2,793,891). 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, whose 26 homers for St. Louis tied him for second in  
the league going into Tuesday night's game, received the 
second-highest NL vote total, leading first basemen with 1,669,066. 
</P>
<P>
	He wishes the All-Star break was longer than three days.  
</P>
<P>
	``All the other sports have four to five days off,'' he said,  
``and I've never understood why baseball doesn't give the guys that 
play in the All-Star Game and extra day off just to get back to the 
cities they're going to play their games in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who trailed Biggio 697,326 to 658,407 in totals announced  
last week, finished with 1,203,902, about 32,000 ahead of his 
Houston rival, who wound up at 1,171,574. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, none of the votes cast on the Internet had  
been included in the weekly totals. Fans were allowed to vote up to 
22 times on the Internet -- the average number of home games for 
each team during the balloting. Sosa gained nearly 1 million votes 
in the final week of counting. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, who led Ordonez by fewer than 10,000 votes last week,  
won by a wide margin, 858,203 to 799,858. Larkin will be making his 
10th All-Star appearance, his fourth as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker will be making his fourth appearance, his third straight  
as a starter. Williams, a five-time All-Star, returns to the game 
for the first time since 1996 and will make his fourth start. For 
Bell, it's his second appearance and first start. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, Gwynn, McGwire, Piazza and Williams get $50,000 bonuses,  
and Walker gets $25,000. Griffey, who earned a $100,000 bonus for 
getting elected and leading the AL voting, gets an additional 
$25,000 for getting the most votes in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	AL starters were announced Monday. In addition to Griffey and  
Alomar, the lineup includes Cleveland's Jim Thome at first, and 
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton in the outfield. They will be joined 
by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Boston shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken and Tampa Bay 
designated hitter Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and reserves for both leagues will be picked Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Energy Rejects NiSource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Energy Group's board rejected the  
latest $5.7 billion takeover offer from NiSource Inc, saying it is 
not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The NiSource offer to buy all of Columbia's outstanding stock  
for $68 per share is inadequate and likely would be rejected by 
federal and state regulators, Columbia officials said Tuesday. The 
board urged Columbia shareholders to oppose NiSource's takeover 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have told you on several occasions, Columbia is not for  
sale,'' Columbia chairman Oliver Richard told Nisource chairman 
Gary Neale in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will resist any attempts to take for the benefit of  
NiSource shareholders the value of Columbia's assets and strategic 
growth plans,'' Richard said. ``Columbia's value rightfully belongs 
to Columbia's shareholders, not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, the parent company of Northern Indiana Public Service  
Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts, would become one of the 
nation's biggest natural gas companies if it succeeded in the 
takeover.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Khorkina Wins Another Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Russian gymnast  
Svetlana Khorkina captured her third gold medal of the University 
Games today by winning the uneven bars, her specialty. 
</P>
<P>
	Khornika scored a 9.8 out of 10, to beat Ukraine's Olha  
Teslenko, who was second with 9.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, in Olympic, Goodwill Games, World or European  
Championships, Khorkina has missed gold only once on the bars, 
finishing second in the world championships five years go. She 
added that title here to her golds from the team competition and 
the individual all-around, and was to compete for two more golds 
later Tuesday in the balance beam and floor exercise events. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four athletes in the 40-year history of the University  
Games have ever taken home as many as five gold medals. Soviet 
gymnast Dimitri Bilozerchev holds the record of six, in 1985, at 
Kobe, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to win (the all-around) yesterday, because it  
is very hot here and I feel tired. I'm not in the best physical 
shape,'' Khornika, 20 said, ``but the bars are my favorite event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Russian, Elena Produnova, won the women's vault and  
teammate Elena Dolgopolova was third. Cuban Arasay Jova took the 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Carballo won Spain's first medal of the event on the  
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny crowd of about 100 fans at the Principes de Espana  
arena saved its loudest cheers for Carballo, who took the bronze in 
the rings with a score of 9.625. Ivan Ivankov claimed one of two 
golds for Belarus here with a 9.8, and China's Zhen Dong won the 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitali Rudnitski of Belarus won the men's floor exercise, and  
Romanian Marius Daniel Urzica captured his country's first gold of 
the games in the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
	All eight of the gold medals won by the United States at this  
biannual, Olympics-style event have come in swimming, but the 
team's domination of the sport appeared headed for an end today, 
with Japan putting in the top performances in the morning heats. 
</P>
<P>
	The best U.S. showing came from Jessica Foschi, who early in her  
career was suspended for a failing a steroids test. She led 
qualifying for the women's 400-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Foschi was 15 when she tested positive for steroids at the U.S.  
national championships in Pasadena, Calif., on Aug. 4, 1995. She 
has denied ever knowingly taking a banned substance. U.S. Swimming 
placed Foschi on two years' probation, allowing her to compete in 
the 1996 Olympic trials and other national meets. She failed to 
make the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA, the sport's world governing body, suspended her for two  
years, a punishment eventually reduced to six months and made 
retroactive to 1995 by the Court for Arbitration in Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Keitaro Konnai clocked just .01 of a second off the  
University Games record for the men's 100-meter backstroke, and 
teammate Atsushi Nishitori had the second fastest time in 
qualifying for the evening finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomoko Hagiwara, who took gold in the 100-meter butterfly  
Sunday, and Miki Nakao gave Japan the top two qualifiers in the 
women's 200 backstroke, while countryman Akira Hayashi turned in 
the top heat performance in the men's 100 breaststroke.

<HEADLINE> Weis May Wait To Join Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frederick Weis, picked in the first round by the  
New York Knicks in last week's draft, isn't sure he will be ready 
to play in the NBA next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Weis, a 7-foot-2 member of the French National team, is still  
recovering from back surgery that he had in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't feel in shape or strong enough, it may be better  
for me and New York to wait one more year,'' he said in a 
conference call Tuesday. ``I'm sure I want to go to the NBA. But, I 
want to be ready to go. I think I'm not strong enough. Four months 
is not enough time to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weis said the back surgery had limited him in the European  
championships. ``I averaged something like 15 minutes a game,'' he 
said. ``The coach didn't want me to go too quick because I wasn't 
in shape. The last game, I played 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My shape is getting better and better. I feel good. I'm sure I  
will come to the NBA, this year or next year,'' he said. ``I just 
want to play basketball. The NBA is the best basketball in the 
world, so I want to play in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weis said he may come to the United States to play summer pro  
league basketball. New York has a team entered in the Boston 
Shootout from July 26 to Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks passed on local product Ron Artest of St. John's to  
choose Weis, projecting him as an eventual replacement for 
36-year-old Patrick Ewing.

<HEADLINE> `Homemaker' Group Changes Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Brandon Abbott remembers the moment he realized  
the Future Homemakers of America needed a new name. 
</P>
<P>
	After explaining the ``FHA'' slogan on his red blazer to a  
stranger at an airport, the man looked at Abbott and said: ``You're 
going to make someone a great wife someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jokes should stop now that Abbott, the organization's  
18-year-old departing president, has gotten his wish. The Future 
Homemakers, started in 1945 to teach teen-age girls how to keep 
house for their future husbands, have voted to change their name to 
Family, Career and Community Leaders of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote Tuesday came after a debate among the group's 220,000  
members -- girls and boys alike -- over whether the term 
``homemakers'' is hopelessly outdated. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, the group's members are more likely to be running food  
pantries or after-school programs than whipping up an apple brown 
Betty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Change is inevitable,'' said Sarah Graham, 17, of Dallas, Ga.  
``You have to update the name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reston, Va.-based organization offers programs in career  
development, community service, leadership and balancing family and 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates approved the name change 139-38 at the group's annual  
leadership meeting in Boston. Thirteen state chapters already have 
adopted the new name. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last five years, the organization has lost more than  
30,000 members, and some said they hope the new name will reverse 
the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in a few Indiana chapters started to grow after they  
adopted the new name, said Joe Grimme, 17, of Sharpsville, Ind., 
one of the group's 45,000 boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members, like 17-year-old Jenny Keller of Poth, Texas, are  
fiercely loyal to the traditional name and symbols their mothers 
used as future homemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to build on that,'' she said. ``You can't just give  
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the old name conjures up images of stay-at-home  
housewives who cook pot roast and darn socks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really represent who we are or what we do,'' said  
Joni Miller, 17, of Shenandoah, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Boys, who began to join the group in 1973, particularly disliked  
the name. Sixteen-year-old Tim Hinerman of Canon City, Colo., said 
he gets grief about it all the time.

<HEADLINE> Special Olympians Close Out Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- With tears and cheers, thousands of athletes  
from around the world said goodbye in an emotional closing ceremony 
of the Special Olympics' 10th World Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite sadness over the deaths of three people connected to the  
games, the ceremony at Duke University's Wallace Wade Stadium was a 
casual, sentimental event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin delegation entered the stadium Sunday night  
wearing ``cheeseheads'' to help shield heat that sickened more than 
a dozen participants. Others beat the 95-degree temperature by 
wearing bathing suits, dousing themselves with water from squirt 
guns or wearing wet towels over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes danced together and one drew a crowd as he dropped to  
his knees, pretending to play an inflatable toy guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I was here last Friday I was told to make new friends. I  
have made 304 new friends,'' said a sobbing Joseph ``Papa Joe'' 
Garceau, a 64-year-old softball player from Massachusetts. ``I had 
a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics, held for individuals with mental  
retardation, was founded in 1963 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. This 
year's games featured competitors from 150 countries and drew 
400,000 people, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to believe the Shrivers, who have seen it for 30 years,  
that this was the best ever,'' said LeRoy Walker, president of the 
Games and former president of the United States Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a moment of silence early in the program for a  
volunteer who died of heart problems just after the opening 
ceremony, an Egyptian athlete who died of an apparent seizure and 
University of North Carolina chancellor Michael Hooker, who died of 
cancer during the games he was instrumental in bringing to the 
Durham area. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Dominican basketball players and two Moroccan soccer players  
slipped away from their delegations in the event's opening days. 
Three have been heard from since, but one of the Moroccans remains 
unaccounted for, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next world Special Olympics competition will be held in 2001  
at the Winter Games in Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Allied Backs Whitbread Pub Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With names like the Stick &AMP; Weasel, the Blind  
Beggar and Shakespeare's Head, many of Britain's pubs evoke the 
quaint charms of one-of-a-kind watering holes with pedigrees dating 
back to the age of Falstaff. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of these pubs are now part of a very 20th-century  
creation, national chains owned by corporations like Whitbread PLC 
and Punch Taverns Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	And Whitbread stands to double the size of its retail empire  
with the planned acquisition of Allied Domecq PLC's 3,600 pubs. 
Allied's management board urged shareholders Tuesday to accept 
Whitbread's offer of 2.86 billion pounds, the equivalent of $4.56 
billion, and reject a higher, rival bid from Punch. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied, a British food and drinks conglomerate, said it would  
let shareholders vote on whether they prefer Punch's 2.93 billion 
pound, or $4.67 billion, offer. But the Allied board also planned 
to send them a letter backing Whitbread's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch's chairman Hugh Osmond has refused to concede defeat,  
calling Allied's decision in favor of Whitbread a ``classic example 
of old boy networks and cronyism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allied wants to sell its pubs to focus on its other businesses,  
which include some of the world's best-known liquor brands, among 
them Beefeater gin and Canadian Club whiskey. It also owns the 
Dunkin' Donut and Baskin-Robbins ice cream chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the aftertaste of a good British ale, the pub war looks set  
to linger a while. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied board's surprise decision follows weeks of  
acrimonious bids and counterbids between Punch and Whitbread. The 
board announced its choice after a meeting that began late Monday, 
after Punch raised its bid a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Allied said its board was swayed by the fewer  
risks and shorter timetable of a Whitbread takeover, and the fact 
that Punch's offer depended upon a complex financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied plans a special shareholders meeting to consider the  
proposed sale to Whitbread. The sale still must be approved by the 
Office of Fair Trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied's announcement took many investors by surprise. Allied  
was widely expected to approve the Punch bid, and Whitbread shares 
had fallen Monday on this expectation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Whitbread's shares rose 1.4 percent to the  
equivalent of $15.98 a share, while Allied stock fell 2.7 percent 
to the equivalent of $9.71 per share. Punch is closely-held and its 
shares aren't publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had asked me yesterday, I would have said it looks like  
it's going Punch's way,'' said Stuart Forshaw of the brokerage 
Charterhouse Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch launched the bidding war, making a rival cash offer for  
Allied's pubs last month after Allied already had agreed to sell 
them to Whitbread for 2.3 billion pounds, or $3.68 billion, worth 
of Whitbread shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewery group Bass PLC supported Punch's bid, agreeing to buy  
650 of the pubs from Punch if the bid succeeded. Among Punch's 
financial backers were American venture capital firms Texas Pacific 
Group and Soros Private Equity Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Whitbread sweetened its bid, offering 53 percent of  
its price in cash and 47 percent in shares. Punch countered on 
Monday with a higher offer that included an option of 25 percent of 
the purchase price in Bass shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied said Tuesday a deal with Punch, if approved, would be  
unlikely to be completed before mid-October, due to an exclusivity 
arrangement between Allied and Whitbread. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch chairman Osmond said his company would take its case  
directly to Allied shareholders. ``If necessary we'll bypass the 
Allied board,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Athens Olympic Organizer Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The chief organizer for the 2004 Olympics  
quit Tuesday after repeated accusations that Athens was not 
aggressively preparing for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Stratis Stratigis, a 65-year-old lawyer and professor, spent 18  
months on the job. His departure comes at a time of reported 
friction between the government and Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostas Vernikos, spokesman for Athens 2004, said Stratigis was  
leaving for personal reasons. A replacement is expected to be 
appointed in several days by Premier Costas Simitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stratigis could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, head of the International Olympic Committee's  
coordination committee, said in May he was pleased with the 
progress by Athens organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said he was surprised to  
hear Stratigis left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Stratigis was always very good and had constructive  
relations with the IOC,'' he said. ``We feel confident that the 
organization of the games will be fine, and that the Athens 
Organizing Committee will be able to find a successor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 percent of the Olympic projects are completed, and  
construction of the Olympic Village is to begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens has been spared the scandals that have shaken the Olympic  
movement and caused some sponsors to reconsider their support. But 
the organizing committee is still seeking national sponsors to 
close an expected $200 million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Stratigis' departure could open the way for the return of Gianna  
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who led Athens' successful bid for the 
Olympics following a rebuff for the 1996 Games. She did not return 
calls to her London office. 
</P>
<P>
	Stratigis has clashed with the Socialist government. He is a  
former parliament member for the opposition, and in the mid-1980s 
tried to establish a new conservative party. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, after a stormy first meeting of the national  
committee helping organize the games, Stratigis shrugged off 
criticism that Athens was slow in its preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all,'' he said, ``the turtle finished before the hare.''  
</P>
<P>
	Changes in top management have hit other Olympic cities.  
</P>
<P>
	The two top officials of the organizing committee for the 2002  
Winter Games in Salt Lake City resigned this year amid the 
vote-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing team for the 2000 Sydney Games has had four chief  
executives and three presidents.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Left wing Valeri Kamensky and defenseman  
Stephane Quintal signed with the New York Rangers on Tuesday as the 
team began to rebuild after failing to make the NHL playoffs last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky had 14 goals and 30 assists for the Colorado Avalanche  
last season, while Quintal had eight goals and 19 assists with the 
Montreal Canadiens. Both players were unrestricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky spent his eight-year NHL career in the Colorado  
organization. The team was in Quebec from 1991-1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky, a 33-year-old Russian, has 166 goals and 248 assists  
during his NHL career. In 64 playoff games, he has 25 goals and 35 
assists. Before coming to the NHL, Kamensky played nine seasons in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintal played in 82 games for the Canadiens last season, and  
his 27 points ranked second among Montreal defensemen. Quintal, 30,

<HEADLINE> DNA Database May Aid Investigations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- It took 21 months for police to name a  
suspect in the murder of Thomas Maier's son: Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez, the rail-riding fugitive suspected of going on to 
kill seven other people. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier wonders whether that time could have been cut had  
authorities been able to use a national index of DNA samples. 
</P>
<P>
	Though many states have used genetic evidence derived from DNA  
samples as a crime-fighting tool since early this decade, an FBI 
computer index of DNA went online only nine months ago. Kentucky 
still is not a participant. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Maier said, DNA samples collected from the scene of  
his son Christopher's slaying in August 1997 proved largely useless 
in the search for the killer. The fact that Resendez-Ramirez is 
believed to have murdered again only underscores the importance of 
a national database, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've stated from the day he (Christopher) died that we were  
afraid (his killer) would repeat this,'' Maier said. ``It's sad 
that we've had to find him through such a means of all these other 
tragic deaths that he's generated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Maier and his girlfriend, students at the University  
of Kentucky, were attacked late at night as they passed railroad 
tracks on their way to a party. The girlfriend was raped and left 
for dead. 
</P>
<P>
	During the investigation of his son's death, Maier was  
frustrated to learn that there was no national DNA index. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were even implications that there might be civil  
liberties union objections to having DNA compared across state 
lines,'' said Maier, who lives in North Canton, Ohio. ``I look at 
DNA just like a fingerprint. It's one of the rights you sacrifice 
when you commit a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it was another FBI database -- one that matched the  
killing to similar crimes in Texas -- that led to Resendez-Ramirez -- 
whose real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis -- being charged 
with Maier's murder and labeled a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, said FBI spokesman Paul Bresson, such breaks  
could come from the FBI's DNA index, which went online in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think potentially it could provide a lead that otherwise  
would be unavailable'' in cases like the Maier murder, Bresson 
said. ``Certainly within the next couple of years we hope to have 
all 50 states participating in the national DNA indexing system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen states currently participate by submitting DNA samples  
from known criminals and unsolved crimes. New participants must 
meet FBI standards for quality control and restricted access before 
being allowed to go online. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacy Warnecke, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky State Police  
Crime Laboratory, said Kentucky hopes to join by the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees that a DNA index is desirable.  
</P>
<P>
	``It opens the door to abuse,'' said Jeff Vessels, executive  
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. ``Too 
often databases are created for one purpose but later used for 
purposes that are discriminatory and abusive of other peoples' 
fundamental rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, collecting an individual's DNA violates  
the privacy of relatives who share similar genetic traits. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who use DNA as a law enforcement tool argue that it is  
uniquely effective. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, Milwaukee County prosecutor Norman Gahn said a DNA  
index has been used to link more than 20 unsolved cases to other 
unsolved cases or a known offender within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous law-enforcement tool,'' he said. ``I just  
know from my experience that it's been rapid, it's been 
effective.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Ga. Killings Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, Ga. (AP) -- A prisoner awaiting trial for the December  
1997 slayings of four members of a Georgia family escaped early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Scott Heidler was in a jail cell with nine other inmates  
when he somehow got free, Toombs County Sheriff Alvie Kight Jr. 
said. He disappeared sometime between 3:30 and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Kight said none of the other prisoners escaped, but provided no  
other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidler, in his early 20s, was due to stand trial in late August  
on charges he killed Danny and Kim Daniels and two of their 
children. The victims were shot to death at their isolated, 
one-story ranch home in Santa Claus, about 70 miles west of 
Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidler also allegedly kidnapped three other children -- ages 8,  
9, and 10 -- including a foster child, who were later abandoned 40 
miles away. Two other foster children were left unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the killings, Heidler had briefly lived with the family  
while trying to overcome drug and alcohol problems. Investigators 
have said the suspect has a foggy recollection of the crime, but a 
motive remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities searched for the suspect today with dogs and  
helicopters, and said he should be considered extremely dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now were focusing on Toombs County and all surrounding  
counties, but we're running out leads anywhere we can,'' Kight 
said.

<HEADLINE> New Contract for Spurs' Popovich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Gregg Popovich signed a four-year contract  
extension Tuesday, 11 days after coaching the San Antonio Spurs to 
their first NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich had one year remaining on a three-year deal. The new  
contract keeps him as both coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has really proven his ability to put together successful  
offensive and defensive schemes, as well as build a team that 
thinks and plays as a team,'' Spurs chairman Peter Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich was to be paid $1.2 million next season under his old  
contract, the San Antonio Express-News reported. Financial terms of 
the new contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am both thrilled and fortunate to have the opportunity to  
coach this great group of people, and look forward with great 
anticipation to next season,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	In only his second full year as coach, Popovich led the Spurs  
past the Knicks in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as general manager before the 1994-95 season. In  
December 1996 he fired Bob Hill and made himself the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	After an injury-plagued 1996-97 season that ended with the worst  
record (20-62) in franchise history, Popovich drafted Tim Duncan. 
The Spurs have enjoyed two consecutive winning seasons culminating 
in this year's championship.

<HEADLINE> Torture Killer Executed in Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) -- A man condemned for killing two of six  
women he kept in a makeshift torture chamber, where he fed body 
parts of one victim to others, was executed by injection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Heidnik, a disabled Army veteran who made a fortune in the  
stock market and ordained himself bishop of his own church, was 
convicted of starving one woman to death and electrocuting another. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidnik, 55, claimed he was insane. He has declined to pursue  
any appeals since he was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who survived Heidnik's basement in his Philadelphia row  
home testified that he electrocuted Deborah Johnson Dudley by 
touching live wires to her chains as she stood in a water-filled 
pit. 
</P>
<P>
	After his arrest, officers found body parts in his freezer that  
were those of Sandra Lindsay, a mentally retarded girl who had been 
starved. She was shackled in the basement and died while hanging by 
her arm from a rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidnik dismembered her body and fed her ground-up flesh mixed  
with dog food to the other captives, the witnesses said. He held 
the women in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidnik was found out when Josefina Rivera, a prostitute,  
escaped. Heidnik picked her up in 1986 and after they had sex, 
choked her until she passed out. When she came to, she was in 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next four months, Rivera watched in horror as the other  
five women arrived and were tortured. Three were prostitutes and 
all were black. Heidnik is white.

<HEADLINE> Rudy Tomjanovich To Miss Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- An exhausted Rudy Tomjanovich is still on course  
to coach the U.S. basketball team in the 2000 Olympics despite 
having to miss this month's qualifying tournament, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Rockets coach spent Friday and Saturday night in the  
hospital recovering from ``extreme physical exhaustion,'' said team 
physician Jim Muntz, who suggested the coach take a month off from 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown will replace Tomjanovich  
for the tournament in Puerto Rico on July 14-25, according to USA 
Basketball, the sport's national governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not been given any indication by USA Basketball that  
this will affect his status for 2000,'' Rockets spokesman Tim Frank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday night at the Rockets' training  
center in Houston, Tomjanovich looked healthy but dejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed and I'm going to do my best to recharge  
myself and get ready for the coming season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which begins training Tuesday, includes San  
Antonio's Tim Duncan and New York's Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which has won gold medals at the last two  
Olympics, must finish among the top two teams in the 10-team 
tournament to earn a berth in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really great honor and something I was looking forward  
to, but I've overworked myself and I find myself really physically 
and mentally exhausted,'' Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich led a team of CBA and college players to a bronze  
medal at last summer's world championships in Greece. That team 
exceeded expectations considering it didn't have NBA players 
because of the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, Purdue's Gene Keady and Kentucky's Tubby Smith were  
appointed assistants. Brown has worked on three USA Basketball 
coaching staffs.

<HEADLINE> Panel to Oppose DNA Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- A federal panel has decided to oppose  
mandatory DNA testing for anyone charged with a crime, a 
recommendation that could be adopted by the Justice Department and 
used as guidance by states, USA Today reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence is  
expected this month to recommend that Attorney General Janet Reno 
reject mass DNA testing because such a process could overwhelm the 
justice system, the paper said in it Tuesday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's decision will set federal policy and give non-binding  
guidance to state authorities. Reno had sought the legal and 
practical implications from the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's proposed recommendation, according to USA  
Today, says mass testing should be postponed until the DNA samples 
already collected from more than 1.4 million convicted criminals 
can be added to a national database. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's executive director, Christopher H. Asplen, was  
quoted in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post as saying 
those samples should be analyzed and catalogued before a decision 
is made on testing arrestees. 
</P>
<P>
	``States (are) saying, `We're gong to grind to a screeching halt  
if this happens,'' Asplen told the Post, which made the story 
available on its Web site. ``Once we get a system that's up to 
speed, we can start doing these other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a genetic configuration unique  
to each person. Investigators can take DNA samples from crime 
scenes found in blood, sweat, sperm or saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates had argued that such mass testing would  
violate the rights of innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some law enforcement officials claim such testing would find the  
perpetrators of countless unsolved crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA has already been used as evidence to convict -- and exonerate  
-- crime suspects. Some European countries have tested the entire 
populations near the scenes of violent crimes, with varying degrees 
of success.

<HEADLINE> Hot Dog Eating Champ Called Cheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A second-place finisher in an annual hot dog  
eating contest says he was robbed of first place and the coveted 
Mustard Yellow International Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	A news station's videotape showed the belt's eventual winner  
cramming a frankfurter into his mouth just before the gun went off 
to start the 12-minute foodfest at Coney Island on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Keiner, a 317-pound electrical inspector from Egg Harbor  
Township, N.J., won the Nathan's Famous eating spectacle by 
swallowing 20 and one-quarter hot dogs and buns. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Hardy finished a bite or two behind, at 20 franks. He  
demanded a Labor Day rematch after seeing a New York 1 tape of the 
event, which clearly shows Keiner with his lips wrapped around a 
dog before the start of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Contest organizers say that International Federation of Hot Dog  
Eating rules don't permit National Football League-style tape 
reviews and that Hardy should let sleeping dogs lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it appears that Keiner jumped the gun,'' Nathan's  
spokesman George Shea said Monday, ``the decision of the judges is 
final.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles May Pick Up Ripken Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles will pick up a $6.3  
million option to keep third baseman Cal Ripken next year, sources 
told The (Baltimore) Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, which was expected, will be announced during a  
three-game homestand this week against the Toronto Blue Jays, 
according to the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken is headed to his 17th All-Star game. He rejuvenated his  
production after his first career stint on the disabled list this 
year, as he closes in on 400 career homers and 3,000 career hits. 
He is batting .310 with 11 home runs and 34 RBIs, and has 395 
homers and 2,943 hits for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	His durability allowed him to play in a record-setting 2,632  
consecutive games, a streak he ended last year. But Ripken, who 
turns 39 next month, said during spring training he would allow his 
performance to dictate whether he would return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, it's going to happen. It's a given,'' a  
source told The Sun.

<HEADLINE> Former Gov. Mulling Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Former Connecticut Gov. Lowell P.  
Weicker Jr. is again considering a third-party run for the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura encouraged Weicker to offer himself  
as a Reform Party nominee. Weicker, who also considered running in 
1996, said he is interested in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us who are independents have a common bond, in that we  
feel that the Republicans and the Democrats have had a monopoly for 
too long and it's beginning to wear rather thin,'' Weicker told The 
Associated Press today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to have competition in anything, and you had no  
political competition for decades,'' Weicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker, 68, said he expects to make a decision within the next  
few months, after considering the effect on his family. He has four 
children ranging in age from 16 to 21, three older children from a 
previous marriage, and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wodele, a spokesman for Ventura, said the governor  
encouraged Weicker to run during a three-hour meeting in Manhattan 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker left the Connecticut governor's office five years ago  
after a long career in politics. He ran for president once before, 
in 1980, as a Republican. But he dropped out of the race before the 
primaries when it became clear Ronald Reagan would win the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker said he is considering a run in 2000 to encourage a  
national dialogue on issues such as poverty, children, violence and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are all items that should be the real agenda of this  
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Perot founded the Reform Party and ran as its presidential  
candidate in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker spent three terms in the U.S. Senate. He lost in 1988,  
when fellow Republicans grew so annoyed with his maverick streak 
that they elected conservative Democrat Joseph I. Lieberman. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he left the GOP and formed A Connecticut Party, then  
won in a three-way race for governor. Weicker opted not to seek a 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Weicker said Ventura is a good example of the kind of centrist,  
independent candidate a third party can offer. Ventura, a former 
professional wrestler, stunned the political establishment in 
Minnesota when he won the governor's office last November as a 
Reform Party candidate.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals TE Gedney To Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals tight end Chris Gedney  
will sit out the 1999 season recovering from intestinal surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old former Syracuse star had been plagued for years  
by ulcerative colitis, an inflammation of the colon. The disorder 
was in remission until it flared up recently, forcing Gedney to 
check into a hospital last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found a perforation, and performed an operation to close  
it Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gedney, a third-round draft choice of Chicago in 1993, was  
slowed by a variety of injuries with the Bears, and had just 28 
catches for 307 yards in his career until he signed with Arizona in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He developed into one of the NFL's top pass-catching tight ends  
in two years with the Cardinals, with 45 receptions for 532 yards 
and five touchdowns. His four TD grabs in 1997 were the most by a 
Cardinals tight end in a season since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Probe Begins in La. Plant Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMERCY, La. (AP) -- It will be months before Kaiser Aluminum  
and Chemical Co. can reopen an alumina plant where a series of 
explosions injured 24 workers -- if the company decides to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to very thoroughly but very rapidly review our  
alternatives,'' company president Ray Milchovich said during a 
conference call Tuesday. Officials said it was too early to set a 
dollar figure on damage at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the workers injured in the blast early Monday remained  
hospitalized Tuesday, two of them in critical but stable condition, 
Kaiser spokesman Scott Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions damaged nine or 10 of the flash tanks where  
caustic aluminum solution is cooled down from the 300-degree 
temperatures needed to ``digest'' it from a slurry of red clay. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause is under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	State police, company investigators and authorities from the  
U.S. Mine and Safety and Health Administration spent Tuesday 
walking through the tangled wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while,'' said Sgt. William Davis, a state  
police spokesman. ``You have to piece this thing back together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 area residents, complaining of nausea and breathing  
problems, were treated at area hospitals after the explosions, 
which spewed red chemical on houses and cars a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	Milchovich said a few area residents called to complain about  
minor damage to their homes or minor skin irritation from red dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, several lawyers filed damage suits Tuesday in state  
district court. One predicted that 15,000 to 20,000 people will 
join if a judge makes it a class action. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, headquartered in Oakland, Calif., is the nation's  
fifth-largest aluminum company, with 1998 sales of $2.3 billion.

	``Is it a good thing that these two French companies join up? I  
think the answer is certainly yes,'' Strauss-Kahn said on RTL 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good thing if a French group is nearly on the  
same level with the world's three biggest oil groups and, 
therefore, protected from a takeover by an Anglo-Saxon or American 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said late Monday that since the merger would not  
threaten national oil supplies, it does not plan to block the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not up to public powers to judge a deal between two  
private companies,'' Strauss-Kahn said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf was the French state's largest concern when it was  
privatized in 1994. The French government no longer has an equity 
stake, but retains a so-called golden share, allowing it to 
approve, or veto, any takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina launched its hostile bid Monday, saying it is  
offering Elf shareholders four Total Fina shares for three Elf 
shares. The all-stock offer, worth 42 billion euros ($42.94 
billion), is conditional upon 66.7 percent acceptance of the offer 
by Elf shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be Europe's third largest oil group after  
Royal Dutch Shell and BP Amoco, and would likely be better able to 
compete with its U.S. and European rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid was a further sign of the new aggressive mood in French  
business but wasn't welcomed by Elf, whose board said the offer had 
``not been the subject of any study or discussions.''

<HEADLINE> Avondale, Litton Merger Vote OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Avondale Industries has won early approval to  
put its proposed merger with Litton Industries to a vote of 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale announced Tuesday that the Federal Trade Commission  
gave permission last Friday for the vote to proceed and a special 
shareholders meeting is set for July 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, based in metro New Orleans, designs, builds and  
overhauls ships for the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard and 
commercial customers. Litton, which owns Ingalls Shipbuilding in 
Pascagoula, Miss., makes destroyers and other surface ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls and Avondale have competed for some defense contracts,  
as well as for building cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton has offered $529 million for Avondale, about $39.50 per  
share, outbidding Newport News Shipbuilding which offered $470 
million in stock. Tom Kitchen, Avondale's chief financial officer, 
has said the merger will cause no layoffs and may result in more 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all the yards, the combined Litton-Avondale company  
would employ 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, a non-union yard, has been engaged in a six-year fight  
to avoid having to recognize the Metal Trades Council of the 
AFL-CIO. The company, which is challenging a union representation 
vote held in 1993, has taken the case to a federal appeals court, 
where a decision is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Avondale is sending out proxies to all its  
shareholders to vote on the merger,'' union organizer Phil Miller 
said. ``I think this will help it become a more stable company. 
It'll make it safer for the workers. It'll be good for both 
management and employees.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Sanctions on Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton imposed financial and  
commercial sanctions against Afghanistan's Islamic fundamentalist 
rulers for harboring Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile wanted for 
last year's U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed an executive order Monday imposing the sanctions  
against the Taliban faction, which controls most of the Southwest 
Asian nation. Bin Laden was placed on the FBI's ``Ten Most Wanted 
List'' last month with a $5 million reward offered for information 
leading to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this day, bin Laden and his network continue to plan new  
attacks against Americans without regard for the innocence of their 
intended victims or for those non-Americans who might get in the 
way of his attack,'' Clinton said in a statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The order bans U.S. trade with and investment in the 85 percent  
of Afghan territory under Taliban control. Official figures show 
the United States exported $7 million in goods to these areas last 
year and brought in imports worth $17 million. About 15 percent of 
Afghanistan is controlled by a rival group. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions do not affect U.S. humanitarian assistance to the  
Afghan people. The United States provides almost $40 million in 
such assistance, part of it to Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. 
Other programs involve health, education, earthquake relief and 
elimination of mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his executive order ``will deepen the international  
isolation of the Taliban, limit its ability to support terrorist 
networks and demonstrate the need to conform to the accepted norms 
of international behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Cairo, Egypt, businessmen from Saudi Arabia and other sources  
told The Associated Press that bin Laden received a torrent of 
donations from rich Saudi and Persian Gulf people after the United 
States put the $5 million price on his head. The sources said bin 
Laden may have netted more than $50 million before the Saudi 
government learned of the transfers and ordered them stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions were imposed under International Emergency  
Economic Powers Act, the National Emergencies Act and other 
authorities, which provide wide latitude to the president to impose 
economic sanctions. At least seven other countries, all on the U.S. 
list of countries that sponsor international terrorism, are subject 
to similar penalties. Afghanistan is not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, who asked not to be identified, said  
millionaire bin Laden provides financing and fighters to the 
Taliban in exchange for sanctuary. Taliban leaders insist they do 
not know where he is. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States demands that the Taliban expel bin Laden to  
the United States for trial or to a third country to face justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration accuses bin Laden of masterminding  
the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 
which killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans, and 
injured thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	While Washington believes bin Laden is still hiding in  
Afghanistan, others suggest he may have gone elsewhere. Among 
possibilities mentioned are Somalia, Chechnya, even Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the Observer newspaper reported Sunday that bin Laden  
moved two months ago within Afghanistan, changing his headquarters 
to an old collective farm in the village of Farmihadda in eastern 
Afghanistan near the Pakistan border.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Talks Up Jobs, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) -- Saying the whole country benefits  
when more people work, President Clinton on Tuesday urged Congress 
to embrace his plan for tax credits to businesses that set up shop 
in downtrodden communities. ``It is not a handout, but it is darned 
sure a hand up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushing to beat a threatened thunderstorm, Clinton greeted a  
crowd of about 1,000 in the parking lot of a Walgreen's drug store, 
which the White House said was the first new retail store to open 
in East St. Louis in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Congress should approve his so-called ``new  
markets'' initiative because it makes it more appealing for 
businesses to operate ``in any high unemployment, high poverty area 
anywhere in America,'' without heavy reliance on the government to 
turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need help from Republicans and Democrats alike. This is not  
a party issue,'' Clinton said. ``Nobody is going to put any money 
here if they think they're going to lose it. But it makes it more 
likely that people will do it. ... It is not a handout, but it is 
darned sure a hand up, and you are entitled to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined by Cathy Bessant, president of Bank of  
America's community development division, who announced a $500 
million capital investment fund targeted at often-overlooked 
communities. That amount included $100 million for the Community 
Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provided the grants 
Clinton announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is real money to be made in these markets,'' Bessant  
said. ``We think we can be even more successful when we create 
markets that work in inner cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Debra Powell said Clinton's plan would encourage more  
businesses to follow the Walgreen's example of investing in her 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton came here at the close of a day devoted to talking up  
jobs and investment in Clarksdale, Miss., that he said can breathe 
new life into the virtually forgotten town on the Mississippi 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	But the promise of jobs and a blossoming economy meant little to  
Flora Bell Clay, 61, disabled after a heart attack and needing help 
to keep her home inhabitable. Her income is too low to get loans, 
and local organizations didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't pay nothing when I ain't got nothing,'' Mrs. Clay  
said, waiting under a blazing sun to talk to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he hoped private money he is trying to  
leverage for places like Clarksdale can ultimately solve problems 
like Mrs. Clay's, from dilapidated housing to inferior schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just that there's not enough money in this area for  
good investment. Somebody has to decide it's a good investment,'' 
Clinton told about 600 people gathered in Waterfield Cabinets' hot, 
tin-roofed warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced $46.5 million in community development  
grants, including $15 million for the Mississippi Delta, where, he 
said, the poverty and unemployment rates far exceed national 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements were part of Clinton's four-day cross country  
tour to highlight the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner 
cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving Tuesday night in Rapid City, S.D., Clinton decided to  
make a nocturnal visit to Mount Rushmore. Clinton had never seen 
the monument and accepted an offer of a guided excursion from 
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. He and Daschle then 
motored over to Thunderhead Mountain to view the completed face of 
Crazy Horse carved in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour also called attention to successful projects like  
Waterfield Cabinets, which opened with a secured loan from the 
Enterprise Corporation of the Delta, which provides capital and 
credit to small businesses that wouldn't qualify for conventional 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, accompanied by Rep. Benny Thompson, D-Miss., and  
Mayor Richard Webster, walked past the abandoned New Roxy Theater 
and the Pac Man game room to the corner of Issaquena Avenue and Dr. 
Martin Luther King Drive. A crowd cheered and chanted, ``Welcome, 
Bill,'' and, ``Don't mess with Bill.'' A large nightclub across the 
street, Club Champagne, sat shuttered and closed. 
</P>
<P>
	For an empowerment zone area, there was little economic  
activity. Some residents said $40 million in empowerment funds is 
not finding its way here, and they wanted Clinton to know that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a sit-down meeting, not in this hot sun, so we can  
tell him the real issues that face the people in the Mississippi 
Delta,'' said Henry Bonner, 41, of nearby Mound Bayou. ``The 
playing field needs to be leveled. And the lending institutions are 
so racist it's a crying shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, accompanying the president  
along with some corporate leaders and Cabinet secretaries, said: 
``When you look at the market, it's not just race. These areas have 
been denied access to capital. Now it's the resources gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Calhoun, 47, from Montgomery Ala., whose Calhoun  
Enterprises owns the 14-store Calhoun Foods-Bigbear Supermarket 
chain in Alabama and Georgia, said his company had $81 million in 
revenue last year but only a $300,000 line of credit. To continue 
growing, opening stores in places like Clarksdale, he needs a $2 
million line of credit, said Calhoun, who was part of Clinton's 
entourage in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm back at a time where I need it just as bad as I did when I  
first started,'' Calhoun said, when he had to pay 22 percent 
interest to borrow money. ``I keep having to prove myself and I've 
been out here 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksdale, Clinton ducked into a flower shop and talked with  
owner Shirley Fair and three other small-business owners. Then he 
greeted the crowd outside, eventually reaching Mrs. Clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she did grasp his hand and told him her dilemma, she  
didn't get her house fixed. ``I told him I need help bad. He never 
did say I could get help.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Prime Minister To Visit U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin is due  
here at the end of the month for talks with Vice President Al Gore 
and a close look at American corporations as Russia sinks deeper 
into its economic doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit July 27 will be Stepashin's first as prime minister  
and the first meeting in a year of the U.S.-Russian Joint 
Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten committees will meet on business development, energy,  
health, environment, science and technology and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin also is interested in meeting with President Clinton,  
and that likely will be arranged, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, who has talked several times to Gore on the  
telephone, is due to bring government economic specialists with him 
for talks with leaders of American corporations, a statement issued 
today by Gore's office said. The prime minister is expected to stop 
in Seattle to meet with officials of Microsoft Corp. and Boeing Co. 
July 25 and then travel to Detroit July 26 to see officials of Ford 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants reported last weekend  
that foreign investment in Russia had slumped 40 percent in the 
first quarter of the year, compared with 1998. He promised reforms 
to attract investors unnerved by Russia's financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Total foreign investment in Russia was $1.5 billion in  
January-March, down from $2.5 billion in the same period last year. 
Direct investment totaled $600 million, down 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was on his way here in  
March for a commission meeting when he turned around his jet and 
went home rather than be in Washington for the announcement that 
NATO warplanes were bombing Yugoslavia to force a settlement in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, in a statement, said the commission was useful in helping  
the two sides to ``expand our areas of agreement and open channels 
we can draw on during periods of disagreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia disagreed with the NATO assault, but helped arrange a  
settlement that removes all Serb troops and special police from the 
province. Russian troops are serving a peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	A mini-crisis erupted when hundreds of the troops were rushed to  
Pristina, the Kosovo provincial capital, and stayed there, without 
notice to Washington and after Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov assured 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright they would be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	At a summit meeting in Germany, however, President Clinton  
concluded agreements with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 
several fronts, including approval of the administration's program 
to build an anti-missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Clinton administration is withholding support for  
Russia in international lending institutions until it reforms its 
economic system.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed; Euro Down Vs. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro touched another record low against the  
dollar Tuesday amid more signs of weakness in the European economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The pan-European currency recovered somewhat against the dollar  
as the day progressed, but remained below its levels reached on 
Friday. U.S. markets were closed Monday in observance of the 
Independence Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro hit a low of $1.0184 in European trading after Germany  
released a weak employment report, the latest sign of sluggishness 
in the European economy. By late afternoon in New York the currency 
had recovered to $1.0226, but that was still below its level of 
$1.0240 in New York late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new European currency has been slipping steadily against the  
dollar ever since making its debut at the beginning of the year. 
The conflict in Kosovo, bickering over European interest rates and 
the relative strength of the U.S. economy have combined to make the 
euro less attractive to investors than the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved less in trading against the Japanese yen  
Tuesday. The dollar was changing hands at 122.02 yen in late New 
York dealings, slightly off from its late Tokyo level of 122.08 
Tuesday. On Friday, the dollar was quoted at 121.01 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar made its big move against the yen on Monday in Tokyo,  
when the Bank of Japan intervened in currency markets to weaken the 
yen, which had risen following a report showing an improvement in 
Japanese business sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial authorities don't want the yen to rise too  
much against the dollar for fear that it could harm the earnings of 
exporters, whose profits are trimmed by a high yen, and endanger 
the prospects for an economic recovery in Japan. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Japanese Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday  
after Japan's central bank failed to intervene to prop up the 
greenback. Japanese stocks fell marginally. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.04 yen at mid afternoon, down 0.54 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 84.33 points,  
or 0.47 percent, to close the day's trading at 18,050.73. On 
Monday, the average rose 202.59 points, or 1.13 percent, finishing 
at 18,135.06 -- its highest closing level since September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign exchange trading, the Bank of Japan disappointed  
traders who expected a replay of its efforts Monday to stop gains 
in the yen against the dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the bank failed to intervene, market players sold dollars,  
which pushed up the yen, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a top official from the finance ministry warned that the  
government might again take steps to stop the yen's gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``An excessive yen strengthening before economic recovery is  
undesirable,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's 
international bureau. A higher yen makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad, and reduces dollar-denominated earnings at 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take decisive action in the foreign exchange markets  
at any time,'' Kuroda added. He is scheduled to become vice finance 
minister for international affairs later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, financial markets in New York were closed Monday for a  
national holiday, leaving a dearth of news to affect trading, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.52 yen, down  
from 125.57 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices dropped slightly on profit-taking,  
especially in blue-chip issues. The Nikkei average had gained 3.5 
percent in the three sessions prior to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the recent pace of gains was fast, a brief pause was  
natural,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the average surged after the Bank of Japan's  
quarterly ``tankan'' survey showed that business sentiment had 
improved in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 7.86 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,478.72. The 
TOPIX rose 26.42 points, or 1.81 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government bond rose to  
1.6500 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6100 percent, driving its 
price down to 101.30 yen from 101.66 yen.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Clark Misses Another Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Will Clark missed a fifth straight start with a  
swollen left knee Tuesday, and there's no telling when he'll be 
back in the Baltimore Orioles' lineup at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark last started July 1 in Toronto. He made a pinch-hitting  
appearance the following day against the New York Yankees, then 
returned to Baltimore on Saturday to have his knee examined. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on his condition Tuesday before limping  
onto the field for warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the infamous day-to-day,'' manager Ray Miller said. ``He  
got it injected, but he's still a little sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark is hitting .295 with six homers. Jeff Conine started at  
first base Tuesday night against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Orioles donned their 1970s caps Tuesday night -- the  
ones with the cartoon bird centered on a white front panel -- in a 
salute to the past. Between innings of Tuesday night's game, 70s 
music was played over the public address system. Baltimore is 
expected to wear the hats through the homestand that ends Thursday. 
... The Orioles signed draft pick Josh Cenate, a left-handed 
pitcher who went 13-1 with a 0.71 ERA in 15 appearances this spring 
at Jefferson High in West Virginia. Cenate, the Orioles' fifth pick 
and the 34th taken overall, had 179 strikeouts and only 21 walks in 
89 innings this season. He was 34-4 in four seasons. He is 
scheduled to report to the Bluefield Orioles of the Appalachian 
League on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> GNC: Takeover Will Mean New Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- General Nutrition Companies Inc. has long been  
known for its ability to attract customers through its strong 
distribution -- but not necessarily for its ability to develop new 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pittsburgh company's acquisition by Dutch food maker  
Royal Numico N.V. will lead to more research and new products, 
including dietary supplements, pain relievers, and remedies for 
memory loss, intestinal disorders and heart trouble, said company 
president and chief executive Bill Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	Numico said Monday is acquiring GNC for $1.75 billion in cash  
and will also assume roughly $760 million in debt. By doing so, 
Numico and GMC will create what they call the largest company in 
the world devoted exclusively to nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will retain their separate identities while  
combining their respective skills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	GNC will market Numico products currently in development, Numico  
research director Albert Eenink said. In turn, the Dutch company 
sees GNC as a means of expanding its market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Matt Patsky of the Boston investment firm Adams,  
Harkness &AMP; Hill Inc., who praised the linkup, said the companies 
should focus on products for people with chronic conditions that 
can be treated with good nutrition, such as arthritis and heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts declined to provide details about specific products yet  
because officials don't want their ideas stolen, said Bill Watts, 
GNC's president and chief executive. That's a common problem in an 
industry with little original development, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	He did say that among Numico's products in development is one  
that would help people who have suffered heart attacks, Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was impressed, however. Sidney Wolfe of the  
Washington, D.C.-based Public Citizen Health Research Group, said 
too many nutritional supplements aren't proven to work and 
consumers should be wary of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies such as this are just asking for trouble if they're  
going to get more into this kind of business,'' he said. ``People 
naively buy these things without adequate evidence that they work 
or that they're safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numico, a major supplier of baby food in Europe, earned a profit  
of $180 million on sales of $1.6 billion last year. The company 
employed 10,500 people in more than 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	GNC had a 1998 profit of $90 million on sales of $1.4 billion.  
The company employed 13,800 people in more than 4,000 stores in all 
50 states and 25 foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of GNC closed Tuesday at $24.56 1/4, up $1.68 3/4, in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Economy Shrink Expected in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The new finance minister said Tuesday  
that Venezuela's battered economy will likely shrink by 3 to 4 
percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a downward revision from previous government projections  
of between no growth and a 2 percent contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Rojas told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview that a sharp  
drop last year in prices for oil, Venezuela's main export, will 
continue to play havoc with the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	His prediction was still more optimistic than estimates given by  
private sector economists, many of whom say the economy will likely 
shrink by 4 to 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's economy shrank 9.8 percent between January and  
March, its worst performance in a decade, and the government has an 
estimated $8 billion fiscal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have accused President Hugo Chavez's economic team of  
lacking a coherent plan to reverse the economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas, 39, took office last Friday, replacing Maritza Izaguirre,  
who returned to her post at the Inter-American Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Rash of Fires Hits Lakeside Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUTTONS BAY, Mich. (AP) -- As the summer tourist season gets into  
full swing in this lakeside resort, residents are so alarmed by a 
rash of suspicious fires that they are pointing fingers, forming 
night patrols and talking about recalling the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestled along a Lake Michigan cove, the village is known for its  
scenic views, fancy boutiques and the British-style red phone 
booths on the sidewalks of the three-block-long main street. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 550 residents, the talk of the town is how nine  
structures -- businesses, homes and outbuildings such as garages or 
barns -- have gone up in smoke over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, nearly a dozen smaller fires of unknown origin have been  
reported in or near the village, 270 miles northwest of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived here 23 years and I've never seen anything like  
this, the whole community in such a scare,'' said Candy Crick, 
member of a support group for the volunteer fire department. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made, and police acknowledge they have made  
little headway. Sheriff Mike Oltersdorf said Sunday it is not even 
certain how some of the fires got started, though some clearly were 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak began last summer, halted in September and started  
again this spring, prompting speculation that a seasonal resident 
is to blame. But no common method or motive has emerged, leaving 
police uncertain whether the fires are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire gutted Leslie Hansen's family grocery June 26, causing  
about $1 million in damage. The sheriff's department said the cause 
is under investigation. But Mrs. Hansen said a detective hired by 
her insurer concluded the fire was set with gasoline or lighter 
fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a fire destroyed a woodworking and machine shop.  
Estimated loss: $175,000. A week later, a building belonging to a 
metalworking artist was torched. 
</P>
<P>
	At a packed town meeting last week, some accused police of not  
taking the matter seriously enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Badalamente, owner of a bakery, pizza shop and coffee  
house, has organized a citizens group to patrol at night. The group 
has planned a training session with a state police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel our elected leaders have failed to recognize this is a  
crisis situation,'' Badalamente said. ``There's a whole lot of 
disgruntled people out there. You've got business owners who can't 
sleep at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and others are threatening to seek the recall of Oltersdorf  
unless he meets their demands, including all-night foot patrols and 
the opening of a satellite office in Suttons Bay. The sheriff's 
office is in Leland, nine miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	But some say it is unfair to blame Oltersdorf and his deputies.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're doing everything they can,'' said Karl Zimmer,  
owner of the Village Grocer. ``It just takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oltersdorf said he understands the frustration and welcomes  
citizen involvement. His department has assembled a task force that 
includes state police and officers from the nearby Grand Traverse 
Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians reservation, where several of 
the fires have happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, this probably won't be solved by good police  
work,'' he said. ``It will be a report from someone in the public 
who observes something or hears something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, many in the close-knit community are pleading for an  
end to rumors and mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already heard some people say, `I saw so-and-so at the  
fire, what were they doing there?''' said Mrs. Hansen, owner of the 
ruined grocery store. ``You don't want to start getting suspicious 
of your neighbors. That's not right.''

<HEADLINE>  Tom Steels Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAVAL, France (AP) -- A day after a dramatic crash during an  
ocean crossing, the third stage of the Tour de France unfolded on 
dry ground and in classic style Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling into the countryside of Brittany, with black-and-white  
Breton flags fluttering along the route, the stage began with an 
early breakaway and ended in a furious, shoulder-to-shoulder 
sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Belgium's Tom Steels won the stage,  
timing his attack perfectly and surging through his rivals across 
the finish line, arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia kept the leader's yellow jersey. Steels  
moved into second place overall, followed by Abraham Olano of Spain 
and Lance Armstrong of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's teammate on a strong U.S. Postal Service team,  
George Hincapie, is sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a remarkable comeback from testicular cancer,  
is waiting for Sunday's time trial and then the mountain stages to 
mount his challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week, in the early, flat stages, it is the sprinters  
who excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's 122-mile route stretched through picturesque northern  
countryside from the city of Nantes, which straddles the Loire 
River, to the town of Laval. 
</P>
<P>
	Two riders, Frederic Guesdon and Massimo Giunti, broke away  
early and maintained their lead for 76 miles. But they were caught 
by the pack late in the race, making way for the sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	The pack maintained a swift pace, averaging 27 mph for the day.  
The final sprint came at a blistering 42 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels had a winning time of 4 hours, 29 minutes, 27 seconds. He  
was followed by Erik Zabel of Germany, Stuart O'Grady of Australia, 
Nicola Minali of Italy and Hincapie. Armstrong finished 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Young fans along the route on Tuesday were well aware of the  
drug scandal that has enveloped the sport. But most preferred to 
enjoy the race, and some were skeptical about efforts to stamp out 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish exchange student Jose Luiz Catala was enjoying a folk  
concert in Nantes before the riders came through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all the players are doped,'' said Catala, 17. ``You  
know why? Because you can't win on a plate of spaghetti. You need 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Joan Albert Lairon, sporting red-and-yellow paint on  
his cheeks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doping is fair if they all do it,'' he said. ``The problem  
comes when only some do. That's why it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a bit dangerous -- no more than smoking cigarettes,''  
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body said 16 cyclists -- none elite riders --  
have been certified to race with a hematocrit level that exceeds 
the 50 percent limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells  
in a blood sample -- one sign of drug use, since the substances 
increase red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union noted that 3 percent of the  
global population has a hematocrit level higher than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many, if any, of the riders issued those  
certificates are racing in this year's Tour. U.S. racer Jonathan 
Vaughters has one, but he was injured in Monday's crash on the 
Passage du Gois and forced to abandon the race. 
</P>
<P>
	On the passage, a strip of land that connects a small island to  
the mainland and is submerged at high tide, top riders Alex Zulle, 
Michael Boogerd and Ivan Gotti were dealt a serious blow. 
</P>
<P>
	They got caught behind the 10-rider crash and never reached a  
group of 50 or so riders that broke away after the crash.

	Two riders, Frederic Guesdon and Massimo Giunti, broke away  
early and maintained their lead for 76 miles. But they were caught 
by the pack late in the race, making way for the sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	The pack maintained a swift pace, averaging 27 mph for the day.  
The final sprint came at a blistering 42 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels had a winning time of 4 hours, 29 minutes, 27 seconds. He  
was followed by Erik Zabel of Germany, Stuart O'Grady of Australia, 
Nicola Minali of Italy and Hincapie. Armstrong finished 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Young fans along the route on Tuesday were well aware of the  
drug scandal that has enveloped the sport. But most preferred to 
enjoy the race, and some were skeptical about efforts to stamp out 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish exchange student Jose Luiz Catala was enjoying a folk  
concert in Nantes before the riders came through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all the players are doped,'' said Catala, 17. ``You  
know why? Because you can't win on a plate of spaghetti. You need 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Joan Albert Lairon, sporting red-and-yellow paint on  
his cheeks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doping is fair if they all do it,'' he said. ``The problem  
comes when only some do. That's why it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a bit dangerous -- no more than smoking cigarettes,''  
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body said 16 cyclists -- none elite riders --  
have been certified to race with a hematocrit level that exceeds 
the 50 percent limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells  
in a blood sample -- one sign of drug use, since the substances 
increase red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union noted that 3 percent of the  
global population has a hematocrit level higher than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many, if any, of the riders issued those  
certificates are racing in this year's Tour. U.S. racer Jonathan 
Vaughters has one, but he was injured in Monday's crash on the 
Passage du Gois and forced to abandon the race. 
</P>
<P>
	On the passage, a strip of land that connects a small island to  
the mainland and is submerged at high tide, top riders Alex Zulle, 
Michael Boogerd and Ivan Gotti were dealt a serious blow. 
</P>
<P>
	They got caught behind the 10-rider crash and never reached a  
group of 50 or so riders that broke away after the crash.

<HEADLINE> AOL, Koop in $89 Million Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- In a move to expand its reach, the  
Internet health care site led by former Surgeon General Dr. C. 
Everett Koop agreed Tuesday to pay $89 million to form an alliance 
with America Online Inc., the dominant provider of Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year agreement gives AOL a link to a widely respected  
name in medicine and an opportunity to buy stock in one of the most 
popular Web health sites, drkoop.com. The deal gives drkoop.com a 
chance to build up advertising and electronic sales through AOL's 
millions of users. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal between drkoop.com and AOL is not exclusive; drkoop.com  
also is found on the GO Network, owned by The Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, investors cheered the announcement, bidding up the stock  
of drkoop.com by 56 percent and sending AOL shares rising almost 5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the reach of AOL and its CompuServe and Netscape  
Netcenter brands, however, some analysts wondered whether the 
health care service would be able to produce enough business to 
meet the four-year schedule for paying AOL $89 million. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will sell ads for drkoop.com, which, like many Internet  
ventures popular on Wall Street, has yet to turn a profit. The 
company lost $4.1 million on revenue of $404,000 in the three 
months ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, health care is a $1 trillion industry and more  
consumers will look to the Internet for help and savings, said 
Donald Hackett, president and CEO of drkoop.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this partnering enables us to reach critical  
mass,'' Hackett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to Koop's site can get information on a range of  
products and services such as insurance, interactive support 
groups, vitamins and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more people are turning to the Internet for health  
information,'' AOL spokesman Tom Ziemba said, adding that Koop is 
the most ``widely recognized and trusted'' voice for this 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary competition will come from Healtheon, which recently  
bought WebMD. Microsoft Corp. has pledged to invest $250 million in 
the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Internet health care ventures have unlimited potential  
because the market applies to everyone, it remains to be seen 
whether the public will flock to drkoop.com and other such sites, 
said Emily Meehan, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of hype,'' she said. ``But right now,  
two-thirds of American homes are not using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether drkoop.com will be able to generate the  
revenue needed make its payments to AOL, Ms. Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales over the Internet have expanded rapidly, but the  
sale of health products by computer is still relatively untested 
and is considered an emerging market, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity is certainly there,'' Ms. Meehan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Koop, 82, who has a 7 percent stake in the company, spent seven  
years as surgeon general in the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of drkoop.com, which began trading early last month, rose  
$13.25 to close at $36.87 1/2 Tuesday in heavy trading on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. AOL was up $5.68 3/4 to close at $120.93 3/4 a share as the 
most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> MGM, Miramax Plan Joint Productions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MGM and Miramax Films announced Tuesday they  
will co-produce up to eight movies, including remakes and other 
projects that would mine MGM's huge film library. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two films planned are ``Cold Mountain,'' based on the  
best-selling novel about a wounded Confederate soldier's journey 
home during the Civil War, and a remake of ``Harvey,'' the Jimmy 
Stewart classic about a simple-minded man whose best friend is a 
giant rabbit only he can see. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax actually has remake rights to ``Harvey,'' but the other  
six films would come from MGM's archives, said Chris McGurk, MGM 
vice chairman. Those movies could be remakes, sequels or 
reinterpretations of old films, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM's library includes about 5,000 films and 8,000 hours of  
television programming. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will allow MGM, which has produced a string of  
disappointments including ``The Mod Squad'' and ``Carrie 2: The 
Rage,'' to tie into Miramax's box-office success, said MGM 
spokesman Craig Parsons. Recent Miramax hits include ``Shakespeare 
in Love,'' ``Life Is Beautiful'' and ``Good Will Hunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through June 27, Miramax was sixth among U.S. studios in  
box-office revenue, taking in $241 million, according to ACNielsen 
EDI Inc., which tracks ticket sales. MGM was 10th with $63.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, MGM and Miramax each would distribute four of  
the films domestically and four overseas.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Wednesday  
morning on expectation the central bank may again intervene to stem 
a rise in Japan's currency. Tokyo stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.12 yen at late morning, up 0.04 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
122.02 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 1.86  
points, insignificant in percentage terms, to close the morning 
session at 18,048.87. On Tuesday, the average closed down 84.33 
points, or 0.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar remained steady against the yen  
as some market players bet the Bank of Japan may again buy dollars 
and sell yen to keep the Japanese currency from rising, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of intervention will likely prevent the U.S.  
currency from falling during Tokyo trading, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to sell the dollar below 122.00 yen,'' said  
Hikari Sekioka, a vice president at Sakura Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan last bought dollars on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan's financial officials fear a stronger yen because it would  
make Japanese exports more expensive abroad and reduce 
dollar-denominated earnings at Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is still struggling to recover from its longest postwar  
recession, despite some improved economic indicators recently. 
Officials are concerned a rise in the yen could send the economy 
back toward the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.08 yen, up from  
124.80 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark index slipped  
slightly as traders cashed in on earlier gains. 
</P>
<P>
	But market sentiment remained positive in part because of  
expectations the Japanese government will take more steps to boost 
economic growth, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have a lot of faith that (Prime Minister  
Keizo) Obuchi will do whatever is needed to get the economy 
going,'' said Louis Tseng, managing director at LHT Investment 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 0.39 point, also insignificant in percentage 
terms, to 1,478.33 points. The TOPIX closed down 7.86 points, or 
0.53 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.6100  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6800 percent, driving its price 
up to 101.66 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> Router Problem Disrupts Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- A malfunction in a device that  
transports information over the Internet caused problems Tuesday 
morning for some users trying to log on to Web sites hosted by 
Frontier Global Center. 
</P>
<P>
	David Filo, a founder of Yahoo!, the Internet's most popular  
destination, said his company was among those affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Allen, a network technician at Frontier Global, blamed a  
glitch in a computer router, which stopped forwarding ``packets'' 
of information requesting data from the affected Web sites. As a 
result, users could not access those sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers reloaded the router, and ``that took care of it,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said there was no way to say how many people might have  
been affected by the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Filo said it didn't appear to him that the problem was  
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way to know how many people were impacted,'' he  
said. ``If it was significant, we could probably tell. We didn't 
see anything unusual.''

<HEADLINE> La. School Respect Bill Now a Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Manners are going back to school next  
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Foster signed a bill Tuesday that requires Louisiana  
public students to address their teachers and other school 
employees with courtesy titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of respect in and out of school is a national problem  
and no one has an answer,'' said Sen. Don Cravens, a Lafayette 
Democrat who co-sponsored the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	When classes begin this fall, Louisiana students must refer to  
teachers and administrators as ``ma'am'' or ``sir'' or use the 
appropriate title of Mr., Miss, Ms. or Mrs. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which was passed earlier this year by the state  
Legislature, is believed to be the first in the nation requiring 
respectful conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly not a cure-all for all the ills of our  
society, of one parent homes where there may not be enough guidance 
or in homes were there is none,'' Cravens said during legislative 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The law will first apply to those in kindergarten through fifth  
grade. Higher grades will be phased in over the next few years, one 
grade per year. All grades will be included by the 2006-2007 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	No punishment is included in the current law. Each of the  
state's 66 public school systems will decide how to discipline 
students refusing to respond politely. However, no student can be 
expelled or suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we've done in four years of this administration has  
caused so much stir,'' said Foster, who had to seek out sponsors 
for the legislation. ``I don't know what that says about the 
state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, some school systems require parents or  
students to sign codes of discipline. Some states, notably Arkansas 
and Georgia, require ``character education,'' teaching honesty, 
fairness and respect for others. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform  
in Washington, said she knows of no other such attempt to require 
respectful conversation through state law.

<HEADLINE> La. Plant Blast Causes Sickness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMERCY, La. (AP) -- Two aluminum plant workers were in critical  
condition today after explosions that injured at least 13 
colleagues and sent a caustic chemical into the community, 
sickening 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not determined what caused the three  
explosions early Monday at the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Co. The 
blasts killed no one but sent residents to hospitals with nausea 
and respiratory problems after a reddish cloud of bauxite ore and 
sodium hydroxide blew into town. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions, heard miles from the plant about 40 miles west  
of New Orleans, shook houses and broke windows, and residents were 
told to stay inside for nearly seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like 10 shotguns fired all at once,'' said Cline  
Cockburn, who lives about 600 yards from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The critically injured workers have burns covering half their  
bodies, officials at Baton Rogue General Hospital said. Two others 
also remain in the hospital's burn unit in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries to other workers included difficulty breathing and eye  
irritation, State Police Sgt. William Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions happened in a part of the plant where electricity  
is generated and where the ore and liquid sodium hydroxide are 
mixed. Debris will be examined by company and federal 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, about 3,000 United Steelworkers members have been  
locked out of the Gramercy plant and other Kaiser facilities in 
Washington state and Ohio. The workers went on strike in September 
over pay, benefits and job security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, the nation's fifth largest aluminum company, has kept  
the plants running with a combination of management and replacement 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gramercy plant may remain closed for several months, said  
Kaiser spokesman Scott Lamb.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Arrive at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The first planeload of new Russian  
peacekeepers landed in Kosovo's capital today, a day after NATO 
brokered an agreement with Moscow on their deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Their presence is seen as a way to help ease the fears of  
Kosovo's minority Serbs, who have come under attack from vengeful 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ranks of the peacekeepers in Kosovo filling out, the  
head of the U.N. refugee agency warned that her agency was running 
short of funds to help hundreds of thousands of returning refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Il-76 transport plane left from the southern Russian  
town of Ivanovo this morning for the flight to Pristina. It was to 
be followed by three more planes today, Russia's Interfax news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 peacekeepers, 20 vehicles and 20 tons of other cargo  
were to be ferried to Kosovo on the planes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment, originally planned for last weekend, came a day  
after NATO and Russian negotiators resolved the latest dispute over 
the role Russian troops will play in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, was seeking to change the  
agreement reached in Helsinki, Finland, last month and allow its 
troops the freedom to operate outside NATO command throughout the 
province. NATO wanted to restrict the Russians to certain areas to 
prevent any partition of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO thwarted the weekend deployment by getting Hungary, Romania  
and Bulgaria to refuse Russia permission to fly through their 
airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement reached Monday in Moscow, the Russian  
reinforcements can patrol in the northern sector of the area 
controlled by American troops, the northwestern part of the German 
area and a small piece of the French sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knot of problems around sending Russian peacekeepers to  
Kosovo has been cut,'' Russian President Boris Yeltsin was quoted 
as saying today by Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's peacekeeping contingent is expected to eventually  
include 3,600 troops, including 750 at the Slatina Airport outside 
Pristina, which will be under Russian command. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin hinted the Kosovo crisis may be far from over, telling  
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that he ``must be prepared for a new 
situation in the Balkans,'' Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin didn't elaborate. But Ivanov, speaking after meeting  
with the Russian president, indicated Moscow was worried that 
peacekeepers may be unable to prevent the conflict in Yugoslavia 
from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are talking not only about Kosovo, but about the  
Balkans and southeast Europe as a whole; aware that the situation 
may upset stability in the entire region,'' Ivanov was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO plans for 50,000 peacekeepers eventually to be deployed in  
Kosovo, including the Russians. NATO said Monday that about 29,000 
were in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NATO deployment, Serbs have been frequently targeted  
by ethnic Albanian refugees who have returned to find their homes 
looted, their villages burned and their relatives and neighbors 
killed by Serb security forces during a crackdown that was stepped 
up during NATO's 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Committee of the Red Cross began visits today  
to some 500 people arrested by Serb authorities during the 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Kraehenbuehl, head of the ICRC Balkans operation, said  
100 people per day were coming into their Pristina headquarters to 
report relatives arrested or missing and believed held in Serbia. 
The Justice Ministry in Belgrade says that some 2,000 people are 
detained in Serbia, and on Friday gave the ICRC an initial list of 
500 names. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, appealed  
at a news conference for governments to contribute more funds to 
her agency. ``I have money for about a week's operation,'' Ogata 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR has so far only received $155 million of a total $389  
million budgeted for Kosovo operations this year, spokesman Ron 
Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR estimates that 71,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo. A total  
of 606,300 of the more than 860,000 refugees, mostly ethnic 
Albanians, have returned so far. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, leaders of Kosovo's Serb community demanded an  
international investigation into crimes against Serbs in the 
province and the alleged the existence of prison camps for Serbs. 
There was no immediate comment from NATO officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 10,000 protesters took to the streets in the southern  
Serbian city of Leskovac on Monday to call for the ouster of a 
local politician who is a member of the ruling party of President 
Slobodan Milosevic.

	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China's economy could grow by up to 8  
percent in the first half of 1999, surpassing its official target, 
state media reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both agricultural and industrial output grew strongly, with a  
bumper spring grain harvest, Ye Zhen, a spokesman for the National 
Bureau of Statistics, was quoted as saying by the China Daily 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	China reported economic growth of 7.8 percent last year, and set  
a lower target of 7 percent this year, in part because of slower 
export growth. 
</P>
<P>
	To stimulate growth, the government is spending heavily on roads  
and other public projects and encouraging Chinese to spend their 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports are still struggling, but sales of steel, cement and  
other construction materials rose, the China Daily quoted Ye as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials regard the growing telecommunications and  
other high-tech industries as ``the new star of hope in China's 
economic growth,'' Ye said.

<HEADLINE> Alex Corretja Quits Swiss Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) -- Defending champion Alex Corretja  
withdrew from the Swiss Open on Tuesday when a stomach injury 
forced him to quit during the first set. 
</P>
<P>
	Corretja, seeded second, trailed 4-3 against Ecuador's Nicolas  
Lapentti. The Spaniard first strained his stomach last week. The 
walkover sends Lapentti into the second round against Croatian 
qualifier Ivan Ljubicic. 
</P>
<P>
	In a match in which both players hit serves topping 130 mph,  
Marc Rosset beat fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (4-7), 
6-2. Top-seeded Gustavo Kuerten advanced with a 6-4, 6-4 victory 
over Mariano Puerta of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	With Corretja out, Rosset and Rusedski delighted the crowd on a  
rainy day with lethal serves. Rusedski had one serve of 139 mph, 
with Rosset clocked at 134 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling to adapt from Wimbledon's grass to Gstaad's clay,  
Rusedski faltered in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuerten, ranked a career-high fifth, had little trouble  
dispatching Puerta. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a really good win for me, just adding to a really  
great season,'' said the Brazilian, a quarterfinalist at both the 
French Open and Wimbledon this year. ``In 1997 I won the French 
Open but this season I've been playing better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuerten is optimistic about his game in Gstaad after clay court  
wins in Monte Carlo and Rome. But Gstaad is one of the fastest clay 
courts on the circuit because of the high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to play well after Wimbledon,'' Kuerten said.  
``It's probably the worst change to go from Wimbledon to here. In 
Wimbledon the balls are much heavier. Here they bounce high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round matches, No. 6 Fransisco Clavet defeated  
fellow Spaniard Juan Balcells 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), and U.S. 
qualifier Donald Johnson defeated Swiss wild card George Bastl 7-6 
(10-8), 6-4.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire, Sosa To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who led baseball's  
resurgence with their home-run race last summer, will be starting 
together in the All-Star game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs last year, and Sosa, who  
leads the major leagues with 32, were elected Tuesday to start for 
the National League at Boston's Fenway Park on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the 11th appearance and seventh start for McGwire,  
and the third appearance and first start for Sosa, whose first 
career home run came at Fenway against Roger Clemens on June 21, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say thank you to all the people who voted for me,''  
Sosa said. ``I feel pretty proud of myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Arizona Diamondbacks were the only team to place  
two players in the starting lineup: Matt Williams won at third base 
and Jay Bell overtook Houston's Craig Biggio in the final week to 
win at second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely, extremely surprised,'' Bell said. ``Craig has  
been the fair-haired second baseman in the National League. He's 
deserved it. He's been a great player over the years. For me to be 
elected over him is a great honor and truly unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza of the New York Mets will start at catcher for the  
sixth straight season and make his seventh appearance overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never get tired of going there,'' Piazza said. ``As long as  
I am elected or selected, I will feel honored to go. It is probably 
the most fun you can have as a player, hanging out with the rest of 
the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Barry Larkin held off the Mets' Rey Ordonez at  
shortstop, and Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn 
were elected to join Sosa in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, elected to his 15th All-Star game and 11th starting spot,  
won't play because of a calf injury that has put him on the 
disabled list for the second time this season. But he will make the 
trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted a chance to play in Fenway, but being on the  
DL, I can't,'' he said. ``It's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, one of the few bright spots in the Chicago Cubs' dismal  
season, was the NL's leading vote-getter with 2,315,204, finishing 
third overall in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (2,918,055) led all players  
for the fourth straight year and fifth time overall and was 
followed by Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar (2,793,891). 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, second in the NL with 27 homers, received the  
second-highest NL vote total, leading first basemen with 1,669,066. 
</P>
<P>
	He wishes the All-Star break was longer than three days.  
</P>
<P>
	``All the other sports have four to five days off,'' he said,  
``and I've never understood why baseball doesn't give the guys that 
play in the All-Star Game and extra day off just to get back to the 
cities they're going to play their games in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who trailed Biggio 697,326 to 658,407 in totals announced  
last week, finished with 1,203,902, about 32,000 ahead of his 
Houston rival, who wound up at 1,171,574. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, none of the votes cast on the Internet had  
been included in the weekly totals, and Bell benefitted from 
Arizona's promotional push. Fans were allowed to vote up to 22 
times on the Internet -- the average number of home games for each 
team during the balloting. Sosa gained nearly 1 million votes in 
the final week of counting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him and I hope he goes up there and plays  
well,'' Biggio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, who led Ordonez by fewer than 10,000 votes last week,  
won by a wide margin, 858,203 to 799,858. Larkin will be making his 
10th All-Star appearance, his fourth as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker will be making his fourth appearance, his third straight  
as a starter. Williams, a five-time All-Star, returns to the game 
for the first time since 1996 and will make his fourth start. For 
Bell, it's his second appearance and first start. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some satisfaction for me because I got to see  
first-hand what they went through last year,'' Diamondbacks manager 
Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, Gwynn, McGwire, Piazza and Williams get $50,000 bonuses,  
and Walker gets $25,000. Griffey, who earned a $100,000 bonus for 
getting elected and leading the AL voting, gets an additional 
$25,000 for getting the most votes in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	AL starters were announced Monday. In addition to Griffey and  
Alomar, the lineup includes Cleveland's Jim Thome at first, and 
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton in the outfield. They will be joined 
by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Boston shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken and Tampa Bay 
designated hitter Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and reserves for both leagues will be picked Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hard Sell Is On at Steelcase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- With a half-dozen employees of  
BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama visiting Steelcase Inc. 
headquarters in search of desks, chairs and cubicles, the hard sell 
was on. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest office furniture maker had flown the group  
in on a Steelcase corporate jet for a day of tours and a lunch 
featuring dishes such as pear and duck salad and mussels and 
mushroom fettuccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lunch, amenities ... are a way of saying thank you to the  
customer for investing the time to come,'' says Steelcase sales 
consultant Jeff Schutte. ``We want them to see our products are 
superb ... and our services are outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high-class treatment is routine for big customers. But these  
days, in a time of uncertainty for the office furniture industry, 
each order from those big customers is especially important. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven years of strong growth, sales in the $12 billion  
domestically produced office furniture industry have softened. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dilbert may think that every employee works in a cubicle,  
it's clear that the industry is changing. There is a 
diversification in business demographics, and fiercer competition 
from cheaper refurbished furniture and ready-to-assemble furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Olson, a Grand Rapids investor and writer who works out of  
his home, says he looked at Steelcase but ended up buying his 
office furniture from Office Depot. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the low prices, lack of sales pressure and the quality  
of the ready-to-assemble furniture, as well as its immediate 
availability, convinced him. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a home office it always seems like my needs are  
changing,'' he says. ``It's easier to think about pitching a $500 
desk than a $3,000 desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase makes 20 percent of the desks, chairs and other office  
furniture sold in the United States. It employs about 19,000 people 
worldwide, but nearly 200 workers voluntarily took several weeks 
off with pay earlier this year as part of a cost-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest sales figures show the company may be back on track.  
It saw sales reach $691.8 million for the quarter that ended in 
late May, an increase of 2.9 percent in comparison to a year ago. 
It was also an improvement from the quarter ended Feb. 26, when 
sales were $678.6 million, down 3 percent from the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no one is certain whether the rebound will last.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Herman Miller Inc. of Zeeland, Mich., had poorer results.  
Net sales for the quarter were $432.4 million compared with $465.3 
million a year earlier. New orders for the quarter were $447.6 
million compared with $460.8 million for the same quarter of last 
year. The company employs about 8,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held Haworth Inc. of Holland, Mich., at No. 3, has  
also reported a slackening in sales. It employs 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase chief executive Jim Hackett primarily blames the  
uncertainty on the mega-mergers of 1998 and believes the big 
companies are waiting until the dust settles before making any 
major commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase last year unveiled Pathways, a high-tech office  
furniture system designed to aesthetically and ergonomically 
integrate furniture and architecture with the computers cables and 
other equipment found in today's offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: The Fortune 500 companies that can appreciate and  
afford Pathways aren't buying much of anything right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say Pathways has been hurt. But it hasn't probably  
taken off at the level it could have, had the Fortune 500 companies 
not been in their funk,'' Schutte says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Steelcase has continued efforts to broaden its  
customer base. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Steelcase unveiled a Web site designed to make it  
easier for its network of dealers to sell furniture. Haworth's 
Internet site is similar, while Herman Miller uses its Web site to 
sell furniture directly to the public, with an emphasis on home 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a part of the market our industry has never served,''  
says Mark Sherman, a Herman Miller spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also emphasis at Steelcase on Revest, the refurbished  
furniture business Steelcase acquired 10 years ago. Haworth and 
Herman Miller also have refurbished furniture programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Revest's) customers would be smaller businesses who want to  
grow their business but want to use their cash for products and 
service, not necessarily their furniture,'' says Steelcase 
spokesman Peter Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe that after record sales growth of 14  
percent in 1997, an industry slowdown was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, it's a little perplexing ... overall economic signs are  
still very strong, very positive ... in essence the economy is 
booming,'' says Tom Reardon, executive director of BIFMA, the 
Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	BIFMA predicts the industry will grow between 3 percent and 5  
percent this year and between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to keep this perspective -- the sky is not  
falling in, it's not the end of the world,'' Reardon says. 
</P>
<P>
	And some believe leaner companies may eventually work to the  
industry's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies have to find ways to gain efficiency and to increase  
worker morale,'' says Jerry Johanneson, Haworth's president and 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend I've seen ... is they're rearranging the work area  
... using technology to improve work space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States continues ... to see more people working in  
white-collar jobs,'' says David Manthey, an analyst with Robert W. 
Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ``Everyone needs a place to sit, so 
office furniture will continue to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steelcase's stock is selling for about $20 per share on the New  
York Stock Exchange. It had dropped to $12.75 per share after 
fetching more than $35 after its initial public offering last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Miller has also seen a resurgence in its stock, which in  
the past year has fluctuated from about $16 to $30.75. It now 
trades at about $24 a share on the Nasdaq exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the office furniture companies' growth likely will  
depend on their ability to develop new business while maintaining 
more traditional clients, like BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurer already uses Steelcase products, but manager Jim  
Wright says the company will also consider the price and quality of 
furniture made by Herman Miller, Haworth and others before making a 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the Steelcase visit was to find what new  
products are out there furniture-wise,'' Wright said. ``This was a 
fact-finding mission.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Find Upstate Unique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Politicians who swing through upstate like  
to talk about New York's growing prosperity and the Wall Street 
boom. But on her campaign tour this week, Hillary Rodham Clinton 
will find that many upstate New Yorkers believe they haven't been 
invited to the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is many upstate New Yorkers live closer to West  
Virginia than Manhattan -- and have more in common with the former. 
So, if it's upstate points that Mrs. Clinton wants in her race for 
the Senate, she'll have to remember there's more to a New York 
state of mind than skyscrapers and subways. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people are calling Mrs. Clinton a carpetbagger. Arkansas,  
Washington, New York City -- it's all the same to upstate New 
Yorkers. Plenty of ``carpetbaggers'' have been elected from right 
within the state's borders -- downstaters who never ventured north 
until election season. 
</P>
<P>
	A few upstate basics: No. 1, it has more people than downstate --  
11 million in all. And a lot more land -- more than 40,000 square 
miles north of Westchester County up to the Canadian border and 
west to the biggest city, Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some upstaters live in concrete apartment blocks, but many more  
make their homes on mountain foothills and more than 30,000 farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers don't see many politicians. But if they did, they'd  
have a lot to say about such things as dairy compacts and the 
concentrated animal feeding operation regulations, topics that 
don't ordinarily arise in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say upstaters don't like to visit New York and its  
smorgasbord of shopping, restaurants and theater. Everyone's heard 
about the city's dropping crime rate and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's 
crackdowns on panhandlers and strip clubs and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	But upstaters still don't feel comfortable in a place where the  
mayor has to practically legislate human kindness. That's taken for 
granted upstate. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstate could learn a lot from upstate, were they to bother to  
look. (When the Buffalo Bills played the New York -- really New 
Jersey -- Giants in the Super Bowl in 1991, a random sampling of New 
Yorkers was asked to point to Buffalo on a map. Most couldn't. 
What's worse, it didn't bother them in the least.) 
</P>
<P>
	Upstate's cities have seen better days. Now, there seem to be as  
many boarded stores as open ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial giants like Bethlehem Steel, Kodak, General Motors,  
Fisher-Price and IBM have scaled back to the tune of 59,100 
manufacturing jobs during this decade alone. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric once employed 40,000 people in Schenectady.  
That's down to 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, when jobs go, people go. Buffalo had 580,132 people  
in 1950. Today, there are 300,000. People are moving out so fast 
that some towns, like Troy and Utica, have needed help from the 
state to avoid bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Upstaters are generally conservative and Republican, and tend to  
view the more liberal south with caution. Last year state 
Republican Committee ads depicted the New York City-based 
Democratic nominees for statewide office as sharks swimming out of 
the city to feast in upstate waters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's true that Sen. Alfonse D'Amato lost to Democrat Charles  
Schumer during the state's last Senate election. But upstate, the 
incumbent Republican won in 47 of 52 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	A final thought, Mrs. Clinton may be a step ahead if she can  
spell ``Niagara.'' Rudolph Giuliani's campaign schedule misspelled 
it to rhyme with ``Viagra.''

	East Swelters in Heat Wave  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the third day in a row, temperatures climbed  
to 100 steamy degrees in the East today, triggering blackouts and 
making for an unpleasant return to work for people who spent the 
holiday weekend in shorts and T-shirts. At least eight deaths have 
been blamed on the heat in the Midwest and East. The heat also 
stalled commuter trains and subways in New York.

	LOME, Togo (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels demanded amnesty from  
prosecution for war crimes, a government official said today, 
dimming prospects for a deal to end a ferocious civil war that has 
left thousands dead and maimed. While African and U.N. mediators 
worked to cobble together a draft peace accord, Sierra Leone's

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Planeloads of Russian troops flew  
into Kosovo's capital today, formally ending a stalemate over their 
deployment and launching Moscow's main foray alongside NATO into 
the province's treacherous ethnic tensions. The arrival of about 
200 soldiers and 20 tons of equipment came a day after Moscow and 
NATO reached agreement on terms of the Russian role in the 
peacekeeping force. The entire contingent of 3,600 troops should be 
in place by the end of July. NATO so far has more than 29,000 
troops in the province, out of a planned total of 55,000 
peacekeepers.

investors eager to reap gains from last week's stunning gains. At 
the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow industrials were down 
4.12 at 11,135.12. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange 
led advancers 1,594-1,449. The Nasdaq was down 4.24 at 2,736.78.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who led baseball's  
resurgence with their home-run race last summer, will be starting 
together in the All-Star game for the first time. Arizona second 
baseman Jay Bell overtook Craig Biggio and joined Diamondbacks 
third baseman Matt Williams in the National League's starting 
lineup for next week's All-Star game. Mike Piazza of the New York 
Mets will be at catcher and Barry Larkin of Cincinnati at 
shortstop.

<HEADLINE> Kids Die in Heat-Related Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Heat exposure is being blamed for the deaths of two children who  
climbed into cars as they played with siblings during the long 
Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the deaths of a toddler left in a car and an adult  
were blamed on the heat in Chicago, two adults died of heat-related 
causes in Philadelphia, and the deaths of a mother and daughter in 
Newport, Pa., also were believed to be due to the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	In Omaha, Neb., 2 1/2-year-old Arnold Guzman died Monday after his  
5-year-old brother helped him into a car, shut the door and went 
off to play. Authorities don't know how long Arnold was inside 
before his mother found him. The windows were up and temperatures 
inside were over 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 2 1/2-year-old can't easily get out of the car, and the kids  
were apparently playing in the backyard and forgot about him,'' 
police Sgt. Dan Cisar said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Masontown, Pa., a 2-year-old boy died Sunday while ducking  
down in the passenger seat of the family car during a game of 
hide-and-seek. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cody Britt's sisters, age 6 and 3, could not find him, the  
family began searching for him. On a second check of the car, they 
opened the passenger door and the boy tumbled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody had been inside the car for at least an hour, with outside  
temperatures in the high 90s, and the boy's asthma condition made 
the heat particularly dangerous, Fayette County Coroner Phillip 
Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Chicago suburb of Villa Park, 2-year-old Melanie Auriene  
died Sunday after she was left in a closed car for about two hours. 
Police said Melanie fell asleep in the car while a family group 
returned from a parade and was left inside with the doors and 
windows shut. The girl's father found her in the car when he 
arrived to pick her up about two hours later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges had been filed.  
</P>
<P>
	A 49-year-old Chicago man collapsed and died Sunday with a body  
temperature of 107 degrees. DeVelle Fredrick also had hypertension 
and cardiovascular disease, the Cook County medical examiner's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia officials said 85-year-old Alice O'Malley and a  
67-year-old man whose name was not immediately released died Monday 
as the heat reached 100 in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania state police said Helen Mae Freet, 80, and her  
daughter, Rose Marie, 54, were found dead Monday in their home in 
Newport, about 25 miles northwest of Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives found the women, who lived in a house that had no air  
conditioning and only one small fan in a window. Both also had 
medical conditions that may have contributed to their deaths, 
police said.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire, Sosa To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who led baseball's  
resurgence with their home-run race last summer, will be starting 
together in the All-Star game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs last year, and Sosa, who  
leads the major leagues with 32, were elected Tuesday to start for 
the National League at Boston's Fenway Park on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the 11th appearance and seventh start for McGwire,  
and the third appearance and first start for Sosa, whose first 
career home run came at Fenway against Roger Clemens on June 21, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say thank you to all the people who voted for me,''  
Sosa said. ``I feel pretty proud of myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Arizona Diamondbacks were the only team to place  
two players in the starting lineup: Matt Williams won at third base 
and Jay Bell overtook Houston's Craig Biggio in the final week to 
win at second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely, extremely surprised,'' Bell said. ``Craig has  
been the fair-haired second baseman in the National League. He's 
deserved it. He's been a great player over the years. For me to be 
elected over him is a great honor and truly unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza of the New York Mets will start at catcher for the  
sixth straight season and make his seventh appearance overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never get tired of going there,'' Piazza said. ``As long as  
I am elected or selected, I will feel honored to go. It is probably 
the most fun you can have as a player, hanging out with the rest of 
the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Barry Larkin held off the Mets' Rey Ordonez at  
shortstop, and Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn 
were elected to join Sosa in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, elected to his 15th All-Star game and 11th starting spot,  
won't play because of a calf injury that has put him on the 
disabled list for the second time this season. But he will make the 
trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted a chance to play in Fenway, but being on the  
DL, I can't,'' he said. ``It's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, one of the few bright spots in the Chicago Cubs' dismal  
season, was the NL's leading vote-getter with 2,315,204, finishing 
third overall in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (2,918,055) led all players  
for the fourth straight year and fifth time overall and was 
followed by Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar (2,793,891). 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, second in the NL with 27 homers, received the  
second-highest NL vote total, leading first basemen with 1,669,066. 
</P>
<P>
	He wishes the All-Star break was longer than three days.  
</P>
<P>
	``All the other sports have four to five days off,'' he said,  
``and I've never understood why baseball doesn't give the guys that 
play in the All-Star Game and extra day off just to get back to the 
cities they're going to play their games in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who trailed Biggio 697,326 to 658,407 in totals announced  
last week, finished with 1,203,902, about 32,000 ahead of his 
Houston rival, who wound up at 1,171,574. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, none of the votes cast on the Internet had  
been included in the weekly totals, and Bell benefitted from 
Arizona's promotional push. Fans were allowed to vote up to 22 
times on the Internet -- the average number of home games for each 
team during the balloting. Sosa gained nearly 1 million votes in 
the final week of counting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him and I hope he goes up there and plays  
well,'' Biggio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, who led Ordonez by fewer than 10,000 votes last week,  
won by a wide margin, 858,203 to 799,858. Larkin will be making his 
10th All-Star appearance, his fourth as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker will be making his fourth appearance, his third straight  
as a starter. Williams, a five-time All-Star, returns to the game 
for the first time since 1996 and will make his fourth start. For 
Bell, it's his second appearance and first start. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some satisfaction for me because I got to see  
first-hand what they went through last year,'' Diamondbacks manager 
Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, Gwynn, McGwire, Piazza and Williams get $50,000 bonuses,  
and Walker gets $25,000. Griffey, who earned a $100,000 bonus for 
getting elected and leading the AL voting, gets an additional 
$25,000 for getting the most votes in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	AL starters were announced Monday. In addition to Griffey and  
Alomar, the lineup includes Cleveland's Jim Thome at first, and 
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton in the outfield. They will be joined 
by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Boston shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken and Tampa Bay 
designated hitter Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and reserves for both leagues will be picked Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tax Bill Helps With Elder Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who care for elderly relatives at home  
would get a new tax exemption under legislation House Republicans 
will include in the massive tax relief bill expected to begin 
moving next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal outlined Tuesday by Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of  
the House Ways and Means Committee, also would allow people to 
deduct on their income-tax returns premiums they pay for long-term 
care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement puts the GOP on the same footing as President  
Clinton in advocating tax-law changes to help people cope with the 
rising costs of old age. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need for long-term care in America is great and will only  
grow larger as the baby boomers start retiring,'' said Archer, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said the proposals would be part of the Ways and Means  
Committee's tax package, which in its current form would provide 
tax breaks estimated at $850 billion over 10 years. Clinton 
probably would veto a tax-cut bill of that size, but parts with 
strong bipartisan support could survive in a smaller measure 
expected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term care tax breaks exist in current law, but most can't  
be claimed unless the amounts exceed 7.5 percent of a taxpayer's 
adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing home care already costs an average of $50,000 a year,  
Ways and Means Committee figures show. Numbers of people needing 
long-term care begin increasing fast at age 85, and 20 percent of 
85-year-olds already need it. Planners worry that in 2030, the 77 
million baby boomers will start reaching 85. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent letter to colleagues, Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.,  
said people who take care of an older relative at home are 
increasingly crucial links in the nation's retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the assistance of caregivers, more people would  
require institutional care, and the public cost of long-term care 
services would increase significantly,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican plan would add a new personal income tax  
exemption -- similar to existing exemptions for dependent children -- 
for people who provide long-term care to elderly relatives at home. 
The exemption this year would be $2,750, but the figure changes 
annually based on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure would allow people to deduct from their  
income taxes the cost of long-term health care insurance premiums. 
The deduction would be phased in over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would allow employers to include long-term  
care insurance in ``cafeteria'' benefits plans. That would allow 
employees to put pretax earnings toward the purchase of such 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed this year a $1,000 tax credit for long-term  
care, but it would be phased out for married couples with adjusted 
gross incomes above $110,000 and $75,000 for singles. The GOP plan 
contains no such income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Office of Management and Budget spokeswoman Linda  
Ricci said Archer was ``right to recognize'' the needs of people 
who provide long-term care for family members. But she repeated 
that Clinton first wants the surplus used to ensure future solvency 
of Social Security and Medicare and to provide a new Medicare 
prescription drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rother, public policy director for AARP, the American  
Association of Retired Persons, called the GOP proposal 
``exciting'' but said the nation's largest organization of older 
adults needs time to determine if the plan reaches the lower- and 
middle-income people who are most in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had any time to figure out if there's any losers in  
this changeover, or if it's just a better deal for everyone,'' 
Rother said. ``There's relatively limited dollars here, and we want 
to see those dollars go to people who are not able to afford other 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overall House tax bill, also to include cuts in income and  
capital gains taxes, is estimated at up to $850 billion over 10 
years, according to a leadership aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A $1 trillion cut was floated last week by Republican leaders,  
but it quickly became clear that members of Congress and the White 
House have many ideas for using new budget surplus figures -- 
including safeguarding Medicare and spending on education and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday with CNBC, Clinton said he would prefer  
using some of the the annual budget surpluses to reduce the federal 
government's $5.5 trillion debt, and still provide a ``sizable tax 
cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we take this country out of debt for the firt time since  
1835, then average people are going to have more money in their 
pockets than if we keep the country in debt and give them a tax cut 
now because we got an election in a year and a half,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Cavaliers To Hire Wittman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Randy  
Wittman will be hired as coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers on 
Wednesday, two TV stations reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Timberwolves spokesman Kent Wipf wouldn't confirm reports by  
Twin Cities stations KARE-TV and KSTP-TV. Wittman doesn't have a 
listed phone number in the Twin Cities area. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers spokesmen Bob Zink and Bob Price didn't immediately  
return messages seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman, 39, in five years with the Timberwolves has gained a  
reputation as one of the league's brightest assistants. He also has 
been an assistant with the Indiana Pacers and Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-year NBA veteran, Wittman was a first-round draft pick of  
the Washington Bullets in 1983 but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks 
before the 1983-84 season. He averaged 7.4 points a game in playing 
stints with Atlanta, Sacramento and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to playing for Indiana's 1981 NCAA title team,  
Wittman was a two-time academic All-American with the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs have been looking for a coach since June 1, when Mike  
Fratello was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland hasn't made it past the first round of the playoffs  
since 1993 and attendance has sagged from 18,011 a game in 1994-95 
to 14,120 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman met with Cavs general manager Jim Paxson on June 16 and  
was back in Cleveland 10 days later to have dinner with Paxson. He 
emerged as the frontrunner over the holiday weekend after meeting 
with Gund at the owner's offices in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman, Dave Cowens, Del Harris and John MacLeod were known to  
have been interviewed for the coaching vacancy. Wittman is the only 
one who hasn't been an NBA head coach.

<HEADLINE> Kendall Unlikely To Return in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Jason Kendall needs  
three months to rebuild his shattered right ankle and almost 
certainly won't play again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, who fractured and dislocated his ankle and tore all of  
his ankle ligaments in a frightening accident at first base Sunday, 
told several teammates Monday that he wants to play a few games in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the Pirates aren't discouraging Kendall's plans for a  
rapid recovery, they also won't jeopardize the 25-year-old's 
promising career by rushing him back prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, a two-time All-Star, was fifth in the NL batting race  
with a .332 average before he was injured Sunday running out a bunt 
against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a medical standpoint, it is unlikely we would recommend  
coming back before the end of the season,'' said Jack Failla, the 
Pirates' orthopedist. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's ankle came apart as he stepped awkwardly on the side  
of the first base bag, causing his fibula to jam its way through 
his skin -- a gruesome sight that left some players nauseous. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to dislocating the ankle and fracturing a 1/4-inch by  
3/8-inch piece of bone, Kendall also tore three outside ankle 
ligaments and one inside ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single ligament in the ankle was ruptured,'' Failla  
said. ``I've never seen anything quite like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jason Kendall thinks he's going to play again this  
year but, realistically, he's not,'' manager Gene Lamont said. 
``When he gets back, he'll realize how tough it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Failla said the injury isn't necessarily  
career-threatening. Bobby Bonilla had a similar-style fracture 
during a mid-1980s as a Pirates farmhand and recovered to become an 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Ventura, then with the White Sox, snapped his ankle in  
similar fashion during a home plate collision in spring training 
two years ago and returned four months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Kendall is one of the Pirates' hardest-working players,  
and Failla said motivating him during his rehabilitation won't be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Jason Kendall, we'll have to hold him down for a while  
to protect the repair,'' Failla said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall will remain hospitalized for another 2-3 days to receive  
intravenous antibiotics, then will wear a protective cast for six 
weeks. He will lift weights and do other exercises during that time 
to maintain his upper body strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's father Fred, a roving catching instructor with the  
Cincinnati Reds, and his mother flew to Pittsburgh on Sunday night 
to be with him. Many of Kendall's teammates also visited him and 
the Pirates wore his nickname, ``Kid,'' stenciled on their hats in 
tribute Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates expect Kendall to recover fully as a hitter, but the  
unanswered question is how the injury will affect his speed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the fastest catchers in major league history, he was the  
Pirates' leadoff hitter earlier this season. With 22 steals in 80 
games, he was on pace to break the single-season record of 36 
stolen bases by a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speed is what you don't know about,'' Lamont said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates and Kendall also were discussing a contract  
extension worth at least $20 million, but those talks are on hold 
until he returns. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kendall on the disabled list, catcher Yamid Haad was  
recalled from Double-A Altoona, a short-term move designed to give 
the Pirates a backup catcher for Monday's game against the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Cam Bonifay is looking for an experienced  
catcher to back up Keith Osik, and former Colorado Rockies catcher 
Jeff Reed is a possibility. He hit 17 homers two years ago before 
being released Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Interest in Home Schooling Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When Sherie Ferguson learned two teen-age gunmen  
opened fire at Columbine High, she jumped in her car and sped 
through traffic to find her daughter, a 15-year-old freshman at a 
neighboring high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, with the death toll in the Littleton school  
massacre at 15, Ms. Ferguson decided she would teach Brandi at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sending her back to Bear Creek, where security is virtually  
nonexistent, to me that's gambling,'' said Ms. Ferguson, a single 
parent. ``Look at all the copy cats. I don't think it's going to 
stop. How can it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is too early to know how many parents will opt for home  
schooling, but educators in Colorado said there was a 30 percent to 
40 percent increase in interest immediately after Dylan Klebold, 
17, and Eric Harris, 18, went on their rampage April 20. The two 
seniors killed 12 classmates and a teacher and injured 25 others at 
Columbine before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, was accused of wounding  
six students at Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga., amplifying 
jitters about school safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tension out there, and parents are very curious what  
they can do about it,'' said Brian Ray of the National Home 
Education Research Institute in Oregon. ``Many people see home 
schooling as a way to protect children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the number of headline-seizing, multiple-victim attacks  
recently has gone up, government figures show a general decline in 
school crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released last year, the Education Department found  
90 percent of schools reported no serious violent crime in 
1996-1997. Fewer students brought weapons to schools, based on 
surveys beginning in 1993 of students in grades 9-12. And the 
overall crime rate at schools dropped between 1993-1996, based on 
surveys of students 12-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is that it is not the safety issue as much as that  
that was the last straw,'' said Michael Kasson of the Colorado Home 
Educators Association. 
</P>
<P>
	For most parents, the decision to home school can take years and  
is based on numerous factors, including the quality of public 
school education, the specific needs of a child, a wish to 
emphasize moral or religious guidelines, or distance from the 
nearest school, particularly in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, however, parents are citing security as a reason  
for turning living rooms into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly was a stick in the fire,'' said Terry Deharsh, a  
locksmith who attended the Christian Home Educators of Colorado's 
recent statewide conference on home schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is an elementary school across the street from  
the Deharshes' home in Greeley, Deharsh and his wife, Lindee, plan 
to home school their 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thrill-seekers are going to look for a group,'' Deharsh said.  
``If someone wants to kill my daughter at home, they have to know 
her, they have to have a reason to kill her and they have to come 
looking for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Columbine, the number of home schoolers has  
increased 7 percent to 15 percent nationally in the past five 
years, with up to 1.6 million children home schooled in 1998, 
according to National Home Education Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzy Parker, director of the Colorado Department of Education's  
home schooling program, said she received five calls a day, twice 
the normal amount, from parents seeking information in the month 
that followed the Columbine shooting.

	In several states with fatal school-related shootings -- Pearl,

<HEADLINE> Fruit Warehouse Explodes in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An explosion and fire destroyed a fruit  
warehouse downtown Tuesday, killing one person and injuring five 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Fire Chief Bob Neamy said the cause of the blast was  
under investigation. The business used a flammable ripening agent 
on bananas and other fruit, but there were also reports of a 
propane leak, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast happened just before 11 a.m., and firefighters battled  
the flames for more than an hour, pouring water through the 
collapsed roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified dead person was found in the burned building.  
One victim was hospitalized with serious burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The busiest time in the produce district is in the early morning  
hours. Most work is typically wrapped up by late morning.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Sparks Ga. Apartment Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fires believed to have been sparked by lightning  
gutted more than 100 apartments in the Atlanta area Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire that began shortly after 5 p.m. on the roof of one  
building of the Post Terrace Apartments north of Atlanta destroyed 
56 units. The fire quickly worked its way down the four-story 
structure until it consumed the entire building. 
</P>
<P>
	Firewalls helped keep the blaze from spreading to other  
buildings in the 296-unit complex, Fulton County Police Maj. Terry 
Mulkey said. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported. At least 60 residents were forced to  
spend the night at a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in shock,'' resident Laura Jorgensen said. ``It's like you  
wake up from a bad dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A band of powerful thunderstorms was believed to have sparked  
the blaze and other less severe fires throughout the area. 
Lightning lit up the sky throughout the city as sheets of water 
poured down on motorists during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires also destroyed 16 units of an apartment building and  
damaged 16 more in another building. Twelve units were destroyed in 
a fire at a fourth apartment complex. Several houses also caught 
fire.

<HEADLINE> Russian Gymnast Gets Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Russian gymnast  
Svetlana Khorkina captured her third gold medal of the University 
Games today by winning the uneven bars, her specialty. 
</P>
<P>
	Khorkina scored a 9.8 out of 10, to beat Ukraine's Olha  
Teslenko, who was second with 9.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, in Olympic, Goodwill Games, World or European  
Championships, Khorkina has missed gold only once on the bars, 
finishing second in the world championships five years go. She 
added that title here to her golds from the team competition and 
the individual all-around, and was to compete for two more golds 
later Tuesday in the balance beam and floor exercise events. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four athletes in the 40-year history of the University  
Games have ever taken home as many as five gold medals. Soviet 
gymnast Dimitri Bilozerchev holds the record of six, in 1985, at 
Kobe, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to win (the all-around) yesterday, because it  
is very hot here and I feel tired. I'm not in the best physical 
shape,'' Khorkina, 20 said, ``but the bars are my favorite event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Russian, Elena Produnova, won the women's vault and  
teammate Elena Dolgopolova was third. Cuban Arasay Jova took the 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Carballo won Spain's first medal of the event on the  
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny crowd of about 100 fans at the Principes de Espana  
arena saved its loudest cheers for Carballo, who took the bronze in 
the rings with a score of 9.625. Ivan Ivankov claimed one of two 
golds for Belarus here with a 9.8, and China's Zhen Dong won the 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitali Rudnitski of Belarus won the men's floor exercise, and  
Romanian Marius Daniel Urzica captured his country's first gold of 
the games in the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
	All eight of the gold medals won by the United States at this  
biannual, Olympics-style event have come in swimming, but the 
team's domination of the sport appeared headed for an end today, 
with Japan putting in the top performances in the morning heats. 
</P>
<P>
	The best U.S. showing came from Jessica Foschi, who early in her  
career was suspended for a failing a steroids test. She led 
qualifying for the women's 400-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Foschi was 15 when she tested positive for steroids at the U.S.  
national championships in Pasadena, Calif., on Aug. 4, 1995. She 
has denied ever knowingly taking a banned substance. U.S. Swimming 
placed Foschi on two years' probation, allowing her to compete in 
the 1996 Olympic trials and other national meets. She failed to 
make the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA, the sport's world governing body, suspended her for two  
years, a punishment eventually reduced to six months and made 
retroactive to 1995 by the Court for Arbitration in Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Keitaro Konnai clocked just .01 of a second off the  
University Games record for the men's 100-meter backstroke, and 
teammate Atsushi Nishitori had the second fastest time in 
qualifying for the evening finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomoko Hagiwara, who took gold in the 100-meter butterfly  
Sunday, and Miki Nakao gave Japan the top two qualifiers in the 
women's 200 backstroke, while countryman Akira Hayashi turned in 
the top heat performance in the men's 100 breaststroke.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Longshore Workers Stall Docks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Longshore workers shut down the Port of  
Oakland and slowed work in Los Angeles and Long Beach on Tuesday as 
negotiators studied a proposed wage and benefits offer from 
steamship companies and port operators, management officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action, apparently originating with Local 10 of the  
International Longshore and Warehouse Union, stopped most activity 
at the port, which includes 12 cargo terminals serving 33 shipping 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of our customers are able to conduct business,'' said  
Port of Oakland spokeswoman Roberta Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Pacific Maritime Association, which represents  
management at all West Coast ports in the talks, were caught by 
surprise. The association made its offer on Saturday, just before 
talks ended for the Fourth of July holiday, with an understanding 
that negotiations would resume this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard from the union,'' said Phil Resch, the  
association's senior vice president. ``We have called all day today 
to talk to the international and they have not returned our 
calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials, whose members have been working without a  
contract since Thursday, did not return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the stoppage spread to other West Coast ports, it could  
idle thousands of workers who help ship and process cargo at inland 
warehouses and cost the nation billions of dollars in lost 
commerce, association officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact will ripple well beyond the West Coast waterfront  
to the far reaches of Asia and America,'' association President 
Joseph Miniace said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The association and union leaders have been negotiating behind  
closed doors since May to work out a contract that would affect 
about 14,700 union members on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's offer included a 32 percent boost in pension  
benefits to future retirees and a 15 percent raise for those 
currently retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials declined to describe the association's pay offer, but  
Miniace said it would make West Coast workers ``among the highest 
compensated union workers in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pay in 1998 averaged $99,000 for workers, $117,617 for clerks  
and $156,251 for foremen, according to the association.

<HEADLINE> Senate Urged On Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's been nearly three years since President  
Clinton became the first world leader to sign a treaty calling for 
a global ban on nuclear test explosions. The Senate has yet to even 
hold a hearing on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is not alone: So far, only 18 of the 44 nations with  
nuclear capabilities that must ratify the wide-ranging 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty have taken action. Now, with a 
September ratification deadline approaching, treaty activists are 
stepping up their campaign to bring the measure to the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the treaty remains bottled up in the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., is locked in a dispute with the Clinton administration over 
two other treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate is dragging its feet on this issue and it's  
unforgivable,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a leader in the 
effort bring the treaty to a vote. He said he and other test-ban 
supporters will get ``more aggressive'' in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan declined to say what that meant, but there's no question  
that a handful of determined senators can bring havoc to the 
Senate's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia is waiting for us, China is waiting for Russia,'' said  
Thomas Graham, president of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security 
and a former director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament 
Agency. ``The delay in ratification is exclusively that there 
haven't been hearings. There is no other reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 pact includes a pledge against all testing of nuclear  
devices and sets up a global system of sensors to monitor 
compliance. It was signed by 152 nations, but ratification is 
moving slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	The approaching deadline is Sept. 23, the third anniversary of  
the treaty's opening for signature. After that, a conference will 
be held to convene to consider what measures might be taken to get 
non-ratifying members to join, including possibly economic steps. 
Only nations that ratified the treaty could participate in the 
conference -- leaving the United States without direct influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the treaty, all 44 states with some nuclear capacity must  
sign for it to take effect. Even one holdout -- by, say, North Korea 
-- could keep the treaty from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the test-ban treaty say it would lock in U.S.  
superiority gained in over 1,000 nuclear tests during the Cold War, 
while failing to ratify the pact could open the door to additional 
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan -- now caught up in another 
military dustup over Kashmir -- or other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argue it could threaten America's ability to deliver  
an effective nuclear strike, if one is ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters are encouraged by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  
expressed willingness last month to renegotiate a landmark 1972 
arms-reduction treaty and signs that the Russian parliament may 
soon take up the START II treaty, a later nuclear-reduction pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Politically, the test-ban treaty has become linked with Russian  
action on those earlier treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	At the core of the dispute: the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile  
treaty. Conservatives don't like it because it prohibits 
development of a national missile defense system. Some consider the 
ABM treaty defunct since the Soviet Union no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Congress sent President Clinton a bill to commit the  
United States to such an anti-missile system, regardless of the ABM 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In another concession, the administration's top arms-control  
official, John Holum, told a Senate hearing the United States 
should go ahead with plans to build the system despite ABM 
prohibitions, suggesting it was in the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helms has shown little interest in such overtures, at least  
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Before moving on the test-ban treaty, Helms wants the  
administration to first submit to the Senate modifications in the 
ABM treaty agreed to three years ago by Clinton and Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says it will submit the modifications, but  
only after Russia ratifies START II. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also wants the administration to submit the climate treaty  
negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, even though it would 
likely be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms hasn't changed his mind, spokesman Marc Theissen said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to submit the ABM treaty (modifications) and  
Kyoto,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Helms refusing to schedule hearings, the only way the  
treaty could be pried from the committee would be for Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to bring it directly to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican Senate sources said Lott was not inclined to do  
so, particularly after criticism from conservatives two years ago 
for helping to win ratification of an also-controversial chemical 
weapons ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan conceded that getting Helms to change his mind, or  
persuading Lott to put the treaty on the Senate agenda, is no easy 
task. Furthermore, there's no guarantee the treaty -- which requires 
67 votes -- will be ratified. But it's still worth the effort, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has not conducted a full-fledged nuclear test  
since 1992, although it conducted tests on two nuclear devices in 
1997 using chemical, rather than nuclear, explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan conducted tests last year, China in 1996 and  
France in 1995-1996.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Bonds Out With Groin Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Francisco's Barry Bonds pulled up while  
running out a grounder and left Tuesday night's game against San 
Diego because of tightness in his right groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds began limping about halfway down the line, and, after  
touching first, clutched his groin in obvious pain. He was easily 
thrown out by second baseman Quilvio Veras. 
</P>
<P>
	After being tended to, Bonds was helped off the field by manager  
Dusty Baker and a trainer. The Giants said Bonds would be 
re-evaluated on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Bonds missed seven weeks after undergoing  
surgery on his left elbow. That was Bonds' first stay on the 
disabled list with the Giants and just the second of his career.

<HEADLINE> Rudy Tomjanovich To Miss Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- An exhausted Rudy Tomjanovich is still on course  
to coach the U.S. basketball team in the 2000 Olympics despite 
having to miss this month's qualifying tournament, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Rockets coach spent Friday and Saturday night in the  
hospital recovering from ``extreme physical exhaustion,'' said team 
physician Jim Muntz, who suggested the coach take a month off from 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown will replace Tomjanovich  
for the tournament in Puerto Rico on July 14-25, according to USA 
Basketball, the sport's national governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not been given any indication by USA Basketball that  
this will affect his status for 2000,'' Rockets spokesman Tim Frank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday night at the Rockets' training  
center in Houston, Tomjanovich looked healthy but dejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed and I'm going to do my best to recharge  
myself and get ready for the coming season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which begins training Tuesday, includes San  
Antonio's Tim Duncan and New York's Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which has won gold medals at the last two  
Olympics, must finish among the top two teams in the 10-team 
tournament to earn a berth in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really great honor and something I was looking forward  
to, but I've overworked myself and I find myself really physically 
and mentally exhausted,'' Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich led a team of CBA and college players to a bronze  
medal at last summer's world championships in Greece. That team 
exceeded expectations considering it didn't have NBA players 
because of the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, Purdue's Gene Keady and Kentucky's Tubby Smith were  
appointed assistants. Brown has worked on three USA Basketball 
coaching staffs.

</P>
<P>
	``You watch these guys all the time on TV,'' Brand said Tuesday  
after the U.S. national basketball team worked out for the first 
time in preparation for the Pre Olympic Qualifying Tournament of 
the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big adjustment playing on another level,'' the top pick  
in last week's NBA draft said. ``But I think I held my own for the 
first scrimmage. I wasn't dominated or anything, so I think I did 
all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is one of three college players selected by USA Basketball  
to play on the team that will spend seven days in Orlando before 
heading to Puerto Rico for the tournament next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Szczerbiak and Richard Hamilton were first-round draft  
picks, too, who figure to benefit from the experience of playing on 
the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're so lucky. Just being around these guys, being  
around the older players, the guys who have been through it before. 
It's going to be a tremendous advantage for them in adjusting to 
pro ball,'' said coach Larry Brown, who took over the team Monday 
after Rudy Tomjanovich withdrew for medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine what it must be like for Elton to be around  
Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett, or Richard Hamilton, as a guard, 
being around Steve Smith, Allan Houston, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd 
and Tim Hardaway. I'm going to try to get them to really spend a 
lot of time talking to the guys about what they need to do and what 
to expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, the most valuable player in the NCAA tournament Final  
Four as he helped Connecticut beat Brand and Duke in the national 
championship game, said there's no way to measure how much it means 
to be part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of college guys coming out don't get an opportunity like  
this. Sometimes you've got to wait 10 years until you play on the 
all-star team to get a chance to play with guys like this,'' 
Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn so much just by watching. ... One thing I do is ask  
the players questions. What do you do here? What do you do there? 
I'm trying to learn everything, trying to take little bits and 
pieces from everybody. I'm not going to be satisfied with my game, 
thinking I know everything because I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team will face Canada in an exhibition game Sunday at  
Orlando Arena, then travel to Puerto Rico where it will open the 
tournament against Uruguay on July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to come down to being unselfish, defending and  
rebounding. You can talk about all the Xs and Os you want,'' Brown 
said. ``With this kind of group, if we're unselfish and we defend 
and rebound, we'll find a way to win games.''

	Bin Laden May Be Receiving Donations  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, alleged mastermind of last  
year's U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa, has received millions of 
dollars from Saudi and Gulf businessmen to help reinvigorate his 
campaign against the United States, sources said today. The sources 
said bin Laden may have received more than $50 million before Saudi 
authorities uncovered the donations and stopped the transfers. 
Meanwhile, President Clinton has imposed financial sanctions 
against the Taliban religious militia that rules Afghanistan in 
retaliation for its reputed support of bin Laden.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The mercury climbed toward 100 again in the East  
for the third day in a row today as people returning to work after 
the holiday weekend changed out of their shorts and into their 
business wear. At least eight deaths were blamed on the heat. Heat 
advisories and warnings were posted from Illinois to the East Coast 
and from southern New England to North Carolina. Utilities urged 
customers to turn off unneeded appliances to conserve electricity

	BERLIN (AP) -- German authorities cleared the RU-486 abortion  
pill for sale today, ignoring last-minute protests by the Roman 
Catholic church. Sales of the pill had been blocked for years under 
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a Christian Democrat, but new 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said he welcomes giving women an 
alternative to surgical abortion. The pill, sold under the trade 
name Mifegyne, causes an abortion if taken within the first 49 days 
of pregnancy. In Europe, only Sweden and Britain had also allowed 
its sale up to now.

<HEADLINE> Expos Release Mel Rojas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Montreal Expos released Mel Rojas on Tuesday  
after their former closer decided he'd rather take the rest of the 
year off than try to regain his form in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas was designated for assignment last Friday after making  
just three appearances for Montreal, allowing five runs in 2 2-3 
innings. He was expected to go to Triple-A Ottawa but decided 
instead to return to his home in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas, 32, has not decided whether he will attempt a comeback  
next year. The right-hander has not been the same since leaving 
Montreal following the 1996 season. He saved 109 games in seven 
seasons for the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas signed a $13.75 million, three-year contract with the Cubs  
before 1997, but bombed in Chicago. He was traded to the Mets in 
August 1997 and sent to the Dodgers last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas began this season with Los Angeles and had a 12.60 ERA in  
five appearances with the Dodgers. He was traded to Detroit on 
April 17 and was released by the Tigers on May 3 after posting a 
22.74 ERA in five appearances. He gave up 11 runs in 1 2-3 innings 
against Seattle on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos then signed him to a minor league deal and called him  
up June 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal also signed 16-year-old outfielder Lorvin Leandro  
Louisa from Curacao.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks Up Jobs, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSDALE, Miss. (AP) -- With boarded-up buildings all around  
him, President Clinton walked down a main street here Tuesday, 
talking up jobs and investment that can breathe new life into this 
virtually forgotten town on the Mississippi Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	But the promise of jobs and a blossoming economy meant little to  
Flora Bell Clay, 61, disabled after a heart attack and needing help 
to keep her home inhabitable. Her income is too low to get loans, 
and local organizations didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't pay nothing when I ain't got nothing,'' Mrs. Clay  
said, waiting under a blazing sun to talk to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he hoped private money he is trying to  
leverage for places like Clarksdale can ultimately solve problems 
like Mrs. Clay's, from dilapidated housing to inferior schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just that there's not enough money in this area for  
good investment. Somebody has to decide it's a good investment,'' 
Clinton told about 600 people gathered in Waterfield Cabinets' hot, 
tin-roofed warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was announcing $46.5 million in community  
development grants, including $15 million for the Mississippi 
Delta, where, he said, the poverty and unemployment rates far 
exceed national averages. Later Tuesday, he was joining a Bank of 
America executive in East St. Louis, Ill., to outline a new $500 
million capital investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements were part of Clinton's four-day tour through  
poor communities from Appalachia to Los Angeles, highlighting what 
the administration is touting as the ``untapped markets'' in 
America's inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour also was calling attention to successful local  
projects. Waterfield Cabinets, for example, was opened with a 
secured loan from the Enterprise Corporation of the Delta, which 
provides capital and credit to small businesses that wouldn't 
qualify for conventional loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, accompanied by Rep. Benny Thompson, D-Miss., and  
Mayor Richard Webster, walked past the abandoned New Roxy Theater 
and the Pac Man game room to the corner of Issaquena Avenue and Dr. 
Martin Luther King Drive. A crowd cheered and chanted, ``Welcome, 
Bill,'' and, ``Don't mess with Bill.'' A large nightclub across the 
street, Club Champagne, sat shuttered and closed. 
</P>
<P>
	For an empowerment zone area, there was little economic  
activity. Some residents said $40 million in empowerment funds is 
not finding its way here, and wanted Clinton to know that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a sit-down meeting, not in this hot sun, so we can  
tell him the real issues that face the people in the Mississippi 
Delta,'' said Henry Bonner, 41, of nearby Mound Bayou. ``The 
playing field needs to be leveled. And the lending institutions are 
so racist it's a crying shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, accompanying the president  
along with some corporate leaders and Cabinet secretaries, said: 
``When you look at the market, it's not just race. These areas have 
been denied access to capital. Now it's the resources gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To a great extent, this is a money problem,'' Clinton said.  
``There is not an even distribution of access to capital. That is 
something we want to fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Calhoun, 47, from Montgomery Ala., whose Calhoun  
Enterprises owns the 14-store Calhoun Foods-Bigbear Supermarket 
chain in Alabama and Georgia, said his company had $81 million in 
revenue last year but only a $300,000 line of credit. To continue 
growing, opening stores in places like Clarksdale, he needs a $2 
million line of credit, said Calhoun, who was part of Clinton's 
entourage in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm back at a time where I need it just as bad as I did when I  
first started,'' Calhoun said, when he had to pay 22 percent 
interest to borrow money. ``I keep having to prove myself and I've 
been out here 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Bessant, a Bank of America vice president, committed $100  
million to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, 
which provided the grants Clinton announced Tuesday. Later in the 
day, she was announcing formation of a $500 million capital 
investment fund targeted at often-overlooked communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is real money to be made in these markets,'' Bessant  
said. ``We think we can be even more successful when we create 
markets that work in inner cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, was  
presenting a study that estimates inner-city residents possess $331 
billion in purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about charity,'' Cuomo said. ``It's about  
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksdale, Clinton ducked into a flower shop and talked with  
owner Shirley Fair and three other small-business owners. Then he 
greeted the crowd outside, eventually reaching Mrs. Clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she did grasp his hand and told him her dilemma, she  
didn't get her house fixed. ``I told him I need help bad. He never 
did say I could get help.''

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Measles Vaccinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Children exempted from measles vaccination  
because of religious or philosophical beliefs are 35 times more 
likely to get the disease than vaccinated children, federal 
researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are based on national measles data for school-aged  
children from 1985 to 1992 and appear in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	About 240,000 children are annually exempted from measles  
vaccines at the request of their parents, said researchers led by 
Daniel A. Salmon, a policy fellow at the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of measles cases among such children varied from a  
low of 22 in 1992 to a high of 838 in 1989, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, among the approximately 51 million children  
vaccinated annually, measles cases ranged from 458 to 3,787 over 
the same years, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine gives only 90 percent to 95 percent immunity, so  
some vaccinated children catch the disease. But exempted children 
were 35 times more likely to get the illness, researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Gets Lots of Ks, But No Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Seldom has a pitcher been as dominant as Randy  
Johnson has lately, with absolutely nothing to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Diamondbacks' ace has a 1.04 ERA, three complete  
games and 43 strikeouts his last three outings, and is 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Cardinals rookie Jose Jimenez beat him 1-0 with a  
no-hitter June 25. Ron Villone of the Cincinnati Reds didn't allow 
a hit for 6 2-3 innings and ended with a one-hitter in a 2-0 
decision June 30. And Jimenez beat him again with a two-hitter in 
another 1-0 heartbreaker on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks' $13.1 million left-hander struck out 14 in the  
Jimenez no-hitter, 17 in the Cincinnati loss and 12 more in the 
Jimenez rematch to reach 200 with half a season to go. All of them 
were complete games, during which he's lowered his ERA to a 
NL-leading 3.03. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's real, real good,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet he has a less than immortal 9-6 record because the  
Diamondbacks have scored zero runs and have only three hits in that 
span. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hats off to Randy,'' teammate Travis Lee said. ``He struck out  
the world, and we didn't give him any runs. You can't go up and say 
you're sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-luck times appear to be taking a toll. Johnson hid from  
the media in Cincinnati and he answered only four questions from TV 
reporters in St. Louis before fleeing for the trainer's room. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his last three outings are ``pretty self-explanatory. I  
don't need to really explain what I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he wasn't really frustrated, and there was ``no  
satisfaction'' in tying Dwight Gooden's 1984 NL record of striking 
out 43 batters in three straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	That his excellence has not been rewarded is one of baseball's  
vagaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen games where pitchers have pitched three or four  
great games in a row and have nothing to show for it, and I've seen 
pitchers who've not thrown real well and gotten four wins,'' 
Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter said. ``That's just the way it 
goes sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Andy Benes felt for his teammate.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know when I've been through it, it hasn't exactly been the  
funnest thing,'' Benes said. ``He's in charge of keeping the other 
team down and he's done that, but has nothing to show for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might be a bit galling that two of the more unsung Cardinals  
are responsible for two of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez spent almost all of last season at Double-A Arkansas and  
has an 8-8 career record and 5.28 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Howard, who had the lone RBI in each game, is a reserve  
with only 68 at-bats. But Howard also is 10-for-18 with runners in 
scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we were hoping was that we could just get one run and  
Jose could pitch the way he did in Arizona,'' Howard said. ``He 
beat Randy Johnson two times in a row, so you've got to say 
something about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't getting much sympathy from Jimenez, who has made a  
name for himself by standing up to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pitched a good game,'' Jimenez said. ``What can I say? He  
tried to do his job and I tried to do mine, and one of us had to 
lose.''

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmates Claim Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The message was scratched on a bench in a police  
lockup: ``Aaron. I lie about murders. Police threaten me with 
violence, slapped and suffocated me with plastic. No lawyers. No 
phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Death row inmate Aaron Patterson says that he carved those words  
in 1986 and that they back his claim that Chicago police punched 
him, brandished guns and suffocated him with a plastic typewriter 
cover to extract a false confession to the killings of an elderly 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Patterson's claim might have been dismissed.  
But a string of wrongful prosecutions in Illinois murder cases has 
raised troubling questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson's lawyers won a court order to photograph the bench  
and the message Patterson says he scratched with a paper clip found 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of 10 death row inmates who say their confessions were  
illegally coerced by since-fired police Cmdr. Jon Burge and his 
officers. Death penalty opponents are calling them the ``Jon Burge 
10'' and hope their names are added to a growing list of exonerated 
death row inmates in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen condemned men have been cleared in Illinois since the  
death penalty was reinstated in 1977. Many were exonerated by DNA 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson and the nine others lack such hard evidence. They are  
relying in part on a damning report from the Chicago Police 
Department's Office of Professional Standards that was released in 
1992, after all 10 were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The report led to Burge's firing. In it, investigators said they  
found systematic physical abuse of suspects by officers under 
Burge's command. All of the officers implicated are white, and all 
of the Jon Burge 10 are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the men say the police report should entitle them to  
a joint hearing so they can make their claims together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want it to be just my African-American client against  
six white police officers,'' said Andrea Lyon, a law professor at 
the University of Michigan representing death row inmate Madison 
Hobley. ``He can't win that battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Cunningham, an attorney for Ronald Kitchen, another of the  
10 death row inmates, said that by lumping the cases together, 
lawyers will be able to show a pattern of police abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitchen claims Burge and his officers beat and kicked him in the  
groin until he confessed to killing two women and three children in 
an alleged dispute over a drug debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Nolan, president of Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police,  
scoffed at the inmates' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys were all murderers,'' Nolan said. ``They were all  
guilty, and now they're looking for a way to get out of jail, so 
they're blaming Jon Burge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the confessions are ruled to have been coerced under torture  
or the threat of violence, they would be inadmissible in court. But 
if new trials are ordered, prosecutors could still use other 
evidence to win a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Wilson, whose case prompted the 1992 investigation that  
led to Burge's firing, got a new trial but was convicted again -- 
without the use of his confession -- in the 1982 killing of two 
Chicago police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the 10 death row inmates are asking the high court  
to grant an evidentiary hearing with hopes that a new trial will be 
granted or -- in a less likely possibility -- the cases dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine has said only that  
he is reviewing the cases linked to Burge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Ter Molen, an attorney for Verneal Jimerson -- an inmate  
freed from death row -- said winning reversals will be difficult 
since prosecutors and judges have already been embarrassed by the 
release of other death row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system hates to admit that it's made a mistake and will do  
whatever it can to avoid doing that,'' Ter Molen said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Prime Minister To Visit D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin is due  
in Washington at the end of July to talk with Vice President Al 
Gore, to take a close look at major American corporations and 
possibly to pocket a fat loan from the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 27 visit will be Stepashin's first as prime minister  
and will mark the first meeting in a year of the U.S.-Russian Joint 
Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting may last only a few hours. Only a few of the  
commission's 10 committees may be ready to grapple with such items 
as business development, energy, health, environment, science and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin is likely to meet with President Clinton while he is  
in the capital, however. And with Russia's economy reeling, the IMF 
is ready to approve $4.5 billion in new loans, beginning with an 
initial $630 million. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Monday that Russia  
is meeting conditions laid down by the IMF. An IMF delegation went 
to Moscow last week and praised Russia's latest economic moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian parliament has approved fiscal consolidation, tax  
laws and changes in the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF board here is waiting for completion of an audit of  
foreign exchange operations Russian's Central Bank carried out with 
a foreign financial institution called FIMACO. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, who has talked with Gore several times by telephone,  
plans to bring government economic specialists with him for talks 
with leaders of American corporations, Gore's office said Tuesday 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister is expected to stop July 25 in Seattle to  
meet with officials of Microsoft Corp. and Boeing Co., then travel 
to Detroit July 26 to see officials of Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants reported last weekend  
that first-quarter foreign investment in Russia slumped 40 percent 
this year compared with 1998. He promised changes to attract 
investors unnerved by Russia's financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Total foreign investment in Russia was $1.5 billion in  
January-March, down from $2.5 billion in the corresponding period 
last year. Direct investment totaled $600 million, down 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was on his way here in  
March for a commission meeting when he turned around his jet and 
went home rather than be in Washington for the announcement that 
NATO warplanes had begun bombing Yugoslavia to force a settlement 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the commission was useful in helping the two sides to  
``expand our areas of agreement and open channels we can draw on 
during periods of disagreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia objected to the NATO assault but helped arrange a  
settlement that removed all Serb troops and special police from the 
province. Russian troops are serving as peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	A minicrisis erupted when 200 Russian troops were rushed to  
Pristina, the Kosovo provincial capital, without notice to 
Washington and remained there even after Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov assured Secretary of State Madeleine Albright they would be 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	At a summit meeting in Germany, however, Clinton concluded  
agreements with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on several fronts, 
including approval of the administration's program to build an 
antimissile defense, and Russian troops are now being blended in 
with NATO peacekeeping forces.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Attend Women's Title Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) -- President Clinton decided Tuesday to  
extend his seven-state trip across the country through the weekend 
so he can attend the women's World Cup soccer championship in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The undefeated American team faces China in the championship at  
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attend a quarterfinal game last week outside Washington  
as the U.S. team defeated Germany to advance to the semifinals. The 
U.S. women defeated Brazil on Sunday to move to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the women's team  
had invited the president. ``I think, like all Americans, he's been 
caught up in their success and wants to be there personally to 
cheer them on,'' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Penagon Undergoing Major Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- In a blocked-off sector of the Pentagon,  
hidden from view, hordes of workers are toiling on a major 
Department of Defense initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it a top-secret military operation? No.  
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old Pentagon is being renovated.  
</P>
<P>
	Before work began last year, no major renovations had been done  
on the Pentagon since it was completed in 16 months on Jan. 15, 
1943. The building, a national landmark, is showing its age. Rusty 
water pipes occasionally burst. Old electrical wires fry and 
short-circuit. Lead paint chips fall from windows. Asbestos tiles 
cover many floors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You name a safety code, the Pentagon doesn't meet it,'' said  
Tom Fontana, a spokesman for the Pentagon Renovation Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The renovation costs are expected to reach $1.2 billion. That  
tab could soar to $3.4 billion when the price of relocating 
employees and building temporary offices is added. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything -- from the plumbing and air conditioning to the  
bathrooms and medical clinic -- is being rebuilt, overhauled or 
rewired. The entire 29-acre building will be gutted and rebuilt 
from the basement up. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 million pounds of debris will be removed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing will remain but the skeleton of the building,''  
Fontana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its rapid construction was a marvel of the World War II  
era, the hasty work is partly to blame for the building's problems. 
The work was done so quickly that many floor plans were lost in the 
rush. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, new electrical and computer wires were placed  
over old, resulting in confusing jumbles of cable spaghetti. As the 
number of employees grew to about 25,000, workers were crammed into 
basement offices and anywhere else space could be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Before work began, three other buildings were fixed up as  
temporary offices for the 5,000 workers who will be relocated 
during each renovation phase. High-security items were moved into 
new locations to allow national security operations to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Col. Robert Kirsch, who heads the effort to overhaul the  
Pentagon's telecommunications system, said extra work is being done 
so future projects will be easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make this work stand for the next 50 years,''  
Kirsch said.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Mixed; Gold Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was mixed against other major  
currencies in European trading today after briefly rising to a new 
high against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell to a new 20-year low after the Bank of England began  
the first in a series of major sales from its stockpile of the 
metal. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0217 in late European trading after  
touching an all-time low of $1.0184 during trading, down from 
$1.0224 Monday. Later in afternoon trading in New York, the euro 
traded at $1.0241. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was battered as Germany reported worse-than-expected  
unemployment figures and amid rumors, later denied, that the French 
government was thinking about increasing its deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,  
included 122.21 Japanese yen, down from 122.26; 1.5687 Swiss 
francs, down from 1.5692; and 1.4677 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4628. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.5688, down from $1.5746.  
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading in New York, the dollar bought 122.05 yen,  
and the pound was worth $1.5635. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates in Europe, the dollar is worth 1.9143 German marks, up from 
1.9130, 6.4203 French francs, up from 6.4159, 2.1569 Dutch 
guilders, up from 2.1554, 1,895.15 Italian lire, up from 1,893.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $256.10 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$261.90 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich, the bid price was $257.25, down from $262.25 Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell $1.50 in Hong Kong to $261.35.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver closed in London at $5.15 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$5.25.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Boat Crash Death Toll at Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- Rescuers have called off the search for  
victims of a weekend boat collision on the St. Croix River after 
finding the bodies of the five people known to be missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boats apparently were traveling toward Hudson, Wis.,  
when they collided shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday. They reportedly 
had left an access area near P.D. Pappy's, a popular bar and 
restaurant in Stillwater, before colliding a few miles downriver. 
</P>
<P>
	George Black, a member of the National Transportation Safety  
Board, said investigators expect to have a report in six to eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned with liability or criminal prosecution,''  
Black said Monday. ``We're concerned about why it happened and 
making sure it doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington County Sheriff Jim Frank said it remained unclear how  
many people were aboard the two pleasure boats. One sank and was 
recovered the next day. Witnesses said they had seen five or six 
people on that boat before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frank said it was a waste of resources to search a muddy  
river for people who hadn't been reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know who to search for even if there's someone out  
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bodies were found Monday. Diver Ken Gilliam spent about 30  
hours in the water, sifting through up to 2 feet of silt for 
victims and debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's black,'' he said. ``You end up swimming with your eyes  
shut. It kind of makes you forget.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees outfielder Shane Spencer  
remained hospitalized Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical 
Center where he is undergoing heart tests.

	Spencer, who left Friday night's game against Baltimore with  
dizziness after striking out in the sixth inning, had started 17 of 
the last 18 games before the incident. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gold at 20-Year Lows; Crude Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures plummeted Tuesday on the Chicago Board  
of Trade as weather conditions remained ideal for producing bumper 
fall harvests, a scenario that would swell already ample 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, gold tumbled to 20-year lows after Britain  
sold gold at below-market prices. Crude topped $20 a barrel for the 
first time in 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans posted new life-of-contract lows, with corn  
falling to its lowest in nearly 12 years, as investors bet that 
rainfall across the Midwest would relieve crops that had baked 
under blistering heat over the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across Illinois and Iowa -- the two largest corn and  
soybean growing states -- are expected to rise once more later this 
week, but forecasters said it was unlikely they would rise into the 
90s. The National Weather Service on Monday called for above-normal 
rainfall and below-normal Midwestern temperatures through mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops are particularly vulnerable to high heat and low  
moisture during the month of July, a period when they are in the 
crucial pollination stage in which kernel begin to form. Soybeans 
enter their crucial flowering stage later this month and into 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported after trading had ended that a  
remarkable 77 percent of the nation's corn crop was in good or 
excellent condition; 71 percent of the soybean crop had the same 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said unless an early frost decimates production, crop  
size could exceed current government forecasts for record soybeans 
and the fourth-largest corn crop in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for December delivery, accounting for prices after the  
harvest, fell 7 3/4 cents to $2.04 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans 
tumbled 18 3/4 cents to $4.21 1/2 a bushel, while prices for immediate 
delivery tumbled to their lowest since November 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold posted new 20-years lows on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after Britain kicked off the first of its planned sales of 
more than half its reserves with an auction that failed to meet 
market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Treasury said it was selling gold to buy U.S.  
dollars, Japanese yen and the European Union's new euro currency to 
create a more balanced cash reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold has been on the general retreat since early 1996, when  
central banks began selling part of their holdings in favor of more 
speculative, but better-returning investments such as stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain plans to slash its 715 metric-ton stockpile to just 300  
metric tons in coming months. Switzerland next year also hopes to 
sell part of its stockpile, joining Australia, Belgium, Canada and 
others in making sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for August delivery fell $6.80, or 2.6 percent, to $257.80  
an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the biggest 
one-day decline in nearly two years and the lowest settlement price 
since May 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures surged above $20 a barrel before settling  
slightly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange as investor bet 
world oil producers are making good on promises to slash output. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries, which includes some of the world's largest oil 
producers, continue to keep supplies off the market in coming 
months to maintain higher prices, according to recent reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude futures and spot prices have rallied as weekly inventory  
data continues to show tightening supplies. Analysts say spot 
shortages could begin to manifest themselves around the world by 
September if the output cuts hold. 
</P>
<P>
	August crude rose 9 cents to $19.78 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Motive Sought in Shooting Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMETTE, Ill. (AP) -- He grew up in an affluent suburb, a world  
of country clubs, comfortable houses and luxury cars. He was a 
doctor's son who joined the creative writing club in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith as a clean-cut kid whose  
family has a swimming pool in its back yard, as well as a private 
tennis court and a basketball hoop in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet behind the trim lawns, beyond the leafy streets and ordered  
lives, Smith raged, acquaintances say, developing a hate he would 
direct mostly at non-whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to harbor intense anger, but not of a physical  
nature,'' said Tyrese Alexander, 23, a neighbor of Smith's in 
Bloomington, Ind., where both attended Indiana University. ``He 
seemed mad at the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe that anger exploded into a weekend shooting  
spree across two states that left two people dead and at least 
eight wounded. Smith fatally shot himself Sunday night during a 
police chase. Dead at 21. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the rampage ended, neighbors and friends were  
struggling to reconcile the apparent contradictions of a promising 
young man and a gunman who killed a black man in front of his 
children and an Asian man on his way to church. 
</P>
<P>
	There were hints that Smith harbored a coiled anger. There was  
his 1996 high school yearbook, where his entry carried the slogan 
``Sic Semper Tyrannis'' -- or ``Thus ever to tyrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are said to be the words John Wilkes Booth spoke after  
shooting President Lincoln, and the phrase on a T-shirt worn by 
Timothy McVeigh the day he bombed the federal building in Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also the dark fears of Smith's friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew one day something like this would happen,'' said  
Elizabeth Sahr, 21, a University of Illinois student who dated 
Smith for a year in 1997. She said she ended their relationship 
because Smith spouted racism and abused her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something clicked and I realized that I had to get away or I  
would be dead,'' she said in a telephone interview Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	White-hot hatred seems out of place in the comfortable lakefront  
neighborhood where Smith grew up, three blocks from the lush 
fairways of exclusive, blue-blooded Indian Hill Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the eldest son of a doctor and real estate agent. He  
attended New Trier High School, one of the elite public schools in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Cooper, 53, a land developer and former newscaster who  
bought the family's Wilmette home, said he saw nothing 
extraordinary about Smith's parents, Kenneth and Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Murray, 47, a real estate consultant who lives across the  
street, said the doctor initially seemed ``very withdrawn'' but 
that ``as time went on he became more outgoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the family moved to nearby Northfield about two years  
ago, their Wilmette neighbors recall them as active, if not 
terribly social. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Smith was elected to the Wilmette Village Board and one  
neighbor, Sid Condit, 61, an attorney, said she was ``a wonderful 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She was Soccer Mom 101,'' Condit said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Smiths, who have two younger sons, have declined to talk to  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're totally shocked and devastated,'' Condit  
said. ``They're probably in church praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How and why did Benjamin change into the youth with the  
sometimes-shaved head and the words ``Sabbath Breaker'' tattooed on 
his chest? One clue may come from Smith himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing in a white supremacist newsletter filled with racial and  
religious slurs, he said ``my genesis of racial awakening began in 
eighth grade'' when studying the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire course was made to instill a strong and lasting  
sense of white guilt,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's brushes with the law began in October 1997, when  
University of Illinois records show he was reprimanded for 
marijuana possession and for fighting in his room, including one 
report of domestic violence against a female student. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, he was put on ``conduct probation,'' according  
to university records. He also agreed to attend counseling, an 
ethics class and to do community service, said Bill Murphy, a 
university spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith began that process but got into more trouble for putting  
up racist posters in his dorm and eventually was called back into 
the dean of student's office for allegedly peeping in dorm windows 
and carrying unspecified weapons, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	He withdrew the next day, Feb. 14, 1998, ``because he was going  
to be expelled,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith in May completed his sophomore year at Indiana University  
as a criminal justice major. Before the angry young man left 
Illinois, Murphy said, he put a notation on his transcript. He 
didn't know if officials at the new school had seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, he said, ``a red flag for anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Wind Storms Strike Minn., Ariz. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELY, Minn. (AP) -- Severe wind and heavy rain swept through the  
woods of northern Minnesota, injuring at least 19 people and 
sending rescuers on a campground-by-campground search for more 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a large number of folks that are still out in the  
wilderness, and we are sending additional people out to find 
them,'' Mark Van Every of the U.S. Forest Service office in Duluth 
said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers airlifted the injured campers out of the Boundary  
Waters Canoe Area following Sunday's storms. One person was in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's search, using six airplanes and two helicopters, was  
directed at a region of 250,000 acres, about one-quarter of the 
huge preserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Every said most were injured by trees downed by wind clocked  
at 80 mph. The storms caused a swath of destruction three miles 
wide and 30 miles long. 
</P>

	``It's changed the face of the wilderness,'' said Roger Skraba,

	Storms also rolled from Minnesota across Lake Superior to  
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where wind up to 60 mph knocked down 
trees and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 40 percent of the 22,000 residents of Marquette were

<P>
	Wind of 63 mph was reported at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near  
Tucson.

<P>
	At least two trees and two houses were struck by lightning in  
Tucson, the roofs of three houses were torn off and power lines 
fell at different points throughout the city, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 4.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower in late trading today as  
optimism about second-quarter earnings gave way to selling by 
investors eager to reap gains from last week's stunning gains. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 4.12 at 11,135.12. Earlier in the session, the 
blue-chip index had risen 97.52 points above Friday's record close 
of 11,139.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower after a late selloff.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.09 to 1,388.13, and the  
Nasdaq composite index fell 4.50 to 2,736.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,609 down, 1,463 up and 489 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 718.47 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
583.75 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.35 to 654.77, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.47 to 804.89. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.92 to 457.43.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks faltered as weakness in the bond market and a desire to  
lock in profits outweighed the strong outlook for second-quarter 
profits. Traders wanted to cash in on gains that included a 
586.68-point advance in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped, pushing the  
yield to 6.04 percent, up from 6.0 percent late Friday. Traders 
consider bond yields above 6.0 percent a threat to stocks, partly 
because at that level, they might present an attractive alternative 
to volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse  
First Boston, said the higher interest rates implemented by the 
Federal Reserve last Wednesday set the stage for a market drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The equity market is substantially overvalued for a rising  
interest-rate environment,'' she said. ``The small new highs are 
generally not sustainable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With interest rates set for now, analysts said investors have  
turned their focus to corporate earnings. Internet search engine 
provider Yahoo! rose in advance of its second-quarter earnings 
report, due Wednesday. Many analysts expect a strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for equities at State  
Street Research and Management Co. in Boston, said that while 
positive earnings forecasts have generated excitement in the 
market, the high valuations of most stocks could create a punishing 
environment for companies that fare poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a very skittish state,'' he said. ``There's no room  
for disappointment, and great potential for volatility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable reports on Intel fed excitement in the Nasdaq market.  
Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Prudential Securities raised their 
ratings on Intel stock, saying the semiconductor maker is 
successfully managing stiff price competition. Intel rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Internet companies rose on announcements of new  
ventures. AOL and drkoop.com both got a boost from a deal that 
makes drkoop.com the primary provider of health information to AOL 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were mostly higher as the price of crude oil topped  
$20 a barrel for the first time since November 1997. Chevron, a Dow 
component, rose. TotalFina SA's unsolicited takeover bid for Elf 
Aquitaine also helped boost the sector, as Elf soared. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, Prudential's famously bullish technical analyst,  
said in a research note today the Dow could hit 13,000 during 1999. 
Acampora's most conservative estimate for the year is in the range 
of 12,000 to 12,3000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be aggressive because we believe that this summer season will  
be a very exciting and bullish affair,'' Acampora said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Charge Boeing With Interfering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department filed three complaints  
Tuesday alleging the Boeing Co. interfered with the agency's 
efforts to enforce affirmative action and nondiscrimination 
requirements on federal contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints allege the Seattle-based aircraft maker and  
defense contractor denied federal inspectors access to records and 
facilities in Seattle, Wichita, Kan., and Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said her agency ``must -- and is  
entitled to -- have reasonable access to the premises and records of 
companies which benefit from doing business with the federal 
government. Denying us that access cannot -- and will not -- be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials said the company is trying to be cooperative  
but called some of the government's requests ``unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has been and is cooperating with the agency in a  
number of ongoing audits and investigations and will continue to do 
so,'' said Boeing spokesman Peter Conte. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that Boeing has withheld data from the agency,  
it has done so based upon its good-faith belief that the request is 
either unreasonable or exceeds the scope of the Office of Federal 
Contracting Compliance Programs' authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department charges were filed with federal  
administrative law judges, who offer an avenue of recourse for 
government agencies outside the normal court system. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency contends that Boeing has disrupted its investigation  
of a class-action complaint alleging race discrimination filed by 
an employee of a commercial aircraft facility in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee is among black Boeing workers who filed a lawsuit  
contending they were treated with hostility and were passed over 
for promotions that went to less-qualified white workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two government complaints charge Boeing with failure  
to cooperate in routine compliance reviews at commercial aircraft 
and military space and defense facilities in Wichita and at a 
training facility in Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	With $11 billion in government business last year and 230,000  
workers nationwide, Boeing is the second-largest defense contractor 
after Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal contractors that interfere with nondiscrimination or  
affirmative action rules enforced by Labor's Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance Programs can have contracts canceled or be 
barred from doing future business with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Conte said Boeing officials hope the dispute can be resolved  
informally. ``If necessary, however, Boeing is prepared to defend 
its positions vigorously and believes it will ultimately prevail,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Detains Bosnian Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO troops today arrested a former  
Bosnian Serb Cabinet minister on war crimes charges and were taking 
him to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Radoslav Brdjanin, the most senior Bosnian Serb civilian  
official yet to be arrested and transferred to the tribunal, faces 
a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in a statement that  
the detention of Brdjanin, now a lawmaker in the Bosnian Serb 
assembly, ``will contribute to the continued consolidation of the 
peace in Bosnia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brdjanin served as minister of urbanization in the wartime  
Bosnian Serb government of Radovan Karadzic, who was also indicted 
for war crimes but has not been captured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, NATO issued a statement saying  
Brdjanin was charged with crimes against humanity for instigating 
the forcible removal of Muslims and Croats from the Banja Luka 
area, the practice that became known as ``ethnic cleansing,'' 
between April and December 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his arrest by British troops in northwest Bosnia, the  
U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo advised Americans to avoid the Banja Luka 
area and ``limit their exposure'' elsewhere in the Bosnian Serb 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO-led Stabilization Force, or SFOR, has a mandate in  
Bosnia to detain officials indicted for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry of urbanization was believed responsible for the  
destruction of mosques in areas from which Bosnian Muslims were 
purged by Serbs during the 1992-1995 war. 
</P>
<P>
	Brdjanin heads a small party in the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia  
that has two seats in the Bosnian Serb assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Another party, the Serb Party of Independent Social Democrats of  
pro-Western Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, protested the action and 
said arrests ``under sealed indictments endanger'' public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, has  
issued indictments for offenses allegedly committed during ethnic 
conflicts throughout the former Yugoslavia, including one against 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the indictments, however, are kept secret until an  
arrest is made in order to prevent the accused from fleeing.

<HEADLINE> VW Considers New Convertible Beetle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Little more than a year after unveiling its hot  
New Beetle, Volkswagen is already thinking of changing it -- by 
cutting off the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Buechelhofer, board member in charge of sales and  
marketing, said the company is considering offering a convertible 
version of its retooled classic, although he wouldn't say when. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand is emerging,'' he told journalists Monday night in  
Sweden, where VW was presenting a new model of its Lupo subcompact. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, demand is already evident in the United States, where  
the New Beetle hardtop debuted with great fanfare, tapping into 
strong baby-boomer nostalgia for the popular 1960s ``people's 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auto customizers in California report strong sales for their own  
topless versions of the VW ``Bug'' -- even with price tags that 
boost the cost by about 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen had previously said it didn't need a convertible  
because it was still struggling to meet demand for the hardtop 
model. All of the New Beetles are made at a single factory in 
Puebla, Mexico, which VW officials say is running at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Beetle helped push VW's North American sales up 45  
percent in the first half of this year, compared to 1998. It also 
caught the attention of rival automakers Ford and DaimlerChrysler, 
who have hired away the retro-styled car's co-designers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40,000 Beetles were sold in the car's first six months on  
the U.S. market last year, with a base price of $15,200. 
</P>
<P>
	A ragtop version of the New Beetle could also help spur European  
sales, which started out slower than in the United States, 
apparently because of the higher price. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechelhofer said about 25,000 to 30,000 New Beetles were sold  
in Germany in the first six months of 1999, at a somewhat higher 
base price of about $18,500. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not rule out the possibility, reported earlier, that VW  
could also introduce a pared-down, cheaper version of the New 
Beetle in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Silverado Exec Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Michael Wise, the former head of Silverado Banking  
savings and loan, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in federal prison 
Tuesday after pleading guilty to stealing $8.7 million from 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise, who built Silverado from a suburban savings and loan into  
a $2 billion thrift before it collapsed, pleaded guilty to two 
violations of the federal wire-fraud law for his schemes involving 
his Aspen-based Cornerstone Private Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise clasped his hands as the judge also ordered him to repay  
the money he stole from 38 investors who invested in his Aspen-area 
mortgage brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Walker Miller turned down requests from  
defense attorney Gary Lozow for a lighter sentence, saying Wise 
tried to avoid responsibility for his crimes until the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities claimed Silverado executives went on a  
lending binge that led to the thrift's collapse in 1988 during the 
national savings-and-loan crisis. The Silverado case became 
well-known because one of the institution's directors was former 
President Bush's son, Neil. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse cost taxpayers $1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	In February 1993, after prosecutors spent four years assembling  
their case, Wise was acquitted of charges that he used nearly 
$500,000 of a loan from the thrift for personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal thrift regulators banned Wise and other Silverado  
executives from the banking industry for life and imposed mild 
restrictions on Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise then moved to Aspen, where he set up the investment firm.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors were alerted to the thefts in August last year when a  
woman tried to change an address and no records were found. Wise 
initially told board members he had borrowed $450,000, but later 
admitted it was more than $8 million and said he couldn't repay the 
money.

	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars have signed left wing Juha Lind  
to a two-year contract and right wing Blake Sloan to a one-year 
deal. No terms were announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Fall in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Tuesday's auction, with rates on six-month bills 
dropping to the lowest level in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.59 percent, down from 4.75 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.59 percent, down from 4.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since June 7, when the bills  
sold for 4.51 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since May 
24, when the rate was 4.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.72 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,884.00 and 4.776 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,768.00. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 5.11 
percent last week from 5.14 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Improvises in Commercial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tiger Woods was killing time, doing trick moves  
with a golf ball during the making of a Nike commercial last month. 
The result: an entirely different ad that will surely add to his 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
	As originally conceived, the ad was to have featured Woods and a  
dozen or so people swinging in sequence at a driving range in 
Orlando, Fla. But Woods had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people were dying in the heat out there,'' he said. ``I  
said, `You know what? I'm just going to try to entertain them.' So, 
I went over there and just started juggling the ball and doing 
weird stuff, and they were entertained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So was the director. Woods was captured on tape bouncing the  
ball off his wedge for 28 seconds, then taking a full swing as the 
ball was in the air. He made tremendous contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not as hard as you might think if you grew up  
playing baseball,'' Woods said. ``Hand-to-eye coordination -- same 
principle.''

<HEADLINE> LendingTree on Web's Cutting Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Doug Lebda had everything in order before  
applying for a mortgage. He made a good living as a 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers executive and his credit record was 
impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it took him several weeks to nail down the best mortgage  
rate and months before he finally closed on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have driven onto a car dealer's lot and got a loan for  
the same amount of money as my mortgage and driven away in a new 
car the same day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Lebda, 29, came up with the idea to start an online  
business that encourages lenders to bid for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of going to one lender, why not let several of them  
compete for my business?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the premise behind LendingTree, an Internet venture that  
encourages consumers to browse its site for the best deals on 
mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and more. 
</P>
<P>
	LendingTree doesn't underwrite loans. Instead, it prequalifies  
borrowers for lenders. For consumers, it offers a unique chance to 
have lenders compete for their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize how much of a seminal change this was for  
banks,'' Lebda said. 
</P>
<P>
	LendingTree (www.lendingtree.com) is far from alone in the  
fledgling online mortgage industry. Some of the other players are 
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), GetSmart (www.getsmart.com), Microsoft's 
HomeAdvisor (www.homeadvisor.com) and iOwn (www.iOwn.com). 
</P>
<P>
	Since LendingTree's Web site went up in February 1998, its  
network has grown to nearly 50 lenders. LendingTree is trying to 
recruit even more. 
</P>
<P>
	In its early days, the site would receive about 15 visits a day.  
Today, it gets hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebda declined to discuss financial details about the  
privately-held company. But in one recent month, Lebda said, the 
site took in 1,000 loan applications valued at $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending Tree makes its money by charging lenders a small fee for  
each loan application they receive. 
</P>
<P>
	If a loan closes, LendingTree gets a second payment, ranging  
from several hundred dollars for a mortgage to a fraction of that 
amount for an approved credit card application, Lebda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebda said both consumers and lenders save time and money by  
using the service. For lenders, the loan origination process can be 
shortened, and they can draw potential customers from a larger 
geographical area. 
</P>
<P>
	For borrowers, he said, it's a timesaving convenience and also  
can result in lower credit costs because of increased competition 
among lenders for a customer's business. 
</P>
<P>
	While savings are possible online, Keith Gumbinger, vice  
president of HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., mortgage research 
firm, cautions that many local lenders offer better deals than 
those available from Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suggests that borrowers try to learn something about an  
online lender and how their privacy will be protected before 
providing sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular part of the LendingTree site is its mortgage  
business, and that puts the company in a good position for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the online mortgage industry captures less than 2  
percent of the nation's $1.3 trillion mortgage market, but that 
should grow to nearly 10 percent of the market by 2003, according 
to James Punishill of Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Punishill said LendingTree has the most compelling business  
model of them all. ``The tough part is getting their message to 
consumers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have always done this one way, and this requires a  
behavioral change. In the old world, you'd pick up the newspaper 
and see a bunch of rates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When visitors log on to the LendingTree Web site, they are not  
bombarded with promotions about rates. Instead, they are asked to 
fill out an application and wait for lenders to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	It usually doesn't take long. The typical mortgage applicant  
hears back in two days or less. It often takes only a few hours for 
an applicant to get responses from four lenders, Lebda said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew from the start that this would work because consumers  
really hate getting loans,'' he said. ``The market is huge, and 
it's perfect for e-commerce. It's not like a sweater that you want 
to try on before you buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make it work, LendingTree has been signing on some of the  
country's top financial institutions, including CitiBank, Chase 
Manhattan, Bank One and The Money Store. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also works with Snap, Priceline.com and Wachovia in  
different deals that allow those companies to use LendingTree's 
technology for their own online ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	LendingTree employs about 70 people at its Charlotte  
headquarters, which resembles a call center. Employees sit in front 
of computer terminals, answering questions from consumers and 
lenders.

<HEADLINE> Japan Mets-Cardinals Series Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals  
are the leading candidates for a possible season-opening series in 
Tokyo next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the commissioner's office and the players'  
association were in Tokyo last week to discuss the unprecedented 
trip. They are expected to attempt to finalize details within a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``In concept, we certainly would support the exposure of major  
league baseball internationally,'' Cardinals president Mark Lamping 
said Tuesday. ``I guess what they're trying to do is evaluate all 
aspects of the trip. Until such times as those details are made 
available to the teams, it's difficult to come to a position on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While nothing has been determined, the Mets and the Cardinals  
are the No. 1 choices for the two-game series, several officials 
with knowledge of the talks told The Associated Press on the 
condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely against it,'' said the Cardinals' Mark McGwire,  
who would be the game's top attraction. ``Major league baseball 
belongs in the United States. The Japanese have Japanese baseball, 
so there's no reason for us to go over there. I have nothing 
against the way they play baseball. It's not the travel. As a 
player, I just don't like it. The game belongs here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Mets and-or Cardinals decline, there are two or three  
additional teams on baseball's short list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a nice long road trip, that's for sure,'' Mets  
closer John Franco said. ``It should be nice though. I've been 
there twice before and I enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Howard, the Mets' senior vice president of business and  
legal affairs, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always open to international opportunities,'' New York  
general manager Steve Phillips said. ``We have been aggressive in 
terms of getting international players and in terms of marketing. 
Certainly it is in line with what we are trying to do. As far as 
the specifics, I can't comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamping said he had heard that the Cardinals and Mets were at  
the top of the list for the games but said he had not spoken yet 
with any of the officials who were in Japan for the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 season is set to start on Sunday night, April 2, or  
Monday, April 3. The games at the Tokyo Dome probably would be the 
previous Tuesday and Wednesday, or on Wednesday and Thursday, and 
the teams involved wouldn't resume regular-season games until the 
following Tuesday or Wednesday to give them time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo is 7,392 miles from West Palm Beach, Fla., the nearest  
major airport from the Mets' and Cardinals' spring training camps, 
and 14 time zones away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if it is done properly and we are given an appropriate  
amount of rest both before we go and after we get back, it would be 
good for the game,'' Mets pitcher Al Leiter said. ``It would give 
baseball great exposure and it would be a great experience for the 
guys who haven't been there before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some, the mileage is too much.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do enough traveling as it is,'' said Cardinals pitcher  
Lance Painter, who went to Taiwan as a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets and Cardinals aren't set to open against each other,  
according to the draft schedule prepared by the National League, so 
there would have to be some switching to fit in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the regular-season games, there also might be two  
or three exhibition games against Japanese clubs during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans are the same,'' Leiter said. ``The only difference is  
that you don't understand what they are yelling at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamping said that if the Cardinals are asked, he would have to  
talk to others in the organization before deciding whether St. 
Louis wanted to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we would certainly need to solicit the opinion of  
our players and staff,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regular-season major league games have never been played outside  
North America. In 1997, the New York Mets and San Diego Padres met 
in the first regular-season games outside the United States and 
Canada, playing three times at Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first season opener outside the United States and Canada,  
the Padres played the Colorado Rockies this year at Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Mariners, whose majority owner is Hiroshi Yamauchi,  
chairman of the Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan, proposed 
starting the 1995 season in Japan, but that idea was scuttled by 
the 1994-95 strike. The Mariners were the first choice for next 
year's opener, but declined in order to start the season at home in 
their new stadium.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise a Bit; Dow up 3.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened slightly higher today, with  
technology stocks extending their gains and outpacing the blue-chip 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 3.80 at 11,143.04, reversing early losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 0.19 at 1,391.03, and the Nasdaq composite index, 
which has a high representation of high-tech issues, was up 21.46 
at 2,762.48. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long weekend in observance of Independence Day, Wall  
Street traders returned to markets that were at record levels. On 
Friday, the Dow rose 72.82 to close at 11,139.24, easily topping 
its previous record close of 11,107.19, set May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, the Dow rose 5.56 percent or 586.68 points, the  
biggest weekly point gain in its 103-year history. The S&AMP;P 500 and 
the Nasdaq also hit new records. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were undoubtedly taking some profits from  
the week's stunning gains. Also, with little news to move the stock 
market, the bond market set a slightly negative tone today. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell, sending the yield  
up to 6.07 percent from 6.0 percent late Friday. Traders consider 
bond yields above 6.0 percent a threat to stocks, partially because 
at that level, they may present an attractive alternative to 
volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable reports on Intel fed excitement in the Nasdaq market.  
Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Prudential Securities raised their 
ratings on Intel stock, saying the semiconductor maker is 
successfully managing stiff price competition. Intel rose 2 1/16 to 
65 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues and decliners were narrowly mixed on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 92.7 million shares, well 
ahead of Friday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.48 at 655.60, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.39 at 804.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.47 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.3 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gamblers Wary of Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Lem Banker once picked the winner in 13  
straight Super Bowls and has bet on almost every sport ever played. 
When asked to pick a side in the women's World Cup final, though, 
he didn't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think the Chinese will steal any of our secret plays?''  
Banker asked, only partly in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the young girls who scream for their favorite players and  
the fans who will fill the Rose Bowl on Saturday, those who make a 
living betting on sports aren't quite sure what to make of the 
World Cup final between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, wagering on the biggest woman's soccer game  
ever played will probably draw only about the same amount of money 
as a weekday baseball game might in the sports books that line the 
Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a long way from a Super Bowl,'' said Pete  
Korner, who sets odds for Las Vegas sports books. ``Compared to 
mainstream sports, the betting is not much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the city's legal sports books are offering bets on the  
game, with most making the United States about an 8-5 favorite to 
beat China and win the World Cup. Norway is about a 2-1 favorite to 
beat Brazil for third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the wise guys aren't likely to be putting down wagers,  
the game is attracting attention among small bettors who like to 
have a little something riding on a game they plan to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of women are coming by asking about it, and some of  
them are betting $10 or $20 on the game,'' said Jay Kornegay, 
manager of the Imperial Palace sports book. ``But the real bettors 
have no idea. I couldn't name one player on the Chinese team and 
its hard to bet on something when you can't name a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Betting on the Women's World Cup was almost nonexistent until  
the semifinals because the U.S. team was such a prohibitive 
favorite that bettors would have had to wager $10 to win $1 on its 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Caesars Palace, though, betting was good on the semifinals,  
which were shown on the main big screen television in the casino's 
lavish and sprawling sports book. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the United States beat Brazil the other day, the book was  
full,'' said Vinny Magliulo, sports book manager Caesars Palace. 
``Baseball took a back seat to our girls that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magliulo said he plans to show the final on the same screen  
Saturday, and expects plenty of small bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of it is the casual patriotic support but there have been  
some four-figure wagers on the ladies,'' he said. ``Personally, I 
think the games are very exciting. These girls have done a great 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korner, oddsmaker for Las Vegas Sports Consultants, said  
gamblers who might wager $50,000 or $100,000 at a time will stay 
away from the game because they don't know the sport or the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Korner noted that the World Cup teams don't have a long history  
of statistics and have played very few actual games, making it 
difficult to handicap a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a token play just for the interest of a bet, if that,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what Banker, a longtime sports bettor plans to  
do with the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a patriotic kind of guy so I might make a little wager,  
nothing serious,'' Banker said. ``But my heart is with the USA. 
I'll be rooting for the girls.''

<HEADLINE> China Soccer Star Has Many Talents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- She writes poetry, studies Chinese  
literature, and sings a soulful ``Candle in the Wind.'' This 
weekend, Sun Wen will be center stage for another of her talents. 
</P>
<P>
	With millions of people in the United States and even more in  
her native country watching on television, Sun will lead China in 
the World Cup championship game against the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The university student from Shanghai, a magician with a soccer  
ball at her feet, is the tournament's leading scorer with seven 
goals. She is so feared that the Americans may pay her the ultimate 
soccer compliment by marking her -- assigning one defender to stick 
on her like glue. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's an all-around great player,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco  
said. ``She has such good vision, can find the open spots and get 
the ball to her teammates. And now she's really finishing, scoring 
a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's at the top of her game.''  
</P>
<P>
	After a leisurely practice at Pomona-Pitzer College on Tuesday,  
Sun, quick to laugh, held court for half an hour for a small group 
of reporters under a shade tree just off the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old forward is one of the finest players in the  
world, a long shot because girls haven't been encouraged to play 
soccer in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was a real soccer fan, a former player, and he  
encouraged me to play,'' Sun said through an interpreter. ``I 
started to play when I was 10 and started regular training when I 
was 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most fathers in China cannot accept girls playing soccer. It's  
the culture. Girls are supposed to be shy and steady and not so 
active. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father is very proud now.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sun said the women's team has sparked interest in China, with  
all its World Cup games being broadcast back home. She believes the 
attitude that girls shouldn't play the game is changing, and 
another big step in that direction can be taken Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very, very important that we win now, for ourselves and  
for China,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of her poetry has been published in newspapers, she said,  
and she also enjoys karaoke, listing ``Can You Feel the Love 
Tonight'' and ``My Heart Will Go On'' among her favorite songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sing them in English,'' she said. The interpreter added,  
``She is a very, very good singer in English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China was host of the first Women's World Cup, in 1991, but the  
fans' interest waned dramatically when China lost in the 
quarterfinals of the tournament won by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun has been very impressed by the World Cup crowds this year,  
which have included numerous Chinese fans. The Rose Bowl will have 
a sellout crowd approaching 90,000 for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' she said. ``This is a very good place for  
women's soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun said she would consider playing in the United States if  
plans to begin a women's professional league in 2001 materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best soccer can be played on a professional level,'' she  
said. ``The best environment for soccer now is in the U.S. So, 
yes.''

<HEADLINE> Voice Actor Plays Woody Woodpecker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I am the red M&AMP;M,'' Billy West says  
proudly. He's not delusional. 
</P>
<P>
	West is the scarlet candy's TV commercial voice. He's also the  
reborn Woody Woodpecker and Fry in the prime-time animated series 
``Futurama.'' And he has given the gift of the gab to both Ren and 
Stimpy and to a variety of Nickelodeon's wee ones. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new golden age of animation, West is among the golden  
voices. Whether he's called on to revive smarty-pants Woody or 
breathe personality into a chocolate tidbit, the 47-year-old 
performer is an acoustic ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm really lucky because my voice goes all over the  
place,'' he said. ``I'm able to go to the basement and I'm also 
able to go up to the stratosphere. It's like having an instrument 
that's flexible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's artistry in the pipes, sure. But there's more at work  
here: How do you decide what an inanimate object like snack food 
might sound like? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can make a mistake by trying to bring too much  
science to something like that,'' West replies. ``It's pure 
fantasy. ... It's your job to be unafraid and to try stuff and to 
let someone else be the judge of what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The M&AMP;M's voice, for instance, is kind of a ``wise guy me,''  
West says. Then he playfully demonstrates in booming tones: ``You 
have to imagine that I'm sort of a candy-coated Leonardo 
DiCaprio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revisiting a classic character in ``The Woody Woodpecker Show''  
(part of Fox Kids' Saturday morning lineup) works different 
muscles. The rat-a-tat-tat delivery and laugh originated with Mel 
Blanc, one of animation's venerable voices and a West hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have some nuances that keep the character rooted  
in its original foundation,'' West said. He has license to play 
with the character's sound a bit, but he knows that such 
assignments are not the path to cartoon immortality. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be the next Mel Blanc by running around doing Mel  
Blanc's voices. You have to take every opportunity to attach your 
name to something you had a hand in fashioning,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say he has a star complex. In a decidedly  
anonymous line of acting -- ``Most people don't know what I look 
like, which is fine by me,'' he says -- West is simply eager to work 
steadily and to add to his credits, minor or major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love things the way they are because it's exactly what I  
dreamed of doing when I was really small,'' he said. As a youngster 
in Detroit, he was intrigued by TV cartoons and the versatile 
actors behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd watch a Hanna-Barbera cartoon or a Warner Bros. cartoon  
and I'd hear upwards of 15 to 20 voices. And then I'd read the 
credits and under 'Voices' I'd see two names. That's it. And that 
signified to me that these were very weird, strange people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was something really cool about that, to be off the  
map.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other actor-comedians who played multiple roles also were ``huge  
influences,'' he said, rattling off the names of Jerry Lewis, Danny 
Kaye and ``Your Show of Shows'' star Sid Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
	Expecting radio to be his creative outlet, West began working at  
WBCN in Boston in 1980, with carte blanche to construct comedy bits 
and funny commercials. He moved to New York City and station WXRK 
in 1989, figuring he had reached the pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was relegated to promoting contests and endlessly  
reciting ``New York's home of classic rock 'n' roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same mindless, Novocain, brain-numbing pieces of  
information over and over again, and I was losing my mind,'' West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he found an improbable savior.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right down the hall was Howard Stern, who was just beginning  
to bust the walls of conventional radio. ... He was some firebrand 
on the loose. I thought, 'This is nuts. This is great.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	West joined Stern's wayward team as a part-time ``utility  
infielder,'' doing off-the-wall characters and impressions of 
politicians and others who ventured into the shock jock's merciless 
sights. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern succeeded by breaking radio's musty rules, West said.  
``Howard's show was all unscripted, and he was the first person I 
ever met who didn't play records to hide behind music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After West tried unsuccessfully to join the show full-time, and  
at the urging of his wife, Violet, he decided on a change. He had 
already begun doing commercial and series work and gambled that 
more could be had in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, West came West and got a ``couple of series. Then it  
turned into 10 series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A single show can mean several voices. In ``Futurama,'' the  
30th-century satire from ``The Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening, 
West plays a 147-year-old mad scientist, an alien crustacean and a 
pompous star-ship captain as well as Fry, a young slacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' and the rest of Fox's Tuesday night all-animated  
lineup reflect a craze for cartoonry that is keeping voice actors 
like West busy -- and optimistic that this is only the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to think all prime-time programming will become  
animated,'' he said. ``People just want different. I don't think 
they care that it's animated.''

<HEADLINE> Voice of Homer Simpson Hitting Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dan Castellaneta has one of television's most  
recognizable voices. His face is a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson on ``The Simpsons,''  
says he ``was never able to develop a persona as an actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that may change.  
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old actor is taking his rarely seen face to the  
stage at the Acme Theater, where he will appear on Wednesday nights 
through July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor will play about 20 characters -- such as a  
ventriloquist's dummy and a Billie Holiday impersonator -- in a 
90-minute, one-man show he wrote. It is titled ``Where Did Vincent 
Van Gogh?''

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Control Western Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Firefighters have nearly contained four blazes that blackened  
more than 83,000 acres across the West in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest, a 61,400-acre Utah blaze burning through pinyon  
pine, cheat grass and juniper trees in steep mountain areas about 
55 miles south of Salt Lake City, drove residents from their homes 
over the weekend. No one was injured and only three abandoned 
shacks burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind-fanned fire, which began in grass along railroad tracks  
and then spread when a 11,000-gallon diesel tank truck exploded, 
was 90 percent contained early today. Full containment was expected 
by Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	However, today's high temperatures were expected to be 10 to 12  
degrees higher than on Monday -- up to 99 degrees, with wind gusts 
to 20 mph -- and there was a threat of lightning-producing 
thunderstorms later in the day, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Containment was also expected soon of a nearly 8,000-acre blaze  
spanning western Colorado and eastern Utah. No homes were 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, a 12,000-acre brush fire that began Sunday northeast  
of Sparks was expected to be completely controlled this week. 
Erratic wind blew flames up against Interstate 80, but the highway 
remained open and no structures were reported threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of snakes and insects we've had to watch out  
for,'' said Dave Marion, a U.S. Forest Service crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, a controlled federal burn that became a  
2,000-acre wildfire on Friday was mostly contained. Two dozen homes 
in the mountain hamlet of Lewiston were damaged, at a cost of $1.6 
million.

<HEADLINE> Special Olympians Close Out Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- With tears and cheers, thousands of athletes  
from around the world said goodbye in an emotional closing ceremony 
of the Special Olympics' 10th World Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite sadness over the deaths of three people connected to the  
games, the ceremony at Duke University's Wallace Wade Stadium was a 
casual, sentimental event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin delegation entered the stadium Sunday night  
wearing ``cheeseheads'' to help shield heat that sickened more than 
a dozen participants. Others beat the 95-degree temperature by 
wearing bathing suits, dousing themselves with water from squirt 
guns or wearing wet towels over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes danced together and one drew a crowd as he dropped to  
his knees, pretending to play an inflatable toy guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I was here last Friday I was told to make new friends. I  
have made 304 new friends,'' said a sobbing Joseph ``Papa Joe'' 
Garceau, a 64-year-old softball player from Massachusetts. ``I had 
a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics, held for individuals with mental  
retardation, was founded in 1963 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. This 
year's games featured competitors from 150 countries and drew 
400,000 people, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to believe the Shrivers, who have seen it for 30 years,  
that this was the best ever,'' said LeRoy Walker, president of the 
Games and former president of the United States Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a moment of silence early in the program for a  
volunteer who died of heart problems just after the opening 
ceremony, an Egyptian athlete who died of an apparent seizure and 
University of North Carolina chancellor Michael Hooker, who died of 
cancer during the games he was instrumental in bringing to the 
Durham area. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Dominican basketball players and two Moroccan soccer players  
slipped away from their delegations in the event's opening days. 
Three have been heard from since, but one of the Moroccans remains 
unaccounted for, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next world Special Olympics competition will be held in 2001  
at the Winter Games in Alaska.

<HEADLINE>  Beating Heat -- East Coast's New Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The mission for 75-year-old Ruth  
Anderson was clear: Keep cool at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Necessary cooking was done at 5 a.m. Lunch and dinner were eaten  
at air-conditioned restaurants. The afternoon was spent working on 
a crossword puzzle inside the cool Connecticut Post Mall in 
Milford. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Ms. Anderson ate ice cream with her daughter and  
granddaughter, and then they were off to see a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sticking to my plan. We did this yesterday and the day  
before,'' she said Monday. ``It's too hot to be outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heat advisories and warnings were posted today from Illinois to  
the East Coast and from southern New England to North Carolina as 
temperatures drove back toward the century mark. Yesterday, 
temperatures hit record highs from the Great Lakes to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Iftode, 13, was ready with a battery-driven, hand-held  
fan with a built-in water sprayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel like you are in a steaming bathroom,'' she said  
yesterday evening after taking a visiting cousin to New York City's 
coolest attraction: the movies. ``They have air conditioning 
inside,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York reached 101 degrees yesterday, a record for the date,  
with a heat index -- the combined effect of temperature and humidity 
-- of 112. Newark, N.J., set a record at 103, as did Portland, 
Maine, reaching 94 Monday. Bridgeport, Conn., registered 100 for 
the date for the first time. North Carolina's Raleigh-Durham 
International Airport hit a record 102, highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds and Astros played an afternoon baseball game in  
Cincinnati, a thermometer stuck in the artificial turf at Cinergy 
Field registered 154 degrees, highest in at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight deaths were blamed on the heat during the long  
holiday weekend, including a man found dead Sunday in Chicago with 
a body temperature of 107. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a measure of relief was on the way as a cold front  
pressed slowly toward the south and east. Behind the front, 
Wisconsin expected less humidity today and highs only in the 80s; 
Monday's high of 94 prompted Milwaukee's first heat health alert in 
two years. After another blast of 100-degree heat today, New 
Yorkers were told highs would be in the 80s the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities urged customers to turn off unneeded appliances to  
conserve electricity and some had scattered blackouts as air 
conditioners outpaced generators. Con Edison said some 16,000 
customers were hit by sporadic outages Monday in New York City and 
its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat buckled roads in Delaware and elsewhere. Several lanes  
of New York City's busy Queensboro Bridge over the East River were 
closed for eight hours during the night because the decking warped. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Flag Acres Zoo in Rensselaer County, N.Y., owner Harry  
VonHaggin fed his monkeys Popsicles and made giant ones for bears 
by freezing fruit chunks and water in 5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a luxury that they enjoy, and for the bears, it's a  
source of entertainment, too,'' VonHaggin said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those affected by the sporadic power outages was Ida  
DiFulvio, 68, of Lynn, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really hot,'' she said after five hours with no way to  
cool her home. ``The sweat was just pouring right off me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She tried sitting on her porch and driving to the beach, then  
finally beat the heat by emptying her freezer of ice cream and 
sharing it with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid it would melt,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Youth Division Named for Ripken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken shoved aside Lou Gehrig in the  
record books, and now he's hoarding in on the name of Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth League Inc. announced Tuesday that it's renaming its  
12-and-under section from the Bambino Division to the Cal Ripken 
Baseball Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal Ripken Jr. and Babe Ruth League share a common vision: To  
provide every youngster the opportunity to play baseball and have 
fun,'' Babe Ruth League president Ronald Tellfsen said. ``Teaching 
them to play the game `The Ripken Way' will assure us of these 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cal Ripken Baseball Division of youths 5-12 is Babe Ruth's  
largest groups, consisting of 471,000 players in all 50 states, 
Canada, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record of playing in 2,130 consecutive  
games in September 1995. He went on to play in 2,632 games before 
voluntarily ending the streak last season.

<HEADLINE> Yankee Not Allowed To Join U.S. Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- George Steinbrenner's Olympic spirit stops when  
it comes to his own players. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees have refused a request to make Double-A  
first baseman Nick Johnson available for the United States team 
that will go to the Pan American Games later this month. The Pan Am 
Games serve as the baseball qualifying tournament for the 2000 
Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, Nick Johnson is in our development plans,'' Yankees  
general manager Brian Cashman said Tuesday. ``The organization's 
thoughts on Nick Johnson are that it's best for him to get going 
and continue his development plans toward the major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's commissioner's office said teams should make  
available any players not on their 40-man rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 20, was the Yankees' third-round pick in the 1996  
amateur draft and was the team's minor league player of the year 
last season after hitting .317 with 17 homers and 58 RBIs at 
Class-A Tampa. He is the nephew of former major league player and 
manager Larry Bowa. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Johnson is hitting .317 with nine homers and 53  
RBIs at Double-A Norwich and already has set an Eastern League 
season record by getting hit by pitches 27 times in 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want him to take any more of a beating,'' said Mark  
Newman, the Yankees vice president of player development and 
scouting. ``We're just trying to protect him. Nick has been beaten 
up and we have keep a close watch over him. He's obviously one of 
our top two or three prospects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and shortstop Alfonso Soriano will participate in the  
future's all-star game at Boston's Fenway Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of Johnson, the Yankees are making available pitcher  
36-year-old pitcher Dave Pavlas, who last pitched in the major 
leagues in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees owner, was a vice president  
of the U.S. Olympic Committee from 1989-96.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Signs SLA Extradition Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura signed an extradition  
warrant Tuesday for Kathleen Soliah, a former member of a radical 
group accused of planting bombs under two Los Angeles police cars 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah, 52, is charged with murder conspiracy and could face  
life in prison if convicted for her alleged role with the 
Symbionese Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Ms. Soliah spent 23 years as a fugitive and  
lived under the assumed name of Sarah Jane Olson in the Twin 
Cities. She was married and an active member of her community. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Howard Bass, has not publicly conceded that Ms.  
Olson is Ms. Soliah. The FBI says fingerprint records prove that 
she is. One issue at an extradition hearing scheduled for July 15 
will be whether Ms. Soliah is who police say she is.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Player Loses Scholarship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Demetrius Smith, accused of being part  
of a six-person embezzlement ring, had his football scholarship 
taken away by the University of Michigan, his parents said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 19, received a letter from the school notifying him that  
his athletic scholarship has been terminated, the player's father, 
Robert Smith, said from the family's home in the Chicago suburb of 
Calumet Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 245-pound sophomore fullback already faced legal  
problems before the embezzlement case. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith pleaded guilty on June 8 to forging a check. He is  
scheduled for sentencing July 27. The team suspended him 
indefinitely April 9 pending resolution of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The university said it couldn't discuss the revocation of  
Smith's scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletic department can't make public comment because of  
freedom of education and privacy law prohibits us from discussing 
it,'' spokesman David Ablauf said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the school didn't give him a chance to discuss his  
situation before terminating his scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches never even asked me what happened,'' Smith told  
The Michigan Daily, the school's student newspaper. ``They just got 
rid of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's mother, Diane Smith, said offensive coordinator Mike  
DeBord called two days before the letter arrived, notifying her of 
the scholarship revocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and two other players could face embezzlement and  
conspiracy charges in what authorities said was the theft of 
thousands of dollars in merchandise from a Kmart store. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive linemen Jonathan Goodwin and Maurice Williams, 20, and  
Smith, are accused of being part of a six-person embezzlement ring, 
according to 14th District Court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men and two women, as well as one female cashier, are  
accused of taking thousands of dollars worth of merchandise through 
a checkout lane at the Kmart store in Ypsilanti Township in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations are included in affidavits filed by the  
Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department seeking search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects would face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison  
and a $5,000 fine if charged and convicted on felony embezzlement 
and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith missed the 1998 season after injuring a knee. He played in  
10 games as a freshman in 1997, carrying twice for 5 yards.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Inmate Escapes Briefly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, Ga. (AP) -- A man charged with killing four members of a  
family escaped from jail but was recaptured about 12 hours later as 
he walked along a nearby highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Still wearing the red boxer shorts and white T-shirt he had on  
when he escaped from his cell, Jerry Scott Heidler was nabbed 
shortly before 5 p.m. Tuesday near Vidalia, about six miles from 
the jail in Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	``After being read his rights he said that he was tired of  
running,'' said Bob Herz, a sheriff's department spokesman. ``It 
was quite obvious he made no attempt to camouflage himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heidler, 22, was captured after someone called in a tip that he  
had been seen near Vidalia. A trooper spotted him walking along the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Alvie Kight Jr. declined to discuss details of the  
escape, which he said was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidler, who is charged with killing four members of a Santa  
Claus, Ga., family three weeks before Christmas in 1997, escaped 
sometime between 3:30 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	He is scheduled to stand trial in August on charges he broke  
into the home of Danny and Kim Daniels, shooting them in their bed 
and then shooting Mrs. Daniels' 8-year-old son and Daniels' 
16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he also kidnapped three girls -- ages 8, 9 and 10 --  
and left them on a dirt road about 50 miles from their home. Two 
other children were left in the house unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the seven children who lived in the house were in  
foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had invited Heidler to their church and he had lived  
in their home briefly, investigators said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Tuesday in quiet trading after  
an extended holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32  
point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.03 percent from late Friday's 
6.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities 
fell 7/32 point to 1/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no major economic reports released Tuesday to steer  
the market, leaving traders to focus on a series of large sales of 
corporate debt securities due this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose to 4.69 percent while the discount rose 0.03 percentage point 
to 4.57 percent compared with late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 4.74 percent, as the discount fell 0.04  
percentage point to 4.56 percent. One-year yields slipped to 5.04 
percent as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.94 percent from 4.88 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/8 point to 118 19/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.55 percent from late Friday's 5.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Honda Unveils Fuel Efficient Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. said Today that its entry into the  
low-emission, fuel-efficient vehicle race will get an estimated 84 
miles per gallon when it goes on sale later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's third-largest automaker said the aerodynamic two-seat  
coupe, unveiled in prototype form earlier this year at the Detroit 
auto show, will be called ``Insight'' and will be the world's most 
fuel-efficient, gasoline-powered, mass-production vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insight uses a lightweight, 1-liter, three-cylinder gasoline  
engine assisted by an electric motor. The highly efficient 
``hybrid'' powertrain, combined with the addition of lightweight 
plastic and aluminum body panels, results in the high mileage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Toyota Motor Corp. was the first to sell a hybrid  
gasoline-electric car in Japan, the Prius, in 1997. It will go on 
sale in the United States and Europe next year. Honda plans to beat 
Toyota to the U.S. market by placing the Insight on sale nationwide 
in December. The car will go on sale in Japan in the fall, in 
Europe in December and in Canada next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars operate differently. While the Prius shifts between  
gasoline engine and electric motor, the Insight always uses the 
engine as its primary power source. The electric motor is instead 
used to boost the engine's power during hard acceleration, 
spokesman Andy Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	An advantage of the Insight system is its battery is half the  
size of the Prius battery, which results in significant weight 
savings, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's Prius also uses a conventional steel body, while the  
Insight makes extensive use of aluminum and plastic. Honda said 
that resulted in a 40 percent weight savings over a conventional 
steel body. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda also said it has developed a new catalytic converter that  
will make vehicle emissions 50 percent cleaner than required by 
Japanese regulations slated for next year. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tiny 10-Ounce Oregon Baby Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A girl born last month weighing only 10  
ounces -- who got the nickname ``Mighty Mo'' for her fighting spirit 
-- lost her struggle for life. 
</P>
<P>
	The infant, born June 12, died early Monday at Legacy Emanuel  
Children's Hospital. She was 3 weeks, 2 days old. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl and her twin sister were born three months premature.  
Her sister weighed 2 pounds, 10.5 ounces, and was listed in fair 
condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the parents' request, officials at Legacy Emanuel wouldn't  
reveal the baby's name. Doctors nicknamed her Mighty Mo because 
they compared her fighting spirit to the historic battleship USS 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guinness Book of World Records says the smallest baby to  
survive is a 9.9-ounce girl born in 1989 in Maywood, Ill. The girl, 
Madeline Mann, was described in a 1997 news story as a healthy 
8-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Patrick Lewallen, chief of neonatology at Legacy Emanuel,  
said in most cases, an infant of Mighty Mo's weight would have died 
within an hour or two of birth. But because she had been gestating 
for 28 weeks, she had developed enough to have a chance. Normal 
gestation is 40 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mighty Mo was so small, it was difficult to treat her even  
with the smallest equipment in a unit that specializes in tiny 
babies. The girl's hands were about as small as a Barbie doll's.

	Pakistani Shells Slam Into Indian Highway  
</P>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- While the nations' troops battled over  
mountain peaks in the disputed province of Kashmir, Pakistani 
shells slammed into an oil tanker convoy on a crucial Indian 
highway today. The shelling came two days after President Clinton 
met with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and raised hopes of 
a speedy end to the two-month battle in the snowcapped Himalayas. 
U.S. officials in Washington said Sharif and Clinton agreed that 
Pakistan-based forces would withdraw from the Indian part of 
Kashmir. But India says there has been no sign of withdrawal.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The first planeload of new Russian  
peacekeepers landed in Kosovo's capital today. Their presence is 
seen as a way to help ease the fears of Kosovo's minority Serbs, 
who have come under attack from vengeful Albanians. The Il-76 
transport plane departed from the southern town of Ivanovo this 
morning. It was to be followed by three more planes today, Russia's 
Interfax news agency said. Some 200 peacekeepers, 20 vehicles and 
20 tons of other cargo were to be ferried to Kosovo on the planes, 
the report said.

55 miles south of Salt Lake City, drove residents from their homes 
over the weekend. No one was injured and only three abandoned 
shacks burned. The wind-fanned fire, which began in grass along 
railroad tracks and spread when a 11,000-gallon diesel truck 
exploded, was 90 percent contained early today. Full containment

<HEADLINE> Jagger-Hall Divorce Due in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Preliminary proceedings in the divorce of Rolling  
Stone Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall will begin this week, his lawyers 
confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hall filed for divorce in January, Jagger's publicity  
agents released a statement saying the singer's lawyers were 
contesting her petition ``on the grounds that Mick Jagger and Jerry 
Hall are not, and never have been, married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger contended his 1990 Indonesian marriage to the Texan-born  
model was not legally valid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement confirming this week's court date, his publicity  
agents said nothing dramatic was on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mick Jagger's lawyers want to make it clear that the purpose  
of Friday's court hearing is to determine the future procedural 
conduct of the case,'' the statement said. ``The judge will not 
rule on the issue of the validity of the marriage, but will merely 
make directions as to the future progress of the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Jagger nor Ms. Hall are expected to be in court.  
</P>
<P>
	Although their wedding ceremony took place in 1990, Jagger, 55,  
and Hall, 43, have been together for 21 years and have four 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall filed for divorce after a Brazilian model claimed she was  
pregnant after a fling with Jagger. 
</P>
<P>
	Recents sightings of Hall and Jagger together with their  
children in recent days -- and a very public kiss they exchanged at 
a film premiere -- have led to speculation about a reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Reform Panel Proposes Changes at IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A reform panel has suggested changes in the way  
the IOC chooses members, including democratic elections, terms of 
office and a lower age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	A working group of the IOC 2000 commission, set up following the  
Salt Lake City scandal, also proposed full membership for 10 
athletes elected by their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, whose members include former Secretary of State Henry  
Kissinger, discussed a number of proposals during a meeting in 
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will meet again Sept. 10 to complete its  
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made considerable progress toward transparency,  
rotation in office and broad representation from all interested 
sports organizations, especially from the active athletes,'' 
Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reforms were also discussed in London in a meeting between  
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
and former Senate Majority leader George Mitchell. They were in 
London to attend Sunday's Wimbledon finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell wrote a report criticizing the IOC's role in the Salt  
Lake scandal. The report accused the IOC of fostering a ``culture 
of improper gift giving'' and suggested wide-ranging reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Tuesday all of Mitchell's recommendations have been  
``integrated into the reform process and are currently being 
considered by the IOC 2000 commission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch described his meeting with Mitchell as ``most  
constructive and very encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is under pressure to change following the vote-buying  
scandal stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. Six IOC members have been expelled and four others resigned 
in the organization's worst crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Members now are essentially handpicked by Samaranch and serve  
until age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC 2000 panel proposed setting a maximum number of members,  
though no specific figure was set. The IOC currently has 104 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel proposed that a majority of IOC members be elected  
``on the merits of their individual contributions to sport,'' 
including active athletes and presidents of international 
federations and national Olympic committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group suggested extending full membership to the 10  
athletes on the IOC Athletes Commission. The 10 are elected by 
their peers at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Also discussed was increasing the number of international  
federation presidents on the IOC. There are 35 summer and winter 
Olympic federations. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel proposed that candidates for IOC membership be  
nominated for election, and that members face re-election after 
serving a certain term of office. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group also addressed lowering the age limit for  
members. The limit was raised from 75 to 80 in 1995 to allow 
Samaranch to serve another term. The panel is considering whether 
to reduce the limit to as low as 70. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel is chaired by Italian IOC member Franco Carraro. Other  
members include former French ski champion Jean-Claude Killy, U.S. 
Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl and NBC sports chief Dick 
Ebersol. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-member IOC 2000 commission also has working groups  
studying the overall role of the organization and the process for 
choosing Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Final proposals are to be drafted by the commission's 24-member  
executive committee before being submitted for approval at a 
special IOC session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Senator John McCain has proposed legislation that would  
strip the IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States, limit the 
tax deductions of IOC sponsorships and direct all U.S. TV rights 
fees to the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell has recommended that McCain give the IOC until the end  
of the year before pushing ahead with any legislative action. 
McCain has agreed.

<HEADLINE> Serbian, Iranian Join MetroStars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The New York-New Jersey MetroStars, seeking  
to climb out of last place in Major League Soccer, are adding a 
Serbian midfielder and Iranian defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasha Curcic, a 27-year-old Serb who voiced outrage at NATO's  
bombing of his country, and Mohammad Khakpour, a 30-year-old 
Iranian who played at last year's World Cup, are expected to join 
the MetroStars in time for their July 24 game against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that this is the last series of changes for a while,''  
MetroStars general manager Charlie Stillitano said Tuesday. ``These 
players are young, and we hope to have them for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curcic has played for Partizan Belgrade, Bolton and Aston Villa  
and has 13 international appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to come and show people that I can play, not talk  
politics,'' he said. ``I am a sportsman. You have to understand 
that I really want to come to the U.S. to show what Serbian people 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars (5-11-3) still hope to add a marquee player.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeeping Seen As Valuable Tool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the United States deploys 7,000 troops to  
Kosovo, a study quotes senior U.S. military commanders who say such 
peacekeeping operations provide valuable field experience and are 
central to the military's future. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers, both retired and active duty, concede that peace  
operations can sap military readiness if they supersede combat 
training. But they say such operations also can give troops and 
commanders valuable real-world experience in chaotic post-Cold War 
trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The report this month by a private group with both Republicans  
and Democrats on its board challenges oft-repeated Capitol Hill 
arguments that the Clinton administration's penchant for 
dispatching U.S. forces to far-flung trouble spots is reducing 
overall military capability. The study quotes high-profile 
retirees, including Gens. Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, but 
is notable for the number of active-duty officers who expressed 
strong opinions on the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``American military involvement (is) essential if we are to  
maintain our own security, continue to hold a position of world 
leadership, and be involved in shaping world events,'' said Marine 
Corps Gen. Charles Wilhelm, head of the U.S. Southern Command, in 
charge of operations in Central and South America. ``One of the 
elements of power is the will to exert it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm was one of 11 active-duty officers to participate in the  
study by the Peace Through Law Education Fund, a Washington-based 
nonprofit group that researches foreign policy issues. Retired 
Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., are among the 
fund's directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Charles Krulak, who retired last week as the Marine Corps'  
commandant, challenged the idea held by some on Capitol Hill that 
foreign officers should never command U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a period of chaos, you have to have foreign command,''  
Krulak said. ``You either do this, or you are the world's 
policeman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. George Fisher, U.S. 1st Army commander, said ground  
troops under his command in Haiti judged that ``they were generally 
a better force for having completed such missions if -- and this is 
a very important reservation -- if the deployment is of limited 
duration, and if there is time to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1st Armored Division was a much better division when we  
came back (from Bosnia) than when we went,'' said retired Army Maj. 
Gen. William Nash, who led the U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia and 
helped conduct interviews for the report. In a telephone interview 
Tuesday, Nash said that the pending deployment to Kosovo will not 
involve an intact U.S. division, removing an element that helped 
Nash's soldiers maintain unit cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarzkopf said flatly, ``These deployments, in fact, probably  
help morale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These and other statements by senior officers and prominent  
military retirees run counter to an argument particularly prevalent 
among congressional Republicans that the military is being 
exhausted on relatively unimportant but costly peacekeeping 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops are overextended and operating at levels that  
simply cannot be sustained over time,'' Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., 
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a recent 
floor debate. Opposing the deployment of U.S. troops to Kosovo, 
Spence said, ``Tying down a large U.S. ground force in the Balkans 
will cause our friends -- and our enemies -- to legitimately question 
our ability to protect and promote our interests and to remain a 
force for stability in other critical regions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This view is not confined to Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	Some military schools still hew to the doctrine that peace  
operations distract from the central military mission of fighting 
and winning major wars, according to retired Army Gen. George 
Joulwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a bankrupt strategy,'' said Joulwan, NATO commander  
during the 1995 U.S. troop deployment to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The assumption that the military exists solely to fight ``the  
big one,'' Joulwan said, ``means we are strategically irrelevant. 
... You are not shaping the environment. You're sitting here 
waiting for the big one to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, peacekeeping operations, deny-flight missions and  
short-term military actions can and often do harm military 
readiness by siphoning funds from combat training into noncombat 
patrol operations, several generals agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	And military success in peace operations will usually be less  
clear than in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best the military will ever do for you is create an  
absence of war,'' Nash, the former Bosnia commander, said. 
``Militaries do not achieve peace.''

<HEADLINE> Imported Auto Sales Rise in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In another sign that Japan's economy could be  
reviving, sales of imported automobiles climbed a robust 15.8 
percent in June from the same month a year before, importers 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese bought 27,768 imported cars and trucks last month, up  
from 23,982 units sold in June 1998, the Japan Automobile Importers 
Association said. It was the first increase in four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports fell 0.2 percent in May, 0.6 percent in April and 3.9  
percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said sales of imported passenger cars jumped  
18.1 percent to 27,226, although truck imports fell 41.7 percent to 
542 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of automobiles from Germany rose 24.8 percent to 16,380,  
followed by U.S.-made passenger cars, which totaled 5,323, up 18.1 
percent. British automakers sold a total of 1,524 units in Japan, 
down 31.5 percent, followed by French carmakers with 1,002, up 2.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz remained the most popular foreign brand in June  
for the eighth consecutive month, with a 20.9 percent share of the 
import market, followed by Volkswagen with 15.9 percent and BMW 
with 14.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase comes along with other signs that Japan may be  
pulling out of its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported strong 1.9 percent economic growth in  
the first three months of the year. The Bank of Japan on Monday 
said business confidence at major companies showed its biggest 
improvement since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Voice of Homer Simpson Shields Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man behind the voice of Homer Simpson  
says he has a schizophrenic approach to comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Character actor Dan Castellaneta is best known as the voice of  
the doughnut-munching dad on ``The Simpsons,'' but said he hides 
his real personality behind his scores of characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never able to develop a persona as an actor,'' the  
41-year-old actor said. ``Peter Sellers was like that. You didn't 
really know who he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Fox cartoon, Castellaneta voices everyone from cranky  
Grandpa Simpson, to churlish Groundskeeper Willie and frantic 
Krusty the Klown. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-spoken actor is now taking his rarely seen face -- and  
multiple personalities -- to the comedy stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor plays nearly 20 different characters -- such as a  
ventriloquist's dummy and a Billie Holiday impersonator -- in a 
90-minute, one-man show he wrote titled ``Where Did Vincent Van 
Gogh?''

<HEADLINE> Ordenstein Avoids Prison Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- Former New Mexico football player Kawika  
Ordenstein, who pleaded no contest to beating up a Lobos track 
athlete last year, avoided prison time in a sentence handed down 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Pat Murdoch gave Ordenstein, a 21-year-old  
wide receiver, three years of conditional probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordenstein pleaded no contest May 19 to allegations he assaulted  
sprinter James Marin in April 1998. He was accused of repeatedly 
slamming Marin's head against a car during a fight outside the 
university athletic complex. Marin suffered ear damage and a broken 
cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordenstein, of Kailua, Hawaii, was kicked off the team and  
charged with aggravated battery with great bodily harm. Until then, 
he had been a leading candidate to start as wide receiver for the 
Lobos last year.

raise and spend money for political travel, polling and ads. Among 
the committee's first expenses will be the New York ``listening 
tour'' Mrs. Clinton is to embark on Wednesday, beginning at the 
rural home of retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign Web site, www.hillary2000.org, was set to debut  
Wednesday morning to coincide with the start of her New York swing. 
The site will feature Mrs. Clinton's columns and speeches as well 
as information on how to volunteer or contribute to her campaign. 
New Yorkers will also be able to communicate with Mrs. Clinton 
through e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady was nowhere to be seen Tuesday when her advisers  
-- as expected -- hand-delivered the single page to the FEC notifying 
the agency of the formation of her exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, 15 television cameras crowded the sidewalk outside  
the commission's downtown Washington offices to capture committee 
lawyer Lynn Utrecht walking the paperwork inside, a formality that 
lasted less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the committee was formed, aides say unsolicited  
checks had been arriving to support Mrs. Clinton's seemingly 
inevitable entrance into the Senate race. Most supporters expect 
the first lady, who has been a fixture in Democratic fund raising 
efforts, to rake in money. 
</P>
<P>
	She is not expected to have any opposition for the Democratic  
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Rep. Rick  
Lazio are considering Senate campaigns. Each says he had just under 
$3 million in the bank at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to news of Mrs. Clinton's filing, Giuliani touted his  
own familiarity with the heavily Republican areas of upstate New 
York that Mrs. Clinton will visit in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a very significant knowledge of the whole state,'' he  
said. ``Every time I've gone up there I've gotten the feeling 
people like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor was to headline two fund-raisers Tuesday night on  
Nantucket, just a stone's throw from the frequent Clinton vacation 
destination of Martha's Vineyard. But the events were canceled late 
Tuesday because of power outages and other problems associated with 
the heat wave blanketing the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has enlisted some New York political veterans to  
assist her. Long Island attorney William Cunningham has come aboard 
as her exploratory committee's treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say that while Mrs. Clinton will spend much of the summer  
traveling New York to hear from residents, she also is trying to 
establish herself as more of a presence in the state to counter 
attacks that she is a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
	State Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman, a Syracuse-area  
Democrat who has been helping plan Mrs. Clinton's upstate foray, 
conceded that convincing New Yorkers to vote for her even though 
she has never lived or worked in the state would be Mrs. Clinton's 
biggest obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with her star power, and she absolutely has star power, if  
she is on the street day in and day out, I think people will tend 
to forget that she is not a resident of this state,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forming an exploratory committee will help to eliminate another  
potential GOP line of attack -- that taxpayers are funding Mrs. 
Clinton's quasi-campaign trips to New York under the guise of 
official first lady duties. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she will still receive Secret Service protection paid  
for by the federal government.

<HEADLINE> More Tickets on Sale for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Women's World Cup organizers put several  
thousand additional tickets on sale for the final between the 
United States and China, raising capacity for Saturday's game at 
the Rose Bowl to about 90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	After a seat survey of the stadium on Tuesday, World Cup  
organizers discovered between 3,000 and 5,000 more seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The tickets, which were not in prime locations, sold for $45  
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting these seats on sale to accommodate the many fans  
who were unable to buy seats before,'' Richard Finn, a spokesman 
for the U.S. organizers, said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, organizers said the game was a sellout and more than  
85,000 were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the final in Pasadena, Norway plays Brazil in the  
third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd expected Saturday would be a record for a women's  
sporting event, Marla Messing, president of the organizing 
committee, said. The current record is 78,972 for a World Cup 
doubleheader at Giants Stadium on June 19.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Gwynn Out of All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- If Tony Gwynn can't play for the San Diego  
Padres, he's not going to play in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was voted in as a starting NL outfielder, Gwynn  
declared himself out of next Tuesday's All-Star game at Boston's 
Fenway Park. He made his decision after the Padres chose to keep 
him on the disabled list through the break. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one is pretty simple,'' Gwynn, on the injured list for  
the second time this season with a strained left calf, said 
Tuesday. ``There's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do 
things, and the wrong way would be to be on the DL going right into 
the break and then playing in the All-Star game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said this will be a tough one to sit out, because he  
wanted to play in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, you're honored to be able to go and be voted in by  
the fans, but this time I can't. I'd rather see someone else get 
the opportunity to play than try to force my way in there. So I'll 
sit this one out and hopefully be ready to go'' when the Padres 
open the second half at Seattle's new Safeco Field on July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, voted to his 11th All-Star starting spot and his 15th  
appearance overall, will still go to Boston and take part in the 
festivities. Although he plays right field, he'll be attracted to 
the landmark in left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go to the workout, you know, take some balls off the  
Green Monster, just for my own sake,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway is the last of the classic ballparks that Gwynn, an  
eight-time NL batting champion, hasn't played in. He played in 
Detroit's Tiger Stadium, which is closing after this season, in the 
1984 World Series. He made his first visit to Yankee Stadium in 
October and hit a home run in the opening game of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn missed the 1996 All-Star game because of an Achilles'  
tendon injury, but still hobbled out for pregame introductions, his 
lower right leg in a walking boot. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's Bruce Bochy, who will manage the NL All-Stars, said  
there's still some weakness in Gwynn's calf muscle, and the team 
took the decision out of the player's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to have Tony healthy for the rest of the year,''  
Bochy said. ``We felt that by giving him even more time to heal up 
that our chances were better on clearing up this calf problem. 
Sure, Tony feels good, but he felt good, too, before and he had a 
couple setbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was hurt the first time on May 21 breaking out of the  
batter's box and missed 19 games. He came back on June 12 and 
played seven games, then sat out three. His calf bothered him as he 
pursued a fly ball in warmups at Dodger Stadium and went back on 
the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy said the timing would be perfect to have Gwynn back now,  
because some of the Padres' outfielders could use a break. But the 
Padres don't want to bring him back early only to see him get hurt 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is how important he is to our club, to have him healthy  
the rest of the year, have him down the stretch,'' Bochy said. ``We 
feel like if we keep playing the way we're playing, we're going to 
contend here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn is just 18 hits short of 3,000, but he said it's been more  
frustrating missing out as the Padres rebounded from a dreadful 
start to climb into third place in the NL West. He had just five 
at-bats during San Diego's recent club-record 14-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a young team and we've had our ups and downs,''  
Gwynn said. ``When they're down, you felt like you could help and 
when you're up, you're missing out on the fun. That's been the only 
downer of the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people think I'm sitting here chomping at the bit  
trying to hurry up and get to 3,000. I'm going to get to 3,000. I'm 
not concerned about that. I just want to get back to what I love to 
do, period.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire, Sosa To Start All-Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who led baseball's  
resurgence with their home-run race last summer, will be starting 
together in the All-Star game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs last year, and Sosa, who  
leads the major leagues with 32, were elected Tuesday to start for 
the National League at Boston's Fenway Park on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the 11th appearance and seventh start for McGwire,  
and the third appearance and first start for Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year Arizona Diamondbacks were the only team to place  
two players in the starting lineup: Matt Williams won at third base 
and Jay Bell overtook Houston's Craig Biggio in the final week to 
win at second. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza of the New York Mets will start at catcher for the  
sixth straight season and make his seventh appearance overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never get tired of going there,'' Piazza said. ``As long as  
I am elected or selected, I will feel honored to go. It is probably 
the most fun you can have as a player, hanging out with the rest of 
the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Barry Larkin held off the Mets' Rey Ordonez at  
shortstop, and Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn 
were elected to join Sosa in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, elected to his 15th All-Star game and 11th starting spot,  
won't play because of a calf injury that has put him on the 
disabled list for the second time this season. But he will make the 
trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted a chance to play in Fenway, but being on the  
DL, I can't,'' he said. ``It's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, one of the few bright spots in the Chicago Cubs' dismal  
season, was the NL's leading vote-getter with 2,315,204, finishing 
third overall in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (2,918,055) led all players  
for the fourth straight year and fifth time overall and was 
followed by Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar (2,793,891). 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, whose 26 homers for St. Louis tied him for second in  
the league going into Tuesday night's game, received the 
second-highest NL vote total, leading first basemen with 1,669,066. 
</P>
<P>
	He wishes the All-Star break was longer than three days.  
</P>
<P>
	``All the other sports have four to five days off,'' he said,  
``and I've never understood why baseball doesn't give the guys that 
play in the All-Star Game and extra day off just to get back to the 
cities they're going to play their games in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who trailed Biggio 697,326 to 658,407 in totals announced  
last week, finished with 1,203,902, about 32,000 ahead of his 
Houston rival, who wound up at 1,171,574. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, none of the votes cast on the Internet had  
been included in the weekly totals. Fans were allowed to vote up to 
22 times on the Internet -- the average number of home games for 
each team during the balloting. Sosa gained nearly 1 million votes 
in the final week of counting. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, who led Ordonez by fewer than 10,000 votes last week,  
won by a wide margin, 858,203 to 799,858. Larkin will be making his 
10th All-Star appearance, his fourth as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker will be making his fourth appearance, his third straight  
as a starter. Williams, a five-time All-Star, returns to the game 
for the first time since 1996 and will make his fourth start. For 
Bell, it's his second appearance and first start. 
</P>
<P>
	AL starters were announced Monday. In addition to Griffey and  
Alomar, the lineup includes Cleveland's Jim Thome at first, and 
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton in the outfield. They will be joined 
by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Boston shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken and Tampa Bay 
designated hitter Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and reserves for both leagues will be picked Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Shooter Strikes City on Big Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- The memorial outside the Korean United  
Methodist Church grew throughout the day, swelling with flowers, 
candles and photos. 
</P>
<P>
	It was here that Korean graduate student Won-Joon Yoon was shot  
and killed by a white supremacist just before Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter, scrawled on notebook paper and left Monday, stated a  
common feeling among residents: ``I never met Won-Joon Yoon and yet 
my heart feels the pain of his passing. ... I don't have an answer 
to this craziness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon was the last victim in a two-state shooting spree that  
ended Sunday night when the suspect, 21-year-old former Indiana 
University student Benjamin Smith, fatally shot himself in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday really sent a shock wave through our community,''  
said Bloomington Mayor John Fernandez, on the verge of tears Monday 
morning. ``It broke up what should have been a celebratory day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today begins the process of healing.''  
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez spent most of Monday entertaining a five-member  
delegation from Bloomington's sister city of Lu Jou, Taiwan, trying 
to make them feel at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington and Lu Jou have been sister cities for 10 years, but  
this was the first time Mayor Chein-Hui ``David'' Huang had visited 
Bloomington, 60 miles southwest of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, in town for a cultural and educational exchange, said the  
killing did nothing to affect his opinion of Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bloomington is a peaceful city,'' he said. ``All the people  
here were very kind. The city is beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city also was familiar with Smith, described Monday as  
hateful but publicly reserved and even polite. Authorities say 
Smith regularly distributed white supremacist fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, about 500 people, including Fernandez, other  
Bloomington officials and the Indiana University football coach, 
staged a march to speak out against racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents said the city would bounce back from Sunday's tragedy.  
A few hours after the shooting, the city held its Fourth of July 
Parade, which included a group of about 100 people from Bloomington 
United, a local anti-hate coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show unity,'' said Peg Stice, a coalition member.  
``To show that we didn't accept those actions or thoughts.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Cavaliers To Hire Wittman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Randy  
Wittman will be hired as the coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers on 
Wednesday, according to media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Twin Cities stations KARE-TV and KSTP-TV and The Plain Dealer of  
Cleveland and the Akron Beacon Journal reported that Wittman would 
become coach of the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman told Orlando coach Doc Rivers, a former NBA teammate and  
longtime friend, that he had accepted the job, the Beacon Journal 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really excited,'' Rivers said. ``He thinks it's a perfect  
situation for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers' spokesmen Bob Zink and Bob Price didn't return  
messages seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In five years with the Timberwolves, Wittman, 39, gained a  
reputation as one of the league's brightest assistants. He also has 
been an assistant with the Indiana Pacers and Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-year NBA veteran, Wittman was a first-round draft pick of  
the Washington Bullets in 1983 but was traded to the Atlanta Hawks 
before the 1983-84 season. He averaged 7.4 points a game in playing 
stints with Atlanta, Sacramento and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to playing for Indiana's 1981 NCAA title team,  
Wittman was a two-time academic All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs have been looking for a coach since June 1, when Mike  
Fratello was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland hasn't made it past the first round of the playoffs  
since 1993 and attendance has sagged from 18,011 a game in 1994-95 
to 14,120 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman met with Cavs general manager Jim Paxson on June 16 and  
was back in Cleveland 10 days later to have dinner with Paxson. He 
emerged as the frontrunner over the holiday weekend after meeting 
with Gund at the owner's offices in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittman, Dave Cowens, Del Harris and John MacLeod were known to  
have been interviewed for the coaching vacancy. Wittman is the only 
one who hasn't been an NBA head coach.

<HEADLINE> Part of Racial Bias Suit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday threw out part of a $30  
million civil rights lawsuit filed against the city of Lubbock by 
the women's basketball coach of Hampton University, her husband and 
an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed April 19, alleges racial bias by police in the  
wrongful arrest of the three last Nov. 16 outside a Wal-Mart. 
Hampton was in Lubbock for a basketball game against Texas Tech, 
but the game was canceled because of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings dismissed two allegations that  
assistant Vanetta Kelso, who was pregnant, received inadequate 
medical care at University Medical Center, but allowed a third 
claim to remain in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings also held that the city of Lubbock is immune from the  
claims of slander, libel, defamation and emotional distress 
mentioned in the lawsuit. The judge said individual police officers 
and paramedics cited in the lawsuit have no such immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelso was detained along with coach Patricia Bibbs and her  
husband, Ezell Gibbs, after a woman complained that someone had 
scammed her. 
</P>
<P>
	The three, who were handcuffed and held for several hours,  
insisted upon their innocence. No charges were filed after a review 
of the store's security tapes showed that none of the three had any 
contact with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged that police detained them because they are  
black. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also contends police violated the constitutional rights  
of due process, equal protection and protection from unreasonable 
and illegal arrests, searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelso claims she was humiliated, embarrassed and threatened by  
an emergency worker at the University Medical Center in Lubbock 
because she vomited. The worker threatened to stuff a towel in her 
mouth, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought $2.5 million for each plaintiff for past and  
future loss of wages, medical expenses, pain and mental anguish, 
plus punitive damages of $7.5 million for each plaintiff.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Said Wanted To Be Famous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Last July 4, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith  
strolled along the tree-lined streets of Bloomington, tucking 
hundreds of racist leaflets onto car windshields and under doors. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, police said, he charged through the same college  
town with a gun, killing a Korean student during a two-state 
shooting spree that also left a black man dead in Illinois. Late 
Sunday, when much of the country had its attention turned to 
fireworks and barbecues, the 21-year-old Smith was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to him between the two holidays was, according to  
those who knew him, a horrible culmination of racist outrage that 
had been building for years. Perhaps even when he was growing up in 
an upscale Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Smith shaved his skull, skinhead style, and he had his  
chest tattooed with the words ``Sabbath Breaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he was made a ``brother'' of the World Church of the  
Creator, an avowedly white supremacist group based in East Peoria, 
Ill. Its leader, Matt Hale, has been denied a law license by the 
Illinois bar because of his racist preachings. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith apparently found acceptance in the group, whose members  
greet each other with the acronym ``Rahowa,'' which stands for 
``Racial Holy War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's habit of littering the Indiana University campus in  
Bloomington with racist leaflets had become notorious at the school 
of about 30,000 students, which Smith attended in 1998 before 
dropping out. He had been a criminal justice major. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Indiana student Tyrese Alexander, who is black, said  
Smith's racist views were so well known at the school that he 
brought them up for discussion in his African-American studies 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just had an angry look on his face,'' said Alexander, 23.  
</P>
<P>
	At first, a few Indiana students started writing letters to the  
campus newspaper complaining of Smith's propaganda. Smith responded 
with his own letters signed under the pseudonym ``August Smith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``White Nationalists have no desire to rule over other races;  
instead we want separation from nonwhites. This is why White 
Nationalists are working for an independent white nation,'' he 
wrote on June 11, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	By the fall, the trickle of complaints about the leaflets had  
become a protest march of hundreds of people through the center of 
town, said Jeffrey Willsey, one of the event's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was unbowed, but possibly humbled, too, Willsey said.  
Smith, whom police say was seldom seen with anyone else, stood on a 
corner and watched the marchers pass, holding a sign that read, 
``No Hate Speech Means No Free Speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we are as a community coming together, and here's this  
poor guy standing out there all buy himself, entirely alone,'' 
Willsey said. ``I thought, this is a really pathetic human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Smith wrote another letter to the Indiana Daily  
Student newspaper. ``America,'' he said, ``has become increasingly 
nonwhite and the constitutional rights of racial activists have 
increasingly been infringed upon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Smith appeared as a witness for Hale at a hearing  
before a bar association panel. He said that at times he had 
``considered violent acts to achieve racial goals, but Hale 
counseled me to act peacefully.''

	``Our No. 1 goal is to straighten out the white man's  
thinking,'' he said. ``We're the new minority being crushed left

<P>
	That struggle apparently boiled over last weekend. Police said  
Smith apparently targeted minorities, killing two and wounding at

it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Development Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSDALE, Miss. (AP) -- With a helping hand from corporate  
America, President Clinton is offering a mix of public and private 
investment to spur economic activity in some of the nation's 
forgotten communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was announcing $64 million in community development  
grants today -- including $15 million for the Mississippi Delta 
region -- before joining a Bank of America executive in East St. 
Louis, Ill., to outline a new $500 million capital investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements were part of Clinton's four-day tour through  
poor communities from Appalachia to Los Angeles, highlighting what 
the administration is touting as the ``untapped markets'' in 
America's inner cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to provide incentives for people to go there,'' he  
said in Hazard, Ky, Monday. ``We know that government can't solve 
these problems alone. We know that we'll never get anywhere by 
leaving people alone either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was visiting the shop of a Mississippi cabinetmaker who  
opened with a secured loan from the Enterprise Corporation of the 
Delta, which provides capital and credit to small businesses that 
wouldn't qualify for conventional loans. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of corporate leaders are accompanying Clinton and  
several Cabinet secretaries and politicians as they review 
successful local projects and deliver promises of investment and 
technical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mississippi Delta today, Clinton was announcing $60  
million in grants from the Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund to community development organizations across the 
country. The fund was created in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Bessant, a vice president of Bank of America, committed  
$100 million to the fund. Later in the day, with Clinton by her 
side, she was announcing formation of a $500 million capital 
investment fund targeted at often-overlooked communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, was  
presenting a study in East St. Louis, where Clinton also was 
touring a new Walgreen's, that estimates inner-city residents 
possess $331 billion in purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about charity,'' he said. ``It's about  
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Tyner, Ky., on Monday, Clinton met with residents of the  
Whispering Pines neighborhood, a cluster of small trailer homes 
with about 100 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who stood along their path told Clinton they  
desperately need better transportation and housing. Most of the 
homes had broken windows, some covered with cardboard or wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first electricity was in 1961. I didn't have running water  
in a bathroom until five years ago,'' Jean Collett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president traveled by helicopter to Hazard, Ky., where he  
told some 2,000 people who waited hours in the blistering heat to 
see him that it was time that former coal mining towns like theirs 
began to share in the economic good times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to show America who you are,'' Clinton said. ``At  
this time of prosperity, if we can't find a way to give every 
single hard-working American family a chance to participate in the 
future we're trying to build for our country, we'll never get 
around to doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message was welcomed by the people of Hazard, the seat of  
Perry County, where the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent, compared 
with a national average that has been holding below 5 percent. The 
county's per capita income, at about $16,000, is only 63 percent of 
the national average. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need help. We need hope,'' Hazard Mayor William Gorman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a late-night dinner of ribs and catfish at the Blues City  
Cafe on Memphis' famed Beale Street, Clinton toured the National 
Civil Rights Museum, located at the site of the former Lorraine 
Hotel, where the Rev. Martin Luther King was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was accompanied by about 20 people who had supped with  
him, including Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater, and Jesse Jackson, who had accompanied 
King to Memphis on the day he was slain in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	While visiting the museum, Clinton placed a telephone call to  
console the widow of former Northwestern University men's 
basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong, who was shot to death Friday near 
his home in Skokie, Ill. A white supremacist who took his own life 
late Sunday was suspected in the killing.

<HEADLINE> Gold Prices Fall on British Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The old saying that a fool and his gold are soon  
parted has been replaced by warnings you'd be a fool nowadays not 
to part with your gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on both cash and futures markets tumbled Tuesday to new  
20-year lows after Britain kicked off the first in a series of 
auctions that will eventually lead to the sale of more than half 
its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, previously announced in May, is the latest in a series  
of high-profile central bank sales that come as gold loses its 
luster in favor of better-returning investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only good thing gold has going for it is the fact that it  
has so few friends that people may become interested in it,'' said 
Bernard Savaiko, director of futures research at PaineWebber Inc. 
in Weehawken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in order to see a sustained rally, investors are going to  
have to return to the market in a big way, and that's a tough sell 
with the great strength in competing assets like the stock 
market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for August delivery fell $6.80 to $257.80 an ounce on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange. Spot gold prices in Europe hit a 
20-year record low at $255.75 a troy ounce. In London, the gold 
price closed at $256.10. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ominous sign that prices will continue lower, the British  
sale -- which amounted to 50,250 pounds, or 3.5 percent of the 
United Kingdom's total 1.6 million-pound reserve -- did not attract 
higher prices despite heavy bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the gold was sold at the lowest accepted prices  
was not particularly positive,'' said Refco metals analyst James 
Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Treasury said it was selling gold to buy U.S.  
dollars, Japanese yen and the European Union's new euro currency to 
create a more balanced cash reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Gold Council, which represents the mining industry,  
campaigned against the sale in national newspaper advertisements, 
gathered a petition with 10,000 signatures and called the auction 
``a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, traditionally a safe haven for investors in times of  
turmoil, peaked at $875 per troy ounce in January 1980 -- a time 
when Soviet troops were moving into Afghanistan, the U.S. inflation 
rate was in double figures and oil prices were rising rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Many nations are no longer interested in making payments to each  
other and backing their currency with 27-pound gold bar, though it 
still has a large role in industrial and ornamental settings. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era where electronic commerce is moving the world toward a  
paperless currency system, countries such as Argentina, Luxembourg, 
Australia and Canada now believe they can maintain economic 
confidence by buying other investments that do not cost as much to 
hold and appreciate in value faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the demand that's out there for jewelry and  
other industries is not enough to stem the tide,'' Savaiko said. 
``Gold pays no return at a time when real returns are moving higher 
and inflation still doesn't pose a threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A ray of hope for a price rebound, however, is that jewelry  
manufacturers typically begin buying gold in July and August for 
the November-December holiday shopping period. Manufacturers could 
purchase in heavier-than-normal quantities in anticipation that 
consumer demand would spike as some of the cost savings are passed 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be able to offer the consumer for the holidays some  
very, very sharp values on some pieces,'' said Beryl Raff, 
president and chief operating officer of Zale Corp. Zale is the 
largest jeweler in North America, with 11,175 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of 14K gold pieces such as chains, which cost little to  
make, are likely to see the steepest discounts, Raff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices are unlikely to recover significantly, analysts  
said. Switzerland and the International Monetary Fund are moving to 
dispose next year of part of their holdings. The IMF sale, however, 
must receive U.S. congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent gold sales have struck South Africa, the world's  
biggest gold producer, particularly hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelvin Williams, executive director of South Africa's Anglogold,  
the world's single-largest producing company, criticized the UK's 
plan to continue its auctions once every other month. 
</P>
<P>
	He said pre-announcing a sale leads to high volatility as  
speculators sell ahead of the auction and buy at lows afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bank of England has chosen the method that has been most  
disruptive to the market,'' Williams said on a conference call 
after the sale. ``This is an inappropriate way to sell monetary 
assets in any shape or form.''

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Control Western Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Firefighters marched toward containment of four blazes that have  
blackened more than 83,000 acres across the West in less than a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest, a 61,400-acre Utah blaze burning through pinion  
pine, cheat grass and juniper trees in steep mountain areas about 
55 miles south of Salt Lake City, drove residents from their homes 
over the weekend. No one was injured and only three abandoned 
shacks burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind-fanned fire, which began in grass along railroad tracks  
and spread when a 11,000-gallon diesel truck exploded, was 90 
percent contained early today. Full containment was expected by 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds died down and temperatures cooled in Utah on Monday,  
allowing more than 400 firefighters to gain ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Containment was also expected soon of a nearly 8,000-acre blaze  
spanning western Colorado and eastern Utah. No homes were 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, a 12,000-acre brush fire that began Sunday northeast  
of Sparks was expected to be completely controlled this week. 
Erratic winds blew flames up against Interstate 80, but the highway 
remained open and no structures were reported threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of snakes and insects we've had to watch out  
for,'' said Dave Marion, a U.S. Forest Service crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, a controlled federal burn that became a  
2,000-acre wildfire on Friday was mostly contained. Two dozen homes 
in the mountain hamlet of Lewiston were damaged, at a cost of $1.6 
million.

<HEADLINE> Asia To Have Chance for Extra Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Asia will have a chance to put a fifth team  
in the 2002 World Cup as part of a deal approved by FIFA's 
executive committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia was originally set to get four spots in the tournament: two  
for co-hosts Japan and South Korea and two for its regional 
qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-place team in the Asian qualifying tournament will  
play the 14th team in European qualifying, FIFA president Sepp 
Blatter said Tuesday. European has the most spots in the field, 
with 14 qualifiers and defending champion France. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia, which had threatened a boycott, had four teams at the 1998  
World Cup: Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia advanced from the 
qualifying tournament and Iran, which finished fourth, won a 
playoff with Oceania champion Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by the governing bodies for European  
and Asian soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Africa gets five berths in the tournament, while South America  
gets four, with its fifth-place team playing the Oceania champion 
for another berth. North and Central America and the Caribbean gets 
three spots. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA postponed the decision on a site for the 2006 World Cup  
from next March to July 2000 and extended the deadline for final 
applications July 31 to Aug. 9-10. England, Germany and South 
Africa are the chief contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The first FIFA World Club Championship will take place from Jan.  
5-14, 2000, in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> `Parsifal' Explored on PBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An opera first performed in 1882 can still be  
relevant and controversial in 1999. Such staying power is part of 
the story of Richard Wagner's ``Parsifal: the Search for the 
Grail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-minute program airing on PBS Wednesday at 8 p.m. EDT  
isn't only for opera buffs, says Tony Palmer, the film's director, 
``though I think opera buffs will be thrilled by the singing, and 
conductor Valery Gergiev is giving the performance of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Placido Domingo was filmed singing the title role for the first  
time with the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg, Russia, in May 1997. 
Violeta Urmana sang Kundry. 
</P>
<P>
	But this ``Great Performances'' program also recognizes other,  
decidedly non-operatic versions of legends about the grail -- said 
to be the cup Jesus drank from at the Last Supper and in which his 
blood was collected when he bled on the cross. 
</P>
<P>
	There are clips from the movies ``Monty Python and the Holy  
Grail,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Ingmar Bergman's 
``The Seventh Seal'' and ``Wagner,'' made by Palmer for TV, in 
which Richard Burton plays the composer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Search for the Grail'' also hears from Wolfgang Wagner, who  
runs the Bayreuth Festival of his grandfather's operas; from Bible 
scholar Karen Armstrong; and from Robert Gutman, who wrote the 
biography ``Wagner'' and connects Wagner's ideas with Adolf 
Hitler's. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opera, Amfortas, son of the leader of the medieval  
knights who guard the grail, has gone into the territory of the 
evil Klingsor. There he is seduced by Klingsor's servant, Kundry. 
Klingsor then grabs Amfortas' magic spear and wounds him. 
</P>
<P>
	Only with the retrieval of the spear from his foes can Amfortas  
be saved. Enter Parsifal, who instinctively realizes his mission is 
to regain the spear and thereby give his own life meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera begins with the 17-year-old Parsifal being brought  
before the knights. Since Domingo, in his late 50s, hardly passes 
for a teen, an actor was hired to set the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo also was filmed telling the ``Parsifal'' story in a  
public garden in Ravello, south of Naples, Italy. ``Parsifal'' 
often is performed on Good Friday because Act 3 takes place on Good 
Friday, but Domingo says its contemporary relevance goes beyond 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the cup represents truth and beauty and the human need for  
truth and beauty,'' he says, ``then it has something to offer all 
of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gutman insists the opera ``has nothing to do with  
Christianity. The subject matter is racial purity.'' He believes 
Wagner intended Amfortas to represent Germany; the wound doesn't 
heal because his blood is tainted by non-Aryans, and healing will 
come only when non-Aryans are eliminated from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all scholars agree with Gutman. Ernest Newman, in his study  
``The Wagner Operas,'' calls Klingsor the epitome of evil. He 
writes that ``the simple old tale of a misfortune befalling the 
rash Amfortas had to be made a symbol of sin in general, and its 
atonement by one made wise and understanding by pity not merely for 
an individual but for all men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer agrees with Gutman. ``A lot of works of art are very  
dangerous,'' he says. ``I think this is very dangerous. Wagner had 
a view of utopia in which mankind was pure. It's easy to be used as 
an excuse, as Hitler did, for ethnic cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't ruin the opera for me,'' he adds. ``Wagner was an  
appalling man, very anti-Semitic. And he did write the most 
wonderful music. I'm not attacking the opera, which is one of the 
greatest ever written. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opera also contains the extraordinary message that,  
through sacrifice, we can achieve love and forgiveness. Domingo 
quotes what people sing in the opera: 
</P>
<P>
	```Through suffering, understanding. Through understanding,  
compassion. Through compassion, love.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, in the end, that is what the film leaves you with. I  
hope so, anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Mexican Bank Aid Cost: $8B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The cost to taxpayers of a government-led  
bank bailout exceeded $82.5 billion as of June, far higher than the 
government's original estimate of $68 billion, the Mexico City 
daily Reforma reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank bailout, proposed by President Ernesto Zedillo last  
year, became one of the most controversial issues in Mexico before 
being approved by Congress in December 1998. Many lawmakers warned 
its final cost could well exceed government estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry had no immediate comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Reforma's estimates, the cost of the bank bailout  
is equivalent to 18.8 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product, 
and is 6.6 times higher than the revenues obtained by the 
government when it privatized the banking sector in the early 
1990s.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Recommends Women's Finals Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- An NCAA committee has recommended  
that the Division I women's basketball championships be played in 
Atlanta in 2003 and in New Orleans in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four site selections, announced Tuesday by the  
Division I Women's Basketball Committee, await approval later this 
week by the Division I Championships/Competition Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities considered for the 2003 and 2004 women's finals  
were Charlotte, N.C., Detroit and Memphis, Tenn., the NCAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, the 2003 Final Four will be played April 4 and April  
6 in the Georgia Dome, which will be configured to seat anywhere 
from 24,000 to 36,000. Georgia Tech will be the host for the 
championships, which were last held in Atlanta in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane will host the 2004 women's Final Four, to be played April  
2 and April 4 in the 18,500-seat New Orleans Sports Arena. The 
event was also held in New Orleans in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA earlier announced the First Union Center in  
Philadelphia as the site of the 2000 women's Final Four, the Kiel 
Center in St. Louis for 2001 and San Antonio's Alamodome for 2002.

<HEADLINE> Executive Linked To Thefts Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Slobodan Lunic found the good life in America --  
custom-made suits, a Porsche and a Mercedes-Benz in the garage and 
a glistening 40-foot Sea Ray yacht named ``Never Enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4-inch executive was the image of life in the fast  
lane, piloting one of his company's planes or hitting the town with 
a 27-year-old model on his arm while his wife and kids stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, it's anyone's guess what happened to the money that  
bankrolled Lunic's lavish existence. The 41-year-old Serbian 
disappeared June 19, two days before he was to go on trial charged 
with swindling 2,000 investors of more than $37 million. The move 
cost his own mother her two homes, which were put up as legal 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slobodan Lunic has skipped the country -- that's what I  
think,'' said attorney Steven Gustafson, who claims one of his 
clients went broke after paying $700,000 for bogus letters of 
credit from Lunic. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said $30 million is still missing, and federal  
prosecutor Marsha McClellan said some of the money investors paid 
to Lunic businesses was traced to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has alerted Interpol in hopes that Lunic might slip up  
as he tries to cross an international frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a year ago, Lunic was anything but the target of a manhunt.  
</P>
<P>
	From a 22nd-floor suite in the AT&AMP;T Corporate Center in Chicago,  
``Dan'' Lunic and partner Scott Holmberg invited investors to 
become do-it-yourself telecommunications tycoons. Thousands bought 
-- or thought they had bought -- pay telephones from the two men. 
</P>
<P>
	The price tag was up to $7,000 for each telephone -- an  
investment the brochures apparently claimed was all but guaranteed 
to pay 12 percent annually, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also were lured with the promise of a hefty tax break  
under the Americans with Disabilities Act for owning 
``disabled-access telephones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim it was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme: money  
pumped in by new investors was used to pay ``profits'' to other 
investors. There were no profits, prosecutors said: The 1,400 
phones bought in Florida, Illinois and Wisconsin were operating at 
a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the two entrepreneurs siphoned off cash for luxuries  
ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to a $100,000 account at 
Caesar's Palace, FBI agents testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmberg, 34, was arrested Sept. 15, trying to buy phony  
passports from an undercover FBI agent. He pleaded guilty to 
racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud charges and faces a sentence 
of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lunic was arrested in October, he insisted that he was  
innocent and blamed Holmberg for everything. Unimpressed, 
prosecutors prepared their case. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Lunic's 66-year-old mother pleaded with the judge to  
release her son on bond. Asked if she would put up her home as 
security for the bond, Spomenka Lunic said, ``I would sign my life 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lunic was jailed anyway. But on Jan. 21, U.S. District Judge  
Harry Leinenweber ordered him released provided that his mother 
post her two homes in suburban Berwyn as security for a $500,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors warned that Lunic might flee to his native Serbia,  
which has no extradition treaty with the United States. The judge 
ordered Lunic to wear an electronic home-monitoring bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
	Late on June 19, federal monitors detected tampering with the  
ankle bracelet. Police and FBI agents raced to the four-bedroom 
suburban Wheaton home where Lunic lived with his wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The bracelet was still there, but Lunic was gone.  
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, with Lunic still missing, a judge gave federal  
prosecutors permission to go ahead and confiscate the two houses 
put up by Lunic's mother. She must now move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost everything,'' she wailed to the judge. ``I've lost  
my son.''

<HEADLINE> Trade Group to Declare Privacy Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Direct Marketing Association will require  
all of its members doing business in the United States to disclose 
to consumers when they are sharing their private information with 
other marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy, which was expected to be announced Wednesday, is  
intended to prevent unwanted mail or phone solicitations from 
reaching consumers and protect consumers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group's members that deal with U.S. consumers -- which  
include 2,600 Internet companies, catalogs, banks, financial 
institutions, publishers, manufacturers, nonprofit organizations 
and books and music clubs -- will be required to adhere to the new 
privacy practices immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the time is now to step forward and assure  
consumers that information in marketers' hands is used responsibly, 
in beneficial ways, and with respect for individual choice,'' said 
H. Robert Wientzen, president and chief executive of the New 
York-based DMA. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct marketing is big business in the United States, with  
sales exceeding $1.3 trillion in 1998, according to a study for the 
DMA by the research firm The WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
	But direct marketers have been criticized in the past for  
sharing private consumer information to build their customer base. 
That means that if you donate money to a charity, you could end up 
with a pitch from a music club or a solicitation from a credit card 
company -- without ever requesting any information from either of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, companies will be required to disclose to  
customers when information about them -- such as their names and 
addresses -- may be shared with other marketers. They also must tell 
consumers that they have the option to not have their information 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies must also honor any individual's request to not  
receive solicitations, and they must use the DMA's two national 
name-removal services -- which track the names of people who don't 
want solicitations by mail or by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley lauded the new  
regulations, saying they are ``critical to building consumer 
confidence in the electronic marketplace by assuring that personal 
information will be handled fairly and responsibly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DMA will monitor companies by using secret shoppers, decoys,  
consumer complaints and visits to DMA member Web sites. Those not 
adhering to the new policies will risk public expulsion from the 
DMA. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the DMA, less than 1 percent of its members have  
refused to endorse the new policies, but the group declined to name 
any specific companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The DMA is the largest trade group for businesses interested in  
interactive and database marketing. Worldwide, it has nearly 4,500 
member companies, with about 2,600 required to comply with the new 
rules.

<HEADLINE> French Cheer TotalFina Bid for Elf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French government and market investors on  
Tuesday cheered TotalFina SA's hostile bid for rival oil concern 
Elf Aquitaine SA, leaving little maneuvering room for the target 
company that has voiced its opposition to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, which gave the green light for the $43 billion  
takeover bid late Monday, said Tuesday it favored the TotalFina 
offer because it would protect the companies from a U.S. or British 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good thing if a French group is nearly on the  
same level with the world's three biggest oil groups and, 
therefore, protected from a takeover by an Anglo-Saxon or American 
company,'' French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on 
RTL radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf's management was meeting its banking advisers Tuesday to  
prepare a response to the unsolicited takeover offer before 
presenting it to its board of directors. The company remained 
silent about whether it planned to fight the bid, designed to 
create the world's fourth largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government's support for the bid left Elf with few  
options to fend off the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elf's margin for maneuver appears small,'' said Hugues de la  
Presle, analyst at Standard and Poor's in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	De la Presle noted that the government's position limits Elf's  
ability to find a so-called white knight, most likely foreign, to 
help it fend off the hostile bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the government prefers that the deal remain French,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government, which retained a so-called golden share  
in Elf after its privatization earlier this decade, said late 
Monday it wouldn't use that share to block the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, analysts said a sharp rise in Elf shares on the Paris  
stock market reflects confidence in the deal and a belief that 
TotalFina could increase its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sent Elf shares up 1.2 percent to 179.4 euros ($183)  
on Tuesday after a 22 percent surge Monday. Shares of TotalFina 
rose 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TotalFina launched its surprise hostile bid Monday, offering Elf  
shareholders four TotalFina shares for three Elf shares. The 
all-stock offer is conditional upon shareholders holding at least 
two-thirds of Elf's shares accepting the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be the world's fourth-largest oil group --  
after the planned Exxon Corp.-Mobil Corp. combination, Royal Dutch 
Shell AG and BP Amoco PLC -- and would likely enjoy strong growth in 
output and be better able to compete with its U.S. and European 
rivals.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Boat Crash Death Toll at Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- Divers pulled two more bodies from the  
murky St. Croix River, completing their search for five victims of 
a weekend boat collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims found Monday were two 26-year-old men. The three  
other victims, all men in their early 30s, were found on Saturday 
and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boats apparently were traveling toward Hudson, Wis.,  
when they collided shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday. They reportedly 
had left an access area near P.D. Pappy's, a popular bar and 
restaurant in Stillwater, before colliding a few miles downriver. 
</P>
<P>
	George Black, a member of the National Transportation Safety  
Board, said investigators expect to have a report in six to eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned with liability or criminal prosecution,''  
Black said Monday. ``We're concerned about why it happened and 
making sure it doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said five people were reported missing following the  
crash, although some witnesses claimed they saw as many as nine 
people aboard the two crafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington County Sheriff Jim Frank said it remained unclear how  
many people were aboard. But he said it was a waste of resources to 
search a muddy river for people who hadn't been reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know who to search for even if there's someone out  
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In searching for bodies over the weekend, diver Ken Gilliam  
spent about 30 hours in the water, sifting through up to 2 feet of 
silt for victims and debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's black,'' he said. ``You end up swimming with your eyes  
shut. It kind of makes you forget.''

	TOKYO (AP) -- Four companies have agreed on a standard way to  
structure their computer chips, a move that will allow for smaller 
mobile phones and hand-held computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitachi, Intel, Mitsubishi Electric and Sharp made the  
announcement of the agreement in a release yesterday. Mitsubishi 
and Sharp had initially suggested the joint specifications last 
September.

	The companies will package the chips so that flash memory and  
static random access chips will be stacked in a single package, 
allowing for the smaller devices, the release said.

<HEADLINE> London Stocks Close at New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- London's Stock Exchange reached a new closing high  
today as European bourses elsewhere fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times Stock Exchange-100 index closed up 0.4  
percent at a new record of 6,620.6. London's provisional volume for 
the whole market was 960 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that London share prices were pushed higher by  
U.S. investors on Wall Street bidding technology shares up. 
</P>
<P>
	Automotive stocks in Frankfurt also had a good day. As  
exporters, they benefited from a weakening euro and from an influx 
of foreign investors in search of cheap euro-denominated stocks at 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical stocks extended gains but were unable to lift other  
European bourses Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed down 0.2 percent. The Paris  
CAC 40 index ended 0.1 percent lower, and Madrid's IBEX-35 index 
was down 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 594 European companies closed down  
0.85 points, or 0.3 percent, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index,

currency, finished down 0.33 points at 336.53.

<HEADLINE> French minister Backs Fina Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said  
Tuesday he favored Total Fina's hostile takeover bid for its French 
rival Elf Aquitaine because it would protect the companies from an 
American or British acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a good thing that these two French companies join up? I  
think the answer is certainly yes,'' Strauss-Kahn said on RTL 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good thing if a French group is nearly on the  
same level with the world's three biggest oil groups and, 
therefore, protected from a takeover by an Anglo-Saxon or American 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said late Monday that since the merger would not  
threaten national oil supplies, it does not plan to block the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not up to public powers to judge a deal between two  
private companies,'' Strauss-Kahn said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf was the French state's largest concern when it was  
privatized in 1994. The French government no longer has an equity 
stake, but retains a so-called golden share, allowing it to 
approve, or veto, any takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina launched its hostile bid Monday, saying it is  
offering Elf shareholders four Total Fina shares for three Elf 
shares. The all-stock offer, worth 42 billion euros ($42.94 
billion), is conditional upon 66.7 percent acceptance of the offer 
by Elf shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be Europe's third largest oil group after  
Royal Dutch Shell and BP Amoco, and would likely be better able to 
compete with its U.S. and European rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid was a further sign of the new aggressive mood in French  
business but wasn't welcomed by Elf, whose board said the offer had 
``not been the subject of any study or discussions.''

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 4.12  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower in late trading today as  
optimism about second-quarter earnings gave way to selling by 
investors eager to reap gains from last week's stunning gains. The 
Dow Jones industrial average closed down 4.12 at 11,135.12. Earlier 
in the session, the blue-chip index had risen 97.52 points above 
Friday's record close of 11,139.24. Broader stock indicators were 
also lower after a late selloff. The Nasdaq composite index fell 
4.24 to 2,736.78. Stocks faltered as weakness in the bond market 
and a desire to lock in profits outweighed the strong outlook for 
second-quarter profits.

unveiled in prototype form earlier this year at the Detroit auto 
show, will be called ``Insight'' and will be the world's most 
fuel-efficient, gasoline-powered, mass-production vehicle. The 
Insight uses a lightweight, 1-liter, three-cylinder gasoline engine

<HEADLINE> German Jobless Problem Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made slight  
progress in job creation talks with labor and management leaders 
Tuesday, winning a pledge by employers to offer trainee jobs to all 
``willing and able'' young Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are on a good path,'' Schroeder after three hours  
of round-table talks on ways to fight unemployment, the third 
session since the forum's December debut. He also appealed for 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder has made job creation his No. 1 priority, but the  
talks have been mired in bickering. Even after issuing a joint 
statement on Tuesday's talks, union and employer representatives 
clashed openly about whether it committed companies to a union 
demand for cutting overtime as a way to spread work around. 
</P>
<P>
	New unemployment data, meanwhile, showed the jobless rate edging  
down to 10.1 percent in June from 10.2 percent in May, mostly due 
to seasonal factors as the sluggish economy continued to hurt the 
labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Federal Labor Office, Bernhard Jagoda,  
attributed the decline mostly to seasonal factors, such as summer 
jobs in tourist centers or an upswing in outdoor construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted for those factors, the number of unemployed actually  
rose by 15,000 people, the office said. That was worse than 
analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In a potentially significant concession in Tuesday's meeting,  
union leaders dropped their opposition to talking about pay levels 
in future round-table sessions. It was unclear how much pressure it 
would create for the lower wages that German industry wants, but 
German Labor Federation chief Dieter Schulte said a ``taboo has 
been broken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides also agreed to make it easier for older workers to  
move from full-time to part-time work as a way to create new jobs. 
A new round of talks was set for sometime in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the talks, some union leaders accused the employers of  
stalling and threatened to boycott the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't allow ourselves to be dependent on whether the  
gentlemen from the employer side deem it fit to cooperate,'' said 
Juergen Peters, vice chairman of the powerful IG Metall industrial 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the head of the German Employers' Federation,  
Dieter Hundt, welcomed a recent government plan to lower corporate 
taxes and said the jobs talks should continue. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects the leaders to agree on an industry guarantee  
to offer trainee jobs to young people, but he gave no specifics.

<HEADLINE> Summers Likes House Move on Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration sees promise in the  
House version of a bill to lift Depression-era barriers to 
overlapping operations by banks, securities firms and insurance 
companies, new Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers says. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, approved last week in a 348-86 vote, omitted  
provisions the administration found objectionable in a bill to 
revamp the financial services industries that the Senate passed in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bills, which would lift restrictions on banks,  
securities firms and insurance companies entering into each others' 
businesses, must be reconciled into a single measure by a 
conference of House and Senate lawmakers. To become law, the 
compromise must be approved by both chambers, then signed by the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration favors the House approach, although Summers  
said that in some areas, such as privacy, even the House bill 
should be improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we do, of course, have some concerns, overall we were  
very pleased with the bill that the House passed by a very large 
margin last week,'' Summers said Tuesday in a chat with reporters 
at the Treasury. ``We think it certainly provides a basis for 
financial modernization legislation that the president can sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks came on his first full working day in the top job at  
the Treasury Department. Formerly the department's No. 2 official, 
Summers was sworn in Friday to replace Robert Rubin, who had served 
as Treasury secretary since 1995 after a 26-year career on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the House financial overhaul bill, the Senate measure  
would take banking regulatory powers away from the Office of the 
Comptroller, an administration agency inside the Treasury 
Department, in favor of the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly supports the Senate approach, one 
of few areas in which he has openly disagreed with the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also objects to a provision in the Senate  
measure that would exempt thousands of banks from requirements that 
they make loans to minorities and others often denied access to 
credit. That provision is not contained in the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, 44, a Harvard economics professor when he joined the  
administration in 1993, said his first day was filled with staff 
meetings to make sure that ``we didn't miss a beat during this 
transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was facing a ``very full agenda'' in the next few  
months at Treasury, starting next week with a trip to Brussels, 
Belgium, for a meeting of finance ministers of the world's seven 
richest industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, Italy and Canada. They will review financing 
requirements for reconstruction efforts in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also will review the global economy, Summers said, and  
the administration will continue to press its point that the United 
States cannot remain the only major economy doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a soaring U.S. trade deficit, the administration has  
been pressuring Europe and Japan to do more to boost domestic 
growth and provide more of a market for products from crisis 
countries in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to think that it is in the enormous interest of  
the global economy and our own economy that strong domestic demand 
be established in Japan and in Europe,'' Summers said.

<HEADLINE> Hot Dog Eating Champ Called Cheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A second-place finisher in an annual hot dog  
eating contest says he was robbed of first place and the coveted 
Mustard Yellow International Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	A news station's videotape showed the belt's eventual winner  
cramming a frankfurter into his mouth just before the gun went off 
to start the 12-minute foodfest at Coney Island on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Keiner, a 317-pound electrical inspector from Egg Harbor  
Township, N.J., won the Nathan's Famous eating spectacle by 
swallowing 20 and one-quarter hot dogs and buns. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Hardy finished a bite or two behind, at 20 franks. He  
demanded a Labor Day rematch after seeing a New York 1 tape of the 
event, which clearly shows Keiner with his lips wrapped around a 
dog before the start of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Contest organizers say that International Federation of Hot Dog  
Eating rules don't permit National Football League-style tape 
reviews and that Hardy should let sleeping dogs lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it appears that Keiner jumped the gun,'' Nathan's  
spokesman George Shea said Monday, ``the decision of the judges is 
final.''

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Tom Johnson Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Bruins vice president Tom Johnson, a Hall  
of Famer who won six Stanley Cups as a player and one as a coach, 
retired on Tuesday after 52 years in the NHL -- the last 36 in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson joined the Montreal Canadiens in 1947, and in 1959 was  
voted the league's top defenseman. He joined the Bruins in 1963 and 
played two years for Boston. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall 
of Fame in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years as an assistant to Bruins president Weston Adams  
Jr. and two more as an assistant to general manager Milt Schmidt, 
Johnson succeeded Harry Sinden as Boston coach in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	His teams won two conference titles and the 1972 Stanley Cup --  
Boston's last -- while posting a .738 winning percentage that 
remains the best in franchise history. He returned to the front 
office as an assistant general manager in 1973 and has been a vice 
president the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom has meant a lot to the Bruins organization,'' Sinden said.  
``His hockey knowledge, ability to judge talent, good humor and 
friendship have been an invaluable resource to me and every member 
of the Bruins organization over the years.''

<HEADLINE> Penagon Undergoing Major Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- In a blocked-off sector of the Pentagon,  
hidden from view, hordes of workers are toiling on a major 
Department of Defense initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it a top-secret military operation? No.  
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old Pentagon is being renovated.  
</P>
<P>
	Before work began last year, no major renovations had been done  
on the Pentagon since it was completed in 16 months on Jan. 15, 
1943. The building, a national landmark, is showing its age. Rusty 
water pipes occasionally burst. Old electrical wires fry and 
short-circuit. Lead paint chips fall from windows. Asbestos tiles 
cover many floors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You name a safety code, the Pentagon doesn't meet it,'' said  
Tom Fontana, a spokesman for the Pentagon Renovation Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The renovation costs are expected to reach $1.2 billion. That  
tab could soar to $3.4 billion when the price of relocating 
employees and building temporary offices is added. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything -- from the plumbing and air conditioning to the  
bathrooms and medical clinic -- is being rebuilt, overhauled or 
rewired. The entire 29-acre building will be gutted and rebuilt 
from the basement up. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 million pounds of debris will be removed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing will remain but the skeleton of the building,''  
Fontana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its rapid construction was a marvel of the World War II  
era, the hasty work is partly to blame for the building's problems. 
The work was done so quickly that many floor plans were lost in the 
rush. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, new electrical and computer wires were placed  
over old, resulting in confusing jumbles of cable spaghetti. As the 
number of employees grew to about 25,000, workers were crammed into 
basement offices and anywhere else space could be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Before work began, three other buildings were fixed up as  
temporary offices for the 5,000 workers who will be relocated 
during each renovation phase. High-security items were moved into 
new locations to allow national security operations to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Col. Robert Kirsch, who heads the effort to overhaul the  
Pentagon's telecommunications system, said extra work is being done 
so future projects will be easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make this work stand for the next 50 years,''  
Kirsch said.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Said Wanted To Be Famous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Last July 4, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith  
strolled along the tree-lined streets of Bloomington, tucking 
hundreds of racist leaflets onto car windshields and under doors. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, police said, he charged through the same college  
town with a gun, killing a Korean student during a two-state 
shooting spree that also left a black man dead in Illinois. Late 
Sunday, when much of the country had its attention turned to 
fireworks and barbecues, the 21-year-old Smith was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to him between the two holidays was, according to  
those who knew him, a horrible culmination of racist outrage that 
had been building for years. Perhaps even when he was growing up in 
an upscale Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Smith shaved his skull, skinhead style, and he had his  
chest tattooed with the words ``Sabbath Breaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he was made a ``brother'' of the World Church of the  
Creator, an avowedly white supremacist group based in East Peoria, 
Ill. Its leader, Matt Hale, has been denied a law license by the 
Illinois bar because of his racist preachings. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith apparently found acceptance in the group, whose members  
greet each other with the acronym ``Rahowa,'' which stands for 
``Racial Holy War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's habit of littering the Indiana University campus in  
Bloomington with racist leaflets had become notorious at the school 
of about 30,000 students, which Smith attended in 1998 before 
dropping out. He had been a criminal justice major. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Indiana student Tyrese Alexander, who is black, said  
Smith's racist views were so well known at the school that he 
brought them up for discussion in his African-American studies 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just had an angry look on his face,'' said Alexander, 23.  
</P>
<P>
	At first, a few Indiana students started writing letters to the  
campus newspaper complaining of Smith's propaganda. Smith responded 
with his own letters signed under the pseudonym ``August Smith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``White Nationalists have no desire to rule over other races;  
instead we want separation from nonwhites. This is why White 
Nationalists are working for an independent white nation,'' he 
wrote on June 11, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	By the fall, the trickle of complaints about the leaflets had  
become a protest march of hundreds of people through the center of 
town, said Jeffrey Willsey, one of the event's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was unbowed, but possibly humbled, too, Willsey said.  
Smith, whom police say was seldom seen with anyone else, stood on a 
corner and watched the marchers pass, holding a sign that read, 
``No Hate Speech Means No Free Speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we are as a community coming together, and here's this  
poor guy standing out there all buy himself, entirely alone,'' 
Willsey said. ``I thought, this is a really pathetic human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Smith wrote another letter to the Indiana Daily  
Student newspaper. ``America,'' he said, ``has become increasingly 
nonwhite and the constitutional rights of racial activists have 
increasingly been infringed upon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Smith appeared as a witness for Hale at a hearing  
before a bar association panel. He said that at times he had 
``considered violent acts to achieve racial goals, but Hale 
counseled me to act peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 goal is to straighten out the white man's  
thinking,'' he said. ``We're the new minority being crushed left 
and right. We're in a life and death struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That struggle apparently boiled over last weekend. Police said  
Smith apparently targeted minorities, killing two and wounding at 
least eight others before fatally shooting himself late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Smith's ex-girlfriends seemed unsurprised by his violent  
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things he was doing were not working -- distributing  
pamphlets and things. It wasn't stirring up news or making 
headlines,'' said Elizabeth Sahr. ``He wanted to make a name for 
himself, to show people that this could be done if you wanted to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``This was the Fourth of July. This was his freedom  
day from the government.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Cromer on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Tripp Cromer has an  
irregular heart beat and was put on the 15-day disabled list 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cromer, 31, was sent back to Los Angeles for testing and  
evaluation by Dr. Michael Mellman. Cromer was hitting .208 with two 
home runs and eight RBIs in 29 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't know anything more until the tests are performed,''  
Los Angeles manager Davey Johnson said before Tuesday's game with 
the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second player within a week to be diagnosed with an  
irregular heart beat. New York Yankees left fielder Shane Spencer 
was hospitalized during the weekend with a similar problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles filled Cromer's spot by activating shortstop Mark  
Grudzielanek, who missed 28 games because of a fractured right 
hand. Grudzielanek was 4-for-16 during a four-game rehabilitation 
assignment at Class-A San Bernardino. 
</P>

said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Tuesday, with prices falling in Tokyo and Hong Kong but surging in 
Seoul and Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 84.33  
points, or 0.47 percent, to close the day's trading at 18,050.73. 
On Monday, the average rose 202.59 points, or 1.13 percent, 
finishing at 18,135.06 -- its highest closing level since September 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks fell on profit-taking. The Nikkei average had  
gained 3.5 percent in the three sessions prior to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is adjusting its speed,'' said Hidenori Karaki, a  
general manager Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The average had surged Monday after the Bank of Japan's  
quarterly ``tankan'' survey showed that business sentiment had 
improved in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.08 yen  
in late trading, down 0.50 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange also fell on  
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, lost 134.13 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 
14,372.61. On Monday, the index had gained 322.16 points, or 2.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the profit-taking was expected after the index  
gained 7.2 percent in the past two sessions in reaction to record 
gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea shares closed sharply higher for a second straight  
day, boosted by the rapid pace of the country's economic recovery, 
and expectations that local interest rates will remain stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 26.59 points, or 2.8  
percent, to 989.43, its highest level since Nov. 6, 1995 when it 
reached 992.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian stocks also closed sharply higher as foreign and  
local bargain- hunters bought back shares whose prices were seen as 
cheap, shrugging off domestic political concerns that recently 
depressed sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 2.4 percent,  
or 16.443 points, to 681.587. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower on profit-taking.  
The Straits Times Index closed at 2,175.51, down 35.93 points, or 
1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed as investors took profits in  
technology shares amid concern that the market has been overbought. 
The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 138.86 points, or 
1.61 percent, to 8,454.49. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by  
demand for local forestry stocks. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital 
Index rose 19.90 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,160.70. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: The Philippine stock index finished lower as investors  
cashed in on gains made in the past five sessions. The 30-company 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 11.31 points, or 0.4 percent, 
to 2,10.36. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly higher, with  
solid gains in market heavyweight News Corp. and the 
telecommunications sector offsetting losses in the banks. The All 
Ordinaries Index closed at 3,081.9, up 3.8 points, or 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian stocks closed mostly higher, although  
the main index slipped because of a fall in the share price of 
Malaysia's largest telecommunications company, Telekom Malaysia 
Bhd. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, closed at 
846.28, down 0.78 points. 
</P>

<P>
	FREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- A convict paroled from San Quentin Prison  
over the weekend is wanted in the kidnapping, stabbing and shooting 
of two young women who were left for dead in a rural canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	A man believed to be Donald Paul Gatson, 22, got away Monday as  
a parole officer arrested his alleged accomplice, Matthew Mark 
Koslowki, 18, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men are suspected of abducting two young women, ages 15  
and 18, from a high school Monday, forcing them to take money out 
of a cash machine at a 7-Eleven, and then taking them to Palomares 
Canyon, about 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	There, the young women were shot, stabbed and left for dead in a  
ditch. Police said the women were each stabbed more than 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women were in critical condition Tuesday. Their names were  
not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Dennis Madsen said Gatson was paroled Saturday

knee, was eligible to be activated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After an MRI last week revealed a slightly torn ligament, the  
two-time All-Star feared he might need reconstructive surgery, 
which would end his season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least I think I'm coming back now,'' Lopez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the watch of assistant trainer Jeff Porter, Lopez wore a  
knee brace as he ran a series of figure eights, quick starts and 
stops on the outfield grass at Turner Field. Lopez said he felt a 
``little bit'' of discomfort but no significant pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically nothing,'' he said of the pain. ``I was  
impressed because I thought it was going to hurt. The knee brace 
really helped. I didn't feel any pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez has been unable to squat in the catcher's stance while  
wearing the brace for more than a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to go out there and play, not 100 percent  
healthy, but close to it,'' Lopez said. ``I don't want to go now 
and the next day hurt myself again. I want to make sure I can 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez is hitting .321 this season with 11 homers and 37 RBIs. He  
hurt his knee June 20 at Arizona as he slid into second base.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise a Bit; Dow Up 41.79 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were slightly higher today as technology  
stocks extended their gains and outpaced the blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
41.79 at 11,181.03, picking up steam after a lackluster morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 7.18 at 1,398.40, and the Nasdaq composite index, 
which has a large representation of high-tech issues, was up 34.84 
at 2,775.86. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long weekend in observance of Independence Day, Wall  
Street traders returned to markets that were at record levels. On 
Friday, the Dow rose 72.82 to close at 11,139.24, easily topping 
its previous record close of 11,107.19, set May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, the Dow rose 5.56 percent or 586.68 points, the  
biggest weekly point gain in its 103-year history. The S&AMP;P 500 and 
the Nasdaq also hit new records. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were undoubtedly taking some profits from  
last week's stunning gains. Also, with little news to move the 
stock market, the bond market set a slightly negative tone today. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell, sending the yield  
up to 6.04 percent from 6.0 percent late Friday. Traders consider 
bond yields above 6.0 percent a threat to stocks, partially because 
at that level, they may present an attractive alternative to 
volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, however, the weakness in the bond market was being  
outweighed by renewed optimism for second-quarter profits and for 
the continued run of the bull market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, Prudential's famously bullish technical analyst,  
said in a research note today the Dow could hit 13,000 within 1999. 
Acampora's most conservative estimate for the year is in the range 
of 12,000 to 12,3000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be aggressive because we believe that this summer season will  
be a very exciting and bullish affair,'' Acampora said. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable reports on Intel fed excitement in the Nasdaq market.  
Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Prudential Securities raised their 
ratings on Intel stock, saying the semiconductor maker is 
successfully managing stiff price competition. Intel rose 1 5/8 to 
65 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Internet search engine provider Yahoo! rose 9 7/8 to 188.  
Yahoo! will release its second-quarter earnings Wednesday, and many 
analysts expect a strong report. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 309.7 million 
shares, well ahead of Friday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.05 at 658.17, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.70 at 808.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000, which measures the performance of smaller  
companies, rose 2.15 to 458.66.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Web Site Back After Hacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The state shut down its Internet web page Monday  
after a computer hacker briefly took it over. 
</P>
<P>
	The site was up and running normally Tuesday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	The state shut down the infected site shortly after television  
station KHNL informed computer experts of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The web page break-in occurred on a state holiday when only a  
skeleton crew of computer experts was working. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Hawaii computer network expert Brian Chee said he  
is not surprised by the prank. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of folk out there in the world that have just  
way too much time on their hands,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State information on the web page was briefly replaced by a  
series of coded messages. Some messages made references to 
homosexuality, and others warned about future hack attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Any system that allows public access over the Internet, like the  
state's page, may be vulnerable, Chee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has a public access to their system should consider  
running some firewall software, he said. Firewalls are software 
programs to ward off hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chee said his department averages two hack attempts a day, from  
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had to block out the entire country of Brazil because  
we've had so many crack attempts from so many locations in 
Brazil,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistani Shells Hit Indian Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- Pakistani shells slammed into an oil tanker  
convoy on a strategic highway today while Indian troops and Islamic 
fighters battled over mountain peaks in the disputed region of 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelling came two days after President Clinton met with  
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and raised hopes of a speedy 
end to the two-month-old battle in the snowcapped Himalayas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials in Washington said Sharif and Clinton agreed that  
Pakistan-based fighters would withdraw from the Indian part of 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	But India says there has been no sign of withdrawal and no letup  
in the shelling from both sides of the 1972 cease-fire line that 
divides Kashmir between the two nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people are saying the war is over,'' Indian Interior  
Minister Lal Krishna Advani told Hindu right-wing activists in New 
Delhi. ``I say no, it is not over. The military operations will 
continue until the eviction of the last Pakistani intruder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India says it is fighting Pakistani soldiers and hundreds of  
Islamic militants who want to separate Muslim-majority Kashmir from 
India. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan acknowledges its forces are trading nearly constant  
artillery fire with India. Islamabad, however, says its troops are 
not involved in the fighting on the other side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pakistani newspaper today quoted Pakistan's army chief as  
saying the country will ask Islamic insurgents to withdraw, but 
that the final decision will be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Urdu-language Jang newspaper, Gen.  
Pervez Musharraf said 1,500 to 2,000 ``Kashmiri freedom fighters'' 
would be asked to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still has to be seen what their answer will be,'' he was  
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamic guerrillas, meanwhile, said they would die before  
withdrawing from their mountain bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question of a retreat. . . if we don't fight now  
Indians will press forward in our area,'' said Mohammed Shoaib, a 
Muslim rebel who has been fighting in the bitter cold of the Kargil 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather is our greatest enemy,'' he said. ``Only Allah's  
help keeps us going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Pakistani shells hit an oil tanker convoy today on National  
Highway 1, they struck one truck, which exploded in a ball of fire, 
and severely dented another. 
</P>
<P>
	Army engineers worked to clear the wreckage while military and  
civilian vehicles were backed up for four miles on the only link 
between Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar, and the remote battle 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers earlier had mistakenly reported that two oil  
tankers exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many shells exploded all around us, five or six came really  
close,'' said civilian truck driver Amin Ahmed. A civilian truck 
also was hit by shells about a mile away and lay half submerged in 
a river. The driver survived. 
</P>
<P>
	India captured a strategic peak, the 16,500-foot Tiger Hill, on  
Sunday to evict fighters who could direct Pakistani artillery fire 
onto the highway and Indian military camps. Although the shelling 
had diminished, the attack on the tankers indicated there may still 
be hundreds of Islamic fighters on vantage points up to 2 1/2 miles 
inside Indian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Indian army is now focused on Batalik, the most  
difficult of three major battlegrounds, where officers say up to 
300 Islamic fighters are entrenched on jagged ridges. 
</P>
<P>
	India says it has pushed the intruders back 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 miles all  
along the 85-mile front since the heights were seized and stone 
bunkers were built in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	India says 542 Pakistani soldiers and more than 150 Islamic  
guerrillas have been killed in the fighting, while 283 Indian 
soldiers have died, 451 were wounded and 10 are missing. Pakistan 
and the guerrillas have not provided recent casualty figures, and 
India's figures could not be independently confirmed.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Talks Up Jobs, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) -- Saying the whole country benefits  
when more people work, President Clinton on Tuesday urged Congress 
to embrace his plan for tax credits to businesses that set up shop 
in downtrodden communities. ``It is not a handout, but it is darned 
sure a hand up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushing to beat a threatened thunderstorm, Clinton greeted a  
crowd of about 1,000 in the parking lot of a Walgreen's drug store, 
which the White House said was the first new retail store to open 
in East St. Louis in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Congress should approve his so-called ``new  
markets'' initiative because it makes it more appealing for 
businesses to operate ``in any high unemployment, high poverty area 
anywhere in America,'' without heavy reliance on the government to 
turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need help from Republicans and Democrats alike. This is not  
a party issue,'' Clinton said. ``Nobody is going to put any money 
here if they think they're going to lose it. But it makes it more 
likely that people will do it. ... It is not a handout, but it is 
darned sure a hand up, and you are entitled to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined by Cathy Bessant, president of Bank of  
America's community development division, who announced a $500 
million capital investment fund targeted at often-overlooked 
communities. That amount included $100 million for the Community 
Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provided the grants 
Clinton announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is real money to be made in these markets,'' Bessant  
said. ``We think we can be even more successful when we create 
markets that work in inner cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Debra Powell said Clinton's plan would encourage more  
businesses to follow the Walgreen's example of investing in her 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton came here at the close of a day devoted to talking up  
jobs and investment in Clarksdale, Miss., that he said can breathe 
new life into the virtually forgotten town on the Mississippi 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	But the promise of jobs and a blossoming economy meant little to  
Flora Bell Clay, 61, disabled after a heart attack and needing help 
to keep her home inhabitable. Her income is too low to get loans, 
and local organizations didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't pay nothing when I ain't got nothing,'' Mrs. Clay  
said, waiting under a blazing sun to talk to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he hoped private money he is trying to  
leverage for places like Clarksdale can ultimately solve problems 
like Mrs. Clay's, from dilapidated housing to inferior schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just that there's not enough money in this area for  
good investment. Somebody has to decide it's a good investment,'' 
Clinton told about 600 people gathered in Waterfield Cabinets' hot, 
tin-roofed warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced $46.5 million in community development  
grants, including $15 million for the Mississippi Delta, where, he 
said, the poverty and unemployment rates far exceed national 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements were part of Clinton's four-day cross country  
tour to highlight the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner 
cities and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving Tuesday night in Rapid City, S.D., Clinton decided to  
make a nocturnal visit to Mount Rushmore. Clinton had never seen 
the monument and accepted an offer of a guided excursion from 
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour also called attention to successful projects like  
Waterfield Cabinets, which opened with a secured loan from the 
Enterprise Corporation of the Delta, which provides capital and 
credit to small businesses that wouldn't qualify for conventional 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, accompanied by Rep. Benny Thompson, D-Miss., and  
Mayor Richard Webster, walked past the abandoned New Roxy Theater 
and the Pac Man game room to the corner of Issaquena Avenue and Dr. 
Martin Luther King Drive. A crowd cheered and chanted, ``Welcome, 
Bill,'' and, ``Don't mess with Bill.'' A large nightclub across the 
street, Club Champagne, sat shuttered and closed. 
</P>
<P>
	For an empowerment zone area, there was little economic  
activity. Some residents said $40 million in empowerment funds is 
not finding its way here, and they wanted Clinton to know that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a sit-down meeting, not in this hot sun, so we can  
tell him the real issues that face the people in the Mississippi 
Delta,'' said Henry Bonner, 41, of nearby Mound Bayou. ``The 
playing field needs to be leveled. And the lending institutions are 
so racist it's a crying shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, accompanying the president  
along with some corporate leaders and Cabinet secretaries, said: 
``When you look at the market, it's not just race. These areas have 
been denied access to capital. Now it's the resources gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Calhoun, 47, from Montgomery Ala., whose Calhoun  
Enterprises owns the 14-store Calhoun Foods-Bigbear Supermarket 
chain in Alabama and Georgia, said his company had $81 million in 
revenue last year but only a $300,000 line of credit. To continue 
growing, opening stores in places like Clarksdale, he needs a $2 
million line of credit, said Calhoun, who was part of Clinton's 
entourage in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm back at a time where I need it just as bad as I did when I  
first started,'' Calhoun said, when he had to pay 22 percent 
interest to borrow money. ``I keep having to prove myself and I've 
been out here 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksdale, Clinton ducked into a flower shop and talked with  
owner Shirley Fair and three other small-business owners. Then he 
greeted the crowd outside, eventually reaching Mrs. Clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she did grasp his hand and told him her dilemma, she  
didn't get her house fixed. ``I told him I need help bad. He never 
did say I could get help.''

<HEADLINE> Summers Likes House Move on Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is pleased with a  
House-passed bill to sweep away Depression-era banking restrictions 
and hopes it will serve as the basis for compromise with a 
far-different Senate measure, new Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By a lopsided 343-86 vote, the House approved legislation last  
week that would overturn prohibitions on banks, securities firms 
and insurance companies entering into each others' businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure did not contain provisions that the  
administration has found objectionable in a Senate bill passed in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure would take banking regulatory powers away  
from the Office of the Comptroller, an administration agency inside 
the Treasury Department, in favor of the Federal Reserve. Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly supports the Senate 
approach, one of the few areas where he has openly disagreed with 
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also objects to a provision in the Senate  
measure that would exempt thousands of banks from requirements that 
they make loans to minorities and others traditionally denied 
access to credit. That provision is not contained in the House 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bills must not be reconciled in a conference of House  
and Senate lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the administration believes the House proposal is  
clearly the better version of the two although he said that in such 
areas as privacy even the House bill could be improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we do, of course, have some concerns, overall we were  
very pleased with the bill that the House passed by a very large 
margin last week,'' Summers said. ``We think it certainly provides 
a basis for financial modernization legislation that the president 
can sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers spoke with reporters Tuesday on his first full working  
day in the top Treasury job. He was sworn in Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his first day had been filled with staff meetings to  
make sure that ``we didn't miss a beat during this transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, 44, a Harvard economics professor when he joined the  
administration in 1993, has served as the No. 2 official at 
Treasury since Rubin took the top job in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who had joined the administration after a 26-year career  
on Wall Street, sought to pave the way for his deputy and attempted 
to calm financial market concerns about Summers' lack of Wall 
Street experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said he was facing a ``very full agenda'' in the next  
few months at Treasury, starting next week when he will go to 
Brussels, Belgium, for a meeting with other finance ministers for 
the world's seven richest industrial countries -- the United States, 
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- to review 
financing requirements for reconstruction efforts in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the group will also review the global economy. He  
said the administration will continue to press its point that the 
United States cannot remain the only major economy doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a soaring U.S. trade deficit, the administration has  
been pressuring Europe and Japan to do more to boost domestic 
growth and provide more of a market for products from crisis 
countries in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to think that it is in the enormous interest of  
the global economy and our own economy that strong domestic demand 
be established in Japan and in Europe,'' Summers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The hot dogs are tastier, the seats more  
comfortable, the views much better and the open air glorious, 
Seattle Mariners fans said Monday at the dedication of their new 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	So what if service at the concession stands was slow and the  
relish table ill-designed? 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Ken Griffey Jr. first weighed in on the side of  
public officials in a dispute over financing, a crowd estimated at 
15,000 cheered the impending return of outdoor baseball after more 
than two decades in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of who should pay for $100 million in cost overruns  
on the $517 million project seemed almost lost in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care, just as long as they play ball here,'' said Rob  
Eason of Spanaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're back to the way baseball ought to be played --  
outdoors, on the grass,'' Orlin VanWieringen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners could hardly have ordered more perfect weather for  
the festivities, a cloudless sky with a light breeze and 
temperatures edging into the 70s -- the warmest, sunniest weather in 
more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long we have suffered with less than the best. Today  
we have the best,'' Mayor Paul Schell said. ``It's time to 
celebrate a great stadium that all of our children and our 
children's children can enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was evident only in the lackluster applause and a  
few boos for club president Chuck Armstrong, who ignored the snub 
and proclaimed, ``What a great day out for baseball! Ain't baseball 
great?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was a last-minute stand-in for Mariners chairman John  
Ellis, who has borne most of the load in the club's demand for $60 
million in additional public funding. 
</P>
<P>
	An article Sunday in The Seattle Times said Ellis and others  
suggested the Mariners might trade Griffey or Alex Rodriguez if the 
demand was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time this team has something come up, it's always me and  
Alex to blame,'' Griffey told The News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash., on 
Sunday after a phone call from ESPN. ``We love the game. We love 
playing in front of 40,000, 50,000 fans at home. Why does John 
Ellis want to make it so hard for us to bring those people out? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not us asking for more money here. I've been here 11  
years, Jay Buhner has been here 11 years. How much money do we have 
to defer? I deferred $5 million in my salary and offered to defer 
$10 million. They turned it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team was in Anaheim to play the Angels on Monday night, so  
the players missed the dedication.

<HEADLINE> Dan O'Brien's Appeal Is Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dan O'Brien, the three-time world champion and  
Olympic gold medalist in the decathlon, will not compete in the 
World Championships next month at Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien told The Associated Press on Tuesday the International  
Amateur Athletic Federation had denied his request for a wild-card 
berth into the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team for the meet was determined at the USA  
Championships at Eugene, Ore., last month. The first three 
finishers in each event qualified for the team, if they met the 
standards for the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional entries were allowed if an athlete was a defending  
world champion. O'Brien, the world champion in 1991, 1993 and 1995, 
skipped the USA Championships because of injuries. He also missed 
the 1997 World Championships because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien lost his world record to Tomas Dvorak of the Czech  
Republic on Sunday. Dvorak amassed 8,994 points, just missing the 
``magical barrier'' of 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien said his agent, Brad Hunt, received a fax from the IAAF  
Monday night and a phone call from the world governing body 
Tuesday, informing him of the denial for a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed,'' O'Brien said. ``In fact, it's good for  
me. Now, I know there's somebody out there who can compete against 
me. I always thought I was out there by myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think I'm the world's greatest athlete. He's never  
beaten me and until he does, I'll continue to think that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope he doesn't break 9,000, so I can have a shot at it  
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien won't attempt any more decathlons this year. He plans to  
have surgery this month on his left big toe and his left patella 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in constant pain,'' he said. ``I have zero ability to  
jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his injuries, he had hoped to compete in Spain.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I had gotten into the worlds, I would have done my best to  
prepare,'' he said. ``Now, I'm hoping to come back in the Olympic 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Sloan, O'Brien's coach, had been looking forward to a  
matchup against Dvorak at the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They match up very well,'' he said Monday, before learning of  
the IAAF's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	That matchup will have to wait until 2000.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Sale Crushes Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England sold 25 metric tons of gold  
Tuesday -- about 3.5 percent of its reserves -- as the first step in 
a massive selloff that depressed world gold prices when it was 
announced in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price was $261.20 per troy ounce, the bank said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell about $6 to $282.40 per troy ounce on May 7, the day  
the sale was announced, and the price has declined steadily. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, spot gold prices in Europe hit a 20-year record low at  
$255.75 a troy ounce on speculative short selling following the 
auction. In London, the gold price closed at $256.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury said it was selling gold to buy U.S. dollars,  
Japanese yen and the European Union's new euro currency to create a 
more balanced cash reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Gold Council, which represents the mining industry,  
campaigned against the sale in national newspaper advertisements, 
and it delivered a petition with 10,000 signatures to the 
government on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain intends to sell 125 metric tons of gold this year and  
next, with auctions every other month. Over the longer term, it 
plans to reduce British gold reserves from 715 ton to around 300 
ton. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, traditionally a safe haven for investors in times of  
turmoil, peaked at $875 per troy ounce in January 1980 -- a time 
when Soviet troops were moving into Afghanistan, the U.S. inflation 
rate was in double figures and oil prices were rising rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, even central banks no longer feel compelled to maintain  
large gold stockpiles to maintain confidence in their currencies 
and economies. Argentina, Luxembourg and Australia also have sold 
gold, and Switzerland says it is considering disposing of some of 
its gold.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Sanctions on Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has imposed financial  
sanctions against the Taliban religious militia that rules 
Afghanistan in retaliation for its reputed support of Osama bin 
Laden, the alleged international terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed an executive order Monday imposing the sanctions.  
Bin Laden was placed on the FBI's ``Ten Most Wanted List'' last 
month with a $5 million reward offered for information leading to 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this day, bin Laden and his network continue to plan new  
attacks against Americans without regard for the innocence of their 
intended victims or for those non-Americans who might get in the 
way of his attack,'' Clinton said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his executive order ``will deepen the international  
isolation of the Taliban, limit its ability to support terrorist 
networks and demonstrate the need to conform to the accepted norms 
of international behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In practical terms, the impact of the sanctions probably will be  
modest, a senior administration official acknowledged, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. It is not clear what assets might be 
affected, the official said, but declared that the action sends a 
clear message that the United States will not tolerate those who 
shelter international terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade with Afghanistan totaled $24 million in 1998. The  
United States has sanctions in effect covering more than two dozen 
countries, from Angola to Zambia, accounting for half of the 
world's population. 
</P>
<P>
	The order freezes any property of the Taliban within U.S.  
jurisdiction. It also prohibits transactions and trade with the 
Taliban or in territory controlled by the Taliban, preventing any 
U.S. investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States demands that the Taliban expel bin Laden to  
the United States for trial or to a third country where he would 
face justice for alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration accuses bin Laden of masterminding  
the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 
which killed more than 200 people and injured thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says bin Laden is still hiding in Afghanistan. Others  
suggest he is on his way elsewhere -- Somalia, Chechnya, even Iraq -- 
preferably somewhere gripped by anarchy and rife with anti-U.S. 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Taliban leaders have insisted they do not know where he is.  
</P>
<P>
	In London, the Observer newspaper reported Sunday that bin Laden  
moved two months ago into a new base in Afghanistan, into an old 
collective farm in the village of Farmihadda, a few miles south of 
Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border.

	Clinton Laments Midwest Shootings  
</P>
<P>
	EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) -- President Clinton urged all  
Americans to ``rid our hearts of hatred, immediately'' in response 
to the deadly drive-by shootings in Illinois and Indiana apparently 
carried out by a white supremacist. Visiting Illinois as part of 
his national four-day poverty tour, the president said the 
shootings underscored the need for the United States to strengthen 
its hate crimes laws. Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, shot and killed 
himself after killing two people and wounding nine.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the third day in a row, temperatures climbed  
to 100 degrees in the East, triggering blackouts and making for an 
unpleasant return to work for people who spent the holiday weekend 
in shorts and T-shirts. At least eight deaths have been blamed on 
the heat in the Midwest and East. The heat also stalled commuter 
trains and subways in New York.

rulers for harboring Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile wanted for 
last year's U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa. Clinton signed an 
executive order yesterday imposing the sanctions against the 
Taliban faction, which controls most of the Southwest Asian nation.

accidentally cause air bags to deploy. If the tow hooks come in 
sharp contact with curbs, pot holes or similar road hazards, they 
can cause the air bags to deploy, the automaker said today. The

	BEIJING (AP) -- Flooding along China's Yangtze River has killed  
240 people and caused more than $3 billion in economic losses since 
the flood season began in late June, the government said today. 
Heavy rains have swelled the Yangtze and its tributaries, 
demolishing homes by the tens of thousands, destroying 1.6 million 
acres of crops and damaging 8.6 million acres, the Civil Affairs 
Ministry said. Government rescue teams have moved 1.84 million 
people from inundated areas and distributed 5,000 tents.

<HEADLINE> Coca Cola Polish Mineral Water Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A Polish sanitary laboratory said Tuesday  
that mold and bacteria found in samples of mineral water bottled by 
Coca-Cola in Poland posed no threat of food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	While declaring the mold and bacteria nonhazardous, officials  
from the provincial Sanepid laboratory said the tested samples of 
Coca-Cola products were below sanitary standards, the official PAP 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings matched test results previously announced by  
Coca-Cola and a Dutch laboratory. No illness from drinking 
Coca-Cola products has been reported in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola recalled its estimated 180,000 16-ounce plastic  
bottles of Bonaqa Plus brand mineral water on Friday after the 
bacteria showed up in testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall of Bonaqa Plus, a new product fortified with calcium  
and magnesium, extended a problematic summer for Coca-Cola in 
Europe. More than 200 people complained of illness last month from 
drinking Coca-Cola beverages in Belgium and France, leading to a 
costly recall of the company's products in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 25, a Polish consumer discovered mold in a bottle of  
mineral water, which caused the company last week to withdraw all 
of its beverages in 12 ounce returnable glass bottles. The further 
recall of the bacteria-contaminated Bonaqa Plus plastic bottles 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola said it took the extraordinary steps of recalling  
beverages to maintain public trust in its products. It said 
returnable bottles would be washed better, and production was shut 
down at its bottling plant in southwest Poland to check for the 
source of the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanitary inspectors told the news conference the plant would  
resume production once new tests show there was no more 
contamination.

<HEADLINE> Reconstructing the Shooting Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The sun set and the Sabbath had just begun as a  
group of Orthodox Jewish worshippers headed to synagogue. A 
stranger stepped out of a shiny blue Taurus. Soon, the staccato of 
gunfire shattered the night, bullets whizzing past one man's head. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter had calmly approached a group of men and boys  
wearing traditional black hats and long black coats, aimed a pair 
of semiautomatic handguns and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	He got back into his car and slowly drove through the North Side  
neighborhood. He turned the corner, shooting two more men. A block 
south, two more. He drove on a few blocks, stopping three more 
times, all the time shooting from his car -- shattering the glass on 
the passenger side. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 15 minutes Friday night, six Jews were wounded; one was  
hit in his back as he threw his young son to the ground, then 
covered him with his own body. The driver was gone -- without 
uttering a word. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon police had a sketch: a white man in his 20s, medium build,  
short, dark brown hair, driving a '90s model Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunt was on.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the beginning of what police say was a three-day rampage  
by a white supremacist who targeted minorities in two states over 
the Fourth of July weekend. He is suspected of killing a black 
former basketball coach and a Korean graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended Sunday night with a third death on a quiet rural road,  
235 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, authorities say, the person killed was the suspected  
gunman -- Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21. Smith, who had the words 
``Sabbath Breaker'' tattooed across his chest, was well-known to 
authorities for distributing hate-message leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County sheriff's deputies say they chased Smith after he  
carjacked a minivan in southern Illinois; he shot himself once as 
he was pursued, they say, then two more times -- in the leg and the 
chest -- as he struggled with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over,'' Sheriff Gerald L. Benjamin declared  
Monday. ``I don't know what caused this but it's very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Once the shootings began, it took just 17 minutes before he  
struck again. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was fatal.  
</P>
<P>
	The scene was a tranquil tree-lined street in north suburban  
Skokie, where Ricky Byrdsong, a 43-year-old former Northwestern 
University basketball coach, had been walking with his son and 
daughter, about a block from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say at least seven shots were fired at Byrdsong; he was  
hit once in the back and died in surgery hours later. His children 
were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The final shots that evening came at 9:20 p.m. in the northern  
suburb of Northbrook, about 15 miles from where the men were 
attacked outside the synagogue. This time, police say, an 
Asian-American couple honked their car horn at a slow-moving light 
blue Taurus in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Four shots were fired, but no one was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Chicago police began piecing together the shootings  
with ballistic reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the shooter had .22-caliber and .380-caliber  
semiautomatics. They said at least 32 bullets and shells were 
recovered, but perhaps as many as 50 shots were fired -- all within 
one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday, mourners were coming to the Byrdsong home; a  
makeshift memorial of flowers, cards and teddy bears was forming at 
the shooting scene. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the gunman had moved on.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, there were more ominous reports of a man in a blue  
Taurus taking aim at black men walking down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the scene was 175 miles south of Chicago, in the  
state capital, Springfield. Three black men reported being shot at 
in two separate instances. One was hit in the buttocks; the others 
weren't injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two hours later, 35 miles away, a black minister in  
Decatur was shot in the arm and the hip, and investigators believe 
it was the same gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before midnight, an additional 50 miles away, a gunman  
pulled up to a group of five women and one man -- all of Asian 
descent -- standing on a corner near the University of Illinois 
campus and fired three or four shots, according to police. The man, 
a 22-year-old graduate student of Taiwanese descent, was hit in the 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman moved on again ---- this time, apparently, crossing  
state lines. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was a steamy July Fourth and the minister of the Korean  
United Methodist Church was preparing for Sunday Sabbath services 
in Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard bang, bang, bang, bang,'' Byungchill Hahn recalled  
with tear-filled eyes. ``I thought it was a firecracker with the 
Fourth of July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not.  
</P>
<P>
	The minister ran out to find Won-Joon Yoon, a 26-year-old  
doctoral student in economics, collapsing on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, authorities knew the name of their suspect.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, a young man who had been a  
member of the World Church of the Creator, a white supremacist 
organization in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith -- who sometimes liked to use the first name ``August''  
because he thought Benjamin sounded too Jewish -- attended the 
prestigious New Trier High School. His father and mother -- a doctor 
and a real estate agent -- now live in Northfield in a home with a 
tennis court and swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had a troubled past: While attending the University of  
Illinois, records show he was reprimanded for pot possession; he 
also put up racist posters and allegedly was peeping into window 
and carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he distributed white supremacist leaflets around the  
school, Chicago's North Shore, where his family lives, and Indiana 
University in Bloomington, which he attended as a criminal justice 
major after leaving Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he had tucked fliers on car windshields on Bloomington  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The date?  
</P>
<P>
	The Fourth of July.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was late Sunday, the end of a weekend of terror.  
</P>
<P>
	A minivan had been carjacked at a truckstop in southern  
Illinois, police said, by a man who resembled Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A deputy spotted the vehicle. Soon, the chase was on.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith shot himself three times, the last two while struggling  
with deputies after he crashed into a small building. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions of how and why this happened have just begun, but  
others already see a message in this tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the Anti-Defamation League,  
which has monitored Smith for more than a year, said this incident 
demonstrates the power of a hateful message. 
</P>
<P>
	``His rhetoric was fairly inflammatory, but until this episode,  
it was substantially rhetoric,'' he said. ``What it tells you is 
the consequences of words can be fairly significant, the 
consequences of hate and screed can be very, very destructive.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Predicts Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese economy is in store for more growth  
over the the next few months, according to a set of figures 
released Tuesday by the Economic Planning Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's index of leading indicators, which is intended to  
forecast economic conditions in the next few months, rose to 64.3 
in May, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures above 50 percent indicate economic expansion, while  
levels below that mean a contraction. It was the third month in a 
row that the figure topped this boom-or-bust threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the index of coincident economic indicators, a  
measure of the current health of the economy, stood at 37.5 percent 
and below 50 percent for the second successive month. 
</P>
<P>
	The indexes compare the level of various economic indicators,  
such as production, inventory and jobs numbers, with their level 
three months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	While struggling through a stubborn recession, Japan has  
recently been awash in a surprising wave of good economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and  
services produced within its borders -- grew 1.9 percent for the 
first quarter of the year after more than a year of recession. The 
unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in May from a record-high 4.8 
percent the previous two months. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, the Bank of Japan's released its quarterly  
``tankan'' survey showing that business sentiment had improved in 
the past three months. The same day, the Tokyo stock exchanged 
added 202.59 points, or 1.13 percent, to close at 18,135.06 -- the 
highest since Sept. 25, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on the latest figures, an EPA official pointed out  
positive elements such as the three-month rise in the leading 
indicators index and data suggesting a recovery in consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all the news was good. Production is still sluggish, and  
Japan's unemployment situation remains severe, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tom Steels Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAVAL, France (AP) -- In an expertly timed sprint to the finish,  
Tom Steels of Belgium surged ahead Tuesday to win his second 
consecutive stage of the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	As the world's biggest cycling race passed through the northern  
region of Brittany, with black-and-white Breton flags fluttering 
along the route, Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia kept the leader's yellow 
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels moved into second place overall with his third-stage  
victory. Lance Armstrong of Texas dropped to fourth and U.S. Postal 
Service teammate George Hincapie was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day of drama Monday, marked by a spectacular fall on an  
ocean causeway that all but ruined the chances of some top riders, 
Tuesday's stage unfolded in more classic style. 
</P>
<P>
	As happens often in the Tour's early, flat stages, designed for  
sprinters, two riders broke away early and maintained their lead 
for 76 miles but were caught by the pack late in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The pack maintained a swift pace -- an average of 27 mph -- and  
the final sprint came at a blistering 42 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The 122-mile route rolled through picturesque Breton  
countryside, from the city of Nantes, which straddles the Loire 
River, to the town of Laval. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels, with a winning time of 4 hours, 29 minutes, 27 seconds,  
was followed by Germany's Erik Zabel, Stuart O'Grady of Australia, 
Nicola Minali of Italy and in fifth place, Hincapie. Armstrong 
finished 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic crash on Monday, which caused two riders to retire  
with injuries, took another casualty when Javier Pascual Llorente 
of Spain, also injured in that crash, retired early in Tuesday's 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reminder of last summer's drug scandal, cycling's governing  
body said 16 cyclists -- none elite riders -- have been certified to 
race with a hematocrit level that exceeds the 50 percent limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells  
in a blood sample -- one sign of drug use, since the substances 
increase red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union noted that 3 percent of the  
global population has a hematocrit level higher than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many, if any, of the riders issued those  
certificates are racing in this year's Tour. U.S. racer Jonathan 
Vaughters has one, but he was injured in Monday's crash on the 
Passage du Gois and forced to abandon the race. 
</P>
<P>
	On the passage, a strip of land that connects a small island to  
the mainland and is submerged at high tide, top riders Alex Zulle, 
Michael Boogerd and Ivan Gotti were dealt a serious blow. 
</P>
<P>
	They got caught behind the 10-rider crash and never reached a  
group of 50 or so riders that broke away after the crash.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAVAL, France (AP) -- A day after a dramatic crash during an  
ocean crossing, the third stage of the Tour de France unfolded on 
dry ground and in classic style Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling into the countryside of Brittany, with black-and-white  
Breton flags fluttering along the route, the stage began with an 
early breakaway and ended in a furious, shoulder-to-shoulder 
sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Belgium's Tom Steels won the stage,  
timing his attack perfectly and surging through his rivals across 
the finish line, arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia kept the leader's yellow jersey. Steels  
moved into second place overall, followed by Abraham Olano of Spain 
and Lance Armstrong of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's teammate on a strong U.S. Postal Service team,  
George Hincapie, is sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a remarkable comeback from testicular cancer,  
is waiting for Sunday's time trial and then the mountain stages to 
mount his challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week, in the early, flat stages, it is the sprinters  
who excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's 122-mile route stretched through picturesque northern  
countryside from the city of Nantes, which straddles the Loire 
River, to the town of Laval. 
</P>
<P>
	Two riders, Frederic Guesdon and Massimo Giunti, broke away  
early and maintained their lead for 76 miles. But they were caught 
by the pack late in the race, making way for the sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	The pack maintained a swift pace, averaging 27 mph for the day.  
The final sprint came at a blistering 42 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels had a winning time of 4 hours, 29 minutes, 27 seconds. He  
was followed by Erik Zabel of Germany, Stuart O'Grady of Australia, 
Nicola Minali of Italy and Hincapie. Armstrong finished 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Young fans along the route on Tuesday were well aware of the  
drug scandal that has enveloped the sport. But most preferred to 
enjoy the race, and some were skeptical about efforts to stamp out 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish exchange student Jose Luiz Catala was enjoying a folk  
concert in Nantes before the riders came through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all the players are doped,'' said Catala, 17. ``You  
know why? Because you can't win on a plate of spaghetti. You need 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Joan Albert Lairon, sporting red-and-yellow paint on  
his cheeks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doping is fair if they all do it,'' he said. ``The problem  
comes when only some do. That's why it's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a bit dangerous -- no more than smoking cigarettes,''  
he added. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Average NBA Salary Rose Last Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- The number of NBA players making between  
$1 million and $2 million increased almost 50 percent during the 
1999 season, according to figures released Tuesday by the players' 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	The average NBA salary increased to $2.64 million from $2.37  
million, and the median salary increased from $1.4 million to $1.68 
million, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his annual state of the union address on the first day of the  
players' three-day meeting, union director Billy Hunter focused in 
large part on economics, 
</P>
<P>
	It was the union's first chance to review the impact of the  
nearly seven-month long lockout that threatened the cancellation of 
the entire 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a slide show presentation to about 50 players, Hunter  
reviewed the financial outcome and impact of the new collective 
bargaining agreement and made the following points: 
</P>
<P>
	--The players' share of basketball-related income increased from  
57 percent in 1997-98 to 59 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	--Salaries increased 17 percent as a whole.  
</P>
<P>
	--The number of players earning $1 million or more increased from  
61 percent to 71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of players earning between $1 million and $4 million  
annually rose from 44 percent to 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fifteen players signed contracts under the new middle-class  
exception, which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to sign free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Aside from the 10 players going into the final year of their  
rookie scale contracts who signed six-year, $71 million extensions, 
only two players, Rik Smits of Indiana and Jayson Williams of New 
Jersey, received the maximum allowable salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also pointed out that players like Allen Iverson and Ray  
Allen, who signed six-year extensions, can still expect to earn 
upwards of $200 million over their careers if they maintain their 
level of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern going into the lockout was to elevate the salaries  
of the lower class and increase the size of the middle class, and 
we've accomplished that,'' Hunter said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Extend Gains; Dow Up 41.16 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended their gains today as optimism  
about technology companies' earnings spread to the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 41.16 at 11,180.40, building on the record close set Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher, as the Nasdaq  
composite index, which has a large representation of high-tech 
issues, outpaced the blue-chips for much of the session. The Nasdaq 
was up 27.74 at 2,768.76, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was 
up 4.99 at 1,396.21. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long weekend in observance of Independence Day, Wall  
Street traders returned to markets that were at record levels. On 
Friday, the Dow rose 72.82 to close at 11,139.24, easily topping 
its previous record close of 11,107.19, set May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, the Dow gained 5.56 percent, or 586.68 points, the  
biggest weekly point gain in its 103-year history. The S&AMP;P 500 and 
the Nasdaq also hit new records. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, stocks shook off some weakness in the bond market,  
focusing instead on analysts' optimism about second-quarter profits 
and for the continued run of the bull market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, Prudential's famously bullish technical analyst,  
said in a research note today the Dow could hit 13,000 during 1999. 
Acampora's most conservative estimate for the year is in the range 
of 12,000 to 12,3000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be aggressive because we believe that this summer season will  
be a very exciting and bullish affair,'' Acampora said. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable reports on Intel fed excitement in the Nasdaq market.  
Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Prudential Securities raised their 
ratings on Intel stock, saying the semiconductor maker is 
successfully managing stiff price competition. Intel rose 1 3/8 to 
64 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Internet search engine provider Yahoo! rose 9 5/8 to 187 3/4.  
Yahoo! will release its second-quarter earnings Wednesday, and many 
analysts expect a strong report. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Internet companies rose on announcements of new  
ventures. AOL, up 10 5/16 at 125 9/16, and drkoop.com, up 15 7/16 
at 39 1/16, both got a boost from a deal that makes drkoop.com the 
primary provider of health information to AOL users. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were mostly higher as the price of crude oil topped  
$20 a barrel for the first time since November 1997. Chevron, a Dow 
component, rose 1 13/16 to 98 1/16. TotalFina SA's unsolicited 
takeover bid for Elf Aquitaine also helped boost the sector, as Elf 
soared 16 3/16 to 90 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said stocks might have risen even further except for a  
drop in the price of the 30-year Treasury bond. The yield rose to 
6.04 percent from 6.0 percent late Friday. Traders consider bond 
yields above 6.0 percent a threat to stocks, partly because at that 
level, they may present an attractive alternative to volatile 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 569.4 million shares, 
well ahead of Friday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.33 at 657.45, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.70 at 808.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000, which measures the performance of smaller  
companies, rose 1.85 to 458.36.

<HEADLINE> Man Spends 60 Hours Stuck in Mud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLEGANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who disappeared over the weekend was  
found alive Tuesday stuck waist-deep in mud at a gravel company. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Fyfe, 44, of Limestone, Cattaraugus County, was  
immobilized for 60 hours before being spotted by gravel company 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fyfe told state troopers he was chasing his dog at E.F. Lippert  
Sand and Gravel when he was sucked into the silt and mud near the 
edge of a water-filled pit, the Olean Times Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers laid sheet metal and ladders over the muck to keep from  
getting stuck themselves and freed Fyfe with shovels and buckets. 
He was taken to Olean General Hospital, where state police said he 
was treated for dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews had combed the area around the gravel company  
Monday night after Fyfe's truck was found on the side of the road, 
but Fyfe was hidden from view by piles of gravel. Gravel company 
employees had been on the job for several hours before finding him. 
</P>
<P>
	Fyfe had been missing since Saturday.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Takes Senate Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton filed a single sheet  
of paper with the Federal Election Commission today, setting in 
motion the machinery that could lead to a race for a Senate seat in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning we filed a statement of organization with the  
Federal Election Commission to establish the Hillary Rodham Clinton 
for U.S. Senate Exploratory Committee,'' campaign spokesman Howard 
Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will begin a summerlong listening  
tour of New York at the farm of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,'' 
Wolfson said. ``Over the next month Mrs. Clinton will travel 
throughout the state, meeting with New Yorkers in small groups and 
listening to them discuss the issues that concern them most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The papers were filed with the commission in Washington by Mrs.  
Clinton's advisers. She was not around for the five-minute 
formality, which was covered by 15 news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of the exploratory committee will allow Mrs. Clinton to  
raise and spend money in preparation for the race for the 
Democratic nomination. She is not expected to face serious 
opposition within the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans of the state's political wars say Mrs. Clinton will  
have to break away from being first lady if she is to have a shot 
at the seat Moynihan is leaving. And she plans to start a tour of 
the state to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	She would become the only first lady to ever run for public  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has  
already formed a Senate exploratory committee and raised almost $3 
million toward the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reacting to news of Mrs. Clinton's filing, Giuliani glibly  
called exploring ``a good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Who could have anything against exploring? Or listening,'' he  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Mrs. Clinton must establish herself to challenge him,  
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has to get out from under the cocoon of the White House  
and the president,'' said William Cunningham, a former Moynihan 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-day swing across central and eastern New York that begins  
Wednesday with a flight to Binghamton and a drive to the Moynihan 
farm near Oneonta is part of the plan to do that, aides to Mrs. 
Clinton say. The first lady's foray is the kickoff of what aides 
are billing as a summerlong ``listening tour'' by Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The listening tour will put her face-to-face with New Yorkers  
in small settings,'' Wolfson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising the idea of getting out and listening to what he called  
``real people,'' former state Democratic Chairman John Marino said: 
``She has to do it herself. It's time now to have the friends and 
advisers shut up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how small and intimate Mrs. Clinton's gatherings will be is  
open to question. About 200 members of the news media, including 
television crews from Asia and Europe, are expected along for this 
week's trip and there are other handicaps facing a first lady 
seeking to get in touch with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to have to somehow or other break through that  
Secret Service cocoon and show that she's not just the great 
lady,'' Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling 
Institute, explained. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's visit takes Mrs. Clinton into the heart of  
Republican strength, the upstate area north of New York City and 
the suburban counties surrounding it. The reception may not always 
be warm. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, she will be met in Binghamton by Republicans  
staging a contest that offers a weekend at a resort in the 
Adirondack Mountains for whoever shows up in the best fly costume. 
That is designed to remind voters of a New York Daily News report 
two weeks ago quoting an unidentified adviser to the first lady 
saying she wouldn't be vacationing this year in the ``fly-infested 
Adirondack Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said today that in his frequent visits to the  
Adirondacks he had never noticed a large number of flies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would recommend that people vacation in the Adirondacks.  
It's good for the economy of the state,'' Giuliani said. ``As far 
as I know, there are flies in Massachusetts, Vermont. I think they 
even have flies in Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Cunningham said that because of Giuliani's strength  
in the politically crucial suburbs, Mrs. Clinton must try to cut 
into the traditionally strong GOP upstate vote.

<HEADLINE> UEFA To Give Half 2002 Berth to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UEFA has agreed to give up half of one of its  
15 berths in the 2002 World Cup finals, hoping to avert a 
threatened boycott by the Asian Football Confederation, FIFA 
president Sepp Blatter said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Following two days of meetings of FIFA's Executive Committee,  
Blatter said UEFA president Lennart Johansson offered to have the 
14th-place team in European qualifying play the third-place Asian 
team in Asian qualifying for the final berth in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must still be approved by the Executive Committee of  
UEFA and the AFC, scheduled to meet separately Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe had been allotted 15 berths, the most of any  
confederation and a number that included defending World Cup 
champion France. Africa was awarded five, South America 4 1/2, Asia 
four and CONCACAF three. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Asia required two for World Cup co-hosts Japan and South  
Korea, the AFC felt it was unfair for its remaining members to 
battle for only two berths and threatened to boycott qualifying 
play unless it received one more berth.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistani Shells Hit Indian Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- Pakistani shells slammed into an oil tanker  
convoy on a strategic highway today while Indian troops and Islamic 
fighters battled over mountain peaks in the disputed region of 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelling came two days after President Clinton met with  
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and raised hopes of a speedy 
end to the two-month-old battle in the snowcapped Himalayas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials in Washington said Sharif and Clinton agreed that  
Pakistan-based fighters would withdraw from the Indian part of 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	But India says there has been no sign of withdrawal and no letup  
in the shelling from both sides of the 1972 cease-fire line that 
divides Kashmir between the two nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people are saying the war is over,'' Indian Interior  
Minister Lal Krishna Advani told Hindu right-wing activists in New 
Delhi. ``I say no, it is not over. The military operations will 
continue until the eviction of the last Pakistani intruder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India says it is fighting Pakistani soldiers and hundreds of  
Islamic militants who want to separate Muslim-majority Kashmir from 
India. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan acknowledges its forces are trading nearly constant  
artillery fire with India. Islamabad, however, says its troops are 
not involved in the fighting on the other side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pakistani newspaper today quoted Pakistan's army chief as  
saying the country will ask Islamic insurgents to withdraw, but 
that the final decision will be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Urdu-language Jang newspaper, Gen.  
Pervez Musharraf said 1,500 to 2,000 ``Kashmiri freedom fighters'' 
would be asked to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still has to be seen what their answer will be,'' he was  
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamic guerrillas, meanwhile, said they would die before  
withdrawing from their mountain bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question of a retreat. . . if we don't fight now  
Indians will press forward in our area,'' said Mohammed Shoaib, a 
Muslim rebel who has been fighting in the bitter cold of the Kargil 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather is our greatest enemy,'' he said. ``Only Allah's  
help keeps us going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Pakistani shells hit an oil tanker convoy today on National  
Highway 1, they struck one truck, which exploded in a ball of fire, 
and severely dented another. 
</P>
<P>
	Army engineers worked to clear the wreckage while military and  
civilian vehicles were backed up for four miles on the only link 
between Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar, and the remote battle 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers earlier had mistakenly reported that two oil  
tankers exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many shells exploded all around us, five or six came really  
close,'' said civilian truck driver Amin Ahmed. A civilian truck 
also was hit by shells about a mile away and lay half submerged in 
a river. The driver survived. 
</P>
<P>
	India captured a strategic peak, the 16,500-foot Tiger Hill, on  
Sunday to evict fighters who could direct Pakistani artillery fire 
onto the highway and Indian military camps. Although the shelling 
had diminished, the attack on the tankers indicated there may still 
be hundreds of Islamic fighters on vantage points up to 2 1/2 miles 
inside Indian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Indian army is now focused on Batalik, the most  
difficult of three major battlegrounds, where officers say up to 
300 Islamic fighters are entrenched on jagged ridges. 
</P>
<P>
	India says it has pushed the intruders back 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 miles all  
along the 85-mile front since the heights were seized and stone 
bunkers were built in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	India says 542 Pakistani soldiers and more than 150 Islamic  
guerrillas have been killed in the fighting, while 283 Indian 
soldiers have died, 451 were wounded and 10 are missing. Pakistan 
and the guerrillas have not provided recent casualty figures, and 
India's figures could not be independently confirmed.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Sues Over Death Row Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- From Quakers fighting for religious  
freedom to a presidential assassin, the condemned have long been 
allowed to have their say moments before they are executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not in Ohio, where a 1997 law requires inmates to submit their  
last words in writing six hours before they die. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit  
against Ohio on Tuesday, claiming prisoners have a constitutional 
right to give a statement before execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We suggest it's inhuman to muzzle a person at that time, to  
ask that person to stand there like a dog being put to sleep,'' 
said Kevin O'Neill, a professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College 
of Law who is bringing the case for the ACLU. ``A person should be 
able to say what he's thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law was adopted in response to national outrage over  
inflammatory remarks made by Richard Allen Davis at his sentencing 
for the 1993 abduction and killing of 12-year-old Polly Klaas in 
Petaluma, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel we wanted an inmate making those kind of  
statements in the execution chamber,'' said Joe Andrews, an Ohio 
prisons spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the law provides that the final statement be  
transcribed, copied and forwarded to the warden for release after 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed on behalf of death row inmates Fred Treesh  
and Melvin Bonnell, whose executions have not been scheduled, 
O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Treesh, 35, was convicted of shooting and killing a security  
guard during a 1994 robbery, and Bonnell, 41, was convicted of 
shooting and killing a Cleveland man in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio has executed one person -- Wilford Berry, 36 -- since 1963,  
and he chose not to make a statement before his execution in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit cites numerous cases of prisoners allowed last words  
over the centuries, from Quakers executed on Boston Common in 1659 
to Leon Czolgosz, assassin of President William McKinley, in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Pennsylvania, Indiana and Arizona have policies that  
attempt to censor last words, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	William Florio, a private investigator who helped police track  
down Berry in 1989, said he believes members of the victim's family 
were disappointed that Berry didn't have anything to say before 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you don't say a word, there's just a gap there,'' he  
said. ``I hate the word closure, but they're looking for something 
to bring back so now maybe they can go on with life.''

<HEADLINE> Airline Gets Chairman's Wine Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's one thing for the top executives to pick  
the type of planes an airline flies, but the wines it serves? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way it is at US Airways.  
</P>
<P>
	After reviving the airline over the past three years with a new  
name, a new pilots' contract and a $14 billion order to switch from 
Boeing to Airbus aircraft, US Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf and his 
longtime right-hand man, Rakesh Gangwal, are now giving a swirl, 
sniff and taste to the wines used in the airline's ``Envoy'' class. 
That's its merger of first and business classes for trans-Atlantic 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers lucky enough to ride in that lap of luxury should do  
anything but recoil at the intervention. Both Wolf and Gangwal, the 
chief executive officer at US Airways, are known for their 
discriminating palates and taste for the finer things in life. 
</P>
<P>
	Each man was paid nearly $35 million last year. Both are wine  
connoisseurs, known for visiting area wine stores in search of 
their favorite vintages. Wolf also maintains a 1,500-bottle wine 
cellar at his farm in Virginia's horse country. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were personally behind the airline's decision to upgrade  
its food and beverage service, according to an airline spokesman. 
While that's a trend in airlines as they vie for the highest-paying 
customers, top executives usually leave wine selections to the 
dining and cabin staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine experts think Wolf and Gangwal did pretty well when the  
airline recently ``refreshed'' its wine list, given the generally 
low standard of airline wine, the constraints of buying for the 
masses and the challenge of stocking an item that must endure the 
rigors of air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is that it would be an outstanding selection for  
coach class, but for business class, I would give it a solid B,'' 
Thomas Matthews, senior editor at Wine Spectator, a wine magazine, 
said after reviewing the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews had the highest praise for two selections: a 1993 Conde  
De Valdemar Reserva Rioja, a Spanish red wine, and a 1995 Simi 
Chardonnay, a white wine. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Conde De Valdemar is one of his favorite wineries in the  
Rioja region of Spain, and 1993 was a good year. The wine is spicy 
and good with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The chardonnay, meanwhile, comes from Simi, a good California  
producer. ``I would put a star next to that selection,'' Matthews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Wessels, manager of MacArthur Beverage, a wine store in  
Washington's upscale Georgetown section that is frequented by Wolf, 
said he was particularly impressed with the selection of the 1993 
Lanson Gold Label Brut Vintage Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Most champagnes are a blend of several different vintages, but a  
vintage champagne is the product of a single harvest. It can cost 
$50 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in better vintages will they bottle it as a single  
vintage,'' Wessels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another wine expert, Leliah Zenner of Washington's Calvert  
Woodley wine store, was happy with the selection of the 1996 
Augusto Dolcetto d'Acqui for flights to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a delightful, medium-to-light, very fresh and  
easy-drinking wine,'' Zenner said of the red wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the other two wine aficionados, though, Zenner had a  
confession: All of them bring their own wine on flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never fly anything but cattle class, so I always pack my own  
half-bottle,'' Zenner said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles May Pick Up Ripken Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles are expected to pick up a  
$6.3 million option to keep Cal Ripken through next season. The 
only real mystery is the timing of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The (Baltimore) Sun reported in Tuesday's editions that the move  
would be made during the three-game homestand that began Tuesday 
night and ends Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no announcement Tuesday, and team spokesman John  
Maroon said, ``This thing is not on the verge of happening. There 
is absolutely nothing scheduled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles general manager Frank Wren declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ripken signed a two-year extension on April 3, 1997. The  
contract included a club option for the year 2000, and the Orioles 
have until the All-Star break to pick up the option or exercise a 
$2.5 million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears to be an easy decision, given that Ripken entered  
Tuesday's game with a .310 batting average, 11 homers and 34 RBIs. 
Ripken, who will play in his 17th All-Star game next week, is five 
homers short of 400 and 57 hits shy of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, one of the most popular players to wear an Orioles  
uniform, turns 39 next month. But he has showed no signs of slowing 
down, even though earlier this season he was placed on the disabled 
list for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was hitting .179 when he sat out three weeks with lower  
back pain. He returned with a flourish, and now is one of only 
three Orioles with a batting average over .300. 
</P>
<P>
	He said during spring training he would allow his performance to  
dictate whether he would return, but now that appears to be a 
certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, it's going to happen. It's a given,'' The  
Sun quoted an unidentified source as saying.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Genetics Slant Bad for Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A bad year for American farmers might be  
getting worse now that Europeans have stepped up efforts to oppose 
genetically engineered U.S. grains, a Nobel laureate and plant 
pathologist says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about what farmers will do with this year's harvest,''  
said Norman Borlaug, who won the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his 
part in the ``Green Revolution'' that increased grain production in 
the Third World. Borlaug was one several participants at a global 
summit involving 69 countries affiliated with the University of 
Minnesota's Agricultural Student Trainee program. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's two largest food companies -- Nestle and Unilever --  
announced they no longer will make food products from genetically 
modified farm commodities. That probably means American corn, 
soybeans and cottonseed oil -- products modified to resist certain 
pests or to be compatible with weed-killing chemicals -- will be 
excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Nestle, based in Switzerland, and Unilever, based in  
the Netherlands and Britain, won't directly threaten American farm 
marketing prospects, Borlaug said. Rather, it's the ``noise'' such 
actions receive that raises fears around the world about complex 
new sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Borlaug said he thinks Europe's fear of genetically manipulated  
agriculture will diminish when weather patterns change and food 
supplies again become tight around the world. Despite the low 
prices farmers now receive, it would take only one bad growing 
season to draw down world stockpiles of food, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers face a paradox this growing season: While the world  
population needs their productive capacity to meet future demand, 
it is unlikely growers will make a profit on their commodities 
right now, Borlaug said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa native earned forestry and plant pathology degrees from  
the University of Minnesota. He received the Nobel for his work in 
Mexico developing strains of dwarf wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Science has helped farmers double, triple and often quadruple  
cereal grain production in most parts of the world, he said. 
Improvements come from using dwarf varieties that require less 
water because of better farm management practices, more judicious 
use of fertilizers and improved seed genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CORINTH, Maine (AP) -- The strawberry season is normally in full  
swing this time of year, but many of Maine's strawberry growers say 
that for them it is already over. 
</P>
<P>
	Several pick-your-own farmers blamed the dry, early spring for  
pushing the season ahead by nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Adams of Adams Strawberry Acres in Corinth said it is the  
earliest season she has seen in her 20 years as a grower. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Joe, said the pick-your-own season likely would end  
there within a week, though it normally does not wind down until 
August. The season normally begins at the Adamses' farm around June 
26, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, rain hit central and northern Maine and slowed  
ripening of the strawberries. Then birds and bugs damaged the 
crops. In southern Maine, the rain hit after the berries had 
ripened, and many rotted before they could be picked.

<HEADLINE> Minimum Age Debated at NBPA Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Is 18 or 19 too young to play in the NBA?  
</P>
<P>
	That hot-button issue was the most heavily debated topic Tuesday  
as the players' union opened its annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid talk of salaries, salary caps, the lockout and other  
mundane business, it was the subject of the league's youngest 
players -- and how young is too young -- that really got the 
participants talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's ears perked up, and you saw genuine concerns for  
these young men, many of whose careers are being ruined,'' said 
Mitchell Butler, player representative for the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
``Their friends, high school coaches and AAU coaches are telling 
them they'll be superstars, but in most cases the chances of that 
actually happening are slim and none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern has proposed establishing a minimum  
age, perhaps 20, for playing in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a restriction would have to be agreed upon by the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we don't want anyone shut out by an age  
limitation,'' said union director Billy Hunter, who appointed a 
six-man committee -- Alonzo Mourning of Miami, Brent Barry of 
Chicago, Juwan Howard of Washington, Jerome Williams of Detroit, 
Dikembe Mutombo of Atlanta and Butler -- to discuss the issue and 
make recommendations during this three-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union are expected to open negotiations on  
the issue sometime in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are awaiting a report from the NCAA on whether it  
would be feasible to provide the best college players with 
low-interest loans of up to $20,000 to entice them to stay in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is that we don't want the NBA or the NCAA  
dictating what the resolution is. It's got to be something the 
players agree wholeheartedly on,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players have been leaving college early or making themselves  
eligible for the draft out of high school at an increasing rate 
during the past several years, their hopes boosted by the 
commercial and financial success Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett had 
in going directly from the preps to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	During last week's NBA draft in Washington, high schooler  
Jonathan Bender of Picayune, Miss., was drafted fifth overall, 
ahead of players like Wally Szczerbiak, Richard Hamilton and Trajan 
Langdon who established themselves at the college level before 
becoming lottery picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another high schooler, Leon Smith of Martin Luther King HS in  
Chicago, was selected 29th overall -- the final pick of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rookie wage scale that provides guaranteed three-year  
contracts to all first-round picks, Smith will be paid 
approximately $1.8 million. But several players who had solid, 
four-year college careers, such as Lee Nailon, Evan Eschmeyer and 
Todd MacCulloch, dropped to the second round and will receive no 
guaranteed money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the same argument with the owners during the lockout  
over whether they should exert fiscal self-control,'' Hunter said. 
``If they don't want them in the league, they shouldn't draft 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one player wondered aloud why such a fuss was being  
made over the age issue in basketball -- a sport whose athlete 
population is dominated by young, black men -- when it hasn't been 
similarly discussed in sports like baseball, which has a larger 
percentage of white and Hispanic players. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said it seemed curious to him that the issue moved into  
the spotlight this year as Duke, which had never lost an 
underclassman to the NBA draft, had three non-seniors leave the 
team to enter the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but that really  
seemed to set off an alarm and strike a nerve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also said that high schoolers who jump straight to the  
pros should not be blamed for the dropoff in the quality of NBA 
basketball because most of them spend their first season getting 
very little playing time.

	The six-man committee chosen Tuesday will discuss how to weigh  
the interests of those like Bryant and Garnett, who were mature 
enough at 18 to adapt to the NBA lifestyle, against those of 
players like Rashard Lewis of the Seattle SuperSonics, who was 
reduced to tears in the 1998 draft when he was passed over in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just a sad image,'' Butler said, ``and we'd like to  
prevent those situations from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to deprive a young man the opportunity to go out  
into the workforce if he feels ready,'' Butler said. ``But they 
should know that they might be stuck on the bench all year without 
the opportunity to play. Sure, they make a great living, but dreams 
are being shattered and hopes crushed for a quick buck.''

<HEADLINE> EU Unemployment Falls to 9.4 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Unemployment in the European Union fell  
to 9.4 percent in May, down from 9.5 percent in April, the EU's 
statistics office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The May jobless rate compared with 10.1 percent in May 1998,  
according to Eurostat's report. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 11 euro-zone nations, unemployment remained at 10.3  
percent in May, the same as in April. In May 1998, the unemployment 
rate in the euro-zone nations was 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's unemployment in May remained more than double the rates  
of its main trading partners, with the U.S. jobless rate standing 
at 4.2 percent and Japan's at 4.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg continued to register the lowest unemployment in the  
EU, at 2.8 percent. Spain's was the highest at 16.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurostat gave the following May 1999 figures for the 15 EU  
countries, with April 1999 figures in brackets: 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg, 2.8 percent (2.9 percent); Austria, 4.3 percent (4.5  
percent); Portugal, 4.7 percent (unchanged); Ireland, 6.8 percent 
(unchanged); Sweden, 6.8 percent (7.3 percent); Belgium, 9 percent 
(unchanged); Germany, 9.1 percent (unchanged); Finland, 10.5 
percent (10.6 percent); France, 11.2 percent (11.3 percent), Spain 
16.2 percent (16.4 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	May figures were unavailable for the Netherlands, Denmark and  
Italy, which registered unemployment rates in April of 3.3 percent, 
4.7 percent and 12 percent, respectively. No data was released on 
Britain and Greece.

<HEADLINE> Russian Gymnast Gets Four Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Russian gymnast  
Svetlana Khorkina won her third and fourth gold medals at the 
University Games Tuesday, before failing to capture a record-tying 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Khornika won the uneven bars, her specialty, and the floor  
exercise. She then missed an opportunity to become only the fifth 
athlete in the history of the games to win as many as five golds 
when teammate Elena Produnova beat her in the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Khornika led Russia to the team title Sunday and took the  
individual all-around gold Monday. She finished fourth in the 
balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Soviet gymnast Dimitri Bilozerchev holds the record of six  
golds, set in 1985, at Kobe, Japan. Three other athletes have won 
five golds at a single games, most recently Bulgaria's rhythmic 
gymnast Tomka Petrova in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Khorkina's performance helped Russia take the overall lead in  
the medal count from the United States. Russia has 23 medals, 12 
golds, to the Americans' 14 medals, nine golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Russian, Nikolai Krioukov, won gold medals in the men's  
parallel bars and horizontal bar and a silver in the vault, giving 
him five medals -- two golds, three silvers -- at the close of 
gymnastics action. 
</P>
<P>
	Miki Nakao broke the games record for the women's 200-meter  
backstroke as Japan slowed the U.S. team's run of success in 
swimming by picking up five medals in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakao was timed in 2 minutes, 10.32 seconds, slicing .99 seconds  
off the previous games record, set by Whitney Hedgepath of the 
United States in 1993. Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara, winner of the 100 
butterfly Sunday, took the silver in 2:11.96, and Linda Riker gave 
the United States one of its two bronzes for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans dominated the first two days of swimming, with  
eight golds and 11 total medals, but were less successful Tuesday. 
The team's only win came in the women's 400 freestyle relay, as 
Kimberly Black, who swam the second leg, earned her third gold of 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Foschi, who early in her career was suspended for a  
positive drug test, led morning qualifying for the 400 freestyle, 
then finished last in the final. The winner was Hana Cerna, a Czech 
who added that title to her triumph Sunday in the 400 individual 
medley. 
</P>
<P>
	Foschi was 15 when she tested positive for steroids at the U.S.  
Championships at Pasadena, Calif., on Aug. 4, 1995. FINA, the 
sport's world governing body, suspended her for two years, a 
punishment eventually reduced to six months and made retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's haul included silver and bronze medals in the men's 100  
backstroke and a silver in the men's 100 breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's depleted team gained its first two medals, thanks  
to two swimmers from the University of Hawaii. Simon Thirsk draped 
himself in South Africa's colorful flag after winning the 100 
backstroke in 55.97, and Nicholas Folker was third in the 100 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Several South Africans in swimming, tennis, fencing and  
volleyball, as well as the country's entire soccer team, withdrew 
on the eve of competition because of financial reasons. South 
African team chief Malumbetle Ralethe said Thirsk paid $1,500 out 
of his own pocket to come to Mallorca. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's basketball, the defending champion United States team  
earned a spot in the quarterfinals, beating South Africa 140-32 as 
Helen Darling had 22 points, six rebounds and six assists. Kelly 
Miller's 24 points led eight players in double figures for the 
Americans, who forced 45 South African turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team, 3-0 in the tournament and winner  
of 35 straight University Games contests, can secure a place in the 
quarterfinals with a victory over Lithuania (3-0) Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Switch to Old Ball Fuels Irwin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- For Hale Irwin, it's not the shoes.  
It's the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin has been a par-busting terror since switching back to the  
kind of golf ball he used while dominating the Senior PGA Tour in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	After making the change in May, Irwin won three of the five  
senior tournaments he entered and scored par or better in 16 of 17 
rounds. He shot in the 60s in 12 of those rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin will try to keep it going when he begins defense of his  
title in the U.S. Senior Open on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have played extremely well, there's no doubt about that,''  
Irwin said. ``I think it's in large part due to sort of a 
recommitment, of focus if you wish, to get myself more back in the 
frame of mind and the playing mode which I found myself in at this 
time last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin also traces his improved play to his decision to go back  
to the old-style ball instead of the newer edition he had been 
using earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning seven tournaments and nearly $2.9 million last  
year, Irwin got off to a miserable start this year. He placed in 
the top 10 in only one of his first seven tournaments, with a best 
finish of fourth in the GTE Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, using the other ball, he suddenly became the Irwin of old.  
He won the Nationwide Championship, finished sixth in the Las Vegas 
Classic and won the Boone Valley Classic. After tying for 26th in 
the BellSouth Classic, Irwin bounced back to win the Senior Players 
Championship by seven strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went back to the old Professional rather than the new  
Professional,'' Irwin said. ``It's a ball I know, a ball I had 
great success with. The real challenge is to find some because they 
don't make them anymore. It's just sort of what I've hoarded and 
what we can find.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Irwin is going strong, Jack Nicklaus is still struggling  
with his sore left hip and withdrew from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, a two-time Senior Open champion, had his left hip  
replaced Jan. 27. He returned to play in the Bell Atlantic Classic 
four months later but has not played competitively since pain in 
the hip forced him to withdraw after 45 holes of the Senior Players 
Championship two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hip is starting to feel good,'' Nicklaus said. ``But I  
think it would be wise on my part to wait a week or so to test it 
again. I'm very eager to play golf, but I just don't think I should 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin said the difference in the two balls he has been using are  
minimal. He just feels more comfortable with the old one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old Professional was a ball which I knew how far I was  
going to hit it each time under what conditions,'' Irwin said. ``It 
was a very predictable ball that fit my game nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new Professional is a very good ball, too, but it goes a  
little bit farther. It has different flight characteristics and 
affected my game more than it might affect some other player's 
game. I was hitting it a little too far with some clubs and I 
couldn't find the right pattern. When I went back to this other 
one, it was just like it fell into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin's recent surge has carried into fourth place on the money  
list, behind Bruce Fleisher, Allen Doyle and Larry Nelson. All 
three also will compete in the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, a senior tour rookie, has matched Irwin with three  
victories, including the Senior Championship. Fleisher has won four 
tournaments and is coming off a second-place finish in the State 
Farm Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicente Fernandez, who finished one stroke behind Irwin in last  
year's Open, said he's not surprised by Irwin's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they ask me about Hale being a little bit slow  
starting this year, I always said ... he was taking a rest,'' 
Fernandez said. ``I think he is ready again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not exactly resting, Irwin did say he backed off on the  
intensity early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've just got to take the wind out of the sails sometime,  
and I wanted to take it out before it fell out,'' he said. ``I 
didn't want to be coming into this part of the season just 
absolutely dead beat. So I purposely let it go to try to start 
coming back. I feel my game is back to where I want it now.''

<HEADLINE> America Enjoys World Cup Soccermania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Soccermania has hit the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of one of its countless bus rides during the  
Women's World Cup, the U.S. team was told that Saturday's final 
against China was sold out. The Rose Bowl will be filled, just as 
it was for the men's championship five years ago. And this time, 
President Clinton will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all kind of jumped out of our seats and were pumping our  
fists and yelling and cheering,'' Brandi Chastain said Tuesday 
after the team learned of the sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great tribute,'' Cindy Parlow added. ``I think the fans  
appreciate how much we appreciate their coming to the games and 
coming out to see us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup has become a phenomenon in this country.  
Sure, soccer isn't a high-visibility sport in America and the MLS 
is struggling to draw fans and television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the American women have captured the imagination of the  
nation with their forthrightness, friendliness and accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something we want to do,'' Tiffeny Milbrett said. ``We'll  
stay and sign autographs and we'll talk to the fans because we want 
to do it, not because someone tells us we should. It's important to 
them and it's important to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who attended the quarterfinal win over Germany at  
Landover, Md., decided Tuesday to extend his seven-state trip 
across the country through the weekend so he can attend the final. 
In 1994, Clinton went to the World Cup opener in Chicago and Vice 
President Gore went to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, after the Americans' first practice in preparation  
for the final, the players were interviewed by reporters from 
television networks and national news magazines. ``CBS Evening 
News'' was on hand. So was Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	What they found is what those following the team for the last  
month have long known: This is a refreshing group of athletes who 
understand exactly what is happening. And cherish it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been excited by the tournament and overwhelmed by the  
response,'' Chastain said. ``I knew there was a special package we 
had to offer and now we are getting a chance to present it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes it extra special is that the women are doing it on  
their own. While they were one of the more popular teams at the 
1996 Olympics, they shared the spotlight with the U.S. basketball, 
softball and gymnastics teams that won gold medals. This time, the 
Americans and Chinese and Brazilians are selling soccer -- and 
selling out major league stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``This event has done better than anyone could have expected,''  
Milbrett said. ``I'm shocked at how massive it has been. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it would be huge and we felt it would be OK if we have  
maybe 40,000 fans at the games. But we never thought of anything 
like sellouts at every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett said that is a tribute to the sport, whereas the  
Atlanta Games were about something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics is about the patriotic USA,'' she said. ``It's  
people going to games because it's the Olympics. If we have 
success, they will also come; I think that showed in the numbers, 
when we had 25,000 for an early Olympic game and then sold out the 
final. But it was not just a soccer crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``But 79,000 at the opener says they knew about our soccer and  
they wanted to come and watch soccer, watch women's soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't hurt, either, that the teams generally have given the  
U.S. public what it craves: wide-open play, lots of scoring, 
spectacular goalkeeping and passion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, the passion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It makes us smile. It's really flattering that the fans see  
that from us,'' Tisha Venturini said. ``They see how much you can 
enjoy what you're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Can they really enjoy the prospect of facing China, which has  
been the best team in the tournament and routed defending champion 
Norway 5-0 in the semifinals? 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember back in the FIFA All-Star game in February, the  
Chinese keeper (Gao Hong) saying, `It will be China and U.S. in the 
World Cup final,' '' Milbrett said. ``I really believe that's how 
it should be. We've earned it.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Gunderson To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Texas Rangers left-hander Eric Gunderson  
will undergo surgery on a small tear in his left shoulder on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunderson has been on the disabled list since May 8. He made  
five rehabilitation appearances with Triple-A Oklahoma, allowing 
six runs and 11 hits in 6 2-3 innings, and continued to experience 
shoulder problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunderson was 0-0 with a 7.20 ERA in 11 games for the Rangers  
prior to going on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery will be performed by Dr. John Conway, one of the  
Rangers' team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers sent rookie outfielder Ruben Mateo to Oklahoma to  
begin a rehab assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mateo, on the disabled list since June 23 with a pulled groin,  
batted .182 with a home run and three RBIs in 10 games for Texas.

<HEADLINE> Aretha Franklin To Open Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Aretha Franklin isn't usually an opening act, but  
this is no ordinary concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Queen of Soul has agreed to sing the national anthem to kick  
off the Three Tenors concert at Detroit's Tiger Stadium on July 17. 
She may even join Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido 
Domingo for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What could be better in Detroit than having Aretha Franklin  
sing the national anthem?'' said Frank Stella, a friend of 
Pavarotti's and a board member of the Michigan Opera Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit concert will be the first Midwest concert by the  
tenors, and their only scheduled North American appearance in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Stella said Pavarotti suggested having Ms. Franklin join the  
concert and said she ``was absolutely delighted'' at the 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The two entertainers became friends after Ms. Franklin stepped  
in to sing Pavarotti's signature aria -- ``Nessun Dorma'' from 
Puccini's ``Turandot'' -- when he became ill before the 1998 Grammy 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Pavarotti announced Monday that he will open the  
SuperDome Olympic Games venue in Sydney, Australia, with a Nov. 6 
concert. The $132 million SuperDome will be the site of basketball 
and gymnastics competition during next year's Summer Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Overnite Drivers, Dockworkers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dockworkers and truck drivers at the Overnite  
Transportation Co. went on strike Monday night at six terminals 
around the United States to protest unfair labor practices, a 
Teamsters union spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,400 union workers struck terminals in Atlanta, North  
Atlanta and Marietta, Ga.; Memphis, Tenn.; Kansas City, Mo., and 
Indianapolis, spokesman David Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ira Rosenfeld, an Overnite spokesman, said all the service  
centers in question are open and that ``we expect to make all 
deliveries and pickups on Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters claim to represent workers at 38 of Overnite's 166  
service centers, while Rosenfeld said the union only represents the 
workers at 21 centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron accused the company of intimidating and even firing some  
union organizers working at Overnite, something Rosenfeld 
categorically denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been bargaining with the Teamsters ... and we will  
continue to bargain,'' Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron said the strike would end when the workers felt their  
grievances over unfair labor practices were resolved.

<HEADLINE> Beating Heat -- East Coast's New Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The mission for 75-year-old Ruth  
Anderson was clear: Keep cool at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Necessary cooking was done at 5 a.m. Lunch and dinner were eaten  
at air-conditioned restaurants. The afternoon was spent working on 
a crossword puzzle inside the cool Connecticut Post Mall in 
Milford. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Ms. Anderson ate ice cream with her daughter and  
granddaughter, and then they were off to see a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sticking to my plan. We did this yesterday and the day  
before,'' she said Monday. ``It's too hot to be outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heat advisories and warnings were posted today from Illinois to  
the East Coast and from southern New England to North Carolina as 
temperatures drove back toward the century mark. Yesterday, 
temperatures hit record highs from the Great Lakes to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Iftode, 13, was ready with a battery-driven, hand-held  
fan with a built-in water sprayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel like you are in a steaming bathroom,'' she said  
yesterday evening after taking a visiting cousin to New York City's 
coolest attraction: the movies. ``They have air conditioning 
inside,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York reached 101 degrees yesterday, a record for the date,  
with a heat index -- the combined effect of temperature and humidity 
-- of 112. Newark, N.J., set a record at 103, as did Portland, 
Maine, reaching 94 Monday. Bridgeport, Conn., registered 100 for 
the date for the first time. North Carolina's Raleigh-Durham 
International Airport hit a record 102, highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds and Astros played an afternoon baseball game in  
Cincinnati, a thermometer stuck in the artificial turf at Cinergy 
Field registered 154 degrees, highest in at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight deaths were blamed on the heat during the long  
holiday weekend, including a man found dead Sunday in Chicago with 
a body temperature of 107. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a measure of relief was on the way as a cold front  
pressed slowly toward the south and east. Behind the front, 
Wisconsin expected less humidity today and highs only in the 80s; 
Monday's high of 94 prompted Milwaukee's first heat health alert in 
two years. After another blast of 100-degree heat today, New 
Yorkers were told highs would be in the 80s the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities urged customers to turn off unneeded appliances to  
conserve electricity and some had scattered blackouts as air 
conditioners outpaced generators. Con Edison said some 16,000 
customers were hit by sporadic outages Monday in New York City and 
its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat buckled roads in Delaware and elsewhere. Several lanes  
of New York City's busy Queensboro Bridge over the East River were 
closed for eight hours during the night because the decking warped. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Flag Acres Zoo in Rensselaer County, N.Y., owner Harry  
VonHaggin fed his monkeys Popsicles and made giant ones for bears 
by freezing fruit chunks and water in 5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a luxury that they enjoy, and for the bears, it's a  
source of entertainment, too,'' VonHaggin said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those affected by the sporadic power outages was Ida  
DiFulvio, 68, of Lynn, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really hot,'' she said after five hours with no way to  
cool her home. ``The sweat was just pouring right off me.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> When Fed Tightens, What To Do? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that the Federal Reserve has tightened  
credit conditions, mutual-fund investors may worry that they need 
to hurry up and change their strategies somehow. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, everybody knows that rising rates are bad for both  
the stock and bond markets because they depress bond prices even as 
they serve as a brake on economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	But most long-term investors may find it better to sit tight  
than to reshuffle their whole financial plan. Those who do make 
some changes may not choose the obvious step of lightening up on 
long-term stock and bond funds and shifting to money-market funds. 
</P>
<P>
	For many people who take a long-term perspective, it's an  
article of faith not to switch money around in reaction to each 
change in Fed policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the central bank's move June 30 to raise short-term rates  
by a quarter of a percentage point to 5 percent, the last time it 
nudged rates higher was in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That turned out to be an isolated case, rather than any  
significant change of course. Stocks and bonds soon resumed their 
long bull market -- and it proved to have been a bad time to be 
bailing out of long-term funds. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, there is talk that the Fed might take a series  
of tightening actions, as it did between February 1994 and February 
1995. Over that span the Fed raised its target rate on federal 
funds, or overnight loans between banks, in seven steps from 3 
percent to 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely as a result of tight-money worries and rising interest  
rates, stock and bonds struggled through a difficult year in 1994. 
The average domestic stock fund, as tracked by Morningstar Inc. of 
Chicago, dropped 1.27 percent; the average international stock fund 
declined 2.31 percent, and the average general bond fund lost 2.92 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The place to be, it would seem, was the short-term money  
markets, where 90-day Treasury bills averaged a return of 4.45 
percent and money-market funds typically produced a payoff of about 
4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That conclusion only stands up, however, if you look at 1994 by  
itself, paying no attention to what happened afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, both stock and bond funds soared as the Fed finished  
its campaign to restrain economic growth. Domestic stock funds 
followed that up with more double-digit gains in '96, '97, '98 and 
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	So, with the advantage of hindsight, it is clear that the best  
move to make when the Fed tightened in 1994, for anybody with a 
time horizon of more than a few months, was to buy stocks and-or 
bonds, not to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	You needed to look beyond what the Fed and the markets were  
doing at the moment to what was going to happen afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	This far-sightedness always looks easy in retrospect, but it  
never is quite so simple to practice when it is needed most. If the 
majority of investors could think that way, the markets wouldn't 
have had such a sluggish time of it all the way through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Just try it now. Who knows whether the Fed will push rates  
higher one more time, or twice more, or three times. It might be 
finished already with this round of tightening, or it still could 
be pulling in the reins after the turn of the millennium six months 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also no way to know for sure whether tightening now  
will set the stage for a new round of vigorous economic growth, or 
whether a prolonged period of slower or no growth is in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all this uncertainty, though, investors who are in the  
market for the long term needn't feel defeated. If you have a 
money-management plan that is based on your goals and 
circumstances, and a careful calculation of how much risk you want 
to take, there is no need to try to guess which way the Fed or the 
markets will zig or zag next. 
</P>
<P>
	For people who invest regularly, adding more money to their  
accounts regardless of the prevailing mood, times when the Fed is 
tightening credit can turn out to be blessings, rather than curses. 
</P>
<P>
	Down years for the market provide systematic investors with a  
chance to buy at better prices than they would get if the bulls 
kept romping ahead without interruption.

<HEADLINE> 2 Toddlers Die After Hiding in Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two young children died of heat exposure in cars over the Fourth  
of July holiday while playing with their siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Omaha, Neb., a 2 1/2-year-old boy died Monday after his  
5-year-old brother helped him into a car, shut the door and went 
off to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities don't know how long Arnold Guzman was in the car  
before his mother found him. The windows were rolled up and 
temperatures inside were over 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 2 1/2-year-old can't easily get out of the car, and the kids  
were apparently playing in the backyard and forgot about him,'' 
Police Sgt. Dan Cisar said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Masontown, Pa., on Sunday afternoon, a 2-year-old boy died  
while ducking down in the passenger seat of the family car during a 
game of hide-and-seek with his older sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cody Anthony Britt's sisters, age 6 and 3, could not find  
him, the family began searching for him. At first, the family 
looked in the car but did not see him. On a second check of the 
car, they opened the passenger door and the boy tumbled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody had been inside the car for at least an hour, with outside  
temperatures in the high 90s, and the boy's asthma condition made 
the heat particularly dangerous, Fayette County Coroner Phillip 
Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both deaths are being treated as accidents.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Considers a July Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Wimbledon is considering a move to the first two  
weeks of July to avoid rain and give players more time to adjust to 
grass courts, the Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a change cannot be made in the next two years because  
of scheduling conflicts, the newspaper said it could happen by 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club, told  
the Guardian the move would allow more time between the French Open 
and Wimbledon, which are two weeks apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The players must retool their games from clay to grass courts,  
and some bypass Wimbledon because they can't adapt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grass is our lifeblood,'' Gorringe said. ``With an extra week  
on grass courts, players would find it worthwhile to spend more 
time and effort playing and practicing on it, enhancing its 
popularity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the early 1970s, three of the four Grand Slam tournaments  
were played on grass. The U.S. Open changed to clay in 1974 and 
then hard courts in 1978. The Australian Open switched to hard 
courts in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon has remained faithful to grass despite the problems  
caused by the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Wimbledon a week later would allow the tournament to  
take advantage of drier weather in the first half of July. The 
championship fell 150 matches behind schedule last week when one 
day was totally washed out and only a handful of matches were 
possible on two other days. 
</P>
<P>
	A switch also would allow players to prepare for the  
championship by playing an extra warmup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, the grass-court season is restricted to events in two  
weeks preceding Wimbledon and then the two weeks of the 
championship.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Picks New Patents Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has nominated a longtime  
intellectual property lawyer to be the Commerce Department's top 
patents official, the White House announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton nominated Q. Todd Dickinson for the post of assistant  
secretary and commissioner of patents and trademarks, a job 
Dickinson has carried out in an acting capacity since the beginning 
of the year. Clinton submitted the nomination July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickinson, before joining the Patent and Trademark Office,  
worked as counsel with a Philadelphia law firm, Dechert, Price and 
Rhoads, and was chief counsel for intellectual property and 
technology at Sun Company Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed by the Senate, Dickinson would continue to be in  
charge of maintaining and developing the U.S. patent and trademark 
systems and advocating for increased protection of the intellectual 
property rights of U.S. citizens.

<HEADLINE> Honda Unveils Fuel Efficient Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. said Tuesday that its entry into  
the low-emission, fuel-efficient vehicle race will get an estimated 
80 miles per gallon when it goes on sale later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's third-largest automaker said the aerodynamic two-seat  
coupe, unveiled in prototype form earlier this year at the Detroit 
auto show, will be called ``Insight'' and will be the world's most 
fuel-efficient, gasoline-powered, mass-production vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insight uses a lightweight, 1-liter, three-cylinder gasoline  
engine assisted by a small electric motor. The highly efficient 
``hybrid'' powertrain, combined with the addition of lightweight 
plastic and aluminum body panels, results in the high mileage. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  
estimates released by Honda, the car will get more than 70 mpg in 
combined city and highway driving and close to 80 mpg on the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Toyota Motor Corp. was the first to sell a hybrid  
gasoline-electric car in Japan, the Prius, in 1997. It will go on 
sale in the United States and Europe next year. Honda plans to beat 
Toyota to the U.S. market by placing the Insight on sale nationwide 
in December. The car will go on sale in Japan in the fall, in 
Europe in December and in Canada next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars operate differently. While the Prius shifts between  
gasoline engine and electric motor, the Insight always uses the 
engine as its primary power source. The electric motor is instead 
used to boost the engine's power during hard acceleration, 
spokesman Andy Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	An advantage of the Insight system is its battery is half the  
size of the Prius battery, which results in significant weight 
savings, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's Prius also uses a conventional steel body, while the  
Insight makes extensive use of aluminum and plastic. Honda said 
that resulted in a 40 percent weight savings over a conventional 
steel body. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda also said it has developed a new catalytic converter that  
will make vehicle emissions 50 percent cleaner than required by 
Japanese regulations slated for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial sales of the Insight are expected to be modest. At the  
Detroit show in January, an American Honda executive said the 
company expected U.S. sales to be fewer than 5,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda said the Insight will be priced below $20,000 in the  
United States, and will include antilock brakes, electric power 
steering, dual air bags and an antitheft system. 
</P>
<P>
	As government pressure to reduce pollution around the world has  
increased, automakers have sought ways to make their vehicles 
cleaner. Honda said the Insight's emissions will be much cleaner 
than required by planned government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG also  
are working on hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, but don't plan to 
have them ready for sale before 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Toyota and GM announced a five-year deal to jointly  
research and develop alternative-fuel vehicles. Their research will 
initially focus on vehicles powered by fuel cells, batteries and 
hybrid propulsion systems.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The nude body of a SeaWorld visitor was  
pulled early Tuesday from a killer whale pool, where he had 
apparently gone swimming with one of the black-and-white orcas 
after the park had closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's identity and the cause of death were not immediately  
known. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no obvious signs of trauma,'' sheriff's spokesman

pulled under by the whale's vortex, or the whale may have 
considered him a toy.''

<HEADLINE> Suspicious Gas Bombs Found in Neb. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HASTINGS, Neb. (AP) -- A man was arrested after police found six  
bombs believed to contain a poison gas outside his apartment 
building and toxic chemicals inside his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they had no idea what the man, Jesse Spurgin,  
planned to do with the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery forced the overnight evacuation of 200 people from  
the building and homes nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Police feared the devices had some form of fluorine-based gas,  
which is highly toxic. The chemical was found in the man's 
apartment in the building Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs were doused with diesel fuel and detonated by police  
early Tuesday, and most neighbors were allowed to return. Residents 
of the man's 14-unit building were told to stay away while police 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurgin, 26, who lives in a first-floor apartment, was arrested  
on two explosives charges. Each carries up to five years in prison 
and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices ``had the potential of doing great harm,'' police  
Sgt. Dan Losada said. He said the materials used to make the bombs 
could be obtained in any hardware store, pharmacy or grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents who were evacuated said police told them that a  
possible bomb made of mustard gas was discovered. When asked if the 
devices contained mustard gas, Losada said authorities weren't 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the area around Spurgin's building Monday  
night after being told that two men were fighting and that one had 
a bottle. Spurgin was later spotted walking down the street with a 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	When told to put the bottle down, Spurgin responded, ``That's my  
bomb,'' according to police. Five other devices were found outside 
the dilapidated red-brick apartment building, in the street and on 
the curb. Two of the five were bottles; authorities would not 
describe the three others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency sent a team of investigators  
to Hastings, a city of 23,000 people 130 miles west of Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show that Spurgin is an unemployed laborer who was  
released from jail in February after serving 11 months for failing 
to appear in court on charges he sold marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Wings' Maltby Signs 4-Year Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kirk Maltby, the left wing on the Detroit Red  
Wings' line that generally plays against an opponent's top line, 
signed a four-year contract Tuesday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Business Surveys Forecast Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Executives from the manufacturing and  
construction industries anticipate solid growth in the 
July-September quarter, according to separate surveys released 
today by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers' survey not only showed optimism about  
continued strength but also found ``few signs of inflationary 
pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The construction industry reported its strongest results in  
orders and prices in the June survey since the business-information 
company began such tallies in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 200 U.S. construction executives also indicated  
that employment in the building industry reached its highest level 
since August 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives expect ``continued strength in orders and  
employment, accompanied by modest increases in prices,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	David T. Kresge, chief economist for Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, said that  
``order books in the construction industry are bulging, and 
expectations are for continued growth into the fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that recent increases in mortgage rates ``have been more  
than offset by high levels of consumer confidence, employment 
growth and stock market gains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The June survey of 1,000 U.S. manufacturing executives reported  
rises in production and new orders and expectations of ``solid 
growth to continue over the next three months.'' It noted, however, 
that exports continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	On the inflation front, it said, ``Low input prices,  
particularly from foreign suppliers, together with productivity 
gains are expected to hold pressures on manufacturers' unit costs 
at all-time low levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kresge said that as Asian and European economies begin to  
recover, ``U.S. manufacturers will be in an excellent position to 
expand their presence in those markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J., provides  
commercial credit, marketing and purchasing information as well as 
account management services.

<HEADLINE> NFLPA Disputes Fla. Agent's Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Some documents that sports agent  
William ``Tank'' Black claims exonerate him of charges he made 
payments to college players do not exist, according to the NFL 
Players Association and the state attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA is accusing Black and an employee, Alfred Twitty, of  
giving money to players before their eligibility had expired at 
Florida, South Carolina and LSU. The agent submitted a formal 
response to the NFLPA's disciplinary complaint against him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The response refers to affidavits and statements made under oath  
by former Gators Johnny Rutledge, Jevon Kearse and Reggie McGrew 
last April. It said the statements are believed to be in possession 
of University of Florida campus police or the NFLPA. 
</P>
<P>
	If those statements exist, they would contradict the admission  
Rutledge made in May that he had taken $500 payments from Black 
over the period of a year. Rutledge also said that he, McGrew and 
Kearse had made sworn affidavits admitting the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The incriminating statements have not been made public because  
of an investigation by University of Florida police into Black's 
activities on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the original statements, chief assistant state attorney  
Bill Cervone told The Associated Press the players may have made 
them, but he knows of no written record of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made oral statements in preliminary interviews with law  
enforcement,'' Cervone said. ``But to my knowledge, there is no 
signed affidavit taken by law enforcement saying `He didn't give me 
anything.''' 
</P>
<P>
	NFLPA lawyer Richard Berthelsen told AP the same thing Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am not aware of any written statements that exist in which  
these players denied receiving cash payments,'' Berthelsen said. 
``I am aware of statements that exist to the contrary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University police spokeswoman Stacy Badics did not immediately  
return telephone messages left at her office. Previously, police 
had referred questions about the original statements to the state 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Black claims records of the statements do exist.  
</P>
<P>
	Black said the claim that the statements aren't there is more  
proof of a conspiracy by the union and other agents to kick him out 
of the agent business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows that these players took sworn statements the  
weekend of the draft,'' Black said. ``It was shocking to me that 
anyone would say they were not aware of those statements. Everyone 
knows they're there. It's never been an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a sworn statement included in Black's reply, former Gator  
Mike Peterson, who was also a subject of the investigation, talked 
about two meetings in which he was questioned. The first came at 
the state attorney's office in April, the second at the police 
station about a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if police took a sworn statement or just notes during the  
first meeting, Peterson replied: ``I believe it was a sworn 
statement, as well as notes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was taped or simply asked to tell the truth,  
Peterson replied: ``Just swore me in to tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said he went to the state attorney's office after  
receiving a subpoena. He said NFLPA representative Trace Armstrong 
was present during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the statements did exist, Cervone said their credibility  
would come into question. 
</P>
<P>
	``An initial denial of everything is so common in any criminal  
prosecution that it doesn't faze me a bit,'' Cervone said. ``That 
happens all the time, unfortunately, especially from people 
complicit in wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black claims the players changed their statements because of  
pressure applied by police. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA disciplinary committee will decide whether to penalize  
Black sometime this month. It could suspend or revoke his license. 
</P>
<P>
	Violation of Florida's agent law carries a maximum penalty of  
five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	If some record of the exonerating statements exists, they would  
be made available to Black if university police bring charges, 
Cervone said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe there exists any of what they're referring  
to,'' Cervone said. ``But if there are charges placed against him, 
he will get everything law enforcement has gathered in the case -- 
good, bad and ugly.''

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Bus drivers joined striking taxi drivers  
in walking off the job Tuesday, blocking streets in Ecuador's major 
cities to protest gasoline price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike forced many commuters to walk or bicycle to work,  
while long lines formed for the few buses still circulating. 
</P>
<P>
	The drivers say they have been hard hit by the South American  
nation's worst crisis in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad had announced the 13 percent gasoline  
price hike as part of a series of measures to trim a bloated budget 
deficit that has threatened to bankrupt the country. Gasoline now 
costs $1.20 a gallon in a country where monthly incomes hover at 
about $108 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government declared a state of emergency Monday to give  
soldiers and police special powers to break up blockades of bright 
yellow taxis at major intersections. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have detained 60 strikers in Quito and Guayaquil.

	URIBE, Colombia (AP) -- The government and leftist rebels have  
postponed for two weeks the formal start of peace negotiations 
previously scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement released Tuesday, the two sides cited  
logistical problems and the need to further discuss what role 
international verifiers will play in accompanying the fledgling 
talks aimed at ending a 35-year conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for President Andres Pastrana and the rebel  
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, were set to meet 
Wednesday in Uribe, a small town in the heart of a rebel-held swath 
of southern Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	The formal talks have now been postponed until July 20, the  
parties announced in the statement.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's newly privatized  
telephone system this week faced its biggest test this week -- and 
flunked. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of every three long-distance calls got through on  
Monday, the first business day since private competition began, the 
government's telecommunications agency said. The numbers were only 
slightly better on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To make a long-distance call, Brazilians now must choose among  
seven carriers by punching in a two-digit code in the middle of the 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite massive ad campaigns, the switchover Saturday took many  
callers by surprise. Phone companies were barraged by misdialed 
calls, and some simply blocked calls to avoid overloading circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sold its mammoth telecoms monopoly Telebras for  
$19 billion last year. 
</P>

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Nicaragua is slowing the pace at which  
its currency devalues against the dollar, thanks to an improving 
economy, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Arnoldo Aleman said that beginning Sunday, the  
official exchange rate of the cordoba will fall at an annual rate 
of 9 percent, compared with the current depreciation of 12 percent. 
The official exchange rate is now 11.86 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Aleman said the policy change was the result of economic  
policies that have cut inflation and allowed the country to 
accumulate more than $500 million in international reserves. 
</P>

	CIUDAD DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) -- Thousands of fishermen  
blockaded a major oil port on Tuesday, accusing a state-owned 
refinery of causing damage to fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,500 fishermen and 500 shrimping boat crews joined the  
blockade around Ciudad del Carmen in the southern Gulf of Mexico, 
according to the port authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishermen have long accused Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned  
oil monopoly known as Pemex, of polluting fishing areas. The 
conflict intensified last week when two fishermen died after their 
boat was allegedly rammed by a Navy patrol enforcing fishing 
restrictions.
