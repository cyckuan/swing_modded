ANKARA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Headscarf-wearing Merve Kavakci,
elected deputy of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), left the
parliament without taking oath Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
All the deputies of the central-left Democratic Left Party
(DSP) made a strong protest against Kavakci when she was entering

LUSAKA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Libya Sunday appealed to the southern
African countries to respect and support the peace agreement
signed in Tripoli last month concerning peace in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Visiting Libyan Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, Ali
Trek, told reporters here that the agreement signed between DRC
President Laurent Kabila and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was
a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Though not all the parties involved in the conflict were
present, the peace agreement would enable President Kabila to
dialog with the rebels, Trek said.

He expressed the hope that the Libyan agreement should be
respected just like the one which would be signed in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Libya recognizes the role played by Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba as chairman for the peace process in the DRC, the
assistant secretary said.

He explained that his country deplored the conflicts that had
rocked Africa for years and called for concerted efforts to
promote peace on the continent.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
Al-Faisal and visiting Japanese International Trade and Industry
Minister Kaoru Yosano held talks in the western Saudi city of
Jeddah Sunday on ways of boosting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that Yosano, who arrived in Saudi
Arabia on Friday, also met with Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim
al-Naimi on the oil issue.
</P>
<P>
But they didn't make any decision during the meeting, said a
source close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yosano has reportedly come to the region, which supplies 80
percent of Japan's oil imports, to smooth the negotiations between
Riyadh and Japan's Arabia Oil Company Ltd (AOC) on the renewal of
AOC's oil concession in the Saudi portion of the neutral area,
which will expire in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
In early March, al-Naimi told visiting Japanese vice Minister
of Foreign Affairs Nabutaka Machimura that negotiations on the
concession should be concluded by July.
</P>
<P>
Remarks made by al-Naimi suggested that Tokyo should meet
certain conditions in order to get a renewal of the rights, such
as increasing Japanese investment in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh has also expected Japan to step up crude oil imports
from the Gulf kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Yosano is also scheduled to visit Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Organizes Mass Evacuation of Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) Sunday organized a mass evacuation of Kosovo refugees from
Kukes, a border city in north Albania, to other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation started at 07:30 local time (0530 GMT) in the
main square of Kukes with NATO and Albanian Army trucks and buses
taking Kosovo refugees to the Mjede railway station in the Shkoder
district.
</P>
<P>
From the Mjede railway station, the refugees will be sent to
southern districts of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Private cars and public buses were also mobilized to take part
in the evacuation operation, which is expected to last several
days to take at least 100,000 Kosovo refugees out of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
The Tirana district sent seven buses on Sunday to Kukes for
transporting refugees, who number more than 130,000 in Kukes.
About 400 refugees arrived in Tirana, capital of Albania,
overnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian news agency ATA quoted an Albanian official as
saying that of the 400 refugees, 204 were housed in Tirana
families and the rest in the temporary reception center.
</P>
<P>
A new influx of Kosovo refugees occurred over the weekend with
more than 30,000 refugees having entered Albania through the
Morina border post from Friday.
</P>
<P>
There has been a shortage of drinking water in Kukes, a city
with merely 20,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
The sanitation condition in the refugees camps set up around
the city is also a cause of worry for UNHCR workers who fear for a
breakout of epidemic as the summer is drawing close.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a total of 3,000 Kosovo refugees were taken away
from Kukes, about 28 kilometers from the Morina border post.
</P>
<P>
Many refugees were reluctant to go because they want to stay
close to the border so that they can go home a bit easier when
conditions are ripe for their return to Kosovo.

BAGHDAD, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Sunday continued their attacks on Iraqi military sites, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 9:40 (0540 GMT) nine formations of
enemy warplanes of F-14, F-15, F-16 and Tornado AC6B coming from
Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over Erbil,
Dohuk and Mosul provinces.

The enemy planes bombed a military site in the region, said
the spokesman, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back
and forced the enemy planes to flee to their base in Turkey at
12:30 (0830 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Seventeen formations of enemy warplanes coming from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases also violated southern Iraqi airspace at 8:50 (0450
GMT) over Thi-Qar, Muthana, Qadisiya and Basra provinces, said the
spokesman, adding that Iraqi air defenses repulsed the enemy
planes at 11:50 (0750 GMT).
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have recently intensified their
bombardment on Iraqi targets, either civilian or military.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, they bombed a residential quarter in the
northern Iraqi city of Mosul, injuring 20 civilians.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, they bombed a tent of a shepherd, killing him and
five of his family members as well as 250 sheep.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S. and British air strikes against
Iraq, clashes between U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly
zones and the Iraqi air defenses have almost become daily
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>

Iraq has declared that it does not recognize the zones and
vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating its
airspace.

<P>
BEIRUT, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese woman was rejected to be
buried in Israeli occupied south Lebanon on Sunday, provoking a
sit-in by the funeral participants on the edge of the border zone,
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) warned the relatives of
Safiya Fouani, 90, that they would be shot if they tried to
advance toward the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Fourani wished to bury her in her hometown Houla,
inside the occupied zone and near Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The refusal provoked 300 marchers, most of whom originally from
Houla but were driven out by Israeli forces, to stage a sit-in
near the SLA checkpoint on the edge of the zone before turning to
Beirut to bury the dead woman.
</P>
<P>
Fouani is the second woman from Houla to be refused burial
since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>

The 2,500-strong SLA militia is collaborating with the Israelis
on patrolling the zone and handling the security affairs in

<HEADLINE> Britain Nominates Ambassador to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Sunday formally
introduced its charge d'affaires in Tehran Nicholas Brown as
ambassador to Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the agency that Iran would nominate
its ambassador to London in a reciprocal move in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of ambassadors was seen as a step to end a
long-standing diplomatic row between the two states since 1989,
after the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi
Khomeini issues a fatwa, or religious decree, against the life of
British writer Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death by accusing him of
blasphemy against the Islamic prophet Mohammad in his
controversial novel "the Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
Last September, Tehran and London reached an agreement to
upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level by putting aside
the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced that its government would not send any
commandos to kill Rushdie, a move interpreted by some Western
media as Iran's retreat from Khomeini's fatwa.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials later stated that the fatwa is
irrevocable, even though the Iranian government would not carry
it out.

<HEADLINE> Iran Underlines Ties With Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian First Vice President Hassan
Habibi said here Sunday that strong ties between Tehran and
Riyadh would be important and highly effective in restoring peace
and tranquility in the region and in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Habibi made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Saudi Second
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Sultan Ibn Abd
Al-Aziz, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Both officials called for expansion and consolidation of
bilateral cooperation and relations, especially in the areas of
trade and commerce, on the basis of mutual respect and confidence.
</P>
<P>
Iran's chairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) and Saudi Arabia's membership in the organization
can help increase the two countries' influence on the world of
Islam and their cooperation to solve problems of the Palestinian
and Kosovar people, Habibi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran was concerned about the homelessness of the
Palestinians and the violation of their rights by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Muslim countries to help end crises in Kosovo
and Palestine, and guarantee the return home of the people of
Kosovo and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official, who arrived here on Sunday evening for a
four-day official visit, said his country has always been trying
to bring about a durable peace in the region, especially in
Palestine, in accordance with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is for Israel's withdrawal from all its occupied
territories, including south Lebanon and the Golan Heights, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Tolerance to Beat Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
made a plea on Sunday for tolerance in the wake of the London bomb
attacks that have left three people dead.
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting of Sikhs in Birmingham in northern England
that the Brixton, Brick Lane and Soho blasts should spur a ''one
nation Britain'' free of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three dead from Friday's Soho attack on a gay pub
were a married woman and the best man at her wedding.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Dykes, 27, died immediately in the explosion at the
Admiral Duncan pub, in Old Compton Street. Her best man, John
Light, 32, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday 18 people remain in hospital. Four are said to be in
a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Blair linked the hatred and prejudice that drove
the bombers, to the impulses behind "ethnic cleansing" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The message of tolerance and respect which is at the heart of
the Sikh religion could not be more relevant where blacks, Asians
and gays have been under attack, or in Kosovo where racial hatred
has caused scenes of barbarity not seen in Europe since the Second
World War," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only good that can come out of these nail bombs is that
they spur all of us, whatever race, age, creed or sexuality, to
work harder to build the one nation Britain that the decent
majority want, and to bring our community closer together."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, detectives are continuing to question a man in
connection with the two-week terror campaign. He was arrested at a
house in a Hampshire village where "combustible materials" were
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
A neo-Nazi group calling themselves the White Wolves has
claimed responsibility for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Diplomatic Efforts Not Sufficient in Kosovo, Says Dini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Sunday that recent diplomatic efforts in Belgrade were not
enough to resolve the problems at the heart of the conflict over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Dini said to reporters that "the signs of dialogue so far
received are insufficient to resolve the main problem."
</P>
<P>
He also said that he hoped Clinton would show "some sign of
recognition of the gesture" represented by Milosevic's decision
Saturday to release three U.S. soldiers captured by Serbian forces
a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"There are initiatives to find a political solution, to open
talks on the basis of a number of demands listed by NATO, the
European Union and the United Nations Secretary-general Kofi
Annan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"An acceptance of these demands could lead to a pause in the
bombings and the withdrawal of troops," Dini added.
</P>
<P>
Dini also expressed "great regret" about Saturday's bombing of
a bus crossing a bridge near the Kosovo capital of Pristina, which
killed at least 34 civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Errors are inevitable when hundreds and hundreds of NATO
missions are being flown every day,"he said, hoping that "the
bombardments can soon be ended".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said that the
liberation of the three U.S. soldiers was "an important and
positive fact."
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped other acts would follow which would allow
a political approach to the conflict to be adopted and peace and
security to be established in Kosovo and the entire Balkan region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Rises Again in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal income rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in March following a 0.5 percent
increase in February and a 0.6 percent advance in January, the
Commerce Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Consumers kept pace with a 0.4 percent spending speedup in
March, more moderate than February's 0.8 percent growth but
nevertheless adding an eighth month to a streak of increases.
</P>
<P>
However, overall spending has outpaced income growth, leaving
the nation's personal savings rate down for five of the last six
months. In March, the savings rate held steady at a record low of
minus 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The consumer spending spree helped keep the U.S. economy
growing at a strong 4.5 percent annual rate during the first
quarter of this year, despite the fact that the nation's trade
deficit soared to a record level during the period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers' incomes declined. The farm sector has been
among the hardest hit by the record trade deficit resulting from
economic turmoil abroad.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending on services rose by 0.7 percent in March,
offsetting a 0.7 percent drop in purchases of durable goods,
big-ticket items expected to last three or more years. Spending on
nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, increased 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> May 4th Anti-Imperialism Movement Marked Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Large-scale gatherings were held
today in major Chinese cities across the country to mark the 80th
anniversary of the May 4th Movement.
</P>
<P>
The cities included Beijing, Shanghai and the capitals of
Shanxi and Sichuan provinces, and the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang
Uygur and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments at all levels took this
anniversary as a good opportunity to create greater awareness of
patriotism among young people. A number of young people were
granted awards for their meritorious work.
</P>
<P>
At the gatherings, local government leaders as well as
representatives of local students and soldiers made a common
pledge to inherit the May 4th Spirit and make contributions to the
current reform and opening drive, and the great cause of building
socialism with China's own characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from May 4, 1919, millions of Chinese people,
including many young students, took to the streets of Beijing to
demonstrate and protest against the then Chinese government led by
warlords who wanted to sign a humiliating international pact in
Paris under which China stood to lose Qingdao, a coastal city in
eastern Shandong Province, to Japan. The protest continued in many
Chinese cities till June that year.
</P>
<P>
Despite frenzied repression by the regime, the people did not
retreat. Finally, they forced the authorities to basically accede
to their demands, and China maintained its sovereignty over
Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
That made Qingdao a special place for commemorating the
incident. A series of memorial activities were held in the city,
including a Sunday ceremony by 2,000 local middle school students
to mark the arrival of their adulthood.

<HEADLINE> House Prices in Britain Set to Boom, Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 3 (Xinhua) Britain's housing market is set to boom
this summer, according to a leading economic forecaster released
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates and an improving economy will cause prices
of homes to rise by 8.5 percent in 1999, says a survey by the
Ernst &AMP; Young Item Club.
</P>
<P>
The predictions are based on the Treasury's own mathematical
model of the economy. And the rise could be nationwide, not just
around London.
</P>
<P>
Surging house prices will be welcome news for homeowners but
could give the government problems by raising fears of an
over-heating economy and rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe it could bring an early end to further
interest rate cuts, and even force the government to hike taxes
ahead of the next election.
</P>
<P>
The survey comes as the Bank of England considers whether to
cut interest rates again from their present level of 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Peter Spencer, Item Club economist adviser, said: "For the
whole of the decade people have been held back from moving by
various factors such as high interest rates, job insecurity and
fears of another crash."
</P>
<P>
"Now these factors have all been removed, so for the first time
this decade this pent-up demand is beginning to feed through," he
added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday voiced his welcome to the Yugoslav decision to
release the three American soldiers, caught somewhere inside the
Yugoslav territory about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the release of the three soldiers, I am happy for
them and I am happy for their families," he said, "But we still
have a lot of work to do on the political and diplomatic front
before I can say that we are on the verge of a deal."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks in answering press questions upon his
arrival at the U.N. headquarters here on Monday morning. This is
the first public response to the April 30 release of the three
U.S. servicemen following talks between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the Rev. Jesse Jackson in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, back from visits to Germany and Russia at the
end of April, is expected to meet with Russian Special Envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin here.
</P>
<P>
"I do expect him to come to New York to continue the
discussions that started in Moscow," Annan said. As to when the
talks would take place, he said, "I am waiting for confirmation of
the time."
</P>
<P>
"The trip to Moscow and Berlin has reconfirmed my belief that
we should do whatever we can to find a political solution because
the implications of the alternative is too frightening to
contemplate," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorisation of the U.N. Security Council,
launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent
member of the U.N. family, violating the U.N. Charter and
international law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led military alliance has so far sidelined the United
Nations politically since the bombing of Yugoslavia began on March
24. Annan is trying his best to use his influence to forge an
agreement over the Kosovo crisis, which broke out in February
since the ethnic Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for
independence of the Serbian province.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Republican Party of the
United States held its first major presidential forum of the 2000
campaign in New Hampshire on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Eight actual and potential candidates addressed a crowd of
1,200 in New Hampshire, which will stage the first-in-the-nation
presidential primary next February when citizens cast early and
closely watched votes for their preferred nominee of the party.
</P>
<P>
The eight candidates, delivering their speeches separately to
party activists, explained in a time limit of seven minutes why
they should be the party's presidential nominee instead of George
W. Bush, Texas Governor and son of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
The eight candidates are former vice President Dan Quayle,
former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander, former cabinet member
Elizabeth Dole, publisher Steve Forbes, Ohio Republican John
Kasich, conservative activist Gary Bauer, radio host Alan Keyes,
New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith.
</P>
<P>
The Early frontrunner George W. Bush was absent as were Arizona
Senator John McCain, and columnist Pat Buchanan. Bush has refused
to campaign outside his state until the legislative session ends
later this spring.
</P>
<P>
Their speeches were dominated by the recent massacre at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in which 15 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Dole, wife of defeated 1996 Republican nominee Bob
Dole, declared her support for a ban on assault weapons which
many conservatives bitterly oppose and want to overturn.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you need an Ak-47 to defend your family," she
said in the speech. "I also favor safety locks on guns to
protect our children."
</P>
<P>
Most candidates also fiercely attacked the U.S. role in
Kosovo. Keyes called it an immoral attack on a country that had
never harmed the United States.
</P>
<P>
The New Hampshire primary, tentatively scheduled for February
15, 2000, is different from any other event in a presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
The state is small and a large proportion of its voters
expect to meet the candidates personally, rather than learn of
their views through paid advertisements.
</P>
<P>
The Republican race is more complicated than the two-man
contest being waged among Democrats between Vice President Al
Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Obuchi's Official Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) --President Bill Clinton on Monday
held a welcome ceremony for Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
for his official visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
At the South Lawn of the White House, Clinton praised Obuchi
for acting quickly to start pulling his nation out of its
lingering recession.
</P>
<P>
"You have been in office less than a year, but already you have
taken important steps in meeting the challenges that face you, and
reaching the goals that united us," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, the first Japanese prime minister taking the official
visit to Washington in 12 years, told Clinton that the Japanese
economy was beginning to show signs of improvement and he had an
"unwavering resolve" to make sure it revived.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy is showing an emerging sign of change for the
better," Obuchi said. "I am determined to ensure a successful
revitalization of the Japanese economy to overcoming, with
unwavering resolve, any obstacle we may encounter in the precess."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Obuchi then adjourned to their summit meeting with
trade, the U.S.-Japanese military relationship and the pace of
economic reform on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's aides said the president would press Obuchi to do
more to open the Japanese market to speed the recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has taken some constructive steps on banking and fiscal
matters," said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. "But it's
important that they continue to implement those policies in a
sustained way and do more to open and deregulate their economy."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are worried that Japan cannot achieve the growth
rate of 0.5 percent that Obuchi's government is predicting this
year, since some Japanese and international forecasters say there
will be negative growth well into next year.
</P>
<P>
They also note that Japan still lacks a plan for the economic
recovery's second phase, several months after Obuchi took office
and immediately began pumping billions of dollars into the
economy to try to end the recession.

<HEADLINE> Japan Intends to Join Oil Embargo to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan is expected to join in a
voluntary embargo on oil exports to Yugoslavia, a Japanese
government source said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source said Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will tell U.S.
President Bill Clinton at their summit meeting that Japan was
already acting in concert with NATO on economic sanctions toward
Yugoslavia and now intended to join the oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Tokyo's decision is mostly symbolic, since Japan
has to import almost all of its oil and has little petroleum
products to spare for export.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the world's second largest oil consumer, but has
almost no oil of its own as the country's oil production is a
paltry 81,000 barrels a day.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Yugoslavia's release
of three U.S. prisoners of war would not prompt a lull in NATO
bombing in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
-- The Washington D.C. Council's proposed $431.3 million income
and property tax cut for the District primarily would benefit
wealth city residents and businesses and would throw the city back
into a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton planned to meet Victor Chernomyrdin,
the Russian envoy for the Balkans, on Monday to discuss possible
solutions to the war in Kosovo. Administration officials said it
was unclear whether the Russian was bringing any new proposals.
</P>
<P>
-- Reports that the two students involved in the shootings in
Littleton Colo. had played violent computer games and that one of
them had posted descriptions of making pipe bombs on a Web site
appeared to have sharpened parents' concerns about the on-line
activities of their children.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton said on Sunday he was grateful to
Jesse Jackson, who convinced Belgrade to free the POWs, but the
White House rebuffed Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
request for a pause in airstrikes and talks with the U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
-- Friday's announcement of a record Japanese unemployment rate
may show just how far the country is from recovery. But the
government appears to believe that fast-rising unemployment and
economic growth can coexist.

<P>
KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin has urged the
Chinese people of all 56 nationalities to join their hearts and
fates together, ceaselessly consolidate their relationship of
equality, unity and mutual assistance, and promote common
development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark
during his recent trip to Yunnan, where the '99 International
Horticultural Exposition opened in the provincial capital May 1.
</P>
<P>
Apart from attending the opening ceremony of the horticultural
gala, Jiang made an inspection tour from April 28 to May 3 of this
southwestern province, home to people of 25 ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Jiang visited some villages of minority people
in Kunming and Lijiang, an old town which was devastated by an
earthquake in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with the quake victims in Lijiang, Jiang expressed
his deep concern about their lives since the natural disaster. He
displayed satisfaction when he learned of the efforts, including
over 2,000 projects, made by the local government to help the
quake victims rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
The president spoke highly of the great achievements the local
people have made since November 1989, when he previously paid a
visit to the province.
</P>
<P>
The top military commander also visited several army barracks
and told the soldiers to keep their duty in mind, maintain the
stability and centralization of the armed forces, and take
substantial action to contribute more to the economic buildup and
defense work.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is a province with a very long border line with
neighboring countries, and is of great strategic importance, Jiang
stressed.

<HEADLINE> International Land Mine Conference Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The First Meeting of States Parties
(FMSP) to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and
on Their Destruction (the "Ottawa Treaty") opened here Monday with
over 1,000 participants from 72 countries and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting here in Maputo, Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano said the meeting offered a good opportunity for
mapping out strategies to eliminate anti-personnel land mines to
rid peoples of the world of their danger.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all parties will coordinate and
reach consensus at the meeting to achieve the goal of rooting out
land mines in ten years time.
</P>
<P>
Surveys showed that a total of two million mines have been
planted all over Mozambique during the country's civil war.
Therefore, said the president, it will take about 160 years to
clear all the mines at the current rate of removing 11,000 mines
per year.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries,
74 of which have ratified it. Its ambitious goal is to clear all
the mines on the earth, which is estimated to be over 300 million,
before the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
Chissano called on joint efforts by all countries and the
international community to implement the Treaty, which was
effective in September, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The issue of anti-personnel mines has topped the political
itinerary of southern Africa. The 1997 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) summit in Malawi issued a declaration
asking all SADC members to prohibit anti-personnel mines, treating
it as a national policy.
</P>
<P>
The president revealed that a SADC de-mining committee has been
set up to coordinate efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all signatories to the Treaty to ratify it as
soon as possible, and those who have not signed the Treaty to do
it.
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening were also Louise Frechette, assistant
secretary- general of the United Nations, and Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary -general of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to end on May 7.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Students Discuss May 4th Tradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 150,000 university students in
this east China metropolis have organized a variety of campus
activities to review tradition of the May 4th Movement of 1919,
which was an anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, political and cultural
movement.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting organized by the municipal University Students'
Association, the students discussed how young people at that time
held high the patriotic banner of anti-imperialism and anti-
feudalism to pursue democracy and scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
To inherit that spirit at the present time means to adhere to
the instructions made by President Jiang Zemin to young people,
said a student from prestigious Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
A related speech contest had as its theme the motto of the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping -- "I am a son of the Chinese people".
</P>
<P>
Pan Jing, a student from East China Teachers' University, said
in her speech: "Deng Xiaoping's theory of 'One Country, Two
Systems' has made it possible for me to stand here to say with so
much pride that I am a Chinese."
</P>
<P>
She said these words with tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
Students also showed their talents and their will to pursue
knowledge in thousands of scientific renovation designs submitted
to a "Challenge Cup" contest.

<P>
He expressed the hope that the Democratic Party would continue
to play an active and constructive role in developing the
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Democratic Party Kan Naoto, who is also head of the
delegation, said Japan's invasion of China brought about great
suffering to people of both countries, and Japan should conduct
deep introspection concerning its aggression to prevent such a
tragedy from recurring.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China are close neighbors, so the development of
their friendship is of great significance for both countries, Kan
Naoto said, adding that the Democratic Party is willing to exert
efforts in this regard through its cooperation with the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Democratic Party delegation is on a China visit at

TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said here Monday that relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia
will benefit the region and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul Aziz, Khatami said
the two countries should actively contribute to dialog among
civilizations, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed the Gulf the world's "most important strategic
region," saying cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh would
guarantee a lasting security in the region.

<P>
Iran assumes the policy of expanding relations with other
countries, especially with the neighboring countries, on the

should address the needs of the people, who have been driven from
their homes, and should check the aggressors and tyrants."
</P>
<P>
Citing the Kosovo crisis as one of the biggest human
catastrophes, Khatami said that Iran and Saudi Arabia shared close
viewpoints on the Kosovo crisis and all Muslim states should
prevent in Kosovo the repetition of the tragedies of the homeless
Palestinian people.

<HEADLINE> Anti-AIDS Drugs Cause New Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The powerful cocktail of anti-AIDS
drugs that has dramatically slashed death rate from the AIDS virus
is now causing its own problems, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
AIDS experts worry that the success of the drug combination
known as anti-retroviral treatment is leading to a false sense of
security among infected patients as well as those most at risk of
infection.
</P>
<P>
"Infected individuals have thought they were cured, and they
have behaved inappropriately," said Michael O'Shaughnessy, head of
the B.C. Center for Excellence in HIV-AIDS at St Paul's Hospital
in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"We also know of individuals who are taking risks in spite of
danger of infection. They think there is a cure for AIDS. There is
not a cure. It's worrying."
</P>
<P>
Pill fatigue is another problem, Dr. O'Shaughnessy said. Many
regimens require as many as 35 pills a day, some with water, some
without, others with meals.
</P>
<P>
"They have to do this for the rest of their life," he said. "I
can't imagine what it must be like. No wonder some of them suffer
from pill fatigue."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more and more patients taking the most common
anti-AIDS drugs are developing severe fat problems, such as "
buffalo humps" on their backs or increased girth known as "
protease paunch".
</P>
<P>
A recent study conducted among more than 100 HIV-positive
people showed that 64 percent had developed abnormal fat
distribution while taking protease inhibitor, the most common
class of anti-AIDS drug.
</P>
<P>
Only three percent of HIV carriers did not show similar
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AIDS virus in some patients is already
developing resistance to some of the most common anti-retroviral
drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing emerging patterns of resistance," said Donald
Sutherland, director of the AIDS bureau of the Federal Laboratory
Center for Disease Control. "We may see a resurgence of AIDS and
people dying. It's so difficult to keep pace with new mutations (
of the virus). Viral loads are rising again. It's getting tougher
to manage."
</P>
<P>
Mark Wainberg, director of the McGill AIDS Center in Montreal
and president of the International AIDS Society, said that nearly
one-third of a group of 64 HIV-infected people had started to show
virus resistance to at least one anti-AIDS drug.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we give the virus even the smallest opportunity
replicate, it will do so. It will outsmart us and grow as fast as
ever."
</P>
<P>
However, no one disputes the positive effect of the new
combination of AIDS drugs and treatment techniques.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics indicated that 150 deaths from AIDS were
reported in Canada last year, down nearly 90 percent in comparison
with 1,420 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Dr Sutherland warned that there was a long time before the
epidemic runs its course, especially with an estimated 15,000
people in Canada unaware they are HIV virus carriers.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis: A Million at Risk in E. Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- With the widespread of meningitis in
Sudan, more than one million people remain at risk in seven
badly-affected eastern states, the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a news release available
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting to contain the epidemic in White Nile, Gezira, Sennar,
Kassala, Gedaref, Blue Nile and Red Sea states, the Sudanese Red
Crescent supported by the Federation is close to completing a
vaccination campaign targeted more than 2.25 million people, said
the Nairobi-based regional delegation of the Federation.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional delegation said, a further 1.19 million
of the population, aged between two to 30, need to be vaccinated
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the height of a hot, dry season and therefore
meningitis can be expected to spread fast. It is necessary to
act quickly to bring this epidemic under control and prevent it
taking more lives," said Manan Ganguli, health delegate of the
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Vaccine is still required to cover the extended operation
targeting densely populated urban areas as well as rural districts
with a high incidence of the disease, Ganguli added.
</P>
<P>
Since December, said the news release, 3,156 cases have been
reported in seven eastern states with 207 deaths. Nationwide,
there have been 16, 591 cases and 1,236 deaths, mainly among
children and young adults.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that thousands of Red Crescent workers have
been mobilized to fight the epidemic. And the agency is
distributing the treatment drug of choice, syringes and needles to
health facilities, in addition to conducting a public awareness
campaign.

<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac will
pay a visit to Russia from May 12 to 13, when he will discuss with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin the crisis in Yugoslavia, said the
Elysee presidential palace on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has chosen to engage in a positive dialogue with the
allies on the crisis of Kosovo, by taking fully into account the
five conditions presented by the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
" said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The Russian presidential press service announced earlier on

</P>
<P>
The announcement of the visit coincided with an intensification
of diplomatic efforts by Russia to seek a political solution to
the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
"France has always hoped that Russia would participate fully in
the construction of a Europe of security and peace. It is in this
spirit that the president of the republic will meet on May 13 in
Moscow with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other Russian
leaders," said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The Russian presidential envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, left
Moscow for Washington on Monday to brief U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the results of his talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic last Friday in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Urges Youth to Carry on May 4th Tradition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, urges young people all over the country to carry
on the tradition of the movement in an editorial in commemoration
of the 80th anniversary of the May 4th Movement.
</P>
<P>
The editorial first extended festival greetings to young people
nationwide on the occasion of Youth Day, and then paid respects to
the revolutionary forerunners who sacrificed their lives for the
nation's liberation, the happiness of the Chinese people and the
revitalization of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 20th century is a great century, the editorial said, and
the May 4th Movement of 1919 gave momentum not only to
revolutionary changes in the modern history of China, but also to
an even more greater historical revolution, which made the
movement a milestone in the country's democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement was a great patriotic movement, as well as
a great movement for ideological liberation. The slogan, "Struggle
for national sovereignty and punish traitors to China", which was
promoted by the movement, and its anti-imperialist and anti-feudal
struggle, awakened the whole Chinese nation, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement, which advocated new culture, opposed old
culture, advocated science and democracy, and opposed superstition
and dictatorship, played an important role in promoting Marxism in
China and the establishment of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
the editorial said.

<TEXT>
<P>
As time goes by, the May 4th Movement's impact on the Chinese
historical process is becoming increasingly strong, the editorial
noted. Thus, it is very meaningful to commemorate the movement,
carry on its tradition, and incorporate the spirit of the May 4th
Movement into the cause of reform and opening-up and the
construction of socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
To carry on the tradition of the May 4th Movement is to hold
higher the flag of patriotism and progress. To build a rich and
strong country and shake off ignorance and poverty are the ideal
which generations of Chinese have struggled for, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
The history of the past 80 years has proved that a country
which is not strong enough is not able to safeguard its dignity,
and is bereft of hope and a future, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, especially during the
past two decades of reform and opening-up, the country's economic
construction has made great achievements, the living standards of
the Chinese people have improved, the international status of
China has been raised markedly, and the Chinese people have never
felt so proud and elated before.
</P>
<P>
Today, the spirit of patriotism and progress means working hard
for the prosperity of the country, and concentrating our wisdom
and energy to develop social productive forces, to step up reform
and opening-up, and socialist modernization construction, the
editorial said, adding that this is in the fundamental interests
of the Chinese nation and is the deepest significance of
patriotism and progress.

<P>
To inherit the tradition of the May 4 Movement demands
displaying democracy and respecting science, the editorial
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The paper went on to say that tremendous changes have taken
place in China, compared with 80 years ago, and that the level of
science and democracy the country has achieved so far is
remarkable to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
However, the editorial pointed out that it should be understood
that to further promote economic development and social progress
depends on the improvement of the sense of science and culture of
the nation as a whole, and the strengthening of socialist
democracy and the legal system.
</P>
<P>
By giving priority to democracy and science, China should go
all out to implement its strategy of "reinvigorating the nation
with science and education" and the basic state policy of "
governing the country according to law", in order to enhance the
level of the socialist modernization drive as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
To inherit the tradition of the May 4th Movement demands
further ideological emancipation and concentrating on the current
reform, the editorial said, calling the movement a great
ideological emancipation for breaking out of the cage of the old
thinking and culture, and seeking a road to save the nation and
the people.
</P>
<P>
After a strenuous search, the Chinese people finally made
socialism their choice and achieved a huge victory, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, our reform and opening-up drive has entered its final
stage, " it noted. "It is necessary to further carry out
ideological emancipation, be bolder and work harder."
</P>
<P>
The editorial hailed the May 4th Movement as a great movement
of youth which fostered young people generation after generation.
Young people have always stood in the forefront of the revolution
and construction, and have made important contributions to the
revival of the nation, it added.
</P>
<P>
Young people can not make achievements unless they combine
their youth with science, patriotism, and the needs of the nation
and the people, the editorial suggested.
</P>
<P>
The paper called upon young Chinese to hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, closely unite around the CPC
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and wholly
implement the essence of the 15th CPC National Congress. It urged
them to strive hard to complete the cause of building socialism
with China's own characteristics into the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A sprinkling system was installed
today in the coal harbor of Tianjin Harbor, the largest in north
China, to reduce the degree of air and marine pollution caused by
suspended coal particles.
</P>
<P>
The system is part of Tianjin's efforts to treat marine
pollution. This major trading port on the edge of China's only
continental shelf, in the Bohai Sea, has implemented strict
measures to protect the marine environment from deteriorating,
after a "red tide" alert in August and September last year.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea, covering 77,000 sq km, is seriously polluted by
waste discharged by the three provinces of Shandong, Liaoning and
Hebei, as well as by the city of Tianjin, which amounts to 2.8
billion tons of sewage and 700,000 tons of solid waste a year.
</P>
<P>
The waste producers have combined their efforts to treat
pollution by initiating the "Blue Sea Project". The work of
collecting accurate data on how serious the sea has been polluted
is expected to be completed before the end of June this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has ranked as the third
most important reexport center in the world after Hong Kong and
Singapore, the Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the UAE Industrial Bank said that the total
reexport trade volume reached 24 billion Dirhams (6.5
billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that the reexport trade had an average
annual growth of 15 percent over the past four years, making up
one third of the country's total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The reexport earnings are a major part of Dubai's revenues and
the thriving reexport also further activate the development of
transport, travel, tourism and hotel.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco need to add 30,000 to 50,000 beds in the
coming four years to accommodate the anticipated flocks of tourists
in view of the pickup of the country's tourism.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan Minister of Finance and Economy Driss Jettou said that
tourist industry enjoys priority in government investment and some
building materials and equipment for hotel construction are also
exempted from taxes and tariffs, the Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He added that investors in the sector will enjoy further
preferential measures, including a 50 percent exemption from the
tax with a view to improving the performance of tourism companies.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who visited Morocco last year stood at 2 million and
travel agencies expect the number to reach 2.5 million this year,
with most tourists coming from traditional markets like France,
Germany, Spain, Italy, Britain, the U.S. and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
With the recovery of the tourism, earnings from tourist
industry, export of phosphate and transmittances from Moroccan
expatriates will become the pillar source of the country's hard
currency receipts.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Algeria has been admitted as the seventeenth member
of the Arab Investment Company, the Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has paid a membership fee of 6 million dollars to the
Riyadh-based company, which is equivalent to 1.6 percent of the
company capital.
</P>
<P>
An official of the company said that Algeria's admission will
enhance the company's capabilities and efforts in making good
use of Arab resources.
</P>
<P>
The admission will enable the company to benefit from the
promising investment opportunities in Algeria, which is abundant
in natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1974, the investment company is owned by the
governments of 17 Arab states, with a licensed capital of 400
million dollars, and a paid capital of 372 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company conducts investment activities through its
headquarters in Riyadh and branches in Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- French and Egyptian electricity companies have signed
an agreement for the construction of two thermal power plants in
Egyptian Port Said and Suez respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two thermal plants, with power generation of 650 megawatts
each, need an investment of some 800 million Euro (845.4 million
dollars), the Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The French electricity company will finance the construction of
the plants and operate them for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The French company also signed a contract Saturday with
Egyptian "GASCO" and "CITYGAS" for purchasing natural gas to
operate the two plants.
</P>
<P>
About 100 French companies are engaged in various business
activities in Egypt, plus over 50 Egyptian-French joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
These firms have participated in some major projects in Egypt,
such as the expansion of metro network in Cairo, the construction
of a tunnel for cars under Al Azhar street in Cairo and the
establishment of desalination plants in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> 1st Foreign Marrow Transplant to Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The marrow of a volunteer from the
Republic of Korea (ROK) was transplanted to a 27-year-old Chinese
man here today, China's first transplant of a foreign marrow.
</P>
<P>
Li Jie, a frontier guard of Korean ethnic group from Jilin
Province, has been hospitalized twice for severe leukemia since
last October.
</P>
<P>
The doctors could find no eligible marrow from local marrow
banks to transplant to Li, who is an only child. Finally, they
discovered an eligible male supplier of the marrow in a ROK
hospital via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The operation was smoothly completed, but it will not be known
if it was successful until after one month, as this is the time it
takes for the marrow to take root, according to the doctors. Li is
very weak after months of chemotherapy, they noted.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to find transplantable marrow from a foreign
country, and it is very expensive as well, they noted.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed in a
roadside bombing in south Lebanon on Monday morning, an Israeli
army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Another Israeli soldier was moderately wounded in the chest in
the explosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a millitiaman of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army was also lightly wounded in a mortar and rocket attack
launched by guerrillas in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 allegedly to protect its northern border from attacks by
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the South
Lebanon Army are now in the so-called "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Monday's explosion brought to nine the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
The frequent casualties have aroused public calls in Israel
for a withdrawal from south Lebanon. And the calls have increased
as the May 17 Israeli general elections are approaching.

<HEADLINE> AmCham Intensifies Lobbying for China's WTO Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of Commerce
in Hong Kong (AmCham) said here today that prospects for an early
agreement between the United States and China on China's accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) look promising.
</P>
<P>
However, an orchestrated lobbying efforts by the American
business community, nationally and internationally, will be
required to muster enough votes to pass a skeptical U.S. congress,
said an AmCham delegation that has just returned from a week-long
advocacy mission in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
AmCham's delegation, led by chairman Jason Felton, was in
Washington D.C. from April 26 to 30 to pledge the American
business community in Hong Kong's unequivocal support for a prompt
agreement on China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
The AmCham delegation met 133 of members of the congress and
government officials during their trip to Washington D.C. and 65
percent of them had voiced their support over an agreement with
China for the WTO accession, AmCham President Frank Martin said.
</P>
<P>
During their meetings, AmCham delegates underscored the
importance or reaching a strong WTO agreement based on its own
merits and not political considerations.
</P>
<P>
"In many of our meetings, we sensed a clear understanding that
China's accession to the WTO would be mutually beneficial for
America and China but domestic politics coupled with concerns over
China's human rights record, alleged theft of sensitive technology
and an escalating trade deficit are powerful ambivalent forces
working in the minds of congress members," Felton said.
</P>
<P>
A number of senior officials indicated to the AmCham delegation
that they hoped to strike a WTO accord with the Chinese as soon as
possible so that congress could be asked to vote on legislation
granting China Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status on a permanent
basis, rather than annual renewal, before the June 3 deadline.
</P>
<P>
"AmCham will also rally the support of our regional voice -- the
Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce, a 40,000-
member strong organization," he added.
</P>
<P>
During their week-long visit, the AmCham delegation met with
over 130 members of the House and Senate, senior officials from
the White House and Department of Commerce, Defense, State and
Treasury. Meetings were also held with influential think tanks and
business organizations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Anti-Piracy Efforts Acknowledged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
acknowledged the steps taken by Malaysia in combating pirated
products, but will monitor the progress to ensure that Malaysia's
efforts produce a concrete reduction in piracy rates, the U.S.
embassy here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has taken steps including the creation of an
inter-agency task force to develop and implement a regulatory
regime for optical disc (OD) production, development of
manufacturing and retail level enforcement efforts and revised
affidavit requirements, the U.S. embassy said in a statement
issued here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has also prioritized efforts to deter unlicensed use
of software by end-users, it said.
</P>
<P>
The United State will conduct an out-of-cycle Special 301
review in September this year to assess Malaysia's progress
towards substantially reducing pirated OD production and export,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that pirated products believed to have
originated from Malaysia have been identified throughout the
Asia-Pacific region, North America, South America and Europe and
are sold openly in public markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said reports indicated that at least 90 OD (CD,
CD-ROM, VCD and DVD) production lines are operating in Malaysia
and combined production capacity of these lines far exceeds local
demand plus legitimate exports.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysian Firm in Dispute with Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and a
Malaysian-backed company have brought their long-standing dispute
to a Washington-based center for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The dispute since last year has been centered on the building
cost of a 100-megawatt thermal power plant constructed by the
company in Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The non-tribunal arbitrator, the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes, a member of the World Bank
group, will start hearing the dispute next month, said Patrick
Rutabanzibwa, permanent secretary in the Tanzanian Ministry of
Energy and Minerals,
</P>
<P>
Independent Power Tanzania Limited (IPTL), the Malaysian
company, has claimed that it has invested 150 million U.S. dollars
in the power plant, while the state-owned Tanzanian Electric
Supply Company (TANESCO) maintains that the project is only worth
90 million.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this divergence, the IPTL intends to sell the
electricity generated from the plant at 21 U.S. cents per kilowatt
hour (kwh), while the government wants the price to be set at nine
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank had
been against the project, saying that a 21-cent power tariff would
be an unacceptable burden on Tanzania's fragile economy.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government, however, awarded the
multi-million-dollar contract to IPTL in 1994 as an emergency
means to solve a power crisis.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian investors have 70 percent of shares in the project
while Tanzania has a 30-percent stake. Construction of the power
plant in the northern outskirts of Dar es Salaam was completed
last September but no electricity has been produced due to the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, IPTL filed a case with Tanzania's High Court demanding
TANESCO to pay it 3.6 million U.S. dollars monthly as fixed
capacity power cost since September, when commercial production
had been scheduled to commence.
</P>
<P>
The High Court ordered TANESCO to start paying the monthly
charge early this year pending mediation on the plant's actual
cost but the government responded by challenging the ruling in the
Court of Appeal, which is scheduled to hear the case on May 14.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's electricity production depends mainly on hydropower
stations and the east African country often experienced power
outages during dry seasons.

BAGHDAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were seriously
injured in explosions of two cluster bombs in the southern province
of Thi-Qar, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted director of civil defense in Thi-Qar province as
saying that the two bombs went off as two citizens were at a
pasture feeding their sheep last week.
</P>
<P>
The director, whose name was not given, said that civil
defense teams had rushed to the scene and found two other duds
there. But he added that the two duds were safely defused.
</P>
<P>
INA said the civil defense teams in the province have defused
7,000 duds of various kinds since the end of 1991 Gulf War, which
was set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the Gulf War, southern Iraq was the major battle fields
between Iraq and the U.S.-led allied forces which ended Iraq's
seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi media often reported casualties caused by duds dropped
by U.S.-led allied forces during the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Rules Out Gov't Bailout of PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Monday ruled out using government resources to bail out
debt-ridden Philippine Airlines (PAL).
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in an interview that he will discuss with his
economic managers instead on how his administration can help in
other ways to keep the flag carrier flying.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he will not allow the use of public funds to
aid distressed private corporations such as PAL.
</P>
<P>
"The government had already spent so much, billions of money,
bailing out private corporations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, though, that "the most important thing that we
have to ensure" is to keep PAL in business.
</P>
<P>
A labor-management dispute forced PAL to temporarily shut down
operations in September last year, but Estrada personally took
steps to revive the airlines.
</P>
<P>
Workers eventually approved a referendum that upheld an accord
with employers and paved the way for PAL's reopening.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines is
now in the process of putting in place a rehabilitation program
for the airline.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Work Harder for Overseas Workers' Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Monday pledged to work harder in providing government assistance
to Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) to guarantee their welfare and
safety.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the face of the financial turmoil that gripped
Asia, these "modern day heroes provided infusions to our foreign
exchange that have lightened our economic burden."
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the 17th anniversary celebration of the
Overseas Workers Welfare Administration in Manila, Estrada also
reiterated his commitment to protect and uphold the rights and
welfare of Filipino citizens working abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the economic condition improves, he said, more
OFWs will be coming home and it is necessary to make sure that
there will be opportunities awaiting them.
</P>
<P>
"While more and more Filipino workers go overseas to look for
employment, there are others who are returning home for good.
These workers will also need assistance to start their lives
anew," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be there to lend a helping hand. To serve them
effectively and efficiently should be our continuing commitment,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1997, the OFWs remitted more than 24 billion U.S.
dollars back to the country, providing the economy with a safety
net in the face of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since he assumed office on June 30, 1998, Estrada has
introduced several programs to safeguard the interests of the
OFWs.

GUANGZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua)-- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
left here for home today after wrapping up a week-long official
visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Chuan arrived in Guangzhou from Guilin City of Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region Sunday, and provincial governor Lu Ruihua met
with him yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Guangdong and Thailand share many things in common in
both their natural and economic conditions, and the Asian
financial crisis has also brought about difficulties to Guangdong.
He expressed appreciation over Thailand's efforts in dealing with
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he chose to visit Guangdong because of two special
reasons. First, Guangdong is the home of many Thai people of
Chinese origin, the other is that Guangdong serves as the bridge
of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Foreign Minister Arrived for Landmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh
Muhammad bin Mubarak bin Hamad al-Khalifa arrived here on Monday
for his two-day landmark visit to discuss ways of expanding
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency said in a brief report
that Sheikh Muhammad was welcomed by Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister for Arab-African Affairs Mohammad Sadr.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini official will hold talks with Iranian officials
during their two-day stay in Tehran on ways of expanding
bilateral relations, regional developments and Muslim world issues.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini official Gulf News Agency reported that Sheikh
Muhammad would deliver a message from the Bahraini Emir Sheikh
Hamad ibn Issa al-Khalifa to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Manama and Tehran exchanged their ambassadors recently, some
30 months after the two countries downgraded their diplomatic
ties over an alleged pro-Iranian attempt to overthrow the
Bahraini government by force. Iran has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi visited Manama in
March, following the death of the former emir Sheikh Issa ibn
Salman al-Khalifa, to convey Tehran's condolences.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors have
improved after President Khatami came to power in August 1997
with a detente policy to expand ties with neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Government Monday assured
consumers that it continues to protect public interest by guarding
against unreasonable increases in petroleum product prices.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press briefing, Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas and
Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui said that their departments have
been coordinating very closely against unscrupulous businessmen
following the full deregulation of the oil industry in 1998.
</P>
<P>
While oil companies now set their own prices, the government is
prepared to step in if petroleum product prices reach unreasonably
high levels, the senior officials said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the government continuously monitors movements in
crude oil prices, the peso-dollar exchange rate, and oil inventory
levels.
</P>
<P>
These measures will ensure domestic petroleum product prices
remain fair and in line with international price levels, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also disclosed that a government task force
has intensified its inspection of service stations to make sure
consumers get the quality and quantity they pay for.

to 12.38 Australian dollars while its preferred shares were off
26.2 cents to 11.55 Australian dollars.

Telecom Italia SPA's unprofitable television unit Stream.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia surrendered 47.2 cents to
27.043 Australian dollars and National Australia Bank dropped 42

In the resources sector, global miner Rio Tinto was at the head
of the upward move, rising 23.9 cents to 25.689 Australian dollars
while diversified miner BHP lost 20.9 cents to 16.875 Australian
dollars as profit-takers moved in on last week's gains.
</P>

billion U.S. dollar deficit.

<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The case that the Irish triple
Olympic champion swimmer Michelle Smith-de Bruin appealed against
a four-year ban for tampering with a urine sample began at the
Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Swimming's world governing body International Amateur Swimming
Federation (FINA) imposed the ban last August after finding the
swimmer guilty of tampering with the sample, which contained
lethal levels of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Smith-de Bruin has always maintained her innocence. She
alleges a third party must have tampered with the sample to ruin
her career and reputation.
</P>
<P>
Smith-de Bruin's legal team at the hearing argued that FINA had
not observed proper procedures in dealing with the urine sample
and that it could have been altered by someone other than her.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Sacked Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson
claimed that he was tempted to take over as coach of the
Australian national team from Terry Venables, according to local
reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson is in charge of Serie A Inter Milan until the end of
the season and he said he would relish working with the largely
overseas-based Australian players.
</P>
<P>
"The job has appeal, there's no doubt," said Hodgson, who was
sacked by Blackburn owner Jack Walker after spending more than 25
million pounds on the Ewood Park club and failing to revive their
fortunes. "I can see a lot of positive things Australia have going
for them."
</P>
<P>
He added: "The country has a bright future football-wise. They
have a lot of good players overseas - not just in England, but
also in other parts of Europe, and Japan and other countries."
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old met with Soccer Australia chairman Basil
Scarsella while in Australia to address a sports seminar two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The former Switzerland boss said there was no offer from
Australia, but that officials had contacted him to say he was
still a candidate to replace Venables, who left last July.
</P>
<P>
"I do have some other options but the Australian job would be
one of my top three," said Hodgson. "Money's not the issue. If I
wanted to earn the kind of money I've been making at Inter Milan
or Blackburn, then I wouldn't even be considering a national
coaching job."
</P>
<P>
Hodgson said he would also have no qualms about following
Venables.
</P>
<P>
"Terry's a good friend of mine and I admire him as a coach -
but I'd also put myself in that category," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no doubt some people who think he's a better coach
than I am. But I hope there are one or two who think that I'm
better."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Issues New Visa Sticker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has started
the issuance of a new visa sticker to replace the rubber stamp
visa in conformity with the modern visa administration now in use
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Launching the new visa sticker known as visa vignettes in
capital Abuja at the weekend, Internal Affairs Minister Musa
Yakubu said Nigeria had become the third African country to change
over to the modern visa system, according to a Daily Times report
Monday.
</P>
<P>
With the recent introduction of the machine readable passport
and the visa vignettes, the minister said, "Nigeria can now be
said to have come of age, along with other developed countries as
far as travel documents are concerned."
</P>
<P>
He described the launch of the new entry and re-entry visa
stickers as another technological milestone in Nigeria's march
toward the new millennium, adding that the Nigeria Immigration
Service headquarters and the country's foreign missions would
start to issue the new stickers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the rubber stamp visa which had been in use since
the country's independence in 1960 was easy to forge, Yakubu said
the new visa sticker contained 17 security features, most of which
could not be seen with the naked eyes.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's machine readable passports were launched in August
1998.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, E. Guinea Move to Resolve Dispute over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Government officials from Nigeria and
Equatorial Guinea are to meet from May 5 to 10 in Bata, a city in
Equatorial Guinea, to try again resolve a dispute over an oil-rich
boundary between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Presidential sources said the decision to hold the meeting was
made by the heads of state of the two countries during General
Abdulsalami Abubakar' s visit to Equatorial Guinea last week, This
Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the issue of the dispute was one of the
critical problems discussed between General Abubakar and his
counterpart Sassa Nguesso in Malabo, capital of the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both leaders agreed that the dispute over the
oil-rich boundary, in which the two countries have one oil block
each, be resolved as amicably and as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea have been at logger-heads since
1996 over a boundary dispute involving the two oil blocks lying
side by side each other in the Bight of Bonny.
</P>
<P>
The oil block on the Equatorial Guinea side has been producing
crude oil since 1996 from the Zafiro oil fields which are
estimated to produce 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of crude oil per
day.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigeria is yet to start exploiting the oil fields in
its own block, the southern most part of which borders the Zafiro
oil fields in Equatorial Guinea.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Department of Petroleum Resources who
accompanied General Abubakar to visit Equatorial Guinea last week
said where issues like this arise in other parts of the world, the
two sides will meet and agree to apply unitization as a form of
equitable distribution of resources in the region.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel has urged people in the country to make more savings
to promote national economy.
</P>
<P>
In a television debate Sunday night, Manuel said the
government's policy had been hampered by one of the lowest saving
rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
Manuel quoted figures released at the weekend as saying that
South Africa is one of the countries with the lowest savings as a
ratio of total output at about 15 percent, with countries like
Singapore at about 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Without savings we are not going to have capital available for
 investment," Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated that the government would continue to
implement the tough growth, employment and redistribution strategy
known as Gear, noting growth and jobs could not be created without
a significant increase in the saving rate.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Edge Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices edged up on Singapore
Stock Market Monday as market sentiment was encouraged by the
country's better-than-expected economic data released after the
weekend and was buoyed by the rebound in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index climbed up 12.05 points to
end at 1,898.24, shy of the much expected 1,900 mark.
</P>
<P>
The total volume was 744.84 million shares worth 819.05 million
Singapore dollars (about 480.38 million U.S. dollars). Gainers
outnumbered losers by 248 to 78 with 111 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Lian Beng topped the volume list of the day as it had 41.17
million shares traded. It was followed by Ho Pro that had 24.87
million units done. Frt Links was the next which saw 19.76 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
RothmansI was top mover of the day picking up 40 cents to close

</P>
<P>

as market took lead from Wall Street's fall Friday.
</P>
<P>
They noted the market was lifted in the afternoon by spillover
sentiment from the Hong Kong equities market which rebounded from
its lows, adding Hong Kong's rebound helped spur buying in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Singapore, registered a 1.2 percent economic
growth in the first quarter of 1999, was well placed to stage a
recovery compared with other economies.

<HEADLINE> 80 Pct of Australians at Risk of Heart disease: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A new study has revealed 80
percent of Australians are at risk from stroke, heart or vascular
disease because they smoke too much or fail to do enough exercise.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous people and low-income earners were those among the
population facing the greatest risk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But many of the deaths, disability and illness caused by
cardiovascular disease were preventable, according to a study by
the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Heart
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
They found 80 percent of Australians were either physically
inactive, overweight, have high blood pressure, or smoke
cigarettes, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
The report, released to mark the start of National Heart Week,
also found that cardiovascular disease accounts for 41 percent of
all deaths, with coronary heart disease the major single cause of
death, followed by stroke.
</P>
<P>
Head of the institute's National Center for Monitoring
Cardiovascular Disease Stan Bennett said the death rates among
indigenous Australians and people from low-income groups were
considerably higher than other Australians.
</P>
<P>
"Indigenous Australians aged 25 to 64 die from cardiovascular
disease at seven to nine times the rate of other Australians,"
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
About 2.8 million people, or 16 percent of the Australians, had
cardiovascular conditions in 1995, the report revealed.

<HEADLINE> Negative Growth of Inflation in Indonesia Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A negative inflation of minus 0.68
percent in April, a stronger rupiah against the U.S. dollar, and
lower prices for basic necessities have indicated a restoration of
confidence in Indonesian economic sector, a minister said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita predicted that the average inflation growth
during 1999/2000 fiscal year beginning April 1 will reach 10
percent to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the currency market, the rupiah has stabilized at 8,075
rupiah against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the government has not intervened in the
currency market, and the increased value of the rupiah is affected
by other factors.
</P>
<P>
Those factors are the banking recapitalization program, the
restructurization program for the real sector, lower interest
rates, and lower prices for basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
The situation, he said, has shown restoration of confidence in
the Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that the rupiah will be lower at 7,500 rupiah
(against the U.S. dollar)," he told reporters before the cabinet
session.
</P>
<P>
However, the positive trend will depend on the development of
the June 7 general election results, he said, adding that
political uncertainty could affect economic stability.

<HEADLINE> Syria Agrees to Provide Water to Jordan: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Syria has agreed to provide some
eight million cubic meters of water this summer to Jordan to help
alleviate the projected water shortage of the desert kingdom, the
Jordan Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a Jordanian-Syrian water committee
meeting in Damascus on Sunday, and the water would be provided to
Jordan from Syria`s Dar`a Dam, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided to begin construction of the Wihdeh
Dam on the Yarmouk River, with an investment of 152 million
Jordanian dinars (some 212.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Water Minister Kamel Mahadin, who headed the
Jordanian delegation to the meeting, said his country would
contact donor countries to finance the dam project, particularly
those in Arab organizations.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the dam was expected to be completed in two
and a half years to ensure additional water to Jordan and more
electricity for Syria.
</P>
<P>
The new dam would be used to store some 225 million cubic
meters of water a year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee meeting was held after Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein paid a landmark visit to Damascus in April
to mend bilateral relations which was affected by the 1994 peace
treaty between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria has a territorial dispute with Israel over the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau that was captured by the Jewish state
from Syria in 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Assad had been at odds with late
Jordanian King Hussein Ibn Talal, who signed the peace treaty with
Israel and died of cancer on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Assad declared a three-day mourning in Syria for Hussein's
death and paid a surprise visit to Amman on February 8 to attend
his funeral as a good-will gesture to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan suffers severe water shortage especially in torrid
summer as it does not enjoy sufficient water resources.
</P>
<P>
Part of the drinking water supplies comes from Israel in line
with the peace treaty.

River peace agreement.
</P>
<P>

the policy adopted by late President Gamal Abdul Nasser to achieve
Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy did not achieve its aim and led to
difference among Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi made the remark in a statement to Saudi newspaper OKAZ.

<HEADLINE> Moscoso to Be Panama's First Female President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Mireya Moscoso, widow of
Panama's thrice-ousted president Arnulfo Arias, won the
presidential election Sunday to become the first female president
in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso, 52, defeated Martin Torrijos, 35-year-old son of the
late military strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos who had helped
overthrow Arias' regime, and Alberto Vallarino, a 48-year-old bank
executive who apostatized from Moscoso's party after losing
nomination to her.
</P>
<P>
She will take office on September 1 with a five-year tenure.
She will lead Panama to end the U.S. military presence at the
strategic Panama Canal and resume sovereignty over the whole canal
region on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords signed by Panama and the United States in
1977, the United States must withdraw all its military forces and
cede control over the 40,000 acres surrounding the Panama Canal by
the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
During the election, Moscoso promised to help the poor overcome
difficulties and advocated reform in various fields, which gained
support from approximately half of the voters.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time for Moscoso to compete for presidency.
In 1994, she was narrowly beaten by the current President Ernesto
Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian constitution prevents a president from a second
consecutive five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Ford Motor Co. Faces 4 Billion Dollar Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co., the world's
second largest automaker, was sued by millions of Californians to
a damage of 4 billion U.S. dollars for putting faulty ignition
modules in cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
Reports from San Francisco Sunday said about 3 million
plaintiffs in California accuse Ford of putting the thick film
ignition (TFI), which pass sparks to the spark plugs, in 1.7
million 1983-95 cars and trucks that could cause the vehicles to
stall.
</P>
<P>
"Each distributor-mounted TFI module is a potential time bomb,"
said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety.
</P>
<P>
Ford denies there are safety problems with the modules, but
spokesman Jim Cain said Sunday the company is set to go to trial
later this month in the class action lawsuit, one of the largest
ever against a U.S. automaker.
</P>
<P>
A jury has been seated and opening statements in the trial in
Alameda County Superior Court are scheduled to begin May 11.

<HEADLINE> Potatoes, Peas May Stop Infectious Disease: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Some day in the future kids may be
told to eat up their peas, or they will get measles, thanks to an
ongoing research to genetically alter common fruit and vegetables
to deliver vaccines against scourges such as cholera and measles.
</P>
<P>
Australian scientists said Monday that Australia's leading
research organization, the Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial and
Research Organization (CSIRO), is at the forefront of research
into the creation of the transgenic plants.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ian Dry of CSIRO's plant industry division in Adelaide,
south Australia, said a new National Health and Medical Research
Council grant totaling half a million U.S. dollars will boost
CSIRO's research into the fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Dry and Professor Steve Wesselingh from Melbourne's Alfred
Hospital have succeeded in modifying a tobacco plant to carry
particles of the measles virus.
</P>
<P>
When the plant was fed to mice, they developed antibodies
capable of inactivating the virus.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to do the same work in a plant which children
can eat.
</P>
<P>
"It also has to be something which you can transport easily -
otherwise you are no better off than having vaccines which have to
be stored at the right temperature," Dry said.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization wants to see plant-derived
vaccines because of the breakdown in effectiveness of childhood
needles against infectious diseases such as measles and whooping
cough, and problems with vaccine spoilage.
</P>
<P>
Britain-based researchers are working on incorporating vaccines
against hepatitis B into processed food such as pureed bananas for
babies and dried tomatoes for gourmet grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists recently discovered they could cook potatoes
containing a cholera antigen without destroying their immunization
properties.
</P>
<P>
Australian researchers initially chose the tobacco plant as a
model because it is easy to modify, but are now on the hunt for
the optimum fruit or vegetable to carry a measles vaccine.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make a good choice right from the start," Dry said.
</P>
<P>
He said the right plant will be quick to grow, easily stored,
transported and acceptable to the culture consuming it.
</P>
<P>
Many difficulties lie ahead, including working out the oral
tolerance level: how much vaccine will be effective without
sparking an unwanted reaction, something which can't be done until
the clinical trials stage.
</P>
<P>
"It's very early days yet - this would be eight to 10 years
away," Dry said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Banks Signs with Japanese Bank for Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Two Malaysian banks signed here
Monday with the Export-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM) for loans,
totaling 72 billion yen (about 600 million U.S. dollars) for
financing infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The first untied loan agreement between Malaysia's Construction
and Infrastructure Bank and JEXIM, a loan of 400 million U.S.
dollars is to finance the construction of a portion of the Kuala
Lumpur monorail, the electrified double-track railway project and
other government infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The second loan agreement between JEXIM and Malaysia's Industry
Bank, a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars is to support the funding
needs of the Malaysian bank to finance projects in the shipping
and engineering sectors.
</P>
<P>
The 200-million-U.S.-dollar loan to the Industry Bank is the
final tranche of the total amount of 500 million U.S. dollars
given to the bank under the Miyazawa Plan through JEXIM. The
Industry Bank signed on February 2, 1999 a loan agreement for 300
million U.S. dollars with JEXIM.
</P>
<P>
At the signing Friday, JEXIM was represented by its governor
Hiroshi Yasuda while Malaysia's Industry Bank was represented by
group chairman Abdul Rahman Arshad and Construction and
Infrastructure Bank represented by its chairman Ahmad Zabri
Ibrahim.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Posts Inflation of Minus 0.68 Pct in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- For the second time this year,
Indonesia suffered a 0.68 percent deflation or negative inflation
in April, after suffering a 0.18 percent deflation in March,
Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) chief Sugito Suwito said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Although prices of some commodities increased this past week,
prices of most commodities in the market -- including rice, red
chili, onion, sugar, fresh chicken and fish -- suffered a
decrease," Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of the year, he said, the inflation
rate declined in January and February and deflation set in March
and April.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia recorded a month-on-month inflation of 2.97 percent
and 1.26 percent respectively in January and February this year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate from January to April this year averaged
3.37 percent, compared to 4.7 percent in the same period last
year, Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, he said, of the seven groups of expenses, five
groups faced deflation -- food; cooked food, cigarettes and
tobacco; clothes; education, recreation and sports; and
transportation and communication.
</P>
<P>
"The other two groups -- health and housing -- each suffered an
inflation of 0.15 percent and 0.02 percent respectively," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the consumer's price index, 10 Indonesian cities
suffered inflation and 34 cities suffered deflation.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Calls for EU Harmonized Asylum Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) has urged the European Union members to
develop a fair and harmonized asylum policy.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome a common approach to asylum among European Union
member states, but we would not want to see policy harmonized at
the level of the lowest common denominator," Head of the Geneva-
based UNHCR Sadako Ogata said on the occasion when the Treaty of
Amsterdam entered into force on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the Amsterdam Treaty, the EU is to develop common asylum
legislation binding on its member states.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has been voicing concern over the current trend in Europe
of failing to distinguish between asylum-seekers and other
migrants entering the region, said the U.N. agency in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that governments in Europe often take a
sweeping approach, catching both irregular migrants and those in
need of international protection," said Ogata.
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful to European countries which are coming forward
to share the responsibility to host refugees from Kosovo. We ask
governments to offer protection to Kosovars in a principled and
consistent manner throughout Europe for as long as the need
persists," Ogata said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Shiite Groups Form Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Three major Afghan Shiite groups
have formed a coalition to further consolidate their forces and
strongholds against the Afghan Taliban militia, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The coalition was founded following the talks of the Islamic
Movement Party, the Mohammad Akbari faction and the Abdolkarim
Khalili faction of the Islamic Unity Party based in Iran.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Sunday night by the Islamic Unity Party said
that the coalition, called "Supreme Council of Islamic Coalition
of Afghanistan," would close ranks among parties in the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance to double their efforts with regard
to the current political developments.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the coalition is to bolster peace policy,
explore grounds for realization of national unity, render further
support for the policies of the Northern Alliance and
consolidation of ranks of Shiite Muslims, it said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition came after the Northern Alliance headed by
Afghan ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani recaptured the Bamian
region last month, the main center for the Afghan Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Bamian region, the stronghold of the Islamic Unity Party,
fell to the hands of the Taliban in last September after the
Northern Alliance suffered a series of military setbacks.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Security Chief Stands Trial for Tortures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security police chief
Brigadier General Gholamreza Naqdi on Monday stood trial in
connection with the alleged tortures of Tehran municipal officials
during their detention on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that the
closed-door trial on Naqdi, commander of the intelligence and
security division of the Iranian police, was kicked off Monday
morning at the seventh branch of the military tribunal of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Naqdi was the first Iranian high-ranking police commander who
was put on trial for torturing detainees.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Public Relations Office of the Iranian
Judiciary Fotovat Nasiri Savadkouhi told IRNA that the court has
invited all the complainants, the accused persons and their
lawyers to attend the trial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
He said that the judicial organization of the Iranian armed
forces would inform the public of details of the trial later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
Some 31 Tehran district mayors and municipal officials lodged
complaints against Naqdi. Local media reported that Naqdi was
accused of illegally detaining suspects, ordering the use of
torture and slander.
</P>
<P>
Tens of Tehran municipal officials were detained by the
Iranian conservative judiciary last year, along with former Tehran
Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who was sentenced to two years in
prison and a ban of 10 years from government post.
</P>
<P>
The trial on Naqdi was seen here as a success for the Iranian
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who advocated the rule of law
and civil society in the country.

<HEADLINE> China Beefs up Biodiversity Protection (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has adopted the demarcation of natural reserves or
sanctuaries as a major means to protect its biodiversity. There
are nearly 1,000 natural reserves in the nation, and coverage of
such reserves has already exceeded the world's average.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan province alone, there are 11 natural reserves
protecting ecologies of almost all climates.
</P>
<P>
As the most biodiverse region in China, Yunnan, with only one-
25th of the national territory, is home to 18,000 species of
higher plants and more than 1,700 species of vertebrates, compared
to the national total of 30,000 and 3,100, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The measures taken are obviously effective. More than 60
percent of the state-protected plant and animal species are in
these reserves," said Xu Zaifu, a member of the Expert Committee
for Biodiversity in China.
</P>
<P>
Of these species, Asian elephant in the jungles of
Xishuangbanna in southern Yunnan has propagated to more than 250
from the original 60, while the black gibbon has increased from
300 to over 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Experts like Mr.Long have also gained through field
investigations a complete knowledge about rare animals in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, and 27 percent of the Tibetan land has
been demarcated as natural reserves, which totals 13 in number.
Wild animals in the reserves are increasing at an annual rate of
three to five percent.
</P>
<P>
To supplement the move of setting up natural reserves, China
has also built protection bases to breed rare or endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China plans to invest another ten million yuan in the
next five years in an environment and resources survey project so
as to make biodiversity protection plan more workable.

KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaning against a fir, Mr.Long
Yongcheng focused his telecamera on a group of leaping Yunnan
Golden Monkeys on a distant tree. It was noon, but it was still
freezing at this altitude of more than 4,000 meters above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Long has already camped in the freezing Baimang snow-
capped mountain for more than two months, recording the activities
of this group of monkeys, which belong to an endangered species
under the first-class state protection,
</P>
<P>
"The survival of Yunnan golden monkey shows that biodiversity
in China is duly protected," said Mr. Long, an expert with a
research group for primates.
</P>
<P>
Biodiversity refers to an integrated entity formed by plants,
animals and microbe, and their living environments, including
ecology, species, and heredity.
</P>
<P>
"Biodiversity does not only provide mankind with materials for
subsistence but also has the function of maintaining ecological
balance," Long said.
</P>
<P>
However, biodiversity is meeting with grave challenges in China,
known as a superpower of species and one of the eight places of
origin for crops. Nearly 400 species of vertebrates and more than
4,000 species of plants in the country are being endangered.
China joined in the United Nations Convention for the Protection
of Biodiversity in 1992, and in the same year it launched a
massive program of action in biodiversity protection.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a lot of plant and animal species have increased
noticeably since the demarcation of the Baimang Snow-Capped
Mountain as a natural reserve," Long said, citing the Yunnan
Golden Monkey as an example. The number of the animal has already
exceeded 1,000 at present as against only 300 in the past.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa GNP Much Lower than Sub-Saharan Average: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda,
three east African countries, rank much lower in gross national
product (GNP) per capita than an average of 510 U.S. dollars in
the sub-Saharan Africa, a World Bank report has said.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by Tanzanian local media Monday, said the
life expectancy of the three states has dropped down to 42-52
years in comparison with a sub-Saharan Africa average of 51 years
due to widespread HIV/AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has the highest gross domestic product (GDP) of over 10.2
billion U.S. dollars, Tanzania follows with 6.92 billion dollars,
while Uganda comes closely with 6.582 billion dollars, said the
report on last year's world development indicators issued here
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has the lowest GNP per capita at 210 U.S. dollars,
while Uganda has attained 330 dollars and Kenya has a slightly
higher figure at 340 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in Uganda, the sub-region's worst case of
HIV/AIDS infection, has dropped down to 42 years, followed by
Tanzania at 48 and Kenya at 52 years.
</P>
<P>
Access to personal computers is highest in Kenya, with a 2.3
(people) access rate per 1,000 people, compared with Tanzania's
1.6 and Uganda's 1.4,

the report noted.
</P>
<P>
As far as sub-Saharan Africa is concerned, it ranks second
lowest among the world's regions with an average of 510 U.S.
dollars in GNP per capita and lowest with 51 years average life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The report said only Botswana and South Africa have per capita
GNP of above 1,000 dollars, with 3,310 for Botswana and 3,210 for
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa has a life expectancy of 65 years while
Botswana is still at the low level of 47 years.
</P>
<P>
HIV infection rates in the region are among the world's highest
as Zimbabwe is estimated to have reached 29 percent, Botswana 25
percent, Zambia 19 percent among people of 15 to 49 years of age.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Monday that
President Mohammad Khatami would start an eight-day official tour
to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar on May 13 to discuss expansion of
bilateral ties and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian presidential office said in a statement that
Khatami's visit is aimed at expansion of regional cooperation and
strengthening relations between Iran and the three Middle East
countries.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first visit of President Khatami to the Middle
East region since he was sworn in to office in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency, said
that the latest regional and international developments and issues
concerning the world of Islam and expansion of bilateral relations
would be top on the agenda of talks to be held between President
Khatami and heads of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministers Kamal Kharrazi, Oil Minister Bijan
Namdar Zanganeh as well as the Iranian co-chairmen of joint
commissions will accompany Iranian president in the visit, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the Gulf Arab states have had cool relations since the
Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979. But the two sides improved
their ties after President Khatami came to power with a detente
policy with the rest of the world, particularly Iran's neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Shilling Slide Not Surprising: Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Finance Minister Gerald
Sendaula has said that the current slide of the shilling against
the U.S. dollar is no cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
The shilling's depreciation is similar to that of the dollar
which has experienced depreciation since the euro was introduced.
The shilling is no exception to depreciation if the major
currencies have experienced depreciation pressure, he said at
Masindi district in central Uganda over the weekend, the New
Vision daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers here have said the shilling's fall is
due to reduced hard currency inflow from exports of coffee, fish,
delayed aid money, decline in revenue from tourism and shrinking
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year the shilling traded at about 1,000 to the dollar but
now it is traded at over 1,500 and is still depreciating.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the exchange rate between shilling and the
U.S. dollar would reach 1,700:1 in the near future if the central
bank does not inject more dollars to rescue the falling currency.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Set Up Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda will establish an investment
program agency to administer the country's proposed free trade
zone and bonded manufacturing warehouse, according to the latest
gazette of the Republic of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The agency will be responsible for documenting and
disseminating information about investment opportunities in the
country, the East African weekly newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Privileges to be offered by the free trade zone and bonded
warehouse scheme include investment allowance and a first arrival
privilege under which an industrial enterprise involving a capital
investment of 100,000 U. S. dollars will be entitled to three work
permits, the gazette said.
</P>
<P>
The gazette noted that the move to set up the free trade zone
is aimed at promoting investment in Rwanda for both local and
foreign investors as part of the government's broader economic
recovery program for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other targets set by the government for 1999 include reducing
inflation to below five percent, real gross domestic product
(GDP) growth of 7.6 percent, raising tax revenue from 10 percent
to 11.7 percent and maintaining foreign exchange reserves
equivalent to five and a half months' worth of imports.
</P>
<P>
Also on the government priority list is to restructure the
internal and external debt in order to create a better
environment for investment.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda recently got 75 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank
under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility for the first
time since 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
ordered to recognize civilian victims in U.S. and British
bombardment as martyrs, an Iraqi weekly newspaper reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nabd al-Shabab weekly reported that according to the
presidential order, those civilian martyrs will be given the
same rights and privileges as soldier martyrs.
</P>
<P>
The report did not give the exact number of civilian
casualties, but said it included all those who died in U.S.
and British air raids.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night air raids on
Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly attacking
Iraqi civilian facilities and military sites, leading to heavy
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, U.S. and British warplanes bombed a shepherd's
tent in the northern no-fly zone, killing him and five of
his family members as well as his 250 sheep.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly declared that it does not recognize
these restricted zones and vowed to continue confronting any
allied plane violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Horti-Expo Reflects China's Economic Strength (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current Expo in Kunming has applied the world's most
advanced technologies in plant cultivation and horticulture. The
computer-controlled Large Greenhouse in the expo garden, which is
said to be the largest in all horticultural shows ever held, has
gathered plants from three totally different climatic zones,
namely tropical, temperate and Alpine, under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that a horticultural show hosted by a developing
nation is by no means less attractive than one hosted by a
developed nation," said a French engineer working in the French
Outdoor Exhibition Garden, who had attended several expositions
held in the western nations.
</P>
<P>
A horticultural expert from the Netherlands also praised that
all architecture and gardening works in the Kunming Expo garden
are "first-class".
</P>
<P>
"The Kunming Expo has cost its host an enormous manpower and
capital," acknowledged the AIPH President Koch.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has spent more than 13 billion yuan (
about 1.5 billion US dollars) on preparing for the horti-expo, and
the construction of the Expo garden alone has cost over two
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with China's investment in environmental
protection, the spending on the exposition is just fractional.
Last year China's expenditures on environmental protection reached
some 80 billion yuan, or one percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
"The horti-expo reflects an entirely new look of China," said
Ole Philipson, president of the Bureau of International
Expositions. "The success of the Expo '99 in China is not an
accidental phenomenon, but the result of the country's rapid
economic growth over the past two decades of reform and opening-up.

KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- To many tourists visiting the garden
show of the '99 International Horticultural Exposition in the
northeastern suburbs of Kunming, capital of southwest China's
Yunnan Province, the most impressive thing is the impressive  "
Garden Avenue".
</P>
<P>
The "Garden Avenue", 800 meters in length and 60 meters in
width, is paved with 450,000 pots of fresh flowers including
irises, meconopses and primroses. To maintain the beauty of the "
avenue", the flowers have to be changed several times during the
six-month run of the garden show, which will cost an estimated 10
million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Kunming Expo '99, Otto
Koch, President of the International Association of Horticultural
Producers (AIPH) hailed the exposition as "the most prestigious
and most impressive scheme within floriculture".
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Expo has set many records in the history of the
world horticultural festival. There are two million plants of some
2,300 species, including 33 species under China's first-class
state protection, planted in the expo garden, more than any of the
previous garden shows. Meanwhile, all provinces and regions in
China and many of the countries and international organizations
participating in the Expo have built 82 outdoor exhibition gardens
with their unique features, also a new record.
</P>
<P>
As the first developing nation to host a world exposition,
China faced many difficulties when it just won the right to host
the horticultural show in 1996. It was one of the youngest members
of the AIPH, which it formally joined in 1993, and it only had
less than three years to complete various preparations for the
expo, which usually take five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
But China has managed to give the world a great surprise: the
Kunming Expo has become one of the most successful horticultural
shows with 95 participating countries and international
organizations. Some 10 million tourists, including one million
from overseas, are expected to visit the Expo.
</P>
<P>
"Hosting a world garden show was something unthinkable for
China 20 years ago," said Cheng Zhiying, a research fellow with
the Kunming Botanical Study Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences. "We couldn't even solve some technical problems
concerning plant transplantation and flower cultivation".

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The 12th East African Tripartite
Commission will meet on May 7 in Arusha, northern Tanzania, to
discuss key issues including the East African Community (EAC)
Treaty and preparations for its signing, which is slated for July
30.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda, ministers from three countries of Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda will consider a proposal by Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa for a collective strategy to deal with
the recent ban on Lake Victoria fish by the European Union, the
East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also discuss Rwanda's application to join
the Community, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the East African Co-operation Secretariat is asking
for some 2.4 million U.S. dollars as its budget for the year
1999/2000, with each member state expected to contribute 6.8
percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretariat, the amount has increased due to
the new initiative on defense cooperation and expenses related to
the signing ceremony of the EAC Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The request will be presented to the coming Tripartite
Commission meeting to be attended by ministers from key ministries
from the three countries.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Multi-party Debate likely to Abort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The dispute over the list of
representatives to the multi-party debate of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) has cast a shadow over the debate
scheduled for May 8 in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, the East
African newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of Non-governmental and Development
Organizations of DRC claimed late April that the people invited to
the debate over constitutional arrangements and democratic
elections were not representative.
</P>
<P>
They said the list omitted key members of civil society who
took part in government consultations on a draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Civil society denounces this list, which does not include
representatives who were recognized as legitimate groups with
opinions and were consulted by the institutions of the republic
on the constitution," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the council's stand could deal a severe blow
to the Nairobi initiative and undermine DRC Foreign Minister
Abdoulaye Ndombasi's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ndombasi announced on April 27 that the national debate for
Congolese politicians would take place in Nairobi from May 8 to
15, while the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy reacted with a
refusal to attend the debate.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed on the spot
at Kazinga, near Mukoko trading center, 24 km on the
Masaka-Kampala road when their Nissan pick-up collided with a
Swift Coach over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Eric Naigambi, deputy spokesman of the Ugandan police, told
Xinhua in a telephone interview that the accident happened at
about 8:00 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Among the death are five female middle school students on the
way home," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the cause of the accident to speeding by the
Coach as it tried to overtake. The driver of the Coach fled from
the scene after the accident.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were taken to Masaka Hospital mortuary and some of
them have already been taken by their relatives, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala-Masaka highway has been dogged by major accidents
in which dozens of people died and many others have been maimed
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, 27 people died on the spot and several others
were injured when a Gaso bus ran over a taxi at Mitala-Maria along
the highway. This was followed by another in March 1996 near
Masaka town in which 12 people died.
</P>
<P>
Speeding and drunk driving are the two main causes to traffic
accidents in Uganda. Taxi buses run at full speed on highly
competitive and lucrative routes in order to take more passengers.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Criticizes Headscarfed Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
late Sunday criticized a pro-Islamic deputy for wearing headscarf
when attending the new parliament taking-oath ceremony, saying
such a move provoked Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remark on state-run TRT TV over the scarf
issue.
</P>
<P>
In the predominantly Muslim but secular state of Turkey, those
who wear headscarves are forbidden from entering into the state
institutions and universities.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, deputy of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP) Merve
Kavakci entered the meeting hall of the parliament headscarfed
Sunday to attend the taking-oath ceremony of the 21th parliament,
which was elected in the April 18 parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
She was welcomed with applause by the pro-Islamic FP deputies
and protests from the central-left Democratic Left Party (DSP).
</P>
<P>
All the DSP deputies, especially women in the front, shouted to
Kavakci to "get out" of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president said that "if because of your headscarf you are
claiming to be a Muslim, this means you are making
discrimination. This is provoking people."
</P>
<P>
DSP leader and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that
"everyone in Turkey has the right to wear whatever she would like
in their private lives. But, the General Assembly of Parliament is
not within the bounds of anyone's private life."
</P>
<P>
"Those in state life should obey the rules and regulations of
the state. Parliament is not the place to challenge the state,"
Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
A group of Turkish civilians staged a demonstration in the
National Sovereignty Park in front of parliament in protest
against Kavakci's move.
</P>
<P>
All the deputies of the right-wing Nationalist Movement Party,
central-right Motherland Party and the central-right True Path
Party remain silent over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Among growing tension between the DSP and FP, the oath-taking
ceremony was postponed till 20:00 local time (17:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Kavakci later left the parliament without taking oath.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed and one
other seriously wounded Monday morning by a roadside bomb in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded near Naqoura, headquarters of the United
Nations peacekeeping forces inside the Israeli occupied border
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying one of its groups detonated
a huge bomb at 6:45 local time when an Israeli patrol passed by.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they saw huge smoke columns rising from the
area following the blast, which raised to nine the number of
Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces rushed to seal off the site, closing all access
points into the occupied zone, and even barred U.N. forces to
enter or leave the area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an Israeli armored vehicle has been sent to the
site while two Israeli warplanes flew low over the area.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust the Israeli occupation troops from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Help Angola Fight Rebels: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Namibia would not hesitate to
assist Angola in its fight against rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) if asked to do so by
Luanda, Namibian President Sam Nujoma has said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that his government had not deployed armed forces
in Angola, South Africa's The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question from the main opposition party after
delivering his state of the nation address in the National
Assembly Friday, Nujoma said: "We are not involved in the fighting
in Angola at the moment, but we will not hesitate to assist the
Angolan government if asked to do so."
</P>
<P>
He said Namibia's possible involvement in Angola would be under
the auspices of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
 Media reports have in recent weeks claimed that Namibia and
Zimbabwe have already sent troops to Angola for an attack on UNITA
forces in the north of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The joint offensive against UNITA was said to have followed the
signing in Luanda on April 8 of a general defense pact between
Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). Details of the pact are still being kept secret.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said Namibia was worried about UNITA's continued
aggression in Angola, where Namibian troops have been involved in
U.N. peacekeeping operations. He also defended the deployment of
Namibian troops in the DRC, arguing that the fighting in that
country had to be contained before it spread regionally.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Sunday that his administration will continue the campaign
against poverty to bail the country out of the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Estrada said he owes it to the poor, who
brought him to the pinnacle of his political career nearly a year
ago, to help them break free from their bondage to poverty.
</P>
<P>
"The poor people are the ones who placed me here in this
position. And they are expecting so much from me. And I hope that
I could live up to their expectation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will start this month his administration's
efforts to pump-prime the economy in a bid to generate jobs and
reinvigorate the countryside, where most poor Filipinos reside.
</P>
<P>
In the next months, Estrada said, he plans to visit provinces
in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao to personally inspect the status of
the ongoing development projects there.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his administration continues to address the
poverty problem by working to give Filipinos "equitable
opportunities" and by eliminating graft and corruption in
government.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Invest Substantially in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will spend 1.2 billion dirhams (328 million U.S. dollars) on an
education development strategy until the year 2020, a newspaper
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Training facilities and programs for the teaching staff will
take some 30 percent of the estimated budget," Minister of
Education and Youth Ali Abdul Aziz Al Sharhan said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the education process needs well-trained
teachers, who can deal with the latest technological methodology
to transfer their skills to the students.
</P>
<P>
He said the education development strategy envisaged several
changes in the UAE's education system to meet the requirements of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
"The most important objective of the strategy is to change
the concept of education from a service to the community into
a long-term investment in human resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although a large number of schools have been built in cities
and rural areas, the low efficiency of teachers and the lack of
school laboratories and libraries are hindering the education
process from achieving national targets, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also urged teachers, students and parents to change the
concept of just studying to succeed in exams.
</P>
<P>
"A modern education system must be created to prepare
graduates for challenges of the millennium," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Bankers Call for Curbing Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of Zambia
(BAZ) has called on the government to urgently enact the much
awaited money laundering legislation to curb the undesired outflow
of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Besides curbing the criminal activities to a great extent, the
 legislation will go a long way in checking the undesired outflow
of hard- earned foreign exchange from Zambia's economy," said
Moses Nawa, chairman of the association.
</P>
<P>
He said the expected enactment will arm the banking community
in the country with the required protection against money
laundering and frauds, the Zambia Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will enable the banking community to join hands with the
Drug Enforcement Commission and other related agencies, without
any subsequent complications or harassment arising from their
reporting of the suspicious transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The past year, said the chairman, was a particularly difficult
year for the country's economy and banks had their share of the
problems.
</P>
<P>
The banking industry in 1998 experienced an increase in
non-performing assets (NPA) (bad debts) as a direct result of the
poor performance of the country's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange was in short supply while interest rates
shot up, treasury bill rates rose from 22 percent to 35 percent,
and bank base rates moved from 35 percent to 41 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in the rates increased the vulnerability of advances
to become NPA and also increased the cost of bank deposits.
However, banks continued to make good profits because of the
increased base rates and good margins in the foreign exchange
market."

<HEADLINE> UAE Becomes Third Leading Reexport Center: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
ranks the third most important reexport center in the world
after Hong Kong and Singapore, a study said.
</P>
<P>
The annual turnover of the UAE's reexport sector reached 24
billion dirhams (6.56 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, registering a
4.3 percent growth over the previous year, showed the study issued
Monday by the Emirates Industrial Bank.
</P>
<P>
The average growth rate of reexport turnover between 1994 and
1998 was around 15.7 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Reexport volume accounts for one third of the total trade in
the UAE, with Dubai amounting to 73 percent of entire reexport
trade, followed by Ras Al Khaimah of 10 percent), Abu Dhabi of 9
percent, Sharjah of 7 percent) and Fujairah of 2 percent, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and India are the two most important destinations for UAE
reexports, said the study, adding that, in general, reexports from
the UAE are sent to over 35 countries across the world, including
the U.S. and five European countries.
</P>
<P>
The study said the long term outlook for the UAE's reexport
sector remains positive thanks to the international trend toward
globalization and the increasing role of foreign trade in most
economies.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Focus On Job-Creating Rural Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has assured workers that his administration will give priority to
labor-intensive rural infrastructure and low-cost housing projects
to generate more jobs, a government news release said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying that the government's primary
focus on agricultural modernization and other pro-poor programs
will lead to a "chain reaction" that will benefit the jobless and
the underemployed.
</P>
<P>
"If we pour our resources for the construction of
farm-to-market roads, irrigation facilities and low-cost housing,
this will lead to a chain reaction of generating jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This May, we will pour government resources on these
endeavors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Estrada ordered the implementation of a strategy
that calls for extensive use of workers in infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
The news release quoted Horacio Morales, secretary of agrarian
reform, as saying that Estrada's focus on farm modernization will
have a spillover beneficial effect in the manufacturing sector, of
which almost 40 percent is engaged in food processing.
</P>
<P>
"With agricultural modernization, food will be available at
lower prices and will likewise create more jobs in the food
processing industry," Morales said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Doctors on Strike For Higher Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,000 doctors of the
hospitals around Israel launched a strike Monday to protest
against the lack of progress in the negotiations with the Finance
Ministry over salary increases.
</P>
<P>
Israel Medical Association (IMA) announced that the strike
involved doctors from general, psychiatric, geriatric and
rehabilitation hospitals, and doctors employed by the Health
Ministry and some other government ministries.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the association after a fruitless
meeting between IMA leaders and the officials from the Finance
Ministry on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry Wages Director Yuval Rachlevsky said that
salaries for doctors have risen by dozens of percentage points in
recent years as a result of the 1994 wage agreement.
</P>
<P>
But IMA leaders said that the wage's real value has eroded
because of the inflation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that the doctors want to preserve the real
value of their wages, and to have the salaries they earned since
1994 accordingly adjusted.
</P>
<P>
Monday's strike is to last 24 hours as a warning to the Finance
Ministry. If there will be no progress in further negotiations,
the doctors are expected to impose more sanctions through the rest
of the week.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAINAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An endangered breed of mountain deer
has escaped extinction in China's southernmost island province of
Hainan, thanks to the natural reserve there.
</P>
<P>
The animal is unique to the tropical province and is under the
state first class protection. It faced the danger of extinction in
1976, when there were only 28 left, because farmers hunted them
and an increasing population was using up the deer's natural
habitat for farmland.
</P>
<P>
The 133-ha. nature reserve was then enclosed to protect the
rare breed. People in Hainan have developed an increasing sense of
rare animal protection. They donated 200,000 yuan for the care and
protection of the deer during a serious drought in 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of the deer has grown to more than 500 in
the wild while there are some 200 in captivity.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will have a good harvest
in the new year, sacred oxen indicated Monday during the annual
Royal Plowing Festival held in front of the National Museum.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath presided over
the Royal Plowing Ceremony. Senate President Chea Sim and the
National Assembly Prince Norodom Ranariddh attended the ceremony
together with other government officials and some ambassadors to
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Sirivudh, King Norodom Sihanouk's half-brother
and former foreign minister who returned from exile less than four
months ago, led the Royal Plowing Ceremony with his sister
Princess Norodom Vacheara.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sirivudh lived in exile for three years after being
convicted in absentia for his alleged part in a plot to
assassinate Prime Minister Hun Sen and was granted a royal pardon
last November. Since his return, Prince Sirivudh has been serving
as an adviser to the king.
</P>
<P>
The two selected oxen ate 95 percent of the maize, 80 percent
of the soybeans and 30 percent of the water from the seven
offerings presented to them at the event including wine, water,
sesame, soybeans, rice, grass and maize.
</P>
<P>
The choice of the cattle predicted good wheather for the crops.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the festival was led by Prince Norodom Yuvaneath.
The chosen cattle did eat all of the corn and soybeans signifying
good yields for those crops. And the oxen did not touch the wine
which meant a good news as alcohol signifies war.
</P>
<P>
The tradition of the plowing ceremony makes predications for
the coming farming season based on the actions of royal oxen and
the predictions made by royal astrologers make predications for
the coming year based on the animals' choices.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Marine Life in Real Danger: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti marine environment
expert has said that the Gulf has become one of the most polluted
areas in the world, the Gulf News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Marine life in the region is in real danger," Dr. Abdul Rahman
Abdullah Al Awadhi, secretary general of the Kuwait-based Regional
Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment.
</P>
<P>
Al Awadhi, addressing a conference on environmental law and
marine life protection, stressed the importance of protecting the
Gulf waters by introducing safety measures to prevent oil leakage
and the dumping of toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
"The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries will have
to spend 100-200 million U.S. dollars to protect the Gulf
waters," he added.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which began Sunday in Al Ain, the
UAE, was organized by the UAE University in coordination with the
Federal Environmental Agency and the U.N. Development Program, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the conference underlined the significance of
making laws that meet the requirement of each country.
</P>
<P>
"Legislation should be devised in such a way that it struck a
balance between protecting the environment and economic and human
activities," noted Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, minister
of Higher Education and Scientific Research and chancellor of the
UAE University.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed that if efforts to green the
country were to succeed, strong political support and social
awareness would be required.

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Beats Utah 84-78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The San Antonio Spurs are halfway
home to being at home for the entire NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Tim Duncan won his ballyhooed MVP duel with Karl Malone as he
led an early fourth quarter surge that rallied the Spurs to a
crucial 84-78 victory over the Utah Jazz, their 13th straight home
triumph.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is believed in what we are doing and everyone wants
to be on the floor," Duncan said. "It's been a long road with a
bunch of new players. We had to believe in what we were doing. Now
we are working off each other and feeding off each other."
</P>
<P>
The Spurs (35-13) entered Saturday's home game against Portland
knowing they could secure the NBA's best record and home-court
advantage throughout the playoffs by winning their final four
games. They began the tough trek by surviving an overtime game
against the Trail Blazers and today pulled even in the loss column
with the Jazz (36-13).
</P>
<P>
"They should have confidence," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "
They're big, long and quick and that's a bad combination to have
to play against. If they ever had a lack of confidence playing
against us, they certainly didn't show it in Utah or tonight."
</P>
<P>
Duncan had 26 points and 14 rebounds. He scored eight points in
a 15-4 burst at the outset of the final period that turned a four-
point deficit into a 74-67 lead midway through the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Malone totaled 24 points and 14 rebounds. He also scored eight
points in the final period, but four came in the final minute.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Seattle SuperSonics moved
closer to missing the playoffs for the first time since 1990 after
a desperate fourth-quarter comeback attempt fell short today.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal scored 33 points and Kobe Bryant added 19 of
his 28 points in the third quarter as the Los Angeles Lakers held
on for a 91-84 victory over the Sonics at the NBA basketball
competition.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to go to the playoffs playing good basketball
with a little momentum," Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
Seattle (23-25) dropped 1 1/2 games behind eighth-place
Sacramento (24-23) in the battle for the final playoff spot in the
Western Conference with only two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
Gary Payton scored 29 points and Detlef Schrempf added 21 for
the Sonics, who were outscored 30-13, in the third quarter after
opening a 44-40 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Bryant single-handedly outscored the Sonics in the third
quarter, registering 17 straight Los Angeles points.
</P>
<P>
"In the third quarter, I wanted to come out with a little more
aggression," Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
His dunk gave the Lakers a 70-55 lead with 33 seconds left in
the period before the Sonics mounted their comeback.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal gave Seattle a chance down the stretch by missing 5-of-
10 throws in the final two minutes and wasn't surprised the Sonics
repeatedly sent him to the line.
</P>
<P>
"I sit around the house and wait for a stiuation like that," he
said. "I always make one. I'm gonna start making two. I ain't
missing no more."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers did not need
any late-game heroics in the latest chapter of their rivalry with
the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
Rik Smits and Dale Davis each scored five points during two key
second-quarter runs and as the Pacers built a 14-point halftime
advantage and crushed the Knicks, 94-71, in a game affecting both
ends of the Eastern Conference playoffs race.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers outscored the Knicks 27-15 in the second quarter
after a tight opening 12 minutes and put together a 15-0 run
bridging the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
They held a 23-point lead late in the third period and allowed
the Knicks no closer than 15 points during the final 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Chris Mullin scored 20 points and Davis added 15 for the Pacers,
who clinched at least a share of the Central Division title. They
will win the division outright if Atlanta loses tonight in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
"We played hard, we were aggressive, we were focused," Pacers
coach Larry Bird said. "The last couple of games, we've stepped it
up on the defensive end and it shows. That was good because we
played a quality team fighting for a playoff position."
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing, playing for the second straight game despite his
bad right Achilles, netted 15 points for New York, which still
holds the eighth and final playoff spot in the conference by just
one-half game over Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> Hot Spell Continues in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is still in the grip of a
prolonged hot spell and unprecedented drought, with water falling
to alarming levels, The Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The mercury shot to 41.8 degrees Celsius in northwest Rajshahi
district on April 25, the highest since the beginning of the
summer season this year, and temperatures in other parts of the
country were also as high as 37 to 40 degrees Celsius, it said.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the country, particularly the northern region,
have not experienced any rain for months.
</P>
<P>
People across the country were suffering from erratic power
supply and acute shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
In Kushtia district, 140 kilometers west of here, hundreds of
people suffered from diseases such as fever, asthma and diarrhea
which were made worse by the severe hot spell, The Daily Star
said.
</P>
<P>
Many people had to stay indoors throughout the day, as 90
percent of the shops in the district closed partially and most
rickshaw-pullers stopped plying their vehicles. The hot spell also
affected standing crops because of poor irrigation and lowering
water levels.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Rajshahi said that if there were no rain for a few
more days, most of the crops in the district would be lost, as
rivers and canals were being dried up and underground water had
fallen by 15-20 feet turning most deep tubewells ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the current heat-wave is likely to increase to
some extent in the next two or three days due to the weakening of
the southerly wind, weather experts said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's By-election to Be One-Party Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The by-election in Meherpur-I
constituency in western Bangladesh will be held on Tuesday and all
signs indicate that the election will certainly become a one-party
show.
</P>
<P>
The Jatiya Party led by Communications Minister Anwar Hossain
Manju (JP-Manju) decided Monday not to take part in the polls,
following earlier decisions of the country's major opposition
parties -- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party led
by former President H. E. Ershad (JP-Ershad) and the
Jamaat-e-Islami -- to boycott the by-election.
</P>
<P>
The JP splinter led by Manju took the decision to "protest
against the Election Commission's refusal to defer the polls,
especially when the court is yet to give a final verdict on the
issue of its election symbol -- plow," press reports here said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Sunday stayed a High Court order that had
directed authorities concerned to allocate the symbol "plow" as
the election symbol of a JP (Manju) candidate vying for the
parliament seat in the by-election.
</P>
<P>
The full bench of the Supreme Court's Appellate Division fixed
May 4 as the next date of hearing on the issue, coinciding with
the date of the by-polls.
</P>
<P>
The High Court, following a writ petition by the JP (Manju)
candidate, delivered a verdict on April 28 directing the Election
Commission, the Returning Officer and Assistant Returning Officer
concerned to allocate the "plow" symbol to him.
</P>
<P>
Immediately afterward, Ershad filed a petition before the
Chamber Judge for a provisional stay of the verdict and the judge
stayed the verdict till the matter was heard in the Appellate
Division on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The JP (Manju) on Sunday requested the Election Commission to
defer the by-election, but the appeal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
The Meherpur-I seat of parliament fell vacant following the
death of a BNP legislator on February 13 this year and under the
constitution, the by-election for the seat has to be held by May
14.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Begins First-Phase Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Amid an unusual tranquillity, the
Kathmanduites began to cast their votes at 08:00 (0215GMT) Monday
morning as 35 of the kingdom's 75 districts go to the polls under
the first-phase parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
In some polling centers at the No. 4 constituency of Kathmandu,
voters lined up well before eight o'clock, showing high enthusiasm
toward the elections, the third since the multi-party
parliamentary system was restored in 1990 in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though unhappy with the status quo, Buddha Lal Mashal said,
"I'm not disappointed. It's a matter of happiness to vote."
</P>
<P>
He called for "some improvement" in the country, complaining
that there are so many problems like the law and order situation
and price hikes. "No political party has done good for the
people," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Voters hope that a single party would be able to get a majority
in the elections and the elected would resolve such problems as
drinking water, electricity, unemployment and pollution.
</P>
<P>
Kathmandu is beset by acute water shortage as well as regular
loadshedding. The deteriorating environment is a constant concern
to the residents.
</P>
<P>
But the city is unusually tranquil and clean Monday as few
vehicles ply on the streets thanks to the requirement of special
passes. The colorful posters and streamers here and there add to
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The government declared Monday a public holiday for the 35
districts conducting the polls first.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase elections to the 205-seat House of
Representatives should have been held at 93 constituencies of 36
districts, but the Election Commission declared on March 30 that
Palten Gurung from the Nepali Congress was elected unopposed as he
was the sole candidate to file nomination from the mountainous
Manang district of western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
And elections in the No. 1 and 3 constituencies of Kathmandu
have been rescheduled for June 8 following the death of Man Mohan
Adhikari on April 26. As chairman and prime ministerial candidate
of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist,
CPN-UML), he was scheduled to contest in the two constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said about 5.9 million voters will
exercise their franchise in the first-phase polls and a total of
977 candidates including 74 women are in the electoral fray in
this phase which will end at 17:00 (1115GMT).
</P>
<P>
Police said that altogether 25,412 police personnel are on duty
for the first-phase polls with five to 15 police personnel manning
each polling center. Besides, there are two mobile police teams in
each constituency and the army is mobilized to consolidate the
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security arrangements have been made for the
candidates, poll observers, voters and journalists, police said.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-left guerrillas are a headache for the government and
the Election Commission. Having engaged in a violent people's war
since February 1996, they are reportedly campaigning actively for
a boycott of the elections. On March 5, they killed Yadu Gautam,
the CPN-UML candidate for Rukum district, mid-western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Twelve districts affected by the guerrillas are among those to
conduct the polls first.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three foreign observers from 14 countries are joining
their Nepali counterparts in monitoring the polls.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase polls are scheduled for May 17 in the
remaining 39 districts. However, polling in the No. 1 constituency
of Palpa district in the bracket has been postponed until May 19
after Nepali Congress candidate Tanka Nath Kafle died of heart
attack on April 8.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting will begin only after the second-phase polls are
conducted, the Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of election to the House of Representatives,
the country has been divided into 205 single-member
constituencies. A total of 6,821 polling centers have been set up
across the country with 2,995 for the first phase and 3,826 for
the second phase.
</P>
<P>
An identify card system has been introduced this time in 13
constituencies of five districts including the Kathmandu Valley
and the Election Commission plans to adopt it for other parts of
the country as well within five years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Promote Diving as Sport-Tourism Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) plans to promote diving as a new potential sport-tourism
market, according to Patpong Bhijatapong, director of TAT's
market-promotion department.
</P>
<P>
Diving will be the next niche market promoted by TAT. It is a
new tourism product in Thailand with strong potential for growth,
The Nation Monday quoted Patpong as saying.
</P>
<P>
With around 40,000 international diving tourists visiting
Thailand last year, the sport is popular at several beach
destinations, for example Phuket and Pattaya, and particularly the
world-famous Similian islands, he said.
</P>
<P>
The choice of Thailand as host of next year's Asia Diving
Exhibition in May, the first such event to be held here, is
another evidence of the popularity of the sport in the country.
</P>
<P>
The TAT's promotion of diving will be in addition to its
golfing promotional campaign which started last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign golf visitors is expected to grow from
350,000 in 1998 to 400,000 this year. Last year's golf tourists
accounted for about 5 percent of Thailand's overall tourist
arrivals of 7.7 million, according to figures released by the TAT.
</P>
<P>
Next month the TAT will host the second Thailand Golf Travel
Mart in Bangkok and Kanchanaburi province. 157 travel agents,
mainly from Europe and East Asia, have confirmed they will attend,
Patpong said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the average golf tourist's daily expenditure was
around 6,000 baht (162 U.S. dollars). The average length of stay
was over one week for visitors from Asia and two weeks for Western
tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
The humanitarian disaster caused by NATO in Yugoslavia is
expanding and developing. Bloody facts show that the call for "the
supremacy of human rights over sovereignty" leaves no room for
both sovereignty and human rights -- only hegemony, it added.
</P>
<P>
The fact that NATO is carrying out air strikes against
Yugoslavia in the name of the protection of human rights is an
extremely dangerous signal. If this aggression is allowed to take
its course, the world will end up in chaos, and human rights will
suffer an unprecedented setback, the announcement warned.
</P>
<P>
It called on all people who love peace and wish to safeguard
human rights to take action to stop this threat to peace and human
rights in the embryonic stage and to denounce the blood-stained
hegemonic lie.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it noted, it is worth mentioning that NATO's
military action has encountered resolute resistance from the
Yugoslavian people, and aroused criticism from all over the world.
As a result, NATO's scheme has suffered severe setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Even some Western media organs have pointed out that NATO's
attacks stemmed from an improper excuse, targeted an improper
place and started an unjust war.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the 21st century, people everywhere are
hoping for a world at peace, and are resolutely against entering
the next century in the throes of a war, it said.
</P>
<P>
The war started with the pursuit of hegemony, and is destined
to end in defeat for the hegemonists, the announcement concluded.

<HEADLINE> China to Lift Ban on Overseas Lawyers After Entering WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China may lift the current
geographic ban on overseas lawyers one year after entering the
World Trade Organization (WTO), today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The overseas law firms will also be allowed to open more than
one office in China -- after the nation gains accession to the WTO,
said Wu Mingde, deputy director of the Department of Lawyers and
Notation under the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
However, the setting up of joint venture law firms -- co-funded
by Chinese and overseas investors -- will still have to wait, said
Wu.
</P>
<P>
So far, branches of overseas law firms have been set up in only
eight cities including Beijing and Shanghai among all the 15
Chinese cities which have government permission to hold overseas
law firms.
</P>
<P>
Last month, another 12 overseas law firms were given the green
light to open offices in China, increasing the total to 105, of
which 26 came from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Another 100 overseas law firms are in the process of applying
to enter China's legal service market, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The resident overseas lawyers are today mainly involved in
representing domestic clients in legal disputes abroad. They are
serving as legal counsel to both domestic and foreign clients on
matters of trade, technology transfer, real estate, intellectual
property rights, bonds and securities.
</P>
<P>
"The expanding role of overseas lawyers here will pose strong
competition for their Chinese counterparts in the short term. But
in the long run, they may spur the domestic lawyers to upgrade
themselves, in both professional standards and business skills,"
Wu said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: East Asia Recovering, Obstacles Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The East Asian economy is slowly
recovering from a 22-month-old financial crisis with rising
stocks, lower interest rates, stable currencies and a higher
production output across the region.
</P>
<P>
The gradual turnaround has convinced economists and government
officials that the East Asian economy has finally bottomed out and
started its upturn.
</P>
<P>
Nobody now seemingly has any doubt that the economic situation
in East Asia has stabilized.
</P>
<P>
A sharp rebound in East Asian stocks recently is considered as
a sign of the stabilized situation. Last month, massive purchases
of assets by foreign investors and a surge in Wall Street pushed
East Asian stocks to new record highs in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
Indices of stock markets in Hong Kong, Seoul and Manila had
approached the pre-crisis level by April. Tokyo stocks rose by
14.4 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the downturn in East Asian currencies has stopped
despite the weak yen, which saw its ups and downs against the
greenback due to the dim prospects for the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
While East Asian markets are surging, central banks in
crisis-hit countries -- South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia
and the Philippines -- have cut again and again interest rates to
stimulate the recovery process.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the interest rate of three-year government
bonds has been lowered to 6.39 percent, from 9 percent before the
crisis and 15 percent at the peak of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the central bank cut its overnight rates 11
times in the first four months of this year. The bank's key rates
are now at around 11 percent, compared with 28 percent in July
1997 when the country was hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with interest rate cuts, larger budget deficits adopted
by East Asian governments had a positive impact on production. In
South Korea, industrial production in February grew as fast as
before the economic crisis, while in Malaysia, industrial output
was also increasing.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by these positive signs, both the Asian Development
Bank and the World Bank predicted last month that the crisis-hit
countries, except Indonesia, could register respectively a gross
domestic product (GDP) growth in the range of 0.5 percent to 2.4
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said South Korea's economy is likely to grow 4
percent if it can keep its reform momentum.
</P>
<P>
However, many economists warned that considerable risks still
loom over the region.
</P>
<P>
In his closing remarks at the annual Asian Development Bank
(ADB) meeting Sunday, ADB President Tadao Chino said, "The path of
sustained economic recovery is a challenge one and that there is
no room for complacency or reduced commitment to continued
reforms."
</P>
<P>
What are the risks which could slow the recovery process?
</P>
<P>
Almost all economists believe that the slow pace of the
financial sector restructuring in the region could derail the
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, non-performing loans are impeding financial
reforms. Banks, burdened with mounting bad loans, could hardly
speed up restructuring and ease lending conditions despite lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Except in Singapore, the Philippines and China's Hong Kong,
non-performing loans in East Asian countries are still increasing.
Official figures show that Thailand's non-performing loan ratio
rose to 47 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
As the engine of East Asia's growth, export which remains
sluggish is another factor which would affect the recovery.
</P>
<P>
While exports have gone up 18 percent so far this year in the
Philippines, they are up only modestly in Japan and still dropping
in South Korea and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Other problems like reduction in foreign capital inflows, weak
commodity prices and the corporate debt crisis have also cast a
shadow on the region's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, some economists said East Asia's recovery and growth
prospects are still uncertain despite the positive signs which
emerged recently.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Plants under First-class State Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Of the more than 30,000 species of
plants in China, 354 are protected by the state. Following are
plants under first-class state protection:
</P>
<P>
Metasequois: big deciduous arbor of the fir family. Known as a
living fossil, the tree is a rare and ancient species dated back
to the Cretaceous period. Although the tree was found in a wide
area in North America, West Europe, and East Asia during the
Cretaceous period, it is now available only in China. The tree was
discovered in 1941 in southwestern China's Sichuan province, and
in central China's Hubei and Hunan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Spiny Alsophila: wooden fern or "tree fern", the tree is an
ornamental cash plant rich in starch content. It is now discovered
in southern areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Silver Fir: evergreen arbor of the pine family. An
ancient tree species that dates back to more than ten million
years ago, the plant became nearly extinct during the glacial
period. The plant was discovered in 1950s in southwestern areas of
China.
</P>
<P>
Handkerchief Tree: deciduous arbor of the dove tree family. As
a world-renowned ornamental tree, it has the name as "dove tree"
because of its dove-like flower. It is found only in Xingshan
county of central China's Hubei province. The number of the tree
is on the decline due to low survival rate of the tree sprouts
after transplantation.
</P>
<P>
Toothed Burr Medick: small arbor of the tea family. Known as
the rarest ornamental plant in China, it has flamboyant and
beautiful flowers. The leaf of the plant are valuable raw material
for making tea and medicine. The plant grows only in south China's
Guangxi province and transplantation of the plant has never
succeeded so far.
</P>
<P>
Ginseng: perennial herb of the ginseng family. The only herb
under first-class state protection, ginseng is rare medicinal
material. It is produced only in northeastern China and the
northern part of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Flous Taiwania: evergreen arbor of the fir family. As most
renowned building materials, the tree has soft but compact texture,
and straight lines. It can be found in southwestern China's Yunnan
and Guizhou provinces and the northern part of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Parashorea: big evergreen arbor of the gurjunoiltree
family. The tree can grow to more than 70 meters. Known as the
best material for building ships and automobiles, the tree grows
only in Xishuangbanna jungles in the southern part of Yunnan
province.

<P>
However, in the pursuit of hegemonism, the US has inevitably
flouted the norms on respecting for and refusal to infringe upon
another country's sovereignty, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the height of absurdity to deny national sovereignty on
the excuse of advocating human rights," it said, adding that, as
conditions differ from country to country there are different
views and opinions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The announcement noted that the ``human rights'' excuse peddled
by some western countries is aimed at forcing all nations in the
world, upon pain of extinction, to bow down to the powerful
countries' standards and norms. Any nation which refuses to do so
will be subject to blockades and sanctions, followed by military
action, including bombing.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the world is still divided into different
countries, weak and powerful, and especially with the continued
existence of hegemonism and power politics, human rights need the
protection of national sovereignty, the announcement stressed. (

<P>
Nepal was founded in the 6th century B.C. The Newars and other
tribes lived in Nepal before the 12th century. Several small
kingdoms were established between the 13th and 17th centuries.
Prithvi Narayan Shah, a king of Gurkha, united Nepal in 1768.
Since then, Nepal has remained an independent state.
</P>
<P>
In 1846, Jung Bahadur Rana carried out a bloody coup and
established a hereditary and all-powerful Rana regime until 1951
when an armed revolution toppled the Ranas and restored King
Tribhuvan to power. King Tribhuvan promulgated an interim
constitution on February 18, 1951 and formed a cabinet consisting
of members of various political groups.
</P>
<P>
After Tribhuvan died in 1955, his son Mahendra succeeded him.
Mahendra approved the first constitution of Nepal in February 1959
and the general election was held. The Nepali Congress won the
election and B.P. Koirala formed the government.
</P>
<P>
But a royal coup took place in December 1960. King Mahendra
dismissed the cabinet and dissolved the parliament. One month
later, he banned all political parties. In December 1962, he
introduced a new constitution, reasserting absolute royal power
and providing for a partyless Panchayat system in the country.
</P>
<P>
In January 1972 King Mahendra died and was succeeded by his
son, Birendra. After students demonstrated nationwide for reforms
in 1979, King Birendra announced a national referendum on whether
to restore multi-party democracy. In the referendum held in May
1980, 54.79 percent of the voters supported the Panchayat system
with reforms.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990, the Nepali Congress and the communists launched
a people's movement in the country, which turned to violent
demonstrations, strikes and mass arrests.
</P>
<P>
Later on, King Birendra agreed to lift the 30-year-old ban on
political parties and abolish the Panchayat system. On November 9,
1990, he officially promulgated a new constitution, introducing a
constitutional monarchy and restoring the multi-party
parliamentary system. General elections were held on May 12, 1991.

The Parliament of Nepal consists of the National Assembly
(Upper House), the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the
King.
</P>
<P>
The constitution promulgated in November 1990 introduced a
constitutional monarchy and a democratic multi-party system for
the kingdom. It recognized Hinduism as the country's dominant
religion. The king is the symbol of Nepalese nationality and the
unity of the Nepalese people.
</P>
<P>
The executive powers of the country are vested in the king and
the Council of Ministers. The king appoints the leader of the
party that commands a majority in the House of Representatives as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev was born in Kathmandu on
December 28, 1945. He ascended the throne on January 31, 1972.

The 1990 constitution replaced the unicameral Rashtriya
Panchayat (National Assembly) with a bicameral legislature
consisting of a 205-member Pratinidi Sabha (House of
Representatives) and a 60-member Rashtriya Sabha (National
Assembly).
</P>
<P>
Election to the House of Representatives is conducted on the
basis of universal adult franchise. For the purpose, the country
is divided into 205 single-member constituencies. The term of the
house is five years but can be extended by one year during an
emergency. It can be dissolved as per provisions of the
constitution before its term expires.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly is a permanent body with a six-year term
of office. Of its 60 members, 10 are nominated by the king, 35 are
elected from the House of Representatives and 15 are elected by an
electoral college. One third of the 60 members retire every two

<TEXT>
<P>
The following is a brief introduction about major political
parties in Nepal and their main candidates contesting the
parliamentary election scheduled for May 3 and May 17.
</P>
<P>
Although a royal decree banned political parties in 1960, they
continued to exist informally. In 1990, a multi-party system was
legalized following three months of unrest and the development of
a new constitution. Under the new electoral laws, parties must
register with the Election Commission. In order to gain
recognition, 5 percent of a party's candidates must be women and a
party must gain at least 3 percent of the total votes cast in the
election to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal
(Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party
govern the country.
</P>
<P>
1. The Nepali Congress:
</P>
<P>
The party was formally founded in Calcutta, India on April 9,
1950 as a result of the merger of the Nepali National Congress and
the Nepal Democratic Party. It was the dominant party in the House
of Representatives until late 1994. With the communists, the party
instigated the campaign of civil disobedience that led to the
political reforms in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Main candidates:
</P>
<P>
Girija Prasad Koirala: Prime minister, president and
parliamentary leader of the party, 74. In 1976, he was elected the
party's general secretary. He became the second elected prime
minister in Nepal in May 1991 after his party won a clear majority
in the general elections that month.
</P>
<P>
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai: Prime ministerial candidate, 75. He
was unanimously elected speaker of the first elected parliament in
the country in 1959-60. He was appointed to head an interim
government in April 1990 to draft a new constitution and hold

<HEADLINE> Looking for Dinosaur's Food in South China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carbon dating of fossils shows that alsophila was originated in
the Devonian period some 360 million years ago, and flourished in
the Jurassic period that is known as the era of dinosaur. As a
primitive plant, alsophila's metabolic system needs large amount
of water to support it, and it is vulnerable to cold.
</P>
<P>
During the Cretaceous period, the climate became dry and cold
and a new round of life extinction began.
</P>
<P>
Some paleontologists believe that the shrinking of alsophila
forests finally resulted in famine that wiped out all dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, a very small number of the rare plant survived.
They are mainly growing in certain tropical and sub-tropical
regions like Yunnan province, which is an asylum for many ancient
species," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
However, the global environmental change and human activities
have been threatening the plant. In 1984, the Chinese government
issued a red paper to include spiny alsophila in the list of
endangered plants for tighter protection.
</P>
<P>
The most important work is to locate more wild alsophila trees
and build natural reserves for them, according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s when scientists first found scattered
alsophila trees in the Xishuangbanna rain forest, more of the
species have been discovered in Guizhou, Guangdong, Sichuan and
Fujian provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Chishui county, Guizhou province, the Chinese government has
set up an alsophila reserve. Its area has been expanded from seven
square kilometers to the current 133 square kilometers, where
workers have multiplied 60,000 alsophila trees.
</P>
<P>
Cheng has successfully developed a method of cultivating
alsophila sprouts in test tubes. She said that her laboratory can
produce one million sprouts annually if there is the market demand.
</P>
<P>
The reason for preserving alsophila is explicit: the plant is a
"living fossil" of unrivaled scientific value. In addition,
alsophila is a high-quality timber; it can be used as medicine and
can be processed into human's food if necessary.
</P>
<P>
But the most important reason is that alsophila has unveiled
the secret of a damon-and-pythias relationship between life and
the environment, according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
"Like most rare plants in China, alsophila now faces no threat
of extinction," said the botanist.

<HEADLINE> Looking for Dinosaur's Food in South China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Although dinosaurs became extinct
some 65 million years ago, scientists are still painstakingly
looking for a kind of tree on which dinosaurs depended for
survival.
</P>
<P>
But it is no easy job of discovering such tree, known as spiny
alsophila, as there are an estimated thousands of them that have
survived in the rain forests in south China.
</P>
<P>
It remains a mystery as to why the 360 million-year-old tree-
fern could survived geological catastrophes. Ordinary visitors can
only have a close look at the plant in the Greenhouse at the on-
going Kunming International Horticultural Exposition, the biggest
event to display rare plants on the planet.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the plant was the principal food for
dinosaurs 100 million years ago when they were leisurely roaming
in the warm and humid Jurassic jungles.
</P>
<P>
"The plant is a typical tree-fern at that time, growing
everywhere on the planet. It contains rich starch in its leaves
and stalks," said Cheng Zhiying, an alsophila expert with the
Kunming Plant Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
A vegetarian dinosaur weighing 80 tons could eat 1,500 kg of
plants a day, paleontologists speculated.
</P>
<P>
"A hungry dinosaur might swallow an alsophila tree wholesale,
leaves and stalk," Cheng said, adding that in order to reach top
leaves, the neck of a sort of dinosaur became as long as
incredible 10 meters.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, in her 40s, has spent 20 years studying the legendary
plant, whose population is shrinking in the wild. Most alsophila
trees are now being cultivated artificially.
</P>
<P>
There are some 30 alsophila trees in the garden of the Kunming
International Horticultural Exposition, but most of them were
reproduced in Cheng's laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Cheng is striving to solve the conundrum that the contabescence
of alsophila and dinosaur occurred almost simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
"Many scientists guess that it was meteoroid collision that
killed both animals and plants on the planet 65 million years ago.
However, some experts believe that the tremendous transformation
of continents and oceans during the Cretaceous period led to the
extinction of many life forms," she said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former Tennis Star Yayuk Launches Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's best female tennis
player in the world tennis championship Yayuk Basuki launched her
biography "From Yogya to the World Stage" here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 126-page book whose front page is covered by Yayuk's
portrait was written by Daryadi, reporter of a tennis publication
here.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Yayuk who is pregnant expressed her pride of
being the first Indonesian tennis player who was able to
popularize the country with international tennis fans after she
turned pro in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"I am very proud of becoming Indonesia's player who could
finally represent this country. We were almost never mentioned
before," she was quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In her book, Yayuk, born in Yogyakarta on November 30, 1970, as
Nani Rahayu, shares the ups and downs of her tennis career.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk is noted as the only Indonesian who has ever reached the
world's top 20, after defeating Japanese tennis player Miho Saeki,
in the finals of the Toyota Princess Cup in Tokyo in mid September
1997.
</P>
<P>
A month after the Toyota Cup, she was ranked the 19th in the
world for the first time.
</P>
<P>
She failed to climb higher to the world top 10 because she
declined to compete in qualifications for the Porsche tournament
in Frankfurt, Germany. Only the best 18 players are allowed to
compete and Yayuk blamed the organizers for discriminating against
her.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk also reached the fourth round of the 1998 Australian Open
in Melbourne. Partnering with Dutch Caroline Vis, she managed to
reach the quarterfinals of the 1998 Chase Championship in New York.
</P>
<P>
As she announced the end of her career in tennis, her ranking
was 57th.
</P>
<P>
On Yayuk's book, chairman of the Indonesian National Committee
for Sports Wismoyo Arismunandar said she has successfully improved
her country's image in the eyes of the international community.
</P>
<P>
"She is a person who understands and loves her nation very much,
"Wismoyo said, noting how Yayuk had done her best in grabbing the
gold medal in the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok last December.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Tulips Flourish in Chinese Plateau Town (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"For the present, Zhongdian is the most successful tulip
cultivation base in China," said Xiong Cankun, the Tibetan manager
of the Gesang Company.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year the company's 13-hectare tulip garden
is expected to produce some two million flower bulbs of 12
categories. These bulbs, which have grown for seven months in
Zhongdian, can bloom after 60 days of simple cultivation by the
florists.
</P>
<P>
According to a botanist in Kunming, wild tulips were originated
in the region of Xinjiang in northwest China and later spread to
Europe through Central Asia and Turkey. European countries like
the Netherlands and France have had a history of several hundred
years in cultivating the flower and continuously breeding new
varieties.
</P>
<P>
"In China, however, the systematic breeding of tulips for
ornamental purposes didn't start until the 1970s," said Xiong,
adding that a large proportion of the four to five million tulip
bulbs sold on the Chinese flower market every year are from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Learning that the Dutch have planted some of their best tulips
in the Netherlands Garden in the venue of the Kunming Expo '99,
Xiong said that his company is also planning to put some Zhongdian-
grown tulips on display during the six-month run of the grand
garden show.
</P>
<P>
"I think our tulips will be very glad to have the chance to
meet their Dutch 'brothers and sisters'," said Xiong.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Tulips Flourish in Chinese Plateau Town (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Under a snow-capped mountain lies a
vast garden of Dutch tulips, which are sending out blossoms of red,
yellow, purple, black and other colors in the pleasant breeze of
May. This is not a scene in the Netherlands, but in Zhongdian, an
obscure plateau town in deepest China.
</P>
<P>
"The long daily sunshine and powerful ultraviolet light in
Zhongdian has made the color of tulips growing here astonishingly
bright, even brighter than those back in the Netherlands," said
Zhang Canming, an engineer with the Zhongdian-based Gesang Flower
Company, cultivator of the flowers.
</P>
<P>
Located in the northwestern corner of southwest China's Yunnan
Province, Zhongdian is the capital of Diqing Tibet Autonomous
Prefecture, which has been chosen as one of the sub-venues of the
ongoing '99 International Horticultural Exposition hosted by
Yunnan. Some scholars in recent years have suggested that this
small and secluded town 3,270 meters above sea level has been an
epitome of the legendary Shangrila.
</P>
<P>
It was in 1993 that the tulips, the national flower of the
Netherlands, first came to Zhongdian. To the surprise of many
people, this seemingly fragile flower adapted itself to the great
change of altitudes quite rapidly and bloomed in Zhongdian the
same year.
</P>
<P>
"The decisive factor for tulip planting is appropriate
temperature instead of elevation," explained Engineer Zhang. "It
requires at least three months of sub-zero temperatures in winter,
and summer temperatures no higher than 22 degrees Celsius."
</P>
<P>
The typical Alpine climate of Zhongdian meets these conditions
perfectly, while many other parts of the country, including
Kunming, capital of Yunnan and main venue of the world
horticultural show reputed as China's "city of eternal spring",
are either too hot or not cold enough for tulip growing.

<HEADLINE> Voting Begins in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kathmanduites began to cast
their votes at 08:00 (0215GMT) Monday morning as 35 of the
kingdom's 75 districts go to the polls under the first-phase
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Long queues were seen at a polling center at the No. 4
constituency in the capital. At 8 o'clock sharp, voters with
identity cards were allowed to enter a compound to cast their
votes.
</P>
<P>
The identity card system is introduced this time in 13
constituencies of five districts including the Kathmandu Valley.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase election to the 205-seat House of
Representatives should have been held at 93 constituencies of 36
districts, but the Election Commission declared on March 30 that
Palten Gurung from the Nepali Congress was elected unopposed as he
was the sole candidate to file nomination from the mountainous
Manang district, western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, elections in the No. 1 and 3 constituencies of
Kathmandu have been rescheduled for June 8 following the death of
Man Mohan Adhikari on April 26. As chairman and prime ministerial
candidate of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML), he was scheduled to contest in the two
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said about 5.9 million voters will
exercise their franchise in the first-phase elections. A total of
977 candidates including 74 women are in the electoral fray in the
first phase which will end at 17:00 (1115GMT).
</P>
<P>
The government has declared Monday a public holiday in the
above 35 districts.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase elections are scheduled for May 17 in the
remaining 39 districts. However, the No. 1 constituency of Palpa
district in the bracket is rescheduled for May 19 after Nepali
Congress candidate Tanka Nath Kafle died of heart attack on April
8.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting will begin only after the second-phase polls are
conducted, the Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three foreign observers from 14 countries are joining the
Nepali observers in monitoring the polls.

<HEADLINE> US, Russian, Yugoslav Legislators Reach Accord on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on a peace plan to
settle the Kosovo crisis has been reached by legislators from the
United states, Russia and Yugoslavia, a U.S. Congressman announced
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Curt Weldon, a Republican, who is heading a U.S. congressional
delegation which also includes Democratic Representative Neil
Abercrombie, said the plan stuck to NATO demands while taking
accounts of Russian and Yugoslav concerns.
</P>
<P>
The framework was hammered after two days of talks between the
U.S. delegation, Russian lawmakers, led by Chairman of the
parliamentary group of the Our Home Is Russia party Vladimir
Ryzhkov, and Yugoslav counterparts headed by Dragomir Karic, an
aide to President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Weldon said that Karic assured that Milosevic would be sure to
accept the deal, including an article of sending multinational
armed peace forces into Kosovo which has been opposed by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
But some U.S. officials were skeptical about what the
delegation claimed as the "historic breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
The text of the framework had already been faxed to Milosevic,
delegtes said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Seeks Hegemony, Not Human Rights (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China, like many other developing countries, has learned
painful lessons. Under conditions of foreign invasion and
imperialist bullying in the past, human rights were out of the
question, as the nation had no sovereignty, the announcement
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping emphasized that
sovereignty is far more important than human rights. This truth
has been attested by the concrete practice of history.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that big and powerful countries can get away
with serious infringing on other countries' sovereignty in the
name of safeguarding human rights.
</P>
<P>
But, what about the human rights situation in the US? Racial
discrimination is still rampant and shocking in that country, but
no small and weak country is able to intervene because that would
infringe on the sovereignty of the US.
</P>
<P>
Although the fallacy has misled some people, NATO's air strikes
against Yugoslavia will soon open their eyes, the announcement
said.
</P>
<P>
What has NATO accomplished in Yugoslavia, waving the banner of
human rights? It has caused the deaths of several thousand people,
made more than 600,000 others homeless, caused untold property
damage and brought about environmental catastrophe, it said.
</P>
<P>
People all over the world now have the uneasy feeling that they
have been thrown back to the era of imperialism, when the Great
Powers carved up the world between them in the name of ``spreading
civilization". The only difference is that NATO is engaging in
aggression in the name of protecting human rights. Nevertheless,
the essence is the same: It is a struggle to assert hegemony. (

<HEADLINE> Horti-Expo Serves as Powerhouse for to Yunnan's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The China '99 Kunming International
Horticultural Exposition, which opened here Saturday, is expected
to serve as a driving force for Yunnan's economy, making it a star
in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Provincial statistics show that Yunnan's investment in fixed
assets totaled 8.046 billion yuan in the first quarter of this
year, up 40.4 percent from the same period of last year. The
growth rate almost doubles the national average.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the provincial statistics bureau said the Expo '
99 has given a big push to the provincial economy. To host the
world garden show, Yunnan has so far injected more than 20 billion
yuan into infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The first world exposition China has ever hosted, the 184-day
event is attended by 95 countries and international organizations
and expects to attract ten million visitors.
</P>
<P>
"The Expo '99 benefits at least the following areas. It can
help build up its image in the world and facilitate further
opening-up of the province; it is conducive to implementing the
sustainable development strategy, fostering pillar industries,
propelling provincial economy, improving city infrastructure, and
upgrading social morale," according to Provincial Governor Li
Jiating.
</P>
<P>
"Yunnan has seized this unprecedented opportunity for
development at the turn of the century amid mounting competition
in provincial economic development." he added.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Expo '99 has made Yunnan a focus of media
coverage at home and abroad, and more than 2,000 reporters
converged into Kunming to cover the garden show.
</P>
<P>
City infrastructure and citizens' quality also received a great
boost from the opening of garden show. This capital city of Yunnan
has allocated about ten billion yuan in order to put on its best
face for the horticultural show.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan also mapped out plans for developing biological industry
and tourism, striving to bring the industrial output value to some
ten million yuan for the two sectors.
</P>
<P>
Economists pointed out that Expo '99 has done a lot to
stimulate Yunnan's economy, and is also expected to stimulate the
development of central and western China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Despite its abundant resources of animals, plants and minerals,
Yunnan still has an impoverished population of more than three
million, about one tenth of the nation's total.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Talks Planned within Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The acting chairman of England's
Football Association has confirmed that talks which could lead to
the permanent appointment of Kevin Keegan are due to begin within
days.
</P>
<P>
Geoff Thompson told BBC Radio 5 Live Sunday that discussions
will get under way this week after Keegan's announcement last week
that he wants the job.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a meeting of the sub-committee responsible for
it later this week," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly after our discussions then further discussions will
take place with Kevin."
</P>
<P>
Thompson thinks the experiences of two games at the helm have
made Keegan's mind up for him.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that he always wanted the job," Thompson said. "I
feel that once he got a taste of managing England - it's the best
job in the world - and felt that he was the right man for the job
then he would want to take it."
</P>
<P>
The acting chairman admitted that there are two camps within
the FA over when the appointment should be made, with some
believing the organisation should wait until after the Euro 2000
qualifying campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a diversity of opinion, but only slightly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the manager would be in place before June,
he added: "I very much hope so."

<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- One goal from Nicolas Anelka at the
14th minute gave Arsenal a nervous 1-0 win over Derby County at
Highbury on Sunday to put the champions back on top of the English
premier league.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal moved on to 72 points from 35 matches, a point more
than Manchester United who have a game in hand on the Gunners.
Arsenal have three matches left to play, United have four.
</P>
<P>
United went top on Saturday after their 2-1 win over Aston
Villa but their stay there was cut short by Arsenal's victory.
</P>
<P>
The only goal came when a Ray Parlour through-ball cut open the
Derby defence to find Anelka who beat Derby's offside trap. His
right-foot angled shot gave goalkeeper Mart Poom no chance.
</P>
<P>
Derby, who matched Arsenal stride for stride throughout,thought
they had equalised in the 79th minute but Paolo Wanchope's goal
was disallowed after the referee ruled the Costa Rican striker had
handled the ball before lashing it into the net.

LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- British rider Carl Fogarty notched up
his 51st race victory in the British round of the superbike world
championship in Donington Park, England on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The world champion ran away with the first of the two races in
the British round and was second in the other to move 23 points
clear of Ducati team mate Troy Corser of Australia in the overall
standings after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
American Colin Edwards picked up the fourth world superbike win
of his career in race two after a collision with his own Honda
team mate Aaron Slight on lap two which cannot have done much for
good relations between them.
</P>
<P>
A Honda team official said New Zealander Slight, who was pushed
back in the standings by his team mate moving up to third place
overall, had a badly cut hand.
</P>
<P>
Slight rejoined the race, only to crash out again on lap 19
after tucking in aggressively behind Edwards who had just lapped
him, with Fogarty in close pursuit.
</P>
<P>
Australian Peter Goddard had a big crash on lap one, with the
bike flipping him off. The Aprilia rider dislocated a shoulder and
broke a bone in his foot.

Round four of the world championship takes place in Albacete,

Province, Saturday. Following is a brief introduction to natural
reserves in China:
</P>
<P>
China started demarcating natural reserves quite early. It has
to date established 926 natural reserves, with total areas taking
up 7.64 percent of the territorial land, higher than the world's
average of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In October 1956, China's Ministry of Forestry, in line with
instructions of the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, mapped out
a draft plan for demarcating no-logging zones (natural reserves)
in natural forests, outlining the objects, methods and areas for
demarcating natural reserves and designating 40 places in 15
provinces and regions as no-logging zones.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, the State Council issued instructions, calling for
active protection and rational use of forests and wildlife
resources and for demarcating the main habitats of rare birds and
animals as natural sanctuaries and for banning the killing of 19
species of animals including giant panda.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, with the approval of the State Council, the Ministry
of Forestry issued regulations on the management of forest
reserves and sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country started work in nine natural reserves
across China. They are  Xishuangbanna in Yunnan, Poyang Lake in
Jiangxi, Wuyi Mountains in Fujian and Jiangxi, Foping, Zhouzhi,
Niujiliang and Taibai Mountains in Shaanxi, and Shennongjia in
Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth Session of the China National Committee of Man and
Bio-Sphere Committee convened in April, 1993 decided to establish
a "China Network of Bio-Sphere Protection". By the end of 1996,
this network had incorporated 61 natural reserves across China.
</P>
<P>
For better international cooperation and exchange in wildlife
protection, the Chinese government has become a signatory party to
a series of international treaties and conventions, including the
Conventions on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora, the United Nations Convention on Marine Law, the
International Convention on Important Wetlands, in Particular
Habitats for Water Poultry, and the Convention of Bio-diversity
Protection.
</P>
<P>
At present, 14 Chinese natural reserves, including the Wolong
Natural Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province which is
home to the giant panda, have been covered by the International
Network of Bio-sphere Reserve. Six other natural reserves have
been listed as internationally important wetlands and habitats for
water poultry according to the International Convention on
Important Wetlands, in Particular Habitats for Water Poultry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Civil Rights Leader Urges Clinton to Meet Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson Sunday urged President Bill Clinton to return the gesture
of Yugoslavia's release of three U.S. soldiers and meet face-to-
face with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Jackson made the call on the "Meet the Press" program of the
National Broadcasting Company (NBC).
</P>
<P>
"Leaders should not be afraid to meet. As a matter of fact,
they must...I think (Clinton) and Milosevic would understand each
other... We should not miss this moment of opportunity," Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
Jackson sharply criticized the NATO bombing which has put
civilians in the line of fire. He cited a NATO attack that struck
a bus crossing a bridge in Kosovo, killing 60 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the "Late Edition" program of the Cable News
Network (CNN), Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott also urged
Clinton to seize the opportunity for a diplomatic solution to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Clinton said in a statement that he welcomed
Yugoslavia's release of three U.S. soldiers but said NATO would
continue with its air strikes until all of Kosovo's refugees can
return home.
</P>
<P>
"As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the
over one million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the
policies of the regime in Belgrade," Clinton said in a statement.
"Today, we reaffirm our resolve to persevere until they... can
return -- with security and self-government," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that our three American servicemen who have been
held as prisoners by Serbian authorities have today been released
and that they are now safely out of Serbia," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful to Jackson and his delegation for helping to
secure their freedom. All of America is anticipating their safe
return," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Produce 500,000 Tons of Cocoa in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's annual cocoa production
is expected to increase to 500,000 metric tons by 2005 from
330,000 tons this year and about 425,000 tons of the estimated
cocoa output would be available for export.
</P>
<P>
The target would be easy to reach thanks to a massive expansion
of plantation areas in recent years, said P.S. Siswoputranto,
executive director of the Indonesian Cocoa Association (Askindo).
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar
has caused a significant increase in cocoa prices at home. The
more favorable price has made farmers and plantation companies
expand their cocoa plantations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Siswoputranto said the new cocoa plantations, which account for
about 20 percent of productive cocoa plantation areas, would start
their first harvest within the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
"By 2005, we hope that cocoa production will have gradually
increased to 500,000 tons," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Siswoputranto said Indonesia's cocoa production was expected to
reach 330,000 tons in the 1998/1999 cocoa production year ending
October, a 6-percent rise from the 310,000 tons produced in the
last production year.
</P>
<P>
Exports are expected to reach 225,000 tons in the same period,
the same level as the last production year.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia would be able to export 425,000 tons of cocoa
a year by 2005, generating 600 million dollars in foreign exchange
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's third-largest producer of cocoa after
Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Siswoputranto said that to boost exports, Indonesia must
encourage the production of high-quality fermented cocoa beans.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's cocoa beans were regarded as low quality by
international buyers, which made it hard for the country to
compete with other producers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Expert Warns Against Deteriorating Forest Ecology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Global Ecology is deteriorating
dramatically due to excessive logging and effective measures
should be adopted to save forests, said a forestry expert here.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 million people have been forced to move out of
their hometowns due to deteriorating environment, three million
more than the world's refugee population, and the figure may
double by the end of this century if no effective measures are
taken, said Professor Hong Jusheng, an executive member of the
Global Network for Forest Science Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the United Nations Environment Program show
that global fresh water resources, which could still meet demand
at the beginning of this century, are already falling short of
demand of the current global population of six billion.
</P>
<P>
"Another reason for the short supply of fresh water lies in the
damage of forests, known as 'green reservoir', since the forests
absorb 30 to 40 percent of the rainwater on the earth.' Hong said.
</P>
<P>
"But the global forest cover has shrunk to 3.04 billion
hectares now, 62 percent less than 8,000 years ago, yet the annual
timber consumption has gone up to more than three billion cubic
meters," he added.
</P>
<P>
Forest is also known as an oxygen generating plant and storage
of species. For every ton of timber grown, for instance, it can
absorb 1.47 tons of carbon dioxide and release 1.07 tons of oxygen.
Of the 1.4 million species on the earth, about 50 to 90 percent
live in forest.
</P>
<P>
"Deteriorating forest ecology is posing a grave threat to the
global ecological balance, biodiversity and subsistence of mankind,
" Hong Jusheng said."it is, therefore, pressing to adopt effective
measures to salvage forests that have a vital bearing on the
survival of man."

<HEADLINE> NATO Seeks Hegemony, Not Human Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Society for Human Rights
Studies (CSHRS) today strongly condemned NATO's air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's military action, headed by the US, has trampled on the
norms of international law and brazenly violated the classical
principles enshrined in the UN Charter, which defend peace and
oppose war," said an announcement by the CSHRS.
</P>
<P>
"It is undisguised hegemonism," the CSHRS concluded.
</P>
<P>
The excuse of human rights transcending sovereignty concocted
by some Western countries, including the US, is aimed at seeking
hegemony and NATO's military strikes against Yugoslavia have put
this absurd theory into practice in a massive way, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches marking the 50th anniversary of military
alliance, leaders of some NATO members clearly stressed the
importance of human rights transcending sovereignty and preached
NATO's "new concept" in handling international affairs in a bid to
legalize their practice of military interference in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The fallacy is a denial of sovereignty. Respect for and refusal
to infringe upon another country's sovereignty are the basic norms
accepted worldwide that maintain normal relations among countries,
it noted.

<HEADLINE> Hendry Moves Closer to Record Seventh World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Stephen Hendry put his record seventh
world title hope within eight frames when he took a 10-6 lead over
Mark Williams at the end of play of the World Snooker Championship
in Sheffield, England on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hendry's last world title success came three years ago but the
30-year-old Scot has proved over the last two weeks that he is
still a huge force.
</P>
<P>
Williams has yet to show the sort of form which enabled him to
beat Ronnie O'Sullivan 17-10 in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
And his hopes of becoming the first Welshman to win the title
since 1979 are fading fast in this best-of-35-frame final.
</P>
<P>
Hendry won the first two frames with breaks of 62 and 98. He
won a scrappy third frame to edge further ahead and after trailing
56-4 in the fourth frame, he compiled a 77 break to establish a 4-
0 lead at the mid-session interval.
</P>
<P>
Williams got off the mark in the fifth frame before Hendry
regained his four-frame advantage with a break of 86.
</P>
<P>
But Williams ended the afternoon on a high note, winning the
last two frames of the session.
</P>
<P>
Hendry came from behind to win the opening frame of the evening
with a break of 77.
</P>
<P>
And he went further in front with a 76 break in the next frame.
</P>
<P>
The first century of the match came in the 12th frame when
Hendry produced a 132 clearance.
</P>
<P>
Williams missed several good potting chances while in front,
allowing Hendry to maintain his advantage.
</P>
<P>
Hendry won the last two frames of the evening, finishing with a
break of 92, to move closer to the 230,000 pounds (370,700 U.S.
dollars) first prize.
