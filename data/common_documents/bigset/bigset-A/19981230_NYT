 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Four years ago, Mississippi State running back James
Johnson was floating along in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,
sorting mail on the USS John F. Kennedy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had given up on his dream of playing college football when
his entrance-exam scores weren't high enough for him to accept one
of many Division I scholarship offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so disappointed, and I didn't want to feel like I was
standing still with my life,'' Johnson said. ``I was young, and I
made a drastic decision. I could have gone to a junior college, but
I didn't know anything about juco ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I missed my chance, and I didn't want to sit
around and be nothing. I was going on with life and wasn't going to
mope and cry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But being at sea for months at a time on an aircraft carrier
gives one a lot of time to think. And the desire to play football
was something Johnson couldn't get out of his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the water for two months can get to you,'' he said.
``I'm not a pirate. That's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said the Navy experience turned his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't have made it if I had gone to college out
of high school,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't have my head on right
and probably would have gone to college for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Navy, I realized that no one is going to
hand you anything in life. You have to work for everything you get.
It helped me develop the proper attitude about the things I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending a year in the Navy, Johnson knew he wanted to
find a way to play college ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always said you have to have confidence in yourself
for anyone else to have confidence in you,'' Johnson said. ``I
always felt I could play with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson received a phone call from his high school coach telling
him East Mississippi Community College would sign him to play in
the fall of 1995 if he could get an early release from his two-year
naval commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My captain was all for it,'' Johnson said. ``He said if I had
this chance to further my education, he wanted me to do it. When I
got back to the states, I didn't even go home. I went straight to
the school.''
</P>
<P>
   After two successful years at East Mississippi, Johnson
transferred to Mississippi State and has become one of the most
prolific runners in school history. He set an MSU record this
season with 1,383 yards rushing and earned All-Southeastern
Conference honors.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams will not be the
only talented running back on the field in Friday's Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.J. and Ricky have a lot of similarities,'' said Mississippi
State coach Jackie Sherrill. ``They are big and strong and make so
many yards after contact. This will be a special game for people
who enjoy watching powerful runners.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill believes one trait Johnson and Williams share is the
ability to attack the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference they have over a lot of other backs is they
both are full speed when they get to the line of scrimmage,''
Sherrill said. ``A lot of backs go east and west, and it takes a
little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 6-2, 230 pounds, Williams 6-0 and 225. Williams might
be the first player selected in the 1999 NFL draft, but Johnson
won't be far behind. He likely will be selected in the first or
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of these two guys runs a 4.4 in the 40,'' Sherrill
said. ``But they are very powerful backs who accelerate very
quickly. They are able to be at full speed in two steps. When they
see an opening, they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won the Conerly Trophy, awarded annually by the
Mississippi Hall of Fame to the best college player in the state.
Some of the Bulldogs see Friday's game as a chance for him to show
he can perform at a level equal to the Heisman winner, but Johnson
doesn't look at it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't get into that,'' he said. ``There's nothing
personal about it to me. Ricky is a great running back, and he has
earned everything he has gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson earned every yard he gained over the last month of the
season the hard way, trying to play with a severe groin pull and a
bruised shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask anyone who has had a groin injury, and they will tell you
it's a very painful injury,'' Johnson said. ``It hampers everything
you try to do as a running back. My shoulder still is a little
suspect, but it won't hold me back in the game. The time off
definitely helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's stats this season were impressive, but his numbers
clearly would have been better had he been healthy in the last
three games. Johnson had 1,277 yards rushing after the Alabama game
Nov. 14, including back-to-back 200-yard efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But he pulled his groin in practice before the Arkansas game on
Nov. 21 and rushed for only 34 yards before having to leave. He
also had 34 yards rushing against Mississippi the following week
and didn't play in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.J. was playing on sheer courage in a couple of those
games,'' said Mississippi State running backs coach Glenn Davis.
``He could run straight ahead, but he couldn't cut and couldn't
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had only 38 yards against Tennessee in a 24-14 loss in
the SEC Championship Game. He believes things might have turned out
differently that day had he been healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting the whole game, but you can't change the past,''
Johnson said. ``Tennessee played a great game, and they won it.
Still, if you are a competitive person, you feel like you can make
a difference in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has felt that way since he was a young boy playing
football on the streets of Mobile, Ala., with his childhood buddy
Tee Martin, who now is the starting quarterback at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would play touch in the street and tackle at the sideline
near the grass,'' Johnson said. ``You didn't want to get too close
to the sideline. If you did get tackled in the street, you would
just go home, put a Band-Aid on and come back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it gave some extra toughness to Johnson, a north-south
runner who tends to punish tacklers as much as they punish him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest asset is aggressiveness,'' Johnson said. ``I never
give up on a play. I always want to try to break a tackle and make
some extra yards. Sometimes breaking one tackle can be the
difference in having to punt or getting a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the extra effort is something Johnson learned he had to
do if he was going to go from manning an aircraft carrier to
starring as a college running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in hard work,'' he said. ``You get out what you put
in. Effort and second effort is the key. That's why I always get up
right after I get knocked down. That's what I live by.''

 &HT;    Chiles' thought to be hunting when he died
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau
</P>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Rhea Chiles thought her husband had gone
hunting the day he died in the exercise room at the Governor's
Mansion, a report of his death released Tuesday shows.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-page summary of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's
investigation of Gov. Lawton Chiles' Dec. 12 death states, in fact,
that his wife even looked for him at 10:30 a.m., three hours after
last seeing him dressed in his workout clothes and preparing to
take the dog for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Rhea Chiles went to the exercise room searching for him but
didn't see him, leading her to believe he had gone hunting. Only
later, at about 3:40, did she learn that Chiles had never left the
room and realized that ``something must be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, FDLE agent Vince Curry found Chiles' body
collapsed at the side of his exercise bicycle. Paramedics called to
the mansion were unable to revive him. An autopsy showed he died of
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The FDLE report, however, indicates that even if Rhea Chiles had
seen her husband over the weight machine in her line of sight, she
would have been too late. Security equipment in the exercise room _
the report was released with the specifics blacked out to maintain
security _ showed a sequence of activity starting with Chiles'
entry into the room at 8:11 a.m. and ending at 8:49 a.m., possibly
coinciding with his death.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chiles' assumption that the governor had left the grounds
to go hunting _ indeed, she reportedly expressed irritation with
him that afternoon for missing the start of a reception _ addresses
the question of how Chiles could have been left unattended for an
entire morning and much of an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   FDLE officials have said Chiles jealously guarded his privacy
when he was in his exercise room and adjoining study, and
frequently would spend many hours there alone on weekends.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ Seth McKinney missed half of his senior season in
high school after injuring himself doing a Mexican hat dance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Semisi Heimuli has sported a mohawk-type haircut and is believed
to be the first player from Tonga to play at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Vakalahi, Semisi's cousin, is believed to be the first
300-pound Tongan to play at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Tango McCauley's first name is, well, Tango.
</P>
<P>
   And Kyle Lednicky, solely a deep snapper with 526 consecutive
error-free snaps, is a 6-4, 261-pounder who packs a single-digit
handicap in golf.
</P>
<P>
   But the stories of those A&AMP;M offensive linemen are mere child's
play compared to that of teammate Dan Campbell. Campbell, a 6-5,
253-pound senior tight end, is in a class by himself.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of what sets Campbell apart:
</P>
<P>
   If he does not make it in pro football, and possibly even if he
does, Campbell plans to give serious consideration to becoming a
professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   On his arm, he sports a tattoo of a design he saw on the
Internet. Some Indian tribe (he does not know which because he
didn't read it that closely) used the design when painting its
faces for war.
</P>
<P>
   He is probably the first college football player to have a
church protest his apology to someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's developed it over the years, but he came from Glen Rose,
so he was weird when he got here,'' A&AMP;M safety Rich Coady said.
</P>
<P>
   Being from Glen Rose, a town about an hour's drive south of Fort
Worth with a population of about 2,500, has something to do with it
for sure. Campbell is only the second player from Glen Rose High,
joining Jessie Pruitt of Texas Tech, to play major-college
football.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said one of the reasons he did not go to Texas _
besides the fact a UT assistant coach mistook a group of goats on
his family's property for ``black deer'' when he paid a recruiting
visit _ was that Austin is just too big a town.
</P>
<P>
   He thought College Station was pretty big too, but he figured he
could deal with it. Upon seeing him for the first time, Coady might
not have been so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he came in, he was wearing jean cut-off shorts,
cowboy boots, a tank top and a cowboy hat,'' Coady said. ``He came
in here 100 percent country.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he admits to owning each of those pieces of apparel,
Campbell denies wearing the ensemble at the same time. But he
insists Coady has been trying to get at him for years, and that, he
says, is why Coady shared this tidbit with the media covering this
week's Sugar Bowl between A&AMP;M and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   It's significant because few can compete with Campbell in a war
of words. Most know not even to try.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell will make up stories if he has to, Coady says, to have
fun at the expense of a teammate. The good thing for A&AMP;M is that
the talk is not all fun and games, which is why Campbell is the
unofficial Aggies spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely the vocal leader of this team,'' Coady said,
``and everything he says, even when it looks funny in the paper, we
know he is not mean about it. He says it in a positive manner, and
he really wants us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To describe Campbell as blunt, direct, frank or candid would not
quite capture his essence. You will never hear any coachspeak from
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something my dad always taught me. If you're gonna say
something, make sure it comes from the heart,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually impossible to get a player to describe his team
in negative terms, but not so with Campbell. What did he think of
the A&AMP;M offense after a loss to Texas on Nov. 27?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like, `Man we need to turn this around. We're
pitiful,''' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is a good blocker who will make big catches when
ignored in the passing game, Campbell might make his most important
contribution by being able to say that something pitiful is
pitiful. Just before playing Kansas State in the Big 12
Championship Game, Campbell gave a speech that his teammates say
got them in the proper mood, and the Aggies got the turnaround they
were looking for. They posted a season-high 36 points in upsetting
the Wildcats, who many thought had the best defense in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always has something to say. It's an every-day thing,''
running back Dante Hall said. ``It helps keep us focused. When guys
are slacking or we are having an off day at practice, he always
gets on 'em. Without that, I think guys would lose focus and just
go through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Aggies credit Campbell with the team's dedication to
offseason workouts. If you weren't there giving it your all, you
had to hear from the big guy. And since he is a big guy, you had to
take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a lot nicer when I first met him, but I can't say
anything to him now because he'll beat me up,'' said All-America
linebacker Dat Nguyen, who met Campbell when the two were on a
recruiting trip. ``But he's grown a lot, for a country boy, and he
has taken over the leadership of the team. When he speaks,
everybody listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Campbell: ``Anything that I ever say to the team is
something that just pops into my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that also has gotten him into trouble. One
unfortunate joke made by Campbell at the Aggie bonfire this season
_ he made light of sexual preference when comparing the makeup of
the A&AMP;M and Texas student bodies _ upset certain groups on both
campuses and became a full-blown incident. Then, after Campbell
sent a written apology to UT, a Baptist church decided he should
not have said he was sorry for his remarks and denounced Campbell,
A&AMP;M and the apology.
</P>
<P>
   In a first, Campbell is buttoning his lip on that particular
matter, having gotten enough mail ``to last me for years.'' But
A&AMP;M's coaches won't try to quell his enthusiasm when it comes to
other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of Dan, and he knows when he misspeaks,'' A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum said. ``When you go to him he says, `Aw, I
shouldn't have said that.' So he's one of those guys that you have
a good rapport with. Some of that _ the fieriness, the emotion _
that's what allowed him to be a good leader for us. You love guys
like that.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Montae Reagor watched Ricky Williams' run to the Heisman Trophy and
the NCAA Division I-A career record for rushing yardage and joined
the masses in cheering him on.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He followed much of Dat Nguyen's trek to the Lombardi Award and
would like to have given him a high-five when the deed was done.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas' gifted running back and arguably the best linebacker
to play for Texas A&AMP;M, Reagor is about to end his college football
career as an All-American. But unlike Williams and Nguyen, Reagor
will leave Texas Tech with little fanfare, despite his
accomplishment-filled senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get envious,'' Reagor said Monday from his home in
Waxahachie, where he's spending the holidays with his family.
``Everyone's time comes. I guess when you win more ballgames, you
get more recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have been in programs that have won over the years,
and their names have been up there. I can only congratulate those
guys. They're hard-nosed players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who know about me. I just do my job and not
try to worry about everything else. Everything will come. And my
blessings are falling in, one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   Being named an All-American in his final year at Tech is an
honor Reagor will cherish for many years. But the blessing for
which he's most thankful was finishing his college work in 3{ years
and obtaining a bachelor of science degree in exercise and
kinesiology last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education has always been first to me, and everything else was
secondary,'' Reagor said. ``So that's my biggest accomplishment, by
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagor could have bragged about a number of other achievements
over the past three years. This season alone, the 6-2, 254-pound,
three-time letterman thrust his name among the best defenders in
college football. Reagor, a left defensive end, had seven sacks to
become Tech's all-time leader with 24{, passing Calvin Riggs (18{
from 1983-86).
</P>
<P>
   Reagor had 19 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, surpassing
the Tech single-season record set by Zach Thomas (16), who plays
for the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   When Tech beat Fresno State, Reagor had four stops behind the
line to move past former Tech All-American Gabe Rivera, who had
been the school career leader with 34. Reagor has 47 as Tech (7-4)
prepares for Thursday's Independence Bowl against Mississippi (6-5)
in Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   He was second among the Red Raiders in total tackles for 1998
with 96 (52 solos). His best game was Oklahoma State when Reagor
posted 11 tackles (one for a loss) and a sack.
</P>
<P>
   A semifinalist for the Lombardi Award, which annually goes to
the nation's best college lineman/linebacker, Reagor was a
first-team All-America pick by five organizations _ the Associated
Press, the American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers
Association of America, The Sporting News and the Walter Camp
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Football News had him on the second team.
</P>
<P>
   But those honors pale in comparison to the hardware Nguyen and
Williams took home. Perhaps it would have been different had Reagor
played for a school that's not so isolated from major media
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would've made a big difference,'' he said. ``You
know, more TV time, more recognition. Big-name schools do help. But
like I've said before, I'm proud to be here and wouldn't trade it
for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagor is most proud of the 1997 season when he had 97 tackles,
10{ sacks, five fumble recoveries and the only interception of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really accomplished things I wanted to, and I really just
put myself on another level from the other guys I was playing
against,'' Reagor said. ``I stepped my game up to another level. I
just matured last year, just took a different approach and a
different attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-sized photos of Reagor have been placed on the walls of
athletic facilities at Tech, amid those of other outstanding
present and former student-athletes. And more pictures, said
Reagor, are on order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been really pleased with my efforts over the years,'' he
said. ``I've improved, set certain goals and standards I've tried
to achieve each year. I've done that with hard work and
dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   He has enjoyed a successful career at Tech, beginning as a
freshman when he tied for the team lead in sacks with three. And
Thursday, it will come to a glorious end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it a whole lot these last couple of
weeks,'' Reagor said. ``Time's winding up. I've kind of thought
about it, and I kind of don't want to think about it. It makes me
sad. I've played with a great bunch of guys, who have worked hard.
I've really enjoyed being here. It's going to be a hard thing to
take, but everyone's time comes to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagor vows next season he will play in the NFL. Another thing
he's pretty sure about is how he'll react once the final gun sounds
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably cry. I'm an emotional guy,'' Reagor said.
``It'll hit me. It's already getting to me now. I think about it
every day. It's going to be hard. I'm going to cherish the moment
because that will be my last time playing in college with these
guys, playing college football.''

 &HT;    Trump warned to use minority businesses
 &HT;    By Marc Freeman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Donald Trump is violating his deal with
Palm Beach County to use minority businesses to build his $40
million golf course, County Commission Chairwoman Maude Ford Lee
warned last week.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's agreement requires that his general contractor hire
minorities for 30 percent of the work on the exclusive Trump
International Golf Club under construction on 215 county-owned
acres.
</P>
<P>
   With the 18-hole course and 25,000-square-foot clubhouse
targeted for a November opening, Lee demanded that Trump include
minority firms as his lease with the county requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely disappointed with the lack of participation by
minority and black vendors in this effort thus far,'' Lee wrote in
a Dec. 23 letter to Trump. ``I am requesting an immediate plan of
action from you to help rectify this grave disparity and the
conditions of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump was not in his New York office Tuesday. His lawyer, golf
project manager and spokesman also could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   If Trump fails to comply _ and the county decides he didn't use
``reasonable efforts'' to find minorities _ the county could cancel
the 75-year lease, said Bob Inman, properties manager for the
county's division of airports, which is overseeing the golf course
project.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to lease the golf course property, Trump dropped his
lawsuit against the county over airplane noise at his Mar-a-Lago
club in Palm Beach. Trump's lease payment is $438,000 per year
until 2003; the price rises gradually to $657,000 in 2024.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's original general contractor, Paragon Construction Inc.,
was replaced in July by Ranger Construction Industries Inc. of West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Lee sounded a similar alarm over the construction
of the $28 million Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter. The baseball
park, like the golf course, required 30 percent minority
participation; the stadium's contractor was Case Contracting Co. of
Plant City.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally on the stadium work is still unclear, said
Dianne Kinser, chairwoman of the county's Small and Minority/Women
Business Enterprise Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A leading advocate for minority issues, Lee has not yet alerted
the committee about the Trump project. The panel monitors the
county's contract preference program, which, for example, asks that
black firms get 5.2 percent of all contracts for county
construction jobs each year.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-profile golf course project requires much more.
Black firms were promised 10 percent of the work, with minority and
women-owned businesses in line for another 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said her support for the Trump course was based on the
belief that it would offer job opportunities for blacks, both
during construction and after the facility opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that this will be a tremendous asset and showcase
for Palm Beach County,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Trump International Golf Club _ planned as the most
expensive in Florida _ will feature 35-foot-tall rock formations,
waterfalls and a clubhouse 45 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Club memberships will be for the rich. Initiation fees are
$150,000 for individuals and $250,000 for corporations. Annual dues
are $9,000.

UCLA BRACES FOR BIGGEST BADGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ End Kenyon Coleman and the rest of UCLA's defense
will face their biggest challenge in the Rose Bowl, literally, and
it has nothing to do with the Badgers' mammoth tailback, Ron Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   Before Coleman and Co. can get their hands on the 260-pound
Dayne, they must ward off Wisconsin right tackle Aaron Gibson, who
stands 6-foot-7 and weighs 370 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him on TV, and he's huge,'' Coleman said, shaking
his head in disbelief. ``Weight isn't always a factor. I'd rather
play against someone big than quick. But he's both.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a senior from Indianapolis, was a finalist for the
Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy, won by UCLA junior Kris
Farris. Gibson is considered the finest senior offensive lineman in
the nation, a one-man wrecking crew who clears lanes for Dayne and
the Badgers' ground game.
</P>
<P>
   When he turns the corner for downfield blocks, Gibson will face
UCLA linebackers and defensive backs half his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to strap it up and play,'' Coleman
said. ``But I don't think it'll be that much of a shock to us
because we see Farris (310 pounds) every day in practice. I feel
sorry for the other team having to go against Farris. To us,
(Gibson) isn't a phenomenon, but that doesn't make him a lesser
player. We definitely respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Depleted ranks: The defensive line is UCLA's most battered unit.
Starting nose guard Micah Webb is out with a career-threatening
knee injury, and third-string nose guard Kory Lombard injured his
ankle Monday and is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, starting end Pete Holland's availability and
effectiveness are in doubt because of sprained ligaments in his
elbow that have prevented him from practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody know a defense where you don't have to play a
defensive line?'' coach Bob Toledo joked.
</P>
<P>
   True freshman Ken Kocher has replaced Webb, and another rookie,
Anthony Fletcher, could get the call at end. If he does, UCLA's
starting defense will have five freshmen and three sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   The empire guys: Four of UCLA's 11 defensive starters (36
percent) are natives of the Inland Empire: San Bernardino
linebacker Ryan Nece, Moreno Valley linebacker Santi Hall, Redlands
safety Jason Stephens and Coleman, an Alta Loma product.
</P>
<P>
   All four were recruited by former assistant coach Steve Marshall
and all four signed letters of intent on the same day in Feb. '97.
Coleman is the only one who did not redshirt last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Marshall did a great job recruiting,'' Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo contract: Toledo said Tuesday that he has agreed to a
seven-year rollover contract that must be finalized by UCLA
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to give salary figures, but sources said Toledo will
receive approximately $600,000 per year, making him one of the
highest-paid coaches in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to say goodbye: Sixteen UCLA seniors will play
their last college game Friday, including quarterback Cade McNown,
center Shawn Stuart, guard Andy Meyers, tight end Mike Grieb,
kicker Chris Sailer, linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo and safety Larry
Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It finally hit me that it's my final game,'' Atkins said.
``The chance to play in the Rose Bowl for my final game is
something that I'll take with me.''

EMIGRES SEND RELIEF TO RUSSIA, OTHER FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Zahar Kofsman hears about food shortages and
bitter cold winter in Moldova, he thinks about his former neighbors
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very bad time for them,'' said Kofsman, who owns
two Russian bookstores in Los Angeles, and is now a United States
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Like many immigrants in the region, he is reaching out to help
the poverty- and misery-stricken residents of Russia and
surrounding countries. He's already sent clothes to Moldova, and
Tuesday he applauded efforts by the American Red Cross, area
churches and charities to help as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has issued an urgent plea for donations of money
to purchase food, clothing, shelter supplies and other items.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get excited when there's a flood and it kills 120,000,
but what they don't understand is that the same 120,000 can die
quietly in a big country like Russia because of cold winters,''
said Rabbi Nastoli Estulin, immigration program director at the
Chabad Russian Synagogue in West Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is hoping to work with area synagogues, churches
and community centers to encourage residents to donate, said Mike
Powers, spokesman for the agency's Los Angeles chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty dire,'' Powers said. ``It's winter and if we don't
get more stuff in there as soon as possible _ which we are working
to do _ it could become a problem because of the isolation, winter
and the roads not being accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the surrounding countries of Belarus, Moldova and
Ukraine, have been among the hardest hit, he said. The Red Cross
estimates there are more than 70 million people living below the
poverty line in those areas, said Powers.
</P>
<P>
   An early summer drought and heavy rains in August created a poor
harvest leading to the food shortage, said Powers. The collapse of
the Russian economy this year has also reduced the amount of fuel
and food the country can import.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply don't have the money to purchase food and fuel as
they normally would,'' said Powers.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, the Chabad Russian Synagogue has collected money
and goods for Russia because a majority of the 40,000 parishioners
have close ties to family and friends there, said Estulin.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the needy has not gone unheeded locally. The Holy
Virgin Mary Cathedral in the Silverlake district has helped by
coordinating with their state and national branches to run a
massive soup kitchen in Russia, and to send care packages overseas
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the cathedral's parishioners raised $6,000 to send
food and medical equipment, said Igumen Benjamin, who organized the
effort at the cathedral, which is affiliated with the Orthodox
Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``How these people are going to get through the winter we don't
know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross hopes to raise $14 million internationally. To
help, call (800) HELP-NOW or send monetary donations for the Red
Cross International Response Fund to the Red Cross Los Angeles
Chapter, 2700 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, 90057. &QL;

ALVAREZ NOT THINKING ABOUT NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tuesday was the kind of December day in Southern
California that causes tourists from the frozen Midwest to don
shorts, forget about socks and display untanned legs in all their
glory.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the tunnel alongside the Coliseum, framed by palm
trees and backlit by a golden sky as temperatures hovered in the
mid-70s, Wisconsin head football coach Barry Alvarez fit the
tourist role as if he was sent by central casting.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who want to cast Alvarez in the role of NFL
coach. After all, on Monday five NFL coaches were given pink slips
by their organizations. And Alvarez, with his 59-42 lifetime record
with the Badgers, is a perfect candidate for any one of those
roles.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the verge of his second Rose Bowl as Badger head coach,
Alvarez is content with the part he has. Very content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I thinking about any NFL jobs?'' he asked. ``No, I'm not.
Regardless of whether they've contacted me. I'm not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who turned 52 today, will likely see his annual salary
at Wisconsin increase from $600,000 to $800,000 next season, if a
handshake deal he has with the university's athletic director is
approved by a board of regents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the contract restructuring, a 15-year deferred
annuity will increase in value from $1.25 million to $2 million,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers will play UCLA in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
It is the fourth time Alvarez has coached in a Rose Bowl. As an
assistant at Iowa in the early 80s, Alvarez was involved in
Hawkeyes losses to Washington in 1982 and UCLA in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   As head coach, Alvarez led the Badgers to a 21-16 win over UCLA
in 1994. He's hoping to repeat that success.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Alvarez realizes that although he is
perceived as something of a miracle-worker after turning a 1-10
Wisconsin team in 1990 into a 10-1 team in 1994, he has his work
cut out for him against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   A long layoff could make the difference. While the Bruins played
their final game of the season Dec. 5 against Miami, the Badgers
last played Nov. 21 against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat for two weeks while they were practicing,'' Alvarez
said after Tuesday's workout. ``So, we've had two very physical
days. We've really worked hard. I'm pleased with how the kids have
really focused and given us their full attention when we've
practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be especially hard in Southern California with all its
distractions, but Alvarez is an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially good to be in California (this year) since its
about 5 degrees in Madison,'' Alvarez said. ``This is my fourth
Rose Bowl ... and I'm just as thrilled today as I was in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be someplace warm when you are in the
Midwest come Jan. 1,'' Alvarez added. ``And nothing beats this
place.''

PEPPERDINE RUINS HARRICK'S HOMECOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ Jim Harrick pulled Rhode Island out of the Sun Bowl
Tournament and dragged the Rams cross-country to face a school
where he's considered an icon.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams responded with a miserable offensive performance
paralleled by an inspired defensive effort from Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   It led to a road-weary Rhode Island shooting only 35 percent
from the field as Pepperdine held on for a 61-57 win Tuesday at
Firestone Fieldhouse in the first round of the inaugural Sparkletts
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to beat Coach Harrick,'' said Pepperdine coach
Lorenzo Romar, an assistant under Harrick at UCLA. ``You love him,
that's your mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (8-5) face Siena (8-1) in today's title game. Rhode
Island, which lost at Cleveland State on Sunday, meets winless
Eastern Michigan in the consolation game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope all the attention that was given to me didn't detract
from my team because we certainly got off to a horrible, horrible
start,'' Harrick said. ``We could never climb out of that hole. We
played fairly (well) in the second half and we couldn't generate
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because Rhode Island didn't commit enough fouls, without
question the bane of the Waves' season.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine led 38-23 early in the second half and withstood a
late Rhode Island flurry despite some of the worst foul shooting
known to mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves made 14 of 30 free-throw attempts and were a horrible
4 for 16 from the line in the final 2:04. It helped the Rams cut a
10-point deficit to 60-57 with 23.5 seconds left before Jelani
Gardner made a free throw to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine was led in scoring by Marc McDowell and Kelvin Gibbs,
who scored 13 points apiece. Gardner added 12 and David Lalazarian
had 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to come early to shoot some free throws, but it does
feel good,'' said a smiling McDowell in regards to ruining
Harrick's homecoming. ``I've known him for a couple of years and
I've had a lot of respect for him ever since his days at UCLA, so
it kind of makes you feel good to beat a team that is so well
coached.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rhode Island (6-6) is expected to rebound and contend for
the Atlantic 10 title, the win holds a more drastic significance
for Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Waves' first win against a Division I team since they
defeated Wichita State on Nov. 24. ``To be honest, this means we've
broken our losing streak for December, we're able to play in the
championship of our tournament,'' Romar said. ``And it also means
we beat a good basketball team and that we made progress.'' Though
it was important to Pepperdine's mental state heading into the West
Coast Conference season in nine days, this tournament has more to
do with Harrick's return to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He spent nine seasons at Pepperdine, won 167 games and took the
Waves to the NCAA Tournament four times. It was his springboard to
the UCLA job.
</P>
<P>
   And many members of the 1983 Pepperdine team, which lost to
eventual NCAA champion North Carolina State in double overtime of
the first round, were in attendance. Such a large contingent was
present that Harrick spent nearly 45 minutes signing autographs,
shaking hands and posing for pictures afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we would've played better,'' Harrick said. ``We knew
travel was going to be tough, but adversity breeds character.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harrick wasn't the only attraction for Rhode Island.
Representatives from seven NBA teams, including coach Del Harris of
the Lakers, were courtside to see Rhode Island sophomore Lamar Odom
be harassed, mostly by Tommie Prince, into a 5-for-15 shooting
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Odom fouled out in the final minute and finished with a quiet 19
points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends, and other people, we're like, `Who's
going to stick Odom? Who's going to stick Odom?''' Prince said. ``I
didn't say anything. I just said come to the game. They were like,
`Who's going to stick? You don't have anyone to stick him.' They
must not have seen Pepperdine play before.''

TWO KHMER ROUGE DEFECTORS APOLOGIZE TO CAMBODIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating in new 5th graf) (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ A top leader of the Khmer Rouge muttered
an apology Tuesday, saying he was ``sorry, very sorry'' for the
suffering he had caused the Cambodian people.
</P>
<P>
   His apology, in English, came only after aggressive questioning
at a news conference. At the insistence of Cambodian reporters, he
repeated it in the Khmer language: ``Knyom som tos.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leader, Khieu Samphan, repeatedly urged Cambodians and
foreigners to ``let bygones be bygones'' regarding the deaths of
more than a million people between 1975 and 1979, when the Khmer
Rouge ruled Cambodia and he was head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan, 67, who was welcomed back to society on Tuesday
with an embrace from Prime Minister Hun Sen and a trip to Phnom
Penh with accommodations at a luxury hotel, said Cambodia should
focus on the problems of the present and ``forget the past.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, King Norodom Sihanouk said he would not
grant an amnesty to Khieu Samphan or other Khmer Rouge leaders. His
decision leaves open the possibility that they could face trial in
a Cambodian court rather than the politically complex alternative,
an international court.
</P>
<P>
   A second high-ranking defector, Nuon Chea, 71, was also asked if
he had an apology to make to his countrymen. ``Actually, we are
very sorry not only for the lives of the people of Cambodia, but
even for the lives of all animals that suffered because of the
war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cambodians said the remark reflected a Buddhist pacifist
theology. They also noted that Nuon Chea referred specifically to
Cambodia's long civil war, not to the ravages of the Khmer Rouge
rule, when nearly a fourth of the country's population was killed
or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Brother No. 2'' to the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, Nuon Chea was the architect of the movement's brutal forced
evacuation of the cities in 1975. He later had command
responsibility over a wave of purges in which many thousands of
people were tortured and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Khmer Rouge were indeed responsible for large
numbers of deaths, he said: ``Please leave this to history. This is
an old story. Please leave it to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan was similarly circumspect on the question of
guilt, muttering at one point, ``To say who is wrong and who is
right and who is doing this and who is doing that, et cetera,'' and
then rephrasing: ``The developments of history in our country are
very complicated. Please don't keep stirring things up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had listened Tuesday to a foreign radio broadcast in
which Cambodians had described the losses of family members at the
hands of the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is normal that those who have lost their families, that
they _ what to say _ feel some resentment,'' he said, speaking in
English. ``But I feel that most of our compatriots understand that
we have much more problems to resolve at the present and in the
future and we have to forget the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ```Let bygones be bygones' is the best solution for
our country, because it is the only way to reach national
reconciliation. It is the sine qua non condition for peace and
stability in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge leader himself,
said the same thing on Monday in somewhat less high-flown language:
``We should dig a hole and bury the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his past assurances that he wanted and would assist in
setting up a tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against
humanity, Hun Sen said on Monday that those who surrendered should
be greeted ``with bouquets of flowers, not with prisons and
handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were indeed greeted with bouquets at their hotel
Tuesday, a diplomat said work was continuing at the United Nations
to lay the groundwork for any possible future trial.
</P>
<P>
   The surrenders by Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea virtually complete
the collapse of the Khmer Rouge movement, a process that began more
than two years ago with widening defections. Only one major figure,
the battlefield commander Ta Mok, has not given up or been welcomed
back by the government. Virtually all of his guerrilla fighters are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Khieu Samphan mostly maintained his
smile, but he was clearly distressed by a drumbeat of harsh
questions. Would he at least tell the Cambodian people he was sorry
for their suffering, a foreign reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, barely audibly. ``Sorry, very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, a Cambodian human rights worker could hardly
contain himself. ``Sorry is enough? Enough? I want to beat these
guys up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Cambodian reporter shushed him.
</P>
<P>
   But later the reporter, who had earlier said he agreed with Hun
Sen's policy of forgiveness and national reconciliation, said he
could not hold down a surge of fury when the two Khmer Rouge
leaders arrived at a luxury hotel in their chauffeured sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them, it is difficult to forgive _ very
difficult,'' said the reporter, who lost most of his family during
the Khmer Rouge years. ``It is just like waking me up when I see
them. But we have to forgive and move on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two elderly leaders, who gave up their struggle four days
ago, flew here Tuesday morning by helicopter from the western town
of Pailin, where they have begun new lives as self-proclaimed
``ordinary citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   They were treated to lunch by Hun Sen before being driven to
their hotel, where a manager said they and their families had been
booked in by the Defense Ministry at a corporate rate of $105,
including breakfast. The manager said welcome baskets of fruit and
flowers had been placed in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were joined at the lunch by Ieng Sary, the former
Khmer Rouge foreign minister, who defected more than two years ago.
He is the chieftain of Pailin, which has become an enclave for the
defecting killers.
</P>
<P>
   When a small group of Cambodian photographers were allowed to
take pictures of their meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday
morning, the photographers said they were instructed in a
threatening manner not to publish any photographs of a handshake or
embrace.

<P>
   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea arrived in the capital in a strange
political vacuum _ indeed, a vacuum of reality _ unnoticed and
unremarked as the daily life of this threadbare city surged around
them. Their defection and coming visit had been reported in the
local press, although their schedule was not disclosed in advance.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first visit here by Nuon Chea since Khmer Rouge
times, when Phnom Penh was a dead city, emptied of its citizens by
his absolutist theory of a primitive agrarian revolution.
</P>
<P>
   He walked slowly, using a polished and ornamented wood cane,
looking straight ahead and saying little.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan, one of the movement's chief diplomats, had dyed
his white hair a rich chestnut brown and seemed to want to exude a
suave urbanity. But as he left the heated news conference,
surrounded by jostling, shouting reporters and struggling security
men, his smile became fixed and even terrified.

BANK ONE BALLPARK CREW READIES FOR OZZIE &AMP; CO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Balogh stood on the field at Bank One Ballpark, watching a
team of roadies erect a giant video screen in front of the
electronic scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a big family back here,'' said the ponytailed
Balogh, a personal assistant to Ozzy Osbourne. ``And everyone is
very excited about the first show.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement seems to be the key word at the ballpark these days.
Forget Randy Johnson; the buzz inside BOB focuses on the Black
Sabbath New Year's Eve show.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of firsts are associated with the concert. For instance,
it's the first show inside our baby ballpark, still less than a
year old. It's the first show on the infamous metal band's reunion
tour. And it's the first time that apparently anyone can recall
such a big New Year's Eve event taking place in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix has not been like a mass New Year's Eve type of
town,'' said Danny Zelisko, president of Evening Star Productions,
the promoter of the concert. ``Jerry Riopelle used to be the
biggest thing we'd do on New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it is a big event. The reunited Black Sabbath features
original members Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward,
exciting news for graying metalheads everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the headliner, Arizona gets to see a collection
of other loud-and-proud bands on the bill, including Megadeth,
Soulfly and Slayer. In fact, the ballpark show is the only stadium
show on the tour; other dates will be held in arena-size venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to make it the World Series of rock,'' Zelisko
said. ``That's why we put the other bands with them. It's a special
night, and we wanted to make it extra special.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ballpark has an image that is as cleanshaven as a
Diamondback's chin. Black Sabbath isn't exactly the first band one
pictures getting booked inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rock-and-roll show,'' said Charles Johnston, president
and CEO of Select Artists Associates, the firm that books
non-baseball events into the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affords a great opportunity for the stadium district to
realize some significant revenues. And you really don't get a real
choice on what gets into a stadium. Only certain kinds of acts have
the drawing power to work a stadium. Everything has met with a
pretty positive response.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the lack of organized complaints was rather
surprising. State Rep. Karen Johnson was one who voiced complaint.
She fired off a letter protesting the show that was signed by Reps.
Mark Anderson and Marilyn Jarrett and Arizona House Speaker Jeff
Groscost. She sent the letter to the Maricopa County Board of
Supervisors, Mayor Skip Rimsza, Diamondbacks managing general
partner Jerry Colangelo and ``The Arizona Republic,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   She was shocked at the response she received.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not one little thing,'' she said. ``Not even a
little bump. Here and there a couple of people have called our
office, but it hasn't been very much.''
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of a metal marathon doesn't thrill her, it has more
to do with the setting than the sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show itself is an abomination,'' she said. ``But truly,
that's something that people are free to attend. My problem is that
it's in a taxpayer stadium. If it was a private club, I don't think
anything could be said.''
</P>
<P>
   Most negativity was directed at an advertisement that ran
announcing the concert in the Oct. 30 issue of ``The Arizona
Republic.'' The quarter-page ad met with a prickly response, due to
some provocative copy and the image of two topless children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock and roll is kind of an outrageous thing,'' Zelisko said.
``These people are no exception to the rule. We got a couple of
calls saying `tone it down.' If I had the opportunity to do it over
again, I probably would not have gone that route. But hey, Babe
Ruth sometimes struck out once in awhile, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston also heard some flak about the ad, but gave little
thought to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got those same calls when we did a church service in the
ballpark,'' he said. ``When we announced motor sports, those four
or five folks that are going to call called. It's been nothing out
of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the show is certainly out of the ordinary.
Production people arrived Dec. 17 to begin setting up the stage. So
far, 13 semis are involved, plus a team of more than 75 people from
the United States and England. The stage is 85 feet wide with
50-foot video screens on either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a New Year's event,'' said Dale Skjerseth, production
manager for the tour. ``It's going to be full-on, and we're
throwing down big time for it. We're putting everything we can into
the show, because it's a stadium show. In an arena, you have
restraints, but here, we're wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Skjerseth, who goes by the name of Opie for his bright red hair,
said there have been no problems working with ballpark people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The openness has been great,'' he said. ``It's very simple to
help someone. If they make a request, we follow it. It's all been
smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition may have been a little tougher for ballpark
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for a bunch of guys that look like pirates,'' one
security guard advised when asked for directions to the makeshift
Black Sabbath production office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through a lot of additional steps when it's the first
one of anything,'' said Bob Machen, general manager of the agency
that handles the ballpark and America West Arena. ``We've had to
talk to several other stadiums to make sure we're doing everything
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Security will be tight, with the Phoenix Police Department and a
private security firm in full force. Pat-down searches will be
performed on everyone entering the ballpark. Patrons can bring in
literally nothing other than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the guys working the show, everything not only has to be
done right, it has to be done quickly. Once the show lets out a
little after midnight, the stage has to be torn down immediately:
The National Band Championship will be held Friday on the ballpark
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be scrambling,'' Skjerseth said. ``We ``have'' to be
out. There's no questions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the guys inside the stadium will be busy, fans venturing
downtown for New Year's Eve also will have a fair share of noise
and clutter. With superstar Shania Twain making her Valley debut to
a sold-out America West Arena, expect downtown to be bustling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 50,000 people at a baseball game and 12,000 people
at a Janet Jackson show this past year,'' Zelisko said.
</P>
<P>
   People who have nightmarish images of armies of black-clad metal
fans roaming the streets are off-target, he said. More than 25,000
tickets have been sold for Black Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have that many people coming out for an event _
this is mass acceptance,'' he said. ``People who see this as an
underground thing are off-base. This is mainstream.'' &QL;

HEALTHY CURRY HAS TOUGHENED AGGIES' SOFT SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Texas A&AMP;M defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz saw
the swelling in Sedrick Curry's knee and felt a lump in his throat.
Already perspiring from the heat of August two-a-days, Hankwitz
went into a mental sweat as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big concern,'' Hankwitz said. ``When a guy's knee
swells like that, you never know. So often, they'll go in and find
more damage than they expected and the guy is out for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In Curry's case, the damage stemmed from a floating bone chip
and was removed during arthroscopic surgery. Within a week, A&AMP;M's
starting cornerback was cleared to run. Within two weeks, Curry
took part in a handful of plays during the team's 23-14 loss to
Florida State on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   During the loss to the Seminoles, A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said, it
became clear that replacement Jay Brooks, a redshirt freshman,
``wasn't ready'' to cover top-flight Division I-A receivers. So,
Curry underwent multiple rehabilitation sessions each day, in
addition to regular practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the middle of the season before I felt really
comfortable,'' Curry said. ``By the fourth or fifth game, the
fatigue wore off and I got back in the groove of things. I could
break on the ball and it all came around.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Aggies' season has come full circle heading
into the Sugar Bowl, where A&AMP;M will meet Ohio State at 7:30 p.m.
Friday in the Superdome. Just as they did in the season opener, the
eighth-ranked Aggies (11-2) will face a team many consider the
nation's most talented. Third-ranked Ohio State (10-1), like No. 2
Florida State, features a stellar wide receiver tandem that
includes All-America performer David Boston (74 catches, 1,330
yards, 13 touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   The difference?
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Aggies have a healthy Curry to place on the field
with fellow cornerback Jason Webster, the team's best cover man, in
hopes of slowing the Buckeyes' aerial circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should make a big difference,'' A&AMP;M cornerback Rich Coady
said. ``Having a tall, physical corner like Sedrick is a big plus.
He gives us someone to match up against David Boston, who's an
especially physical receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Aggies' cornerbacks can slow Boston and Dee Miller
(58 catches, 887 yards, 3 TDs) remains to be seen. But one thing is
certain: ``They're really under the microscope,'' Hankwitz said.
``Ohio State's receivers are as good as anybody's.''
</P>
<P>
   Although unheralded, A&AMP;M's cornerbacks have some credentials, as
well. Webster has led the Aggies in pass breakups the past two
seasons, with seven (1998) and nine (1997). Curry has intercepted
six passes over the past two seasons, the most among A&AMP;M players.
He has three in 1998, including a game-clincher in the fourth
quarter of a 28-21 victory against then-No. 2 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made that play against Nebraska, I knew I was back,''
Curry said. ``That was the biggest play of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, likewise, has become a believer in the abilities of his
quiet corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Sedrick Curry is what our defense is all about. He
goes about his business quietly, he plays very sound fundamentals
and he gives up few big plays,'' Slocum said. ``Jason Webster is
the same way. When you're looking on the field, you don't notice
those guys. But they've put up some great numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Webster, the numbers include 72 tackles and two
interceptions this season. Curry, who saw limited duty until the
seventh week of the season, finished with 36 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller predicted the Buckeyes would have success on quick,
underneath routes because the Aggies' cornerbacks play 10 yards off
the ball. Beating them deep, he said, would be difficult. But the
Buckeyes definitely will try.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, Hankwitz said he likes his guy's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very under-appreciated,'' Hankwitz said. ``You look at
the all-Big 12 teams, and the only guys we have are Dat (Nguyen),
Rich (Coady) and Warrick (Holdman) that got any recognition. That
speaks to our team concept. But there's no way we could have
finished with a Top 10 defense, playing the schedule we played,
without having some other pretty good individuals. I think those
two can hold their own with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Including David Boston and Dee Miller.

TENNESSEE, FLORIDA STATE FAN SITES NOT CHEESY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would seem that the key elements for a killer Web site for
Tennessee or Florida State football fans would be for the site to
play audio of Rocky Top or a Seminole war chant as soon as you
start browsing.
</P>
<P>
   So much for expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a search of the best fan-authored sites leading up to
Monday's Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., none had any cheesy
audio _ no pickin'-and-grinnin' banjo music, no politically
incorrect war chant _ blaring while you're trying to shop for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the best homegrown sites for Tennessee or Florida State
fans are, indeed, killer. Here's what one 'Net surfer found:
</P>
<P>
   Best Tennessee fan site: UTFootball.com (www.utfootball.com),
created and maintained by ardent Volunteers fan Jerry Clingan of
Houston, has the big three of quality Web design _ excellent
content, navigation and interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The site's neat design makes for easy browsing. Clingan's
nonprofit site features news updates, a discussion forum, a survey
and a Java-powered chat room.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you must, it has an audio link that plays the band
version of Rocky Top.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up: Big Orange Country (www.utvols.com) has lots of
information for Vols fans to digest. Jake Johnson, who maintains
the Nashville-based site, said his site receives more than 2
million visitors per month. Big Orange Country has news updates on
the team, its practices and recruiting. The Volboard, where
hundreds of messages are posted daily, is its most popular feature,
Johnson said. And, if you look hard enough, you'll find the
Tennessee marching band's audio of Rocky Top.
</P>
<P>
   Best Florida State fan site: Any site that calls its message
board Smack Board has the right attitude. Created by Jay Gandee of
Tampa, Fla., Go Noles (www.gonoles.net) also features a ticket
swap, electronic postcards and headline updates.
</P>
<P>
   Gandee also gives fans an opportunity to express themselves with
guest columns.
</P>
<P>
   The site is neatly designed and easy to navigate. The words to
the Seminole war chant are nowhere to be found. Thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up: Noles Central (www.talweb.com/gjcbs/fsu) does have a
link that plays the Seminole war chant. Grant Jacobs of
Tallahassee, Fla., created the site in 1994 and it includes
historical information, sound files and scores of images, several
of coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL TOSTITOS: In the continuing integration of television
and the 'Net, ESPN.com and ABC Sports plans to introduce Enchanced
TV PrimeTime Football for the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The content for Enhanced TV PrimeTime Football will be
synchronized with ABC telecast's of the game. It includes player
and team statistics updated after each play, rule and penalty
explanations and lots of trivia.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like having John Madden sitting next to you on the
couch.
</P>
<P>
   It looks fun, too. With the PrimeTime PlayerT option, viewers
can match playcalling skills against each other by guessing which
offensive player will carry the ball on the next play and the
result of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Users can access Enhanced TV PrimeTime Football at ABC's Web
sites, including ESPN.com and Bowl Championship Series Online
(abccfb.com).
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR CHAT: Texas quarterback Major Applewhite is the scheduled
guest at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday on CBS SportsLine ... San Francisco
49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice is the guest on Team NFL on America
Online (keyword: Team NFL) at 7 p.m. Wednesday.

DEION HAS CHANCE TO PLAY SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A 3,000-mile round trip to see a foot specialist
in Palm Beach, Fla., Monday night didn't determine that Deion
Sanders' sprained left big toe is ready for action. But yesterday,
the Cowboys cornerback flashed a flicker of optimism about playing
in Saturday's playoff game against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, took part in workouts yesterday, albeit briefly, for
the first time in 13 days and was upgraded on the injury report
from ``out'' to ``doubtful.'' As far as playing Saturday, Sanders
said, ``with God, all things are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bill Hamilton of Palm Beach evaluated that a magnetic
resonance imaging exam taken Monday showed some healing in the toe
and said the Cowboys' medical staff was proceeding in the correct
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to work out again today and Thursday and see how
it goes,'' said Sanders, who has missed the past 61/2 games. ``It's
a time thing. We don't have much time left \Rbecause its the
playoffs\S. We are going to pray about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he was going to approach the game
as though Sanders is not going to play. Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer
remained cautious as well, though he said having Sanders on the
field was encouraging. Sanders did some jogging, backpedaling and
side-to-side drills in a brief stint on the practice field
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is feeling less pain, but he still feels pain,'' Maurer
said. ``We have to wait until today to see how he reacts to the
workout. Then we will try to do a little more and add exercises to
help simulate what he's going to have to go through Saturday if he
is going to play. In my mind, he has to do those things prior to
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that he's antsy about playing and frustrated about
his status because the Cowboys are in the playoffs. He said he's
also troubled that some people question the seriousness of his
injury _ especially because it derailed what he has called one of
the best seasons of his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who was it's injected, it also break down joints and
tendons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could risk rupturing a tendon if we injected him,'' Maurer
said. ``He couldn't feel the ball of his foot. It would be like
injecting a broken bone.''

COWBOYS OFFICIAL HOPEFUL OF AVOIDING TV BLACKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Approximately 6,500 tickets remain available for
Saturday's NFC wild-card playoff game between the Cowboys and the
Arizona Cardinals, Cowboys officials said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   If the tickets aren't sold by 5 p.m. Friday, the telecast will
be blacked out by ABC in the Fort Worth-Dallas area. The blackout
deadline is usually 72 hours before the game, but special
concessions were made to extend the deadline because of the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys sales and promotions director Joel Finglass said the
slow sales are nothing to be alarmed about _ considering that most
teams across the league, including the Cowboys, have always had
trouble selling out wild-card games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the last day the last time we had a wild-card game
\Rin 1996\S,'' Finglass said. ``The one week between games doesn't
give you a lot of time. But I think we are going to do it before
the deadline.''
McCARTY COMES HOME
</P>
<P>
   Former Eastern Hills star and TCU standout Chance McCarty was
one of two players signed by the Cowboys yesterday to contracts for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, a defensive end, and former Southern California
offensive lineman Chris Brymer were both given two-year deals on
the first official day teams could start acquiring players for the
1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, a seventh-round draft pick by Tampa Bay last spring,
had spent the last six weeks of the season on the Indianapolis
practice squad. The 6-foot-3, 250-pounder, considered a strong
college pass rusher at TCU, plays a need position for the Cowboys,
who are still searching for a consistent pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Brymer went to training camp with Seattle and spent time on
Miami's practice squad.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur (sprained knee) remains questionable for
the Cardinals game. He participated in only rehabilitation drills
with the trainers yesterday and still has swelling in his knee.

TENNESSEE, FLORIDA STATE FAN SITES NOT CHEESY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would seem that the key elements for a killer Web site for
Tennessee or Florida State football fans would be for the site to
play audio of Rocky Top or a Seminole war chant as soon as you
start browsing.
</P>
<P>
   So much for expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a search of the best fan-authored sites leading up to
Monday's Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., none had any cheesy
audio _ no pickin'-and-grinnin' banjo music, no politically
incorrect war chant _ blaring while you're trying to shop for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the best homegrown sites for Tennessee or Florida State
fans are, indeed, killer. Here's what one 'Net surfer found:
</P>
<P>
   Best Tennessee fan site: UTFootball.com (www.utfootball.com),
created and maintained by ardent Volunteers fan Jerry Clingan of
Houston, has the big three of quality Web design _ excellent
content, navigation and interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The site's neat design makes for easy browsing. Clingan's
nonprofit site features news updates, a discussion forum, a survey
and a Java-powered chat room.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you must, it has an audio link that plays the band
version of Rocky Top.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up: Big Orange Country (www.utvols.com) has lots of
information for Vols fans to digest. Jake Johnson, who maintains
the Nashville-based site, said his site receives more than 2
million visitors per month. Big Orange Country has news updates on
the team, its practices and recruiting. The Volboard, where
hundreds of messages are posted daily, is its most popular feature,
Johnson said. And, if you look hard enough, you'll find the
Tennessee marching band's audio of Rocky Top.
</P>
<P>
   Best Florida State fan site: Any site that calls its message
board Smack Board has the right attitude. Created by Jay Gandee of
Tampa, Fla., Go Noles (www.gonoles.net) also features a ticket
swap, electronic postcards and headline updates.
</P>
<P>
   Gandee also gives fans an opportunity to express themselves with
guest columns.
</P>
<P>
   The site is neatly designed and easy to navigate. The words to
the Seminole war chant are nowhere to be found. Thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up: Noles Central (www.talweb.com/gjcbs/fsu) does have a
link that plays the Seminole war chant. Grant Jacobs of
Tallahassee, Fla., created the site in 1994 and it includes
historical information, sound files and scores of images, several
of coach Bobby Bowden.
 &LR; subheds:BYTES
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Tostitos: In the continuing integration of television
and the 'Net, ESPN.com and ABC Sports plans to introduce Enchanced
TV PrimeTime Football for the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The content for Enhanced TV PrimeTime Football will be
synchronized with ABC telecast's of the game. It includes player
and team statistics updated after each play, rule and penalty
explanations and lots of trivia.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like having John Madden sitting next to you on the
couch.
</P>
<P>
   It looks fun, too. With the PrimeTime PlayerT option, viewers
can match playcalling skills against each other by guessing which
offensive player will carry the ball on the next play and the
result of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Users can access Enhanced TV PrimeTime Football at ABC's Web
sites, including ESPN.com and Bowl Championship Series Online
(abccfb.com).
CHAT HIGHLIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Major chat: Texas quarterback Major Applewhite is the scheduled
guest at 2:30 p.m. today on CBS SportsLine ... San Francisco 49ers
wide receiver Jerry Rice is the guest on Team NFL on America Online
(keyword: Team NFL) at 7 tonight.

HEALTHY CURRY HAS TOUGHENED AGGIES' SOFT SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Texas A&AMP;M defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz saw
the swelling in Sedrick Curry's knee and felt a lump in his throat.
Already perspiring from the heat of August two-a-days, Hankwitz
went into a mental sweat as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big concern,'' Hankwitz said. ``When a guy's knee
swells like that, you never know. So often, they'll go in and find
more damage than they expected and the guy is out for the year.''
In Curry's case, the damage stemmed from a floating bone chip and
was removed during arthroscopic surgery. Within a week, A&AMP;M's
starting cornerback was cleared to run. Within two weeks, Curry
took part in a handful of plays during the team's 23-14 loss to
Florida State on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   During the loss to the Seminoles, A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said, it
became clear that replacement Jay Brooks, a redshirt freshman,
``wasn't ready'' to cover top-flight Division I-A receivers. So,
Curry underwent multiple rehabilitation sessions each day, in
addition to regular practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the middle of the season before I felt really
comfortable,'' Curry said. ``By the fourth or fifth game, the
fatigue wore off and I got back in the groove of things. I could
break on the ball and it all came around.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Aggies' season has come full circle heading
into the Sugar Bowl, where A&AMP;M will meet Ohio State at 7:30 p.m.
Friday in the Superdome. Just as they did in the season opener, the
eighth-ranked Aggies (11-2) will face a team many consider the
nation's most talented. Third-ranked Ohio State (10-1), like No. 2
Florida State, features a stellar wide receiver tandem that
includes All-America performer David Boston (74 catches, 1,330
yards, 13 touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   The difference?
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Aggies have a healthy Curry to place on the field
with fellow cornerback Jason Webster, the team's best cover man, in
hopes of slowing the Buckeyes' aerial circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should make a big difference,'' A&AMP;M cornerback Rich Coady
said. ``Having a tall, physical corner like Sedrick is a big plus.
He gives us someone to match up against David Boston, who's an
especially physical receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Aggies' cornerbacks can slow Boston and Dee Miller
(58 catches, 887 yards, 3 TDs) remains to be seen. But one thing is
certain: ``They're really under the microscope,'' Hankwitz said.
``Ohio State's receivers are as good as anybody's.''
</P>
<P>
   Although unheralded, A&AMP;M's cornerbacks have some credentials, as
well. Webster has led the Aggies in pass breakups the past two
seasons, with seven (1998) and nine (1997). Curry has intercepted
six passes over the past two seasons, the most among A&AMP;M players.
He has three in 1998, including a game-clincher in the fourth
quarter of a 28-21 victory against then-No. 2 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made that play against Nebraska, I knew I was back,''
Curry said. ``That was the biggest play of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, likewise, has become a believer in the abilities of his
quiet corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Sedrick Curry is what our defense is all about. He
goes about his business quietly, he plays very sound fundamentals
and he gives up few big plays,'' Slocum said. ``Jason Webster is
the same way. When you're looking on the field, you don't notice
those guys. But they've put up some great numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Webster, the numbers include 72 tackles and two
interceptions this season. Curry, who saw limited duty until the
seventh week of the season, finished with 36 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller predicted the Buckeyes would have success on quick,
underneath routes because the Aggies' cornerbacks play 10 yards off
the ball. Beating them deep, he said, would be difficult. But the
Buckeyes definitely will try.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, Hankwitz said he likes his guy's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very under-appreciated,'' Hankwitz said. ``You look at
the all-Big 12 teams, and the only guys we have are Dat \RNguyen\S,
Rich \RCoady\S and Warrick \RHoldman\S that got any recognition.
That speaks to our team concept. But there's no way we could have
finished with a Top 10 defense, playing the schedule we played,
without having some other pretty good individuals. I think those
two can hold their own with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Including David Boston and Dee Miller.

PURDUE TRIUMPHS OVER KANSAS STATE IN ALAMO BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He hardly looked like the Heisman Trophy runner-up
for most of the game, and his team's pre-game heartache over being
shut out of the big-time New Year's bowl games seemed hollow.
Michael Bishop and the Kansas State Wildcats were beaten on Tuesday
night by Purdue, 37-34, in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers overcame a talent gap and, finally, themselves
to win their second consecutive Alamo title before 60,780 fans _
perhaps 40,000 of them in the purple of Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's sophomore quarterback, Drew Brees, made it official
when he marched the Boilermakers 80 yards on a last-chance drive in
just 54 seconds. They were down by 34-30 but had driven to Kansas
State's 24-yard line when Brees floated a pass into Isaac Jones's
hands with 30 seconds left for the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State was still heartbroken over a 36-33
double-overtime loss to Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship game,
it had to be forlorn now. The Wildcats had scored 14 points in the
final six and a half minutes only to be thwarted by Brees (25 of 53
for 230 yards and 3 touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State (11-2) has nobody to blame for its free fall from
national title contender to the Alamo Bowl. Behind Bishop, the
Wildcats acted from the start as if they didn't want to be here.
</P>
<P>
   In going through the motions, the Wildcats collected 125 yards
in penalties _ including a fourth-quarter clipping penalty that
negated a 63-yard punt return, turned the ball over 7 times and
amassed only 308 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   And Bishop, who grew up a few hours from here in the small town
of Willis (population 3,500), hardly showed a pulse for his return
to Texas. He completed 9 of 24 passes for 182 yards with 3
touchdowns. He ran for just 7 yards on 20 carries and showed none
of the improvisational verve that made him 10th in the nation in
total offense with more than 299 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his four interceptions, a fumble and a botched
handoff that helped the Boilermakers keep the more talented team at
bay. After Purdue's long snapper, Andy Standifer, twice sent the
ball over punter Dan Rogers's head _ the second time in the third
quarter, when the Wildcats recovered for a touchdown and to narrow
the deficit to 17-13 _ Bishop and fullback Brian Goolsby muffed an
exchange in their own end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Boilermakers tackle David Nugent was there to fall on it for a
touchdown and a 24-13 lead. On the next possession, he fired an
interception into the numbers of Purdue safety Billy Gustin _ his
second of the night _ and returned it 27 yards to the Wildcats
11-yard line. It was Purdue's place-kicker, Travis Dorsch, who
nailed a 26-yarder for a 27-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kansas State mounted a 7-play, 64-yard drive finished by
David Allen's 3-yard plunge to cut the lead to 27-20. But it was
the other returning Texan who kept getting off the mat. Brees, who
is from Austin, kept scrappy Purdue (9-4) together with a nervy
performance. He set Big Ten records this season for attempts,
completions, yards and touchdowns, and finally got around to
imitating the quarterback who posted a 65 percent completion rate
and threw for 3,753 yards and 36 touchdowns against Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Brees ran three minutes off the clock as he marched the
Boilermakers 43 over nine plays. It was proficient enough to allow
Dortch to drill a 37-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   But was it enough? In Bishop's one lightning strike of the
night, he answered with an 88-yard bomb to Darnell McDonald to
bring the Wildcats within 30-27. It ignited the Wildcats and looked
as if it would let them snatch a respectable defeat from a horrible
performance.
</P>
<P>
   After Purdue stalled, the return specialist David Allen took a
punt 32 yards down to the Purdue's 27-yard line. The Wildcats ran
the ball and ran the ball. Until facing third-and-1 on the 2-yard
line, Bishop rolled, found Justin Swift all alone in the end zone
and it looked as if the Wildcats' day would be saved.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't count on Brees having one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   In an excruciatingly sloppy first half, neither Purdue nor
Kansas State demonstrated any skills to make them appear bowl
worthy. But their shortcomings were glaring for different reasons.
The Boilermakers had the look of an overachieving team trying to
press too hard.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats just looked disinterested, and that was enough to
put Purdue on top by 17-7.

MCCOWN SHOWING HE'S READY TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Texas A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown, who was
considered a long shot to participate in the Sugar Bowl as recently
as last week, completed his second consecutive full-speed practice
yesterday and moved up to No. 2 on the Aggies' depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, who started seven games during the regular season, might
see action Friday against Ohio State regardless of the health
status of starter Branndon Stewart, said offensive coordinator
Steve Kragthorpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say he has no limits,'' Kragthorpe said of
McCown, who suffered a broken collarbone Nov. 27 against Texas.
``He may have lost a little strength. But in terms of throwing the
football, he looks fine. He can play in this game, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCown sidelined, Stewart led the Aggies to a 36-33 upset
of then-unbeaten Kansas State in the Big 12 Championship Game on
Dec. 5. That performance earned Stewart, a fifth-year senior from
Stephenville, the starting nod in his final college game.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said yesterday he would not mind splitting time with
McCown in the game, but A&AMP;M coaches ``really haven't talked about''
a shared-duty situation. Kragthorpe said Stewart remains entrenched
as the starter, with McCown available in case of injury or ``if
something happens in the flow of the game that would dictate a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Punter Shane Lechler, a former high school quarterback,
continues to take snaps in practice, but has been demoted to No. 3
on the depth chart.
COOPER RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State coach John Cooper returned to New Orleans in time for
yesterday's practice. Cooper had been in Knoxville, Tenn., to
attend the funeral of his mother, who died on Christmas Eve.
Graveside services were conducted yesterday morning.
INJURY UPDATES
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen took part in his first full-speed
workout since suffering a sprained toe last week. Nguyen had seen
only limited duty in Monday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M tight end Derrick Spiller, who ranks second on the team in
receptions with 20, sat out a second consecutive workout because of
a strained hamstring. Spiller jogged on the side and ``appears to
be making progress,'' said A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum. Spiller remains
questionable.
CULTURE SHOCK
A trip down Bourbon Street with teammates provided an eye-opening
experience for A&AMP;M safety Rich Coady, a Richardson native.
</P>
<P>
   Some female revelers, at the urging of strangers, removed their
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was just a Mardi Gras thing, a once-a-year
thing,'' Coady said. ``But I guess it's an everyday thing. There
were people flashing everywhere. I don't understand why more people
don't move here.''

APPLEWHITE, NOT WILLIAMS, PUTS BIGGEST SCARE IN BULLDOGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It has been the weeklong refrain from the
Mississippi State Bulldogs that the offensive force they fear most
in the Cotton Bowl is Texas quarterback Major Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   The theory being that Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams is
going to do his thing no matter what, so why worry? Game plan: Shut
down Applewhite and make Williams win the game alone.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldogs defensive coordinator Joe Lee Dunn repeated the refrain
yesterday ... with a small qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' he said, ``I started to shelve everything and
revamp our entire defense just for this one game. The only reason
why I didn't is that some key people in the plan were injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The new plan would have had the Bulldogs lining up in a
conventional 4-3 run defense _ the better to slow down
you-know-who. But the idea was scrapped, Dunn said, ``because
frankly, we don't have a lot of quality depth on defense, so we're
better off doing what we normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Bulldogs normally do is line up in a 4-2 set with five
defensive backs, similar to the defense used by TCU coach Dennis
Franchione. It is designed for survival against pass-happy
Southeastern Conference teams like Florida and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what everyone's doing over there now,'' Dunn said.
``Seems like the teams with the hard-nosed ground games aren't that
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it's back to Plan A for Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really outstanding quarterback, especially for a
freshman,'' Dunn said, ``although I don't usually make any
distinction between freshmen and seniors. He has a lot of ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is that he throws the deep ball extremely well.
We were really impressed watching films of their game against Texas
Tech. I know they lost the game, but he threw four bombs over the
right corner's head that were really something.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a talent for timing his release when the receiver is
even with the defender, and he throws it out there long so only his
guy can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the key to the success they've had on offense this year.
They've got the most dangerous running back in the country back
there, but they wouldn't have won this much without Applewhite.
They needed him to come through for them and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dunn is entirely comfortable with the idea of trying to
stop Williams with a defense composed largely of corners and
safeties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the film, it's kind of scary watching him run
over those defensive backs,'' Dunn said, ``But I think if we hold
him to 180 yards and keep him out of the end zone, we have a chance
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played Ole Miss, their guy got about 200 yards, but he
never scored, and we won fairly easy \R28-6\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big key for us is just to know what they're doing most of
the time. Over the last five games, our defense has played really
well except for six or seven plays. We're healthier now than we
were earlier, and that's a big help.''

MISSISSIPPI LINEMAN NOT KNOCKING MATCHUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Although the Southwest Conference nostalgia
match between Texas and Arkansas failed to materialize, Kevin
Sluder figures this is something even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be a great game,'' said Mississippi State's
right defensive tackle. ``One thing I can tell you for sure, it
will be one of the most physical games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's true that we probably do look at this as the SEC
\RSoutheastern Conference\S against the Big 12, bragging rights and
all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC is tough week in-week out, but over in the other
\REast\S division they tend to throw the ball around a lot. In the
West, most of the teams seem to be a lot more physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I think the Big 12 and the SEC West are the two main
smash-mouth leagues in the nation, so this will be a good matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the thing that makes it extra special is that we are two
teams nobody thought would be here.''
SWITCH BENEFITS BULLDOGS
After growing up in California and playing two years of junior
college ball there, Edward Smith figured he needed a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to isolate myself from life in the fast lane, the
big city,'' he says. ``And I certainly picked the right spot for
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I could have found a place not quite as isolated as
Starkville, but the change has suited me fine.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-time defensive back, Smith is now an All-SEC defensive
end, and itching to get back in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been quite a year,'' he says. ``We've faced probably the
top quarterback in the country \RKentucky's Tim Couch\S, we've
played the top team in the country \RTennessee\S, and now we're
going against the best runner \RRicky Williams\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bulldogs lost to Tennessee, 24-14, Smith says the
defensive unit gained added confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was ours with six minutes left,'' he says, ``but we
were on the field for 70-something snaps and we just wore down.
Still, it proved we can get it done against anybody.''
TICKET SALES SURGING
</P>
<P>
   In eight years under Jackie Sherrill, the Bulldogs have averaged
25,000 in preseason ticket sales for a 42,000-seat stadium that is
being enlarged to ``about 51,000,'' Bulldogs athletic director
Larry Templeton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the interest has increased this year,'' Templeton
said. ``We sold 15,000 Cotton Bowl tickets in 14 hours and sold
15,900 for the SEC title game in about the same time.''

TCU'S GAME PLAN COULD BE A BIT TRICKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Look for TCU's bag of tricks to be deeper than
usual for the Sun Bowl game tomorrow against Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs coach Dennis Franchione says he's going in with a
``nothing-to-lose'' attitude and a game plan to match.
</P>
<P>
   Translated: Look for passing to increase just a bit and a few
risks to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody already told us we're not good enough to beat
them,'' Franchione said. ``How can we disappoint?''
</P>
<P>
   TCU has been listed as much as a 16-point underdog by Las Vegas
bookmakers, and Franchione figures if he's going down, then he's
going down swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione and his players also quietly harbor thoughts of
another TCU upset in a season filled with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been underdogs all year,'' Frogs linebacker Joseph
Phipps said. ``Luckily for us, the bookmakers don't actually decide
the games, or we'd have been 1-10 again.''
GOING PLACES
USC coach Paul Hackett considers a victory tomorrow imperative in
prepping for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, USC has an 8-4 mark in his first season as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, USC qualified for its first bowl game in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, USC returns a lot of talent for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett says USC now just needs a springboard to link growth
from this season to potential for next season.
</P>
<P>
   A Sun Bowl victory seems like a good link, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step is to beat TCU,'' Hackett said. ``I think this
is a very important game for us.''
EARLY BIRD
</P>
<P>
   Frogs tight end Jason Illian has grown weary of talk of his left
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had surgery less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he plans to play against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I really wasn't thinking about it,'' Illian said. ``It
feels better every day. I'm to where I don't even think about my
knee when I play.''
</P>
<P>
   He had bigger concerns yesterday, being the keynote speaker at
the Fellowship of Christian Athletes breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The problem wasn't the crowd. Illian is used to talking in front
of crowds. The problem was the time. The breakfast started at 7
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's early,'' Illian said. ``That's really early.''
TICKET TALK
Sun Bowl officials estimate ticket sales at almost 40,000 for
tomorrow's game. Stadium capacity is 51,171.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has sold a little more than half of its 8,000-ticket
allotment; USC officials estimate 1,500 of its 8,000 tickets have
been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Both schools have returned tickets to be donated to charities in
El Paso.

HITCHCOCK TRIES REST TO KEEP BUSY STARS FRESH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock gave his team a day
off yesterday in hopes of getting a little energy back.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Stars finished a run of six games in six cities
in 11 days. Included in the trip that weaved through Detroit,
Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Denver and Dallas were two days off for
the Christmas break. Because of the break, Stars players actually
made two separate trips to Dallas _ one to return home from
Toronto, then out to Denver and back home again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a brutal stretch,'' winger Brett Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said his biggest concern was that to keep the energy
in his team, he had to cancel nearly all practices. The Stars are
scheduled to practice today before playing tomorrow against the
Boston Bruins at Reunion Arena and Friday in Phoenix against the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they'll have four days off.
TALE OF TWO STREAKS
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' 12-game unbeaten streak (9-0-3) has given Hitchcock a
chance to tackle a streak of his own. Hitchcock has been selected
to coach in 11 all-star games in his career at various levels. He
has lost all 11.
</P>
<P>
   With the Stars holding the top record in the Western Conference,
Hitchcock has been selected the head coach of the North American
team for the Jan. 24 NHL All-Star Game in Tampa, Fla. It will be
the third consecutive NHL All-Star Game for Hitchcock, who lost
while coaching the Western Conference All-Stars in 1997 and the
World All-Stars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Is he worried about the streak?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about it, but I don't have much choice,''
he said. ``It's part of the legacy.''
PLAYERS RETURNED
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Brad Lukowich and forward Kelly Fairchild were
returned yesterday to the Stars' International Hockey League
affiliate in Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The two were called up Saturday to provide depth, but did not
play in either game in which they were eligible to dress.
SAVING FACE
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Nieuwendyk continues to have a firm grasp on the NHL
faceoff lead, despite the fact he has been in something of a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk has won 65.18 percent of his draws, while Mike
Sillinger of the Tampa Bay Lightning is second at 61.62 percent.
However, Nieuwendyk won only 11 of 25 (44 percent) in a 5-1 victory
against the Toronto Maple Leafs last week and won 7 of 13 (53
percent) against the Colorado Avalanche. He won 11 of 18 (61
percent) against Nashville on Monday.
HIT PARADE
Defensemen Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk combined for nine
of the Stars' 26 hits against Nashville. Hatcher leads the NHL in
hits with 106, while Matvichuk is tied for third with 97.

USC'S CLAIBORNE HAS SOMETHING ON A&AMP;M's NGUYEN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Most everybody in Texas knows Chris Claiborne
for who he isn't, not for who he is.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't Dat Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Southern California linebacker edged Nguyen for this
year's Butkus Award, given to the best linebacker in the country,
it begged the question: Who exactly is this guy?
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne can't be better than Nguyen, can he?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty amazing,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Just tune in for tomorrow's Sun Bowl game between TCU and USC
for a peek, Hackett suggests. A quick glance at Claiborne's stats
also suffices.
</P>
<P>
   He had a season-high 14 tackles in a 30-10 loss to Florida
State, prompting Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden to remark that Ohio
State's hyper-hyped Andy Katzenmoyer may be good, but Claiborne's
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played unbelievable all season, and that game he just
played better,'' Trojans defensive tackle Marc Matock said.
</P>
<P>
   His unbelievable season included 107 tackles, taking his
three-season USC total to 299, and a unanimous All-America
selection.
</P>
<P>
   He added a team-leading 16 deflections and six interceptions
this season, although, he says he's disappointed that he only had a
handful of sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something to work on, I guess,'' Claiborne said. ``I
definitely want to leave my mark at USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Stats only begin to define Claiborne, his impact usually being
as simple as his presence.
</P>
<P>
   He has size enough to flatten any guard in his path, his
6-foot-3, 250-pound frame not easily stopped. He has speed enough
to chase down a tailback, his sideline-to-sideline quickness not
easily avoided.
</P>
<P>
   He has instincts that help him find his way into almost any
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just makes every play he's supposed to,'' TCU coach Dennis
Franchione said. ``He makes some fabulous plays, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So teams design plays simply to avoid Claiborne; maybe it's two
guys assigned to block him, maybe it's a screen to stall him, maybe
it's as simple as running to where he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   So Claiborne has learned patience, learned to pursue better,
learned to play smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do what they have to do to win. If I make a lot of
tackles, they probably won't win,'' Claiborne said. ``It's a
challenge of showing I'm not just talk.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants CBS' announcers talking during tomorrow's game against
TCU, talking of his plays instead of his potential, talking of him
in postgame instead of just pregame.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne said TCU has a rushing attack much like that of Notre
Dame. ``Maybe, better,'' he said, amending himself.
</P>
<P>
   So mostly, he wants them talking of how Chris Claiborne helped
to stuff it, helped to hold them to nothing in what could be his
last collegiate game.
</P>
<P>
   He has a decision coming soon. He's good enough to be playing
for an NFL team next season. He's also eligible to play another
season in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may go,'' Claiborne said. ``I may stay.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to decide once he returns to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett called Claiborne his most important recruit for 1999 and
handicapped his chances at keeping him at around 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro football will welcome him with open arms whether it's this
year or next year,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, a West Coast secret in comparison to hyper-hyped
players like Nguyen and Katzenmoyer, hasn't remained anonymous in
NFL circles.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne had a season that prevented NFL anonymity and a Butkus
Award to prove that a few folks east of Arizona noticed, prompting
Franchione to remark that Nguyen may be better known in Texas but
Claiborne may be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how it would go,'' Franchione said of the Butkus
voting, which is done by a national panel of media. ``You hear so
much more about Nguyen because he's a local kid, but I'm on the
All-America committee and I knew \RClaiborne\S was a good player,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   A single vote separated Nguyen and Claiborne. He's hoping to
prove tomorrow that it was much more.

UCLA WINS; RUSH HOMESICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins defeated Loyola Marymount 92-67 Tuesday
night at Pauley Pavilion despite injuries, illnesses and a growing
concern about the status of freshman JaRon Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Rush did not return to UCLA from his home in Kansas City, where
he spent Christmas break. Coach Steve Lavin said personal reasons _
not a missed flight, as initially indicated _ were keeping Rush
away.
</P>
<P>
   Rush missed his Monday morning flight but was expected back that
afternoon. He failed to materialize, then did not return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be here (today),'' Lavin said. ``He's homesick.
Originally, the reason was the plane ticket, but the root was that
he was very homesick.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Earl Watson, Rush's closest friend, suffered from
homesickness last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely what I went through last year,'' Watson said.
``He will be back. He tells me all the time he's homesick. If he
wasn't coming back, he would have said, `Earl, I'm not coming
back.'''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-6 forward, Rush is UCLA's No.3 scorer, averaging 11.1
points per game, and he has played 23.6 minutes per game, second on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Rush wasn't the only player who missed the game. Freshman
forward Matt Barnes didn't play because of a sprained right ankle
and knee suffered during a Christmas-break workout. He watched in
street clothes and is questionable for the Pac-10 opener Saturday
against Arizona. Senior guard Brandon Loyd (flu) joined Barnes on
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bruins played despite lingering illness and injury.
Freshman center Dan Gadzuric, plagued by tendinitis in his knees,
sat out the pre-Christmas matchup against American. The rest
apparently helped. Gadzuric entered the game with 16 minutes left
in the first half and dominated immediately, grabbing four
defensive rebounds in seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Ray Young, who caught the flu from his brother
over Christmas, was not in top shape but played well in limited
minutes. His defense helped fuel UCLA's game-breaking 21-5 surge
midway through the first-half.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was UCLA's sixth consecutive and completed a
December sweep that has elevated the Bruins (8-2) to No. 10 in the
nation despite inconsistency, a plethora of flaws and enough health
problems to keep the medical staff working overtime. Tuesday, for
instance, Barnes wandered into football practice at noon looking
for an available trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're on schedule, but with that said, obviously there
are deficiencies,'' Lavin said. ``The biggest concerns are the
half-court defense and now injuries. We're such a beaten-up team.''
</P>
<P>
   For a chunk of the first half they also were an indifferent
team. The defense was sloppy _ Watson and Baron Davis each
committed two early fouls _ and the offense was stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have struggled against zone defenses throughout the
season, but Tuesday they sputtered against Loyola Marymount's
man-to-man. One stretch of three consecutive turnovers enabled the
Lions to snatch a 16-13 lead with 13 minutes remaining in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long _ two minutes, to be exact, at which point
UCLA's defense and athleticism took control.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward Travis Reed was the catalyst, scoring on a
variety of baskets from the low post. He muscled home a lay-in from
the right side to give the Bruins an 18-16 lead, then converted two
free throws and a dunk for a 24-16 advantage. Reed's run of 10
straight points ended when he grabbed an offensive rebound, fended
off several Lions, and made a two-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Marymount responded with a 3-pointer by Robert Davis, but
it did not slow the Bruins. Watson and Davis took turns feeding
Moiso for lay-ups, then Watson scored from underneath to extend
UCLA's lead to 32-21.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, who feels most comfortable when roaming 12 to 15 feet
from the basket, drained a jumper from the left corner and followed
a Watson miss for a 36-23 lead. Davis gave UCLA a 42-27 halftime
lead on a 3-pointer with seven seconds remaining _ his first of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The most noteworthy moment of the second half came after Lions
coach Charles Bradley was assessed a technical foul with five
minutes remaining: Lavin let Reed shoot the technical free throw. A
33.3 percent foul shooter last season, Reed has improved to 80
percent this year.

   IRVING, Texas _ Texas offensive tackle Octavious Bishop admitted
that on occasion over the course of the season, he's found it
difficult to sustain a block and resist temptation to peek
downfield and see what all the cheering was about.
</P>
<P>
   Though he usually knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blocking for Ricky Williams for four years and he
still amazes me,'' said the 330-pound senior, who anchors the left
side of the Longhorns' line. ``You tend to look up and see what he
does because you don't want to miss anything _ he's so spontaneous,
so spectacular that you never know what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there aren't any awards people give offensive
linemen. But to have a running back you blocked for win the Heisman
Trophy is going to be something I can someday tell my children and
my grandkids about. And that's something really special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting then that the Texas team rings on one side will
feature a replica of Williams' Heisman Trophy. And as Williams will
tell you, he couldn't have won it without the guys up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line has been one of the big keys to our
success,'' Williams recalled yesterday after the Longhorns went
through their last full-scale workout for Friday's Southwestern
Bell Cotton Bowl Classic against Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was a senior in high school coming to Texas
for my official visit and meeting all these big guys who were
redshirting. I knew I was going to be a freshman with them and that
I was going to play with some great linemen. It's worked out really
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, right guard Ben Adams and right tackle Jay Humphrey all
played as redshirt freshmen with Williams in 1995. Left guard Roger
Roesler was a solid backup as a freshman in '96. All four moved up
the ladder of proficiency as Williams began to emerge as one of the
country's top running backs. They were joined this season by senior
center Russell Gaskamp, who resurrected his career last spring by
overcoming a serious back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Together they have formed an offensive line that has not only
contributed mightily to the career of a Heisman Trophy runner, but
one that has also given redshirt freshman quarterback Major
Applewhite time to develop on the run and set a school freshman
passing record of 2,453 yards as Wane McGarity and Kwame Cavil set
tandem receiving records of 109 receptions for 1,862 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Ricky Williams is as good as has ever played,'' UT
offensive coordinator Greg Davis said. ``But those guys in the
offensive line have taken a great deal of pride in what he's
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have seen a lot of things over the years _ blitzes,
different looks _ and they've been the key to our success.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, a consensus all-Big 12 selection, said that
familiarity has bred success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being together most of us for 3 1/2years has been a real
positive for our football team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' front again will be eminent Friday against the
Bulldogs' moving, constantly shifting defense that features an
out-of-the-ordinary blitz package that has contributed to 36 team
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Mississippi State creates more problems than most
teams because their blitzes are not conventional in nature,'' Davis
said. ``But the first thing you see about this team is they have
great team speed. They're not as big as a lot of people we've
played, but maybe that's by design. And maybe because of that, they
move around a great deal and seldom end up where they start out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gap is accounted for, but you've got to find out who's
accountable for that gap after the snap. So you have to be sound in
all your run and pass schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   And especially in this game, Davis said, ``It's nice to have
some guys who have taken a lot of snaps together.''

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Not too long ago, Duncanville ChristWay's
girls basketball team represented a standout program among private
schools. In the 1994-95 season, the Chaparrals won their second
consecutive championship in the widely recognized Oakridge Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But the program hit its low point in the same Oakridge
tournament it dominated earlier, losing 103-0 to Oakridge on Monday
night. The Chaparrals, whose roster includes only two players with
experience in organized basketball before this season, were
eliminated from the tournament yesterday after falling 91-7 to
Rice, a school near Corsicana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my eyes on my daughter, on her face, seeing her
disappointment,'' Dari Hayes said after watching his daughter, Arin
Hayes, and her teammates Monday night. ``Her boyfriend, John
Harrison, is the leading scorer on the boys team and between the
two of us we put it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scope of world events, worse things could have
happened. As for a lifelong effect, they'll get more out of this
than any victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scope of sporting events, worse things have happened as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout is not the most lopsided in high school history, The
Associated Press reports. In Connecticut in 1924, Meriden
Washington High beat South Norwalk High, 148-0. As recently as
1972, Logan High of Ohio defeated Sugar Grove, 106-0, matching the
final score of a 1931 victory by Oklahoma's Alluwe High against
Chelsea High.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Texas schools, ChristWay's defeat was not the worst.
In 1984, Sweeny blasted Stafford, 132-2. The whopper of all
one-sided victories, however, was in California in 1982 when
Riverside Poly beat Riverside Norte Vista, 179-15.
</P>
<P>
   ChristWay's team has suffered in recent seasons, with the sport
nearly dropped last year because of low turnout. The lack of
turnout has led to six game cancellations this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 players who suited up for the Chaparrals (0-7) this
week, seven are freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   If things weren't bad enough for the Chaps, star player Kim
Memmer is out with an injured wrist. The all-district junior is
expected back for district play in early January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't at the game, but I was shocked when I heard the
score,'' Memmer said. ``I wish I could have done something.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakridge coach Chris Spurlock shared that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking that we should hold the ball, but then I
thought people would say we were going for the shutout,'' said
Spurlock, whose Owls were 10-3 heading into last night's late game
against Nolan Catholic of Fort Worth. ``Would it be better if we
beat them 87-0?''
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock also said he didn't think that telling his players to
let ChristWay score would be the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ChristWay coach Jennifer Marks agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letting us score would have been more insulting,'' said Marks,
an all-tournament player for ChristWay in the 1992 tournament.
``But they could have backed off a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock insists that humiliating ChristWay was never his
intention and that although he played his reserves more than his
starters, he tried to give all his players ample playing time in
preparation for the rest of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Jenkins, Marks' sister who plays basketball for Texas
Christian Academy in Arlington, called watching the game
``torturous.''
</P>
<P>
   While she struggled to find a solution, she seemed to hit just
the right perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has an off night,'' Jenkins said. ``And that was the
off night of all off nights.''

   ``San Dieg''o``'' &QL; 
Arizona's Cinderella ride to a lofty national ranking and the best
record in school history couldn't go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot of fun. There weren't any expectations. Just a lot
of surprises, which are never a burden.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Wildcats are at an inevitable crossroads. Was their
fantastic season a shooting star or the real thing? Fact or
fiction?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will come at an unlikely place. The Wildcats had
always thought their search for legitimacy would end with their
first Rose Bowl visit.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. UCLA made sure of that with a victory over the
once-beaten Wildcats and a loss to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Wildcats' quest for confirmation of an 11-1 record
and No. 5 national ranking will happen tonight in a second-tier
bowl, the Holiday (6 p.m., ESPN), at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Rose. Then again, the opponent isn't Wisconsin.
It's Nebraska. Even at an uncharacteristic 9-3, the No. 14
Cornhuskers possess a tradition that Wisconsin simply does not.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools have used a rare victory over Nebraska as a
springboard to another level of respect that in turn attracts
high-profile recruits, alumni dollars, season-ticket customers and
legitimate talk about a a shot at the 1999 national title. Arizona
State is just one example with one victory over Nebraska in the
1975 Fiesta Bowl and another one in the regular season two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence, perhaps, that Arizona, heretofore an
anonymous address on the college football block, has had only one
previous game with Nebraska. Thirty-seven years ago, the two
schools played to a 14-14 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Wildcats get a sec ond chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of significance, there's a lot difference between
Nebraska and Wisconsin,'' said Chris McAlister, Arizona's
All-America cornerback. ``How can you not gain respect by beating a
team with such a tradition as Nebraska's? There's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Arizona practices at San Diego State, respect has
been chanted like some mantra. It's been the theme. The Wildcats
don't believe that Nebraska has any fear of them.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's perceived lack of respect isn't hard to trace. There
are mounting signs that Arizona's record was built on a paper
tiger, Pac-10 competition.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was Arizona's inconsistent effort in a ragged 27-23
victory over California. Cal's defense looked imposing that day. A
far-more imposing Nebraska beat Cal, 24-3.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there was UCLA's loss to a Miami team that suffered a
66-13 loss to Syracuse a week earlier. Arizona was blown out in the
second half by UCLA, 52-28, in October.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there was Colorado's 51-43 victory in the Aloha Bowl over
Oregon, which was a Pac-10 contender before Arizona's 38-3 victory
over the Ducks. Nebraska beat Colorado, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, there was Air Force's 45-25 victory over Washington in
the Oahu Bowl. Arizona needed Ortege Jenkins' acrobatic flip into
the end zone to beat the Huskies, 31-28. Nebraska destroyed
Washington, 55-7.
</P>
<P>
   In bowls, the Pac-10 is 0-2 against forgettable opposition. It
leaves questions not even the Wildcats can escape completely.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the respective Washington games probably
qualifies as the greatest source of concern for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect them (the Cornhuskers) to play like that again,''
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. ``But I also expect us to play
better as the game goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of timing, Arizona might _ just might _ have an
advantage. Other than a penalty-plagued game at California, the
young Wildcats have shown consistent improvement in addition to an
intriguing mix of unselfishness and flexibility. They rarely fail
to adjust. Defensively, they face the toughest adjustment of all
against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have yet to face an option offense, which is a
Nebraska cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to mimic it with our scout team,'' Tomey said.
``But, obviously, we haven't been able to do it with the speed or
efficiency that Nebraska has. That's why I believe we'll probably
play better later in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Nebraska can return to the
dominating team that it was against Washington on Sept. 26. Since
then, injuries have been a constant problem for the Huskers, who
are making their 30th consecutive postseason appearance in bowl
that qualifies as a disappointment even in the Nebraska media
guide.
</P>
<P>
   According to the guide, Nebraska's nation-leading streak of
going to a ``major'' bowl in each of the past 17 years has come to
an end. In other words, the Holiday, quote-unquote, is not a major.
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to Arizona. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have yet to face an option offense, which is a
Nebraska cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to mimic it with our scout team,'' Tomey said.
``But, obviously, we haven't been able to do it with the speed or
efficiency that Nebraska has. That's why I believe we'll probably
play better later in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Nebraska can return to the
dominating team that it was against Washington on Sept. 26. Since
then, injuries have been a constant problem for the Huskers, who
are making their 30th consecutive postseason appearance in bowl
that qualifies as a disappointment even in the Nebraska media
guide.
</P>
<P>
   According to the guide, Nebraska's nation-leading streak of
going to a ``major'' bowl in each of the past 17 years has come to
an end. In other words, the Holiday, quote-unquote, is not a major.
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to Arizona. &QL;

STRINGS ATTACHED  
 OSBORNE'S SUCCESS HANGS OVER CORNHUSKERS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even now, despite hearing questions about it for a year, Joel
Mackovicka's voice cracks and tears well up in his eyes when he
talks about the retirement of former Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a really emotional time in the state of Nebraska,''
said Mackovicka, who grew up in Brainard, Neb., a town so small
that the high school plays eight-man football. ``It was especially
emotional for those of us from the state of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Osborne is considered a legend and probably the greatest
coach that's coached college football, not just for his wins and
losses but how he handled his players and went about his job.''
</P>
<P>
   What assignment could be more difficult in Nebraska than taking
over for Tom Osborne?
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might imagine, it is a tremendously difficult task,''
said 54-year old Frank Solich, who was asked to do just that. ``He
wore so many different hats, and he wore them all well. And
probably the one thing he did best was win football games _ 25
years of averaging around 10 wins a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That set a precedent that whoever would have taken over the
job would have thought it wouldn't be easy to maintain what he had
gotten done.''
</P>
<P>
   All Osborne had done was win at least a share of the national
championship in three of his final four seasons and compile an
87-11-1 record in the 1990s and a remarkable 255 victories in 25
years as the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Solich isn't the first Nebraska coach to go through such a
pressure-packed changing of the guard. In fact, the man best
equipped to give him some advice is Osborne himself, who replaced
Bob Devaney, who retired in 1972 having won back-to-back national
championships in 1970-71.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Devaney had a great career at Nebraska and finished off by
winning a couple of national championships right toward the end of
his career,'' Solich said. ``It was very similar to what Tom did in
winning three right there toward the end of his career. There are a
lot of similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom did tell me if ever I needed any advice, he would
certainly be willing to throw it my way. But he is the type of guy,
he almost feels awkward even hanging around the coaches offices. He
will stick his head into meetings once in a while and almost
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He intended to leave the job to me and, in his words, not
interfere. He indicated to me that was the same thing Bob did for
him, and he appreciated it. That's how he wanted to go about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne was Devaney's hand-picked successor. Solich, who had
served as Osborne's assistant head coach since 1991, was Osborne's
chosen one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did from time to time visit with Coach Osborne because he's
still with the university,'' Solich said. ``We would visit about
the problems with the team and other issues, but he went out of his
way really to make sure everybody understood it was my football
team. Yet, I know I can turn to him if I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich had a pretty good idea of what he was getting into but
did not a grasp the entire picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers compiled a 60-3 record over Osborne's final five
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska won nine games or more for 30 consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers made 29 straight bowl appearances and were in
the Fiesta, Orange, Sugar or Cotton bowl 17 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   There were 13 conference titles and appearances in every
Associated Press weekly ranking since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   And Nebraska won 47 straight games at Memorial Stadium in
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska followers are not only used to success, they're
accustomed to success at the highest level. Solich finished with a
9-3 record in his first season _ almost disastrous by Nebraska
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries mounted early and there was a drop-off from the talent
level Nebraska teams usually possessed. Texas snapped the home
winning streak at 51. There was no Big 12 title. The run of major
bowl appearances ended, too.
</P>
<P>
   A victory against a good Colorado team kept Nebraska's streak of
nine-win seasons going, and Solich got the Cornhuskers into the
Holiday Bowl, where they can gain a measure of redemption by
beating the fifth-ranked Arizona Wildcats today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I took a lot of things for granted,'' Solich said.
``There were a lot of strings. I knew about many of them, but every
week I kept reading about new strings and the possibility of those
being broken. So the pressure, as you might imagine, kind of
mounted.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, however, the Nebraska faithful never asked that
Solich's head be mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans were real patient,'' Mackovicka said. ``They're
coming to San Diego by the thousands for the Holiday Bowl to watch
us.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much to change, Solich acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't lose a single assistant coach from Osborne's staff in
the transition. The program continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was a big deal, but to us, it wasn't a big deal,''
senior linebacker Jay Foreman said. ``Coach Solich had been there a
long time before any of us. It was the same old Nebraska. We
prepare the same way, train the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching change didn't have anything to do with our losses
this year. The right plays were called. The right defenses were
called. Sometimes we didn't execute them, and sometimes it was just
out of our hands.''

AFTER 103-0 LOSS, DALLAS AREA TEAM LOOKS AT THE BIG PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK MAUCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not too long ago, Duncanville (Texas) ChristWay's girls
basketball team represented a standout program among private
schools. In the 1994-95 season, the Chaparrals won their second
consecutive championship in the widely recognized Oakridge Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But the program in Duncanville, near Dallas, hit its low point
in the same Arlington (Texas) Oakridge tournament it dominated
earlier, losing, 103-0, to Oakridge on Monday night. The
Chaparrals, whose roster includes only two players with experience
in organized basketball before this season, were eliminated from
the tournament Tuesday after falling, 91-7, to Rice, a school near
Corsicana, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my eyes on my daughter, on her face, seeing her
disappointment,'' Dari Hayes said after watching his daughter, Arin
Hayes, and her teammates Monday night. ``Her boyfriend, John
Harrison, is the leading scorer on the boys team and between the
two of us we put it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scope of world events, worse things could have
happened. As for a lifelong effect, they'll get more out of this
than any victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scope of sporting events, worse things have happened as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout is not the most lopsided in high school history, The
Associated Press reports. In Connecticut in 1924, Meriden
Washington High beat South Norwalk High, 148-0. As recently as
1972, Logan High of Ohio defeated Sugar Grove, 106-0, matching the
final score of a 1931 victory by Oklahoma's Alluwe High against
Chelsea High.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Texas schools, ChristWay's defeat was not the worst.
In 1984, Sweeny blasted Stafford, 132-2. The whopper of all
one-sided victories, however, was in California in 1982 when
Riverside Poly beat Riverside Norte Vista, 179-15.
</P>
<P>
   ChristWay's team has suffered in recent seasons, with the sport
nearly dropped last year because of low turnout. The lack of
turnout has led to six game cancellations this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 players who suited up for the Chaparrals (0-7) this
week, seven are freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   If things weren't bad enough for the Chaps, star player Kim
Memmer is out with an injured wrist. The three-time all-district
junior is expected back for district play in early January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't at the game, but I was shocked when I heard the
score,'' Memmer said. ``I wish I could have done something.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakridge coach Chris Spurlock shared that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking that we should hold the ball, but then I
thought people would say we were going for the shutout,'' said
Spurlock, whose Owls were 10-3 heading into last night's late game
against Nolan Catholic of Fort Worth. ``Would it be better if we
beat them 87-0?''
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock also said he didn't think that telling his players to
let ChristWay score would be the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ChristWay coach Jennifer Marks agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letting us score would have been more insulting,'' said Marks,
an all-tournament player for ChristWay in the 1992 tournament.
``But they could have backed off a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock insists that humiliating ChristWay was never his
intention and that although he played his reserves more than his
starters, he tried to give all his players ample playing time in
preparation for the rest of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Jenkins, Marks' sister who plays basketball for Texas
Christian Academy in Arlington, called watching the game
``torturous.''
</P>
<P>
   While she struggled to find a solution, she seemed to hit just
the right perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has an off night,'' Jenkins said. ``And that was the
off night of all off nights.''

COYOTES MUST PLAY MINUS BIG 3  
 ROENICK, DRAKE, TKACHUK OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coyotes didn't just a lose a game Monday night. They lost
their entire No. 1 line in the aftermath of a 4-2 defeat to the
visiting Los Angeles Kings:
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Keith Tkachuk will be out for at least three weeks
because of a fractured rib after getting cross checked in the back
by Mattias Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jeremy Roenick will be lost for at least a week because
of a concussion after slamming the left side of his head into the
glass during a frightening collision with Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   And right wing Dallas Drake, as expected, was suspended by the
NHL on Tuesday for his controversial boarding-major penalty on
Bodger, which occurred a few minutes after the Roenick play. Colin
Campbell, league senior vice president, ruled Tuesday that Drake
must sit out four games. He will forfeit $20,833 in lost salary,
according to the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my hearing over the phone (Tuesday morning), I thought
four games was a little harsh,'' Drake said. ``But I did hit him
from behind. He spun around and I should have stopped but I didn't.
The league's trying to cut down on things like that, and I just put
myself and him in a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The losses of Tkachuk, Roenick and Drake figure to be prominent
as the Coyotes (20-7-4) prepare for the remainder of their
four-game homestand, which continues tonight against the New York
Rangers and Friday against the rival Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes can't replace their top trio, which will force Coach
Jim Schoenfeld to shuffle all his lines in search of the right
combinations. The team did make a couple of roster moves, however,
recalling bruising left wing Louie DeBrusk from Las Vegas of the
International Hockey League and veteran right wing Steve Leach from
Springfield of the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   DeBrusk, who has appeared in two games for Phoenix, had three
goals and six assists in 24 games for the Thunder, including a
whopping 153 penalty minutes. Leach, signed as a free agent earlier
this month after being waived by Ottawa, had four goals and two
assists in 10 games for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes lost Tkachuk midway through the second period when
he was leveled from behind by Norstrom. Tkachuk, who is leading the
club with 17 goals, was camped just outside the crease when he was
hit in an unpadded spot. Norstrom was given a two-minute minor.
</P>
<P>
   Kings Coach Larry Robinson, however, said he was surprised a
penalty was called.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of play goes on 90 percent of the time in front of
the net,'' Robinson said. ``That's the price that guys in front of
the net pay for standing in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk went to the bench and briefly returned to take a faceoff
during the ensuing Phoenix power play, but he had to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, the team's leading scorer with 14 goals and 37 points,
which tied him for fifth in the league overall, took a violent
crash into the boards to the right of the Kings' net with 8:49 left
to play. He and Bodger were both trying to steer the puck when they
sailed together into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   For a few tense minutes and with the arena eerily silent, he lay
motionless on the ice as he was checked by the team medical staff.
Eventually, he was helped off the ice by teammates Rick Tocchet and
Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when a guy gets hurt, but when the two guys who get
hurt are the guys who lead the team, it's even tougher,'' Coyotes
forward Shane Doan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodger, who had just 10 penalty minutes in 24 games, said he
``didn't see anything unusual'' about the collision with Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   But he did when Drake ran him from behind about five minutes
later. Bodger went back into his zone to gather a loose puck _ and
looked both ways over his shoulders before retrieving it _ when
Drake flew into him at full force, driving him headfirst into the
boards on a clearly dangerous play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dirty hit,'' said Kings player Ray Ferraro, the first
player to muck it up with Drake after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not a suspension,'' Bodger said, ``then there's
something very wrong with the league. You can hit from the front.
You can fight me. But you can't hit me from behind. That could have
cost me my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld didn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would warrant a suspension,'' he said after
the game. ``I think from Drake's perspective, it happened very
quickly. Doug stopped and Drake already had his line of attack.'' &QL;

COWBOYS DEFENSE NOT COUNTING ON DEION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ With Deion Sanders on the sidelines, wondering,
``Mind if I play?'' his teammates have learned to successfully play
without him.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four games Sanders was unable to play or compete
because of a sprained left big toe, the Cowboys' secondary was
burned for 299.75 passing yards per game. They allowed 19 pass
plays of 20 yards or longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   But as the secondary gained experience with reserves playing in
new roles, the unit improved considerably over the past three
games. Since Dec. 13 in Kansas City, the Cowboys' secondary is
yielding 214 yards passing yards per game. They have allowed seven
pass plays of 20 yards or longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys went 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten as well as we can get without Deion,'' coach Chan
Gailey said. Cornerbacks, ``Kevin Smith and Kevin Mathis are
playing well. Charlie Williams and Larry Brown give us depth. I
feel better about our secondary now than I felt \Rin Arizona\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Arizona. Gailey's consternation came from a defensive
meltdown there on Nov. 15. Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer, whom
the Cowboys (10-6) face at Texas Stadium in a wild-card playoff
game Saturday, passed for 314 yards and two touchdowns in the
second ``half'' alone with Sanders on the bench because of his
sprained big toe.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly wiping out a 28-0 deficit, Plummer completed nine pass
plays of 20 yards or longer and scrambled to engineer touchdown
drives of 74, 60, 73, and 70 yards. Plummer has nine fourth-quarter
comebacks in his NFL career. Though he failed to add to that total
against the Cowboys, his 465 yards passing was one shy of the
record by a Cowboys' opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is expected to miss the rematch. He knows that Plummer
and wide receivers Rob Moore and Frank Sanders will use the entire
field in the pursuit of first downs and touchdowns. But Sanders is
confident that his teammates can prevent a repeat of what happened
in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the field is open now,'' Sanders said. ``Usually, the
quarterback walks up to the line with a patch over his left eye.
Now, he can see both ways. But the corners are really playing well
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The corners will need help. The Cowboys sacked Plummer three
times in their last game, but none came in that whirlwind second
half. Defensive coordinator Dave Campo might employ a ``spy'' to
trail Plummer on passing downs. But the brunt of the pass rush
duties will fall on a defensive line that has one sack this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake makes it hard on you, man, I remember the last game it
was like, `Somebody's got to get him,' '' rookie end Greg Ellis
said. ``We've got to get to him the best way we can. But we've got
to stay disciplined. If you get out of your rush lanes, Jake will
make you pay. You may think he's all the way across the field and
that you can break your lane and go get him. When that happens, he
reverses field and comes back to where you are supposed to be and
makes you look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys overcame the lack of a pass rush to win the game. In
the weeks after that, they had to adjust to more flux in the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year free safety Omar Stoutmire was replaced in the
starting lineup with sixth-year veteran George Teague before the
Dec. 6 Saints game. That game also represented the first start for
Kevin Mathis, who had missed the previous three weeks with a broken
arm. And Smith, who had missed two weeks with a strained lower
back, did not return to the lineup until the Dec. 20 Eagles game.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the stats started becoming noticeable Dec. 13 in
Kansas City. Chiefs quarterback Rich Gannon attempted 34 first-half
passes against a Cowboys secondary that had Mathis and Charlie
Williams as the starting cornerbacks. But Mathis and Williams
helped force 21 incompletions, and the longest pass play, of 20
yards, was to ``running back'' Kimble Anders. Overall, Williams
broke up two passes and Mathis three as they held Andre Rison and
Derrick Alexander to a combined six receptions for 64 yards and no
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis had played so well at left cornerback in place of Smith
that when Smith returned, the Cowboys' coaching staff moved him to
right cornerback where Sanders, when not injured, usually lines up.
Smith would not talk yesterday about how he has played lately, but
Sanders said that Smith, ``is playing better from the right side
backed off \Rthe line of scrimmage\S. It's just a different angle.
He said he breaks differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague said the chemistry among the defensive backs has also
been important in the improvement of the secondary. Mathis and
Smith better understand where Teague and strong safety Darren
Woodson are going to be in passing situations. This intangible can
only help the cornerbacks against Moore and Sanders, who have
combined for 156 receptions for 2,127 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see they are starting to feel a chemistry back
there,'' Campo said. ``They are getting more ball-hawk oriented.
And they have really played good one-on-one coverage. I expect us
to play better this time.''

<P>
   When Jimmy Waite was a kid, his favorite hockey players were
goalies. Since he is one, that only seems natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the player I ``idolized'' was Gretzky,'' said Waite, the
Coyotes' 29-year-old backup. ``He was so big when I was young. He
still is. He's the greatest hockey player ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many are bold enough to dispute that. Wayne Gretzky is the
greatest gift to hockey since Bobby Orr and Gordie Howe.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky and the New York Rangers make their only Valley
appearance of the season at 7 tonight against the Coyotes at
America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Holder of nearly 70 NHL scoring records, including most career
goals, assists and points, Gretzky isn't called the Great One for
nothing. ``Hockey'' ``News'' recently named him No. 1 on its list
of the top 100 players of all time. And word has it that the NHL is
thinking of renaming the Hart Trophy, the award he has won nine
times as Most Valuable Player, in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gretzky is all that, then why don't players beyond
pee-wee hockey choose to wear his No. 99? Isn't imitation the
sincerest form of flattery?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Waite said, ``but you'd have to have pretty big
you-know-what to wear Number 99. Nobody's dumb enough to wear
Number 99. Everybody knows it's Wayne Gretzky's number and nobody
else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. Maybe when Gretzky, who turns 38 next month, finally
walks away from the game he has changed for the better, the league
will permanently retire jersey No. 99 for posterity and principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ``should'' retire it,'' Waite said. ``Put it up in the
corner of every NHL arena.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be fitting to display it next to Old Glory, even if
Gretzky is Canadian. If anyone has helped hockey explode in
America, he's the one.
</P>
<P>
   He rejuvenated the sport domestically upon his Aug. 9, 1988,
trade from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. ``Puck''
no longer was just a four-letter word in so many football-,
baseball- and basketball-driven cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Gretzky about his contributions to the game in that sense
and you get the standard humble response, as expected from one of
the classiest fellows in the history of professional athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that any one person is bigger or more important
to the game, and I don't think one individual necessarily deserves
credit for expanding the sport the way it is,'' Gretzky said in
Scottsdale, where the Rangers have been practicing for the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the image of the game in the southwestern and southern
United States was that of a game that was violent and
over-physical. Canadian people understood there was an art to the
game, but the American image was not that.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he helped the Kings, Gretzky made it one of his top
priorities to get the word out about the NHL. Instead of gimmicks,
he took his case to the children.
</P>
<P>
   Youth hockey programs began sprouting up and down the West
Coast. In-line hockey took off. Before long, the NHL awarded
expansion franchises to Anaheim and San Jose, and existing clubs
moved to Dallas, Denver and Phoenix. Now the NHL is in Nashville,
and three more expansion teams will enter the league during the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Would it have happened if Gretzky had been dealt to, say,
Detroit or Philadelphia or Chicago, established NHL cities? Gretzky
wonders himself sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to see all these tennis courts in LA and we'd used to
say, `One day, will these things ever be used for in-line hockey?'
'' he said. ``And then about '93, when you'd drive around there,
there were signs put up by the municipalities that kids weren't
allowed to play in-line hockey on the tennis courts anymore. So
we've come full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   So has Gretzky. Last season, at 37, when the world thought he
finally was slowing, Gretzky's 67 assists tied him for the most in
the NHL. His 90 points tied him for third in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise. He's in the top 10 again this year with six goals and
29 assists in 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   No. 99 is also nine goals away from 900 in his career. Howe
retired with 801 after 26 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every goal is special,'' he said. ``I don't know if anyone
will ever get to that level, so from that point of view, it'll be
nice. I haven't thought about it a lot. If I get it, great. When I
get it, great. I hope I get it. But I don't worry too much about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he doesn't think about retirement, either. But that
could change in the coming months. Gretzky has said that when he
decides to call it quits, he'll do so before teams have a chance to
stage pregame ceremonies in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Could tonight's game be his last in Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' said Gretzky, who considered an offer to play
for the Coyotes two seasons ago. ``I like playing here too much.'' &QL;

 By JOHN LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Until the bitter end _ heavy on the bitter _ the
Kansas State Wildcats refused to settle for the Alamo Bowl. As it
turned out, the Wildcats came to San Antonio and staged their own
little Holiday Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They took a trip _ heavy on the trip _ to all the lovely places
that once danced in their heads but, as it turned out, truly did
not belong there. The No. 4 Wildcats' minds were on Miami, with
offensive linemen blocking Purdue pass rushers Chike Okeafor and
defensive Most Valuable Player Rosevelt Colvin as if sitting on
Miami Beach chaise lounges.
</P>
<P>
   Their errors were bigger than Dallas, with defensive linemen
jumping offside at all the worst times, leading to perhaps a
14-point swing in Purdue's favor. Among the untimely offside calls
was one that negated a blocked punt and another that kept alive a
Purdue scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats wobbled and staggered around the Alamodome as if it
were Bourbon Street, with receivers dropping passes like so many
Hurricanes from Pat O'Brien's.
</P>
<P>
   Even the superstar kicker, ``Mr. Automatica'' Martin Gramatica,
duck-hooked an extra point as if yanking a wedge on one of
Arizona's lush courses.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was K-State quarterback Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of places other than here Bishop and the
Wildcats seemed to want to be in the weeks since bowl bids were
passed out. They apparently went there Tuesday night, or most of
it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a kid, Bishop, who has epitomized what this Kansas
State program has become in recent years. Here was a monster player
for a monster team.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was Tuesday night, doing everything he could to
give away the game _ four interceptions and a hand in a pair of
fumbles _ then doing everything he could to take back the game. The
record will show as much.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop set one Alamo Bowl record for most interceptions in a
game with four but then carried his team to 21 fourth-quarter
points, which set another Alamo Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was down, then up, then down again. It wasn't just Purdue
37, Kansas State 34 in a shocker. It was Bishop in a shocking turn
of events _ he was being chased, and he finally was caught.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's fumbles that led to the pair of Purdue scores were
silly and inexcusable. On one, he couldn't hold on to the football.
He couldn't get the ball to running back Brian Goolsby on the
other. He also was sacked four times and pressured more than
K-State coach Bill Snyder at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Through three quarters, Bishop couldn't hit the Alamo with a
muzzleloader if he were standing on the front steps. He finished
9-of-24, but that included his marvelous fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He was so un-Bishop-like, talking trash to the Purdue sideline
when his team was down by a pair of touchdowns, barking at
officials and throwing towels and cups along the sideline when
things did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bishop made all the big runs and hit two huge passes in the
waning moments, one an 88-yarder to Darnell McDonald, the other the
go-ahead two-yard toss to tight end Justin Swift with 84 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the Wildcats would find a way to win the game. It
seemed their senses came back to San Antonio at just the right time
and, be it ever so deceiving, the 'Cats would win this game and
finish 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   But what was deceiving was the argument the 'Cats made about the
bowl system in the first place. What was deceiving was Bishop's
fourth-quarter display, which was much like what he had shown the
nation throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's Cool Drew Brees brought his team back one more time in
dramatic style with a terrific toss to Isaac Jones, who gathered it
in over his shoulder with just 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop took the field one more time as the seconds ticked away.
The K-State supporters rose. But Bishop was caught one more time,
tossing an interception on the game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   This was where Kansas State belonged after all. This was all the
opponent K-State could handle.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Alamo Bowl, a game the Wildcats deserved to lose.
And did.

<HEADLINE>
COWBOYS' SEASON WILL BE MEASURED BY CARDINALS' GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Let's just get it out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to the Cardinals on Saturday and this season would have
to be considered a huge disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   There has, however, been a lot of warm and fuzzy talk around the
team's Valley Ranch headquarters about the 10-6 record, the sweep
of the NFC East and the division title.
</P>
<P>
   A popular question/accusation in the locker room lately has
been, ``What record did you pick us to have before the season?''
Which begs the question: Have the Cowboys already exceeded
expectations for the season?
</P>
<P>
   I think not _ no matter what anybody expected before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew before the season that the NFC East would be such a
cake walk? Though it's not a surprise that a tougher schedule would
catch up to the Giants, who knew the preseason favorite Redskins
would be so awful, not to mention the Eagles?
</P>
<P>
   Once play began, it was a foregone conclusion that the Cowboys,
though 6-10 last season, were the class of the division, especially
with the guidance of a new coach, a new offense and early standout
play of Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Not to win the division this season would have been an
embarrassment. However, the Cowboys should get credit for taking
care of business in record fashion. It's hard to go 8-0 in any
division.
</P>
<P>
   But Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman has said it and so has coach
Chan Gailey: The Cowboys will be ultimately evaluated on how they
do in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And a loss to the still-lowly Cardinals shouldn't be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this statement by Cardinals vice president of player
personnel Bob Ferguson:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that good right now,'' Ferguson told the ``Arizona
Republic'' on Monday. ``The league kind of came back to us this
year and we stepped forward and seized the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   A peek at the Cardinals' season concurs. They played the
league's worst schedule. Their opponents had a combined record of
101-155 (.395). Yet, they barely made the playoffs, needing
game-winning field goals to beat the mighty Eagles (3-13), Saints
(6-10) and Chargers (5-11) in each of the past three weeks to
qualify for Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, have the Cowboys come back to the Cardinals?
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said before the season that he would
have made different decisions about the makeup of the team if he
didn't think competing for a Super Bowl was possible.
</P>
<P>
   While that might be far-fetched at this point, a loss to the
Cardinals might signal the changing of the guard in the NFC East
and result in a severely altered Cowboys roster for next year.
Godfrey shows ability Cowboys strongside linebacker Randall
Godfrey, who'll be a restricted free agent at the end of the
season, had a forced fumble and pass interception to key a strong
defensive against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   That might make a new contract for Godfrey an off-season
priority of Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The team is raving about the pass interception, in which Godfrey
trailed Redskins tight end Stephen Alexander into the end zone and
made a leaping catch.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, who is being looked at as a possible pass-rushing end
in the future, said people shouldn't sleep on his pass coverage
skills. He credited the play to his background as a basketball
player. Godfrey was the most valuable player of his high school
basketball team as a senior in Valdosta, Ga. Inside the locker room
The Cowboys' draft position for 1999 has been set _ almost. Unless
they win the Super Bowl, the Cowboys will pick either 22nd, 23rd or
24th. The actual number will be determined how they fair in the
playoffs compared to the Bills and the Dolphins. If they win the
Super Bowl, the Cowboys will pick last. . . . As the Cowboys looked
to the future by signing two players for next year yesterday, keep
an eye on two players on the roster as future possibilities. Wide
receiver Zebbie Lethridge has dazzled with his speed and improved
hands on the practice squad. And punter Toby Gowin might be a
option down the road as a kicker if Richie Cunningham leaves via
free agency. Cowboys kicker coach Steve Hoffman said Gowin has the
talent and mentality to be a good kicker.

TEXAS PLANS 10-YEAR DEAL FOR BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Texas football coach Mack Brown said program
stability is the hidden value in a new 10-year, $850,000 a year
contract being finalized by UT athletic director DeLoss Dodds.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds said yesterday he hoped to have approval for the new deal
from the UT Men's Athletic Council in the next 48 hours, though the
board of regents must give its formal approval at its January
meeting. Dodds said UT President Larry Faulkner has already
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The deal not only bumps Brown's salary by $100,000, it also
raises the salaries of offensive coordinator Greg Davis and
defensive coordinator Carl Reese by $35,000 to $150,000 annually.
Seven other assistants and assistant athletic directors Cleve
Bryant and Jeff Madden would receive raises of $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest part of it says that the University of Texas wants
us to be here a while,'' Brown said. ``But even more than that, our
assistants are going to be paid as much as anyone in the country
and that gives us a chance to keep them. And when you look at the
top programs, most have consistent staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be the best program in the country, I'd like
to have the best-paid assistants. When DeLoss came to me last week
and said what did I need, I wanted to make sure that with all the
jobs open out there our assistants wouldn't have to leave to go to
a lesser place for $5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's name has been mentioned in some NFL circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want you to say you'll never leave,'' Brown said. ``But
there's not a person in America who would say they'll never leave
anything. We're happy, things are going great, we like where we
are. We're really excited about the future at the University of
Texas. It's a fun place to be right now.''
NO YARDAGE GOAL FOR WILLIAMS
</P>
<P>
   Record-setting back Ricky Williams said yesterday he doesn't
expect to break the Cotton Bowl Classic rushing record of 265 yards
by Rice's Dicky Maegle in 1954 against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want us to win the game,'' Williams said. ``I already
have the Heisman Trophy. I've got nothing to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has enjoyed himself during the week, and attended the
Cowboys-Redskins game on Sunday. Williams did say, however, he
spent more time watching the Cowboys Cheerleaders than he did the
game.
WHERE'S THE BEEF?
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas coach David McWilliams said he hoped the Longhorns
didn't out-eat Mississippi State at the annual Lawry's Beef Bowl
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won it in 1990 and I wish we'd eaten one less prime rib,''
McWilliams said. ``We got beat \Rby Miami\S 46-3. But when someone
asked me the other day what I missed most about the Cotton Bowl
other than the game, I told them the Beef Bowl. I loved it.''

fans at the Sports Arena.

   The 8-1 Trojans roll into Pac-10 play Saturday against Arizona
State in the best shape they've been in since the 1991-92 season,
the last time they started a season 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly better being 8-1 than 1-8... we know what
winning tastes like and we like it,'' said USC coach Henry Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   For sure. Last season it took the Trojans more than four months
before they got their eighth win, against Arizona, on March 5, the
final weekend of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby will like it a whole lot more if the Trojans keep running
into outfits like Arkansas State, which looked more like The Gang
That Couldn't Shoot Straight than a team that had won three
consecutive road games.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians (5-5), co-champions last season in the Sun Belt
Conference, shot a miserable 32 percent from the field. They missed
44 of 65 shots, including all 15 of their 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't shoot the basketball in the hole,'' explained
Arkansas State coach Dickie Nutt, ``you struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians struggled, all right, and not just with their
offense. They simply could not contain USC's big Brian Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   Besides shooting nothing at all _ the Indians even missed 9 of
15 free throws _ they were soundly whipped inside, mostly by
Scalabrine. The Trojans' 6-foot-9 sophomore center from Enumclaw,
Wash., had things pretty much to himself once Arkansas State
forward Freddy Hicks got into foul trouble, which was almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 Hicks, the Indians' leading rebounder, picked up
his third foul after only four minutes and his fourth at the 10:07
mark of the first half. Scalabrine, meantime, ended up with 18
points and a career-high 10 rebounds _ his first double-double. He
also had four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian started a lot of the action,'' Bibby said. ``We wanted
to get the ball inside, and we were running some offense to get it
there. The guys responded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans got off slowly themselves, shooting just 31 percent
in the first half. But they finished the half well to open a
nine-point lead. And they quickly wiped aside any Arkansas State
comeback hopes by outscoring the Indians 26-9 over the first 9{
minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, I think that's the best we've played all year,''
Bibby said. ``We missed some layups and some wide-open shots _
maybe it was their defense _ but at the start we just didn't have
the bounce we normally have.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Lakey had 14 points, a career high, and the Trojans, bounce
or no bounce, committed a season-low 15 turnovers.

UCLA WINS; RUSH HOMESICK
</HEADLINE>
 WRITETHRU-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins defeated Loyola Marymount 92-67 Tuesday
night at Pauley Pavilion despite injuries, illnesses and freshman
JaRon Rush's case of homesickness.
</P>
<P>
   Rush has not returned to UCLA from his home in Kansas City,
where he spent Christmas break. Bruins coach Steve Lavin and guard
Earl Watson, Rush's roommate and closest friend, believe he will
eventually be back, perhaps as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   The saga has taken several turns. Monday afternoon, Lavin said
that Rush failed to return because of a snafu with his plane ticket
(Sunday) and then a missed flight (Monday).
</P>
<P>
   When Rush did not materialize Monday night or Tuesday, it became
apparent that homesickness was the underlying reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, the reason (Rush didn't return) was the plane
ticket,'' Lavin said. ``But at the root was that he was very
homesick.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush has been in constant contact with his teammates, especially
Watson, a Kansas City, Kan., native whose homesickness last year
forced Lavin to re-recruit him twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely what I went through last year,'' Watson said.
``He will be back. He tells me he's homesick all the time. But he
would have told me if he wasn't coming back. If he wasn't coming
back, he would have said, `Earl, I'm not coming back.'''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-6 forward, Rush is UCLA's No.3 scorer (11.1 points per
game) and is averaging 23.6 minutes (second on the team).
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only player who missed the game. Freshman forward
Matt Barnes didn't play because of a sprained right ankle and knee
suffered during a Christmas-break workout. He watched in street
clothes and is questionable for the Pac-10 opener Saturday against
Arizona. Senior guard Brandon Loyd (flu) joined Barnes on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bruins played despite lingering illness and injury.
Freshman center Dan Gadzuric, plagued by tendinitis in his knees,
sat out the pre-Christmas matchup against American, and the rest
apparently helped. Gadzuric entered the game early and dominated
immediately, grabbing seven rebounds in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, freshman guard Ray Young, who caught the flu from his
brother over Christmas, was not in top shape but played well in 17
minutes. His defense helped fuel UCLA's game-breaking 21-5 surge
midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was UCLA's sixth consecutive and completed a
December sweep that has elevated the Bruins (8-2) to No.10 in the
nation despite inconsistency, a plethora of flaws and enough health
problems to keep the medical staff working overtime. Tuesday, for
instance, Barnes wandered into football practice at noon looking
for an available trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're on schedule, but with that said, obviously there
are deficiencies,'' Lavin said. ``The biggest concerns are the
half-court defense and now injuries. We're such a beaten-up team.''
</P>
<P>
   For a chunk of the first half, they also were an indifferent
team. The defense was sloppy _ Watson and Baron Davis each
committed two early fouls _ and the offense was stagnant. One
stretch of three consecutive turnovers enabled the Lions to snatch
a 16-13 lead with 13 minutes remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long _ two minutes, to be exact, at which point
UCLA's defense and athleticism took control. Sophomore forward
Travis Reed was the catalyst, scoring 10 straight points on a
variety of baskets from the low post.
</P>
<P>
   He muscled home a layin from the right side to give the Bruins
an 18-16 lead, then converted two free throws and a dunk for a
24-16 advantage. Reed's run ended when he grabbed an offensive
rebound, fended off several Lions, and made a two-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was posting up hard inside, and the guards were looking for
me,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Marymount responded with a 3-pointer by Robert Davis, but
it did not slow the Bruins. Watson and Davis took turns feeding
Jerome Moiso for layups, then Watson scored from underneath to
extend UCLA's lead to 32-21.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, who feels most comfortable when roaming 12 to 15 feet
from the basket, drained a jumper from the left corner and followed
a Watson miss for a 36-23 lead. Davis gave UCLA a 42-27 halftime
lead on a 3-pointer with seven seconds remaining _ his first of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too excited at first,'' Reed said. ``We were trying to
make a home run every time down court. Coach Lavin just told us to
calm down.''

ASU SNAGS EASY WIN IN FIESTA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   December and the preseason portion of its schedule are over for
Arizona State, but the Sun Devils look as if they're just getting
started.
</P>
<P>
   ASU decisively won the championship of its Fiesta Bowl Classic
on Tuesday night, beating Division II Alaska-Anchorage, 85-52, in
front of 5,120 at Wells Fargo Arena. It was the Sun Devils' largest
margin of victory since a 111-78 victory over LaSalle in the first
round of the Classic last year.
</P>
<P>
   With Pac-10 play starting Saturday at Southern California, ASU
has won six straight, the first time that's happened since 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Bobby Lazor had 24 points and 11 rebounds for the Sun
Devils (8-4) and was named the tournament Outstanding Player for
the second straight year. Lazor became the first ASU player to do
that since Chris Sandle in 1984 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor,'' said Lazor, a 6-foot-9 senior who had 17
points in Monday's win over Navy. ``It's always nice to do things
that are positive and that people don't do too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Eddie House added 15 points and forward Mike Batiste had
13, and both made the all-tournament team. Sophomore point guard
Alton Mason, in his first year at ASU after transferring from
junior college, had a season-high 10 assists to go with seven
points.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen Kenny Crandall (seven points, seven rebounds) and Chad
Prewitt (seven points, six rebounds in 16 minutes) contributed to
the supporting cast. Crandall, a 6-4 guard from Mesa Mountain View
High School, was ASU's second-leading rebounder in the tournament
with 12.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska-Anchorage (7-4), which upset Southern Methodist in the
opening round on Monday and beat Notre Dame earlier in the year,
again played without its leading scorer, Chris Hamey. A 6-foot-5
forward averaging 17.2 points a game, Hamey sprained an ankle
during practice on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Junior guard Ed Kirk tried to make up for it, scoring 28 points,
but he had little help. Jim Hajdukovich added 13 points, and no
other Alaska-Anchorage player had more than three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many horses against too few ponies,'' Seawolves Coach
Charlie Bruns said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seawolves, held to fewer than 70 points for the first time
this season, made only 34 percent of their shots. Kirk was 9 of 18
from the field; his teammates were 9 of 35.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils shot 57.1 percent (32 of 56), only the second
time this year they managed to make at least half their shots.
</P>
<P>
   ASU outrebounded an opponent for a seventh straight time,
beating the Seawolves on the boards, 46-21. The Sun Devils now have
outrebounded 10 opponents compared with six all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has beaten tougher teams this year, but Coach Rob Evans saw
a lot that he liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we came out with pretty good intensity,'' he said.
``Sometimes there's a danger when you're playing a team such as
this that you don't come out with the intensity you've got to have.
But our guys came out defensively and really got after them,
especially in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought in the second half we came out and shut them out of
everything they wanted to run. So we can build on that. It doesn't
matter who you're playing. You've got to play against yourself. And
that's what we tried to do tonight, make sure we played against
ourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils never trailed. The Seawolves tied the game at 17
with 11:42 left in the first half and were within two when ASU went
on a 15-4 run with Lazor, Batiste and House doing all the scoring.
ASU led by 15 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the second half was all ASU and all Lazor, who
scored the first 12 points for the Sun Devils and fueled the rout.
</P>
<P>
   Lazor said the Sun Devils aren't where they want to be because
of some early-season losses, but they're getting closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep improving in practice and we're coming out in games
and executing, and that's helping us get to our goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The all-tournament team included, in addition to Lazor, Batiste
and House, Navy's Skip Victor, and Hajdukovich and Kirk from
Alaska-Anchorage. &QL;

DEION'S  BIG TOE BIG STORY IN BIG D 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ I was behind a blue pickup with Texas plates and
the word ``Shameless'' written across the tailgate _ Texans like to
name their trucks _ listening to one of those sports talk radio
shows.
</P>
<P>
   It was KBOY or some All-Cowboys-All-The-Time station.
</P>
<P>
   A caller named Duane had a question, an important one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Deion gonna play?''
</P>
<P>
   Duane sounded concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The host said that barring a miracle of biblical proportions, he
didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   In professional football, the lame are classified as being
probable, questionable or doubtful, depending upon the nature of
the affliction and the athlete's response to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Players with minor hurts are listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we all.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Deion Sanders will play against the Cardinals on
Saturday, Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey said, ``I dunno. I'd put him in
the doubtful category.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the best defensive back in pro football (just ask
him) flew to Florida in owner Jerry Jones' plane and consulted with
a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders returned to the Cowboys ranch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't practice.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country, the topic of discussion is the
president's pending impeachment trial or Saddam Hussein and his
weapons of mass destruction. Here in KBOY land, folks are
preoccupied by a much more serious issue.
</P>
<P>
   Deion's big toe.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers pray for Deion's recovery from their pulpits.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren write get-well letters.
</P>
<P>
   Deion's big toe isn't talking to the media. So local newspapers
interview the other nine. ``We're guardedly optimistic,'' one toe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Joe DiMaggio's doctors, the Cowboys medical staff provides
regular updates about Deion's condition. Deion isn't critical, but
he's doubtful, and that concerns Cowboys players, coaches and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss him,'' Troy Aikman said. ``I'm keeping my fingers
crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders sprained his toe during the Nov. 15 game against the
Cardinals in Tempe. When he limped off the field, the Cowboys were
leading, 28-0. Then Jake Plummer threw for 314 of his 465 yards in
the second half. The Cowboys held on to win, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has been out been out six weeks, limping around with a
fluffy slipper on his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last Cardinals game, the only thing newsworthy Deion
has done is get sued by an air-conditioning repairman who claims he
was seriously hurt when Deion's 8-year-old daughter ran into him
while driving a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   The episode sounds like one of those cases you see on TV's ``The
People's'' ``Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Deion may argue that the plaintiff can't be in any more pain
than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboy Charlie Waters had seven operations and played
with a Heinz variety of ailments. One season he played with a
shoulder-to-elbow-length rod in his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with a broken arm, and I played in a brace,'' Waters
recalled. But his toe injury was too much. ``I couldn't play with
the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   So Deion remains doubtful, which is good news for the Cardinals.
In their last game, Sanders baited Plummer into throwing his way,
and the All-Pro cornerback stole a pass and returned to the Cards'
2-yard line, setting up the fourth Cowboys touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is a game breaker. When healthy, no punt returner in the
NFL is more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that Sanders is out. But this is the
postseason _ prime time, money time _ and Deion loves money so much
that he wears green boxer shorts covered with dollar signs.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the story?
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather forecast is the same,'' Deion said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling any better?
</P>
<P>
   `I'm healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough to play?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prayin' on that,'' Deion Sanders said. &QL;

CARDS TIRED OF HEARING SCHEDULE BELITTLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They won't apologize for their soft schedule or playing in a
weak division, the beleaguered NFC ``Least.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't try to irritate the Cardinals, who remain the NFL's
``feel-good'' story for this week after ending the league's longest
playoff drought at 15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They know they haven't beaten a team with a winning record this
season, but they would appreciate it if you wouldn't tell
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in, and 18 other teams would do anything to be in our
position,'' center Aaron Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals opponents were 101-155 this season, a .395 winning
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The only team they played all season that finished with a
winning record was the Dallas Cowboys, who went 10-6, eight of the
victories coming over NFC East teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will try to beat the Cardinals for the third time
this season when the two teams play an NFC wild card game Saturday
at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the playoffs with what we were given,'' center Mike
Devlin said. ``We can't help what the NFL schedule is, what cards
were dealt to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Cardinals' nine victories, seven were by three or fewer
points, an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   They enter the playoffs on a season-best three-game winning
streak, but all were won on field goals by Chris Jacke on the
game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't back into the playoffs,'' Devlin said. ``We finished
9-7, and the way things panned out, we deserved to be in. Still, it
doesn't matter how you get in, just that you're in. And you know
what? We might be the team that gets the Cardinals' organization on
a roll for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who are 6{-point favorites, also didn't play the
world's toughest schedule. The Cardinals were the only team they
beat that had a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we won enough games this year to qualify,''
defensive back J.J. McCleskey said. ``It doesn't matter who you
beat, how you beat them, whether you rolled over them or barely
beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at history in playoff situations. North Carolina State
wasn't supposed to have a chance against Houston in the NCAA
(basketball) Tournament and beat them. Remember
Villanova-Georgetown in the NCAA Tournament or Memphis-Tennessee in
football last year? You would have bet your life on (the
Volunteers) in that one. . . . And, remember, we have a lot of
talent on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Jamir Miller said every time he looks at the
teams in the playoffs, ``Arizona is on the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason is because Arizona starts with `A,' '' Miller said.
``But we beat those teams others couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said he won't spend one second
worrying about what critics of the team think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about things I have no control over,'' he said.
``We played 16 games, we won nine. The NFL tells you who you play.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is we have a better record than anybody who didn't
make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Joe Greene, who won four Super Bowl rings
with the Pittsburgh Steelers, said it's absurd for anyone to think
the Cardinals don't belong in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go way back in this thing,'' he said of the playoffs. ``If
you win and are in, you deserve it. It's a disservice to anyone who
is in the playoffs for someone to say they don't deserve it. This
is a tough game. It's not easy to win. It's not easy to make the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Cardinals finished 4-12 when they had nine of
their games decided in the final minute of regulation or overtime.
Four of their first five losses were by a total of 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   They were awarded a fifth-place schedule, but last-place teams
no longer play a schedule filled with other patsies. That's because
interconference games are now scheduled on a rotating basis rather
than in order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get anything extra if the teams you beat have
winning records,'' running back Adrian Murrell said. ``You don't
get double wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice president, said he couldn't care
less if people knock the Cardinals for failing to have enough
high-quality wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that has anything to do with it, maybe we should readjust
our schedule next season,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals play eight playoff teams next season _ Atlanta,
the New York Jets, San Francisco, Green Bay, New England, Buffalo,
Miami and Dallas twice.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he is glad the Cardinals are among 12 teams still in
the running for the NFL title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Denver Broncos last year were a wild-card team and went
all the way,'' Graham said. ``It's definitely the way we're
thinking. We've worked too hard to get this opportunity.'' &QL;

JACKE HAS SIGHTS ON DALLAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost to a man, football coaches say place-kickers live in a
universe few others ever visit _ or even consider visiting.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to Cardinals place-kicker Chris Jacke and he seems
normal enough. He wears the same type clothes, eats the same food
and says the same things as the rest of his teammates. OK, there is
one thing.
</P>
<P>
   The man grew up in ``Big D, little A, double L, A, S,'' and
never liked the Dallas Cowboys, the team he and his teammates will
try to oust from the NFL playoffs Saturday _ something he did when
he helped Green Bay win the Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a big (Pittsburgh) Steelers fan,'' Jacke said Tuesday.
``So any time you have an opportunity to go down there and beat
them in front of their own people, and on national television, you
can only say it's a good opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke's mother is a diehard Cowboys fan, but his father is
partial to the Buffalo Bills, having grown up in Buffalo. Mom is
safe, but not being a Cowboys fan in ``Big D'' can get an ol' boy
branded as communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up it was like that,'' said Jacke, who has kicked
game-winning field goals on the last play of three consecutive
games. ``I didn't like that pretty-boy look and attitude the
Cowboys had. The Drew Pearsons and Roger Staubachs. They always had
that good-boy persona about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the bad boys up in Pittsburgh, and they always beat
them. I jumped on the bandwagon, I guess. I took some grief from
buddies, but there are a lot of Steelers fans down there, but
certainly not as many as the Cowboys. But I smiled a lot because
they always beat them in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Jacke, who joined the Cardinals from the hallways of
American Express in Green Bay after Week 12 of the season, would
like nothing better than to kick a fourth consecutive game-winner
and take his team into the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' he said. ``Three weeks in a row, that's enough.
If it happens, though, I think I'm ready . . . but four weeks in a
row? For the most part, I'm pleased with the way I'm kicking,
especially after being out for a year and half. The misses I've had
are correctable with time.''
</P>
<P>
   The misses he has had have all had something in common. They
were initiated from the right hashmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a problem with the right hash,'' Jacke said.
``For whatever reason, I've always had a natural fade to a ball,
and if you're on the right hash you have to bring it back a little
more. It's something I worked on today (Tuesday) and will continue
to work on the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always disconcerting when you miss. But it hasn't been
hard bouncing back because it has been during the process of a game
and I've been back out there kicking again two minutes later to win
it. I haven't had time to think or worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Long snapper Trey Junkin said Jacke's performance after such a
long hiatus hasn't surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pro and brings a pro attitude and persona to what he
does,'' Junkin said. ``I would've been more surprised if he hadn't
done what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Junkin said Jacke has done an excellent job of handling the
tough situation of being a newcomer in the locker room of a team in
the midst of a playoff drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had come in and done a lot of talking or complaining, it
would have been hard to handle,'' he said. ``But he didn't. He has
been an absolute pleasure to work with.'' &QL;

CARDINALS HAPPY TO SEE SWANN AT PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Injured Cardinals defensive tackle Eric Swann was a surprise
visitor Tuesday at practice, his first appearance at a workout in
several weeks as the team began preparations for Saturday's NFC
playoff game at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he came,'' defensive line coach Joe Greene said. ``He
wanted to come. He's one of the oldest guys (in terms of
seniority), been around a long time. He knows the importance of
this and wants to help any way he can. This is the way he can
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann, an eight-year pro, hasn't been around the team's Tempe
training facility since undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his
right knee Dec. 7 in Vail, Colo. He was placed on injured reserve
on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   He had surgery on the knee six weeks after Cardinals orthopedist
Russell Chick operated on him.
</P>
<P>
   Swann hasn't talked to reporters since his first surgery. He
refused comment Tuesday except to say he hasn't been around because
he has been rehabilitating his knee in Vail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see him,'' strong safety Tommy Bennett said. ``We
were wondering where he was. A guy gets hurt, he's usually here
rehabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Lomas Brown said Swann seemed ``more relieved,
more at peace about things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have him around, spiritually, mentally,'' Brown
said. ``I don't think anyone is mad anymore. We've learned to win
without him and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy was making as much as he was and been a leader and
is not there, sure, people are questioning things. But all the
animosity is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann, a team co-captain, was signed to a five-year, $25 million
contract in the off-season, making him the highest-paid player on
the team at the time. He played in only seven games, getting 33
tackles and four sacks. &QL;

SEIFERT MUM ON COACHING OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ George Seifert sounds like he wants to return
to coaching. The Seahawks are looking for a coach.
</P>
<P>
   But is that a scenario that adds up to the former coach of the
San Francisco 49ers becoming the new coach of the Seahawks? Or is
it just another log for the roaring fires of speculation ignited by
the firing of five NFL coaches Monday?
</P>
<P>
   Seifert, 58, was non-committal about his plans Tuesday after
meeting with Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson in Charlotte,
N.C., about that team's vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any exact plans right now. I've got some
telephone calls to make,'' Seifert told reporters at the airport
before catching a flight back to San Francisco. ``It's kind of a
zany time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Seifert also is expected to interview for the
opening with the Baltimore Ravens, who fired Ted Marchibroda, and
could become a candidate for the opening with the Seahawks, who
fired Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks did not contact any potential replacements or ask
any teams for permission to talk with coaches under contract
Tuesday, when vice president of football operations Randy Mueller
began the arduous task of researching possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still much too early to say anybody is or isn't a
candidate,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert called his discussions with Richardson exploratory,
adding, ``I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm a candidate or not a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Seifert was clear about is that he misses
coaching. He spent this season as a studio analyst for CBS Sports
after being replaced in San Francisco in 1996 by Steve Mariucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching is a way of life, more than just a position or a
job,'' Seifert said.
</P>
<P>
   Does he miss coaching? ``Oh yeah. Absolutely. Very much so,''
Seifert said.
</P>
<P>
   Is he ready to take the plunge with the Panthers, or Seahawks,
or Ravens?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to sit back and relax and talk to yourself a
little bit,'' Seifert said. ``That's where I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after firing Erickson, Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt
was not at the team's headquarters. But Erickson was.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. It makes as much sense as trying to project which
candidate will drop into which of the seven openings:
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland _ The expansion Browns have been given exemptions by
the league office to talk with coaches whose teams are in the
postseason, but not during a week when those teams are preparing
for a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   They already have interviewed Vikings offensive coordinator
Brian Billick (Monday) and Broncos offensive coordinator Gary
Kubiak (Tuesday), whose teams have first-round byes this week.
</P>
<P>
   Browns president Carmen Policy also plans to talk with Jaguars
offensive coordinator Chris Palmer and Packers quarterbacks coach
Andy Reid, but not until their teams are eliminated from the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the speculation that won't go away is and Mariucci going to
the Browns and Green Bay's Mike Holmgren taking the job as general
manager and coach in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia _ The word is that Eagles director of football
operations Tom Modrak wants Steelers defensive coordinator Jim
Haslett to replace Ray Rhodes, who was fired Monday. Haslett and
Modrak worked together in Pittsburgh, where Modrak was college
personnel director until this year.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego _ The Chargers have not begun interviewing candidates
for the job that opened when interim coach June Jones decided to
take the head coaching job at the University of Hawaii. But they
remain interested in an offensive-minded coach, and former UCLA
coach Terry Donahue, Stanford coach Ty Willingham and UCLA coach
Bob Toledo continue to be the most frequently mentioned
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore _ Besides Seifert, the Ravens also are interested in
Willingham and Rhodes. Another scenario has Billick signing with
the Ravens and then trading for Vikings backup quarterback Brad
Johnson to run the offense.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: The Seahawks will have the 17th pick in the first
round of the NFL draft. ... LB Chad Brown's 150 tackles topped the
AFC and were second in the NFL to Tampa Bay's Derrick Thomas (156).
... WR Joey Galloway's 12 touchdowns tied for third place in the
AFC with Patriots RB Robert Edwards, behind Broncos RB Terrell
Davis (23) and Jaguars RB Fred Taylor (17).

PLAYOFF BERTH WON'T MAKE, BREAK CARDS' STADIUM HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBBIE SHERWOOD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making the playoffs certainly doesn't hurt the Arizona
Cardinals' chances of getting a new stadium, but success on the
field will not make or break the Rio Salado Crossing project when
it goes to the polls in May, backers insist.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium proponents emphasize that the Cardinals would merely be
a tenant, a 12-times-a-year renter in the proposed $1.7 billion,
650-acre stadium, convention facility and commerce center in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals are not the driving force for this project,''
said Julie Pace, head of the Rio Salado Crossing Association, a
citizen and business group pushing for the project. ``Regardless of
whether they win or lose, the project should be evaluated on the
economic merits. The hotels, the restaurants, the retail and the
convention center are where we get our benefit from this project.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but success helps, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't hurt, let me tell ya,'' Pace said. ``What was so
special about the game was the whole sea of red, 71,000 fans
embracing the Cardinals as their team. If they are the anchor
tenant, that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   After reciting the project's long list of merits _ and the
team's relatively minor role overall _ Cardinals Vice President
Michael Bidwill cautiously echoed Pace's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals winning helps, but we don't know how much,''
Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Mayor Wayne Brown will tell them how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying it all year, if they make the playoffs and
win their first game, this project is a cinch,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're partway there. It's a great project without them
winning, but you saw what happened to the goal posts Sunday. We
have a bunch of crazy fans here, and it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   One major off-the-field hurdle remains, however, before East
Valley voters even get a say on the stadium issue: continued
haggling over a use agreement between the Cardinals and the stadium
district. But Brown does have recent history to back up his theory.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Denver Broncos football and the San Diego
Padres baseball franchises capitalized on monster seasons to help
push their stadium proposals through with voters. The Padres had
just come off an appearance in the World Series, and the 1998 Super
Bowl Champion Broncos were 9-0 at the time of their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way you look at this, although the stadium is only one
component, winning makes a difference,'' said Robert Brinton, head
of the Mesa Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``If we tried to build
America West Arena right now in the midst of a basketball strike,
there would be problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, winning games and winning voters are two different
things. Successful franchises such as the Pittsburgh Steelers and
the Minnesota Vikings, both of whom are no strangers to the Super
Bowl, have had their stadium proposals shot down.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   By the day of their 1996 vote, the Bucs had endured two decades
of futility, had won only five games the season before, had a
losing record at the time of the election and had gotten thrashed
two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved a stadium plan anyway.
</P>
<P>
   All the speculation about how East Valley voters will react
could be moot: Nothing is going to happen unless the Cardinals and
the Rio Salado Crossing district board move closer to a mutually
satisfying use agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Several Mesa City Council members are vowing to keep the issue
from the ballot if the Cardinals don't agree to help with operating
and maintenance expenses for the facility, put in the team's $75
million share of construction expenses at the same time as other
investors, and ease up on their desire for revenue from sporting
events that don't involve the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides will discuss their progress in negotiations at a
district meeting next week. If the district makes a recommendation,
the city councils of Mesa, Gilbert and Queen Creek have until Jan.
18 to put the issue on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the playoffs doesn't give an advantage to the Cardinals
in the negotiating process,'' Mesa City Councilman Dennis Kavanaugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to refer an issue if you still don't know how
revenue will be shared between the district and the team. The
voters won't like that no matter how many games they win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa City Councilman John Giles said he is frustrated by the
lack of progress in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like they're getting the message that the use
agreement is important to us,'' Giles said. ``The enthusiasm is
great, but if they think we're going to gloss over the details
because the Cardinals have made the playoffs, they're kidding
themselves.'' &QL;

PAC-10 RACE CONSIDERED WIDE OPEN  
 YOUNG TEAMS HAVE HAD ROUGH START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only one team ranked in the national Top 25. Postseason
perennials Stanford and Washington with conference-worst 4-7 and
3-5 records.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with Pac-10 women's basketball?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing more than an influx of young talent, overmatched
by rugged non-conference opposition, that will sort itself out in a
mostly wide-open conference race beginning this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one needs to worry about the Pac-10,'' said Chris Gobrecht,
who built Washington into a power in 11 years there and brings her
second Southern California team to Arizona State on Saturday.
``We'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From top to bottom, we're stronger than a year ago. The
conference champion could have three to five losses. There are
going to be a whole lot of teams with a whole lot of losses. It'll
be interesting and also a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rating Percentage Index, used in the selection of the
64-team NCAA Tournament and 32-team WNIT fields, supports the
``Pac-10 is alive and well'' argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rankings of the 304 Division I teams through Monday find three
Pac-10 teams (California, UCLA and Oregon) in the top 20, four
others (Washington State, Arizona, Oregon State, Stanford) in the
top 64 and none below 110. The final RPI of last season showed two
(Stanford, UA) in the top 20, three others (UCLA, Oregon,
Washington) in the top 64 and the remaining five no higher than
126.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cal, which had a league-worst 221 RPI for 1997-98 but
is coming off an 80-75 upset of previously unbeaten Colorado State
is now at 6. UCLA, despite recent losses to three-time defending
NCAA champion Tennessee and Duke, is at 7. And Oregon (19) trampled
DePaul, 86-57, after the Blue Demons had beaten top-25 contenders
Illinois and Marquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``These next few games will be very telling for our team,'' Cal
Coach Marianne Stanley said before wins over Northwestern,
Pittsburgh, Colorado State and Vermont that lifted the Bears to 6-2
going into a Tuesday night game against 20th-ranked Florida.
``We've got to prove ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of the league as a whole that through
Monday was only 4-18 against teams in this week's Associated Press
top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the league is down, just very young,'' Oregon
Coach Jody Runge said. ``A lot of people are depending on young
players to play major roles. There are going to be some growing
pains, but I'm not sure the talent isn't as good as it is
throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara VanDerveer, rebuilding Stanford after the departure of five
players to the pros, concurs. The Cardinal, with a heralded
freshman class, has been overmatched against the likes of No. 2
Tennessee, No. 8 Texas Tech, No. 17 Duke and No. 24 Santa Clara but
did take down No. 3 Purdue, 73-72, after the Boilermakers had upset
Tennessee and climbed to No. 1 for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bit off a bit more than we can chew with a young team
playing the caliber of schedule we have,'' she said. ``But by
tournament time, the Pac-10 will still get its four or five teams
in. We have to hope people are healthy and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   In order of predicted media finish, here's how the Pac-10 stacks
up in what could be only the second season of the past 11 that
Stanford does not at least share the conference title (records
through Monday night): &QL; 
 &QL; 
UCLA (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Losses to No. 1 Connecticut (113-102), Tennessee (100-77), No. 7
Notre Dame (99-82) and Duke (85-80) have done little to dim the
sense that this is the Bruins' year for their first league
championship since winning the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association in 1978-79.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA also had a close 81-74 victory over a Texas team that
held off ASU by a bucket and has had ball-handling and defensive
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our post play is very good right now,'' Coach Kathy Olivier
said of 6-foot-3 Maylana Martin and 6-4 Janae Hubbard. ``If we ever
get our outside shooting on track, we could be a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Erica Gomez missed the first three weeks of practice
to rest her sore knees after a summer with the gold medal-winning
U.S. team at the R. William Jones Cup. She, shooting guard LaCresha
Flannigan and small forward Marie Philman are being counted on to
step it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA has the best chance to be a dominating team,'' Gobrecht
said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the chance to see the Bruins comes early. They are at
ASU on Tuesday, a game moved back a day to avoid conflict with the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stanford (4-7)
</P>
<P>
   VanDerveer described her team as ``too young to be worried''
about its recent game at Tennessee, but it had to be embarrassed by
a 15-point first half in a 98-62 loss. But the Cardinal tradition
will not allow Stanford to relinquish the Pac-10 title for the
first time since 1993-94 without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Where UCLA had some success in the post against Tennessee,
Stanford's 6-6 Carolyn Moos was limited to three points.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Lindsey Yamasaki had a team-high 13 points, and 6-foot
guard/forward Lauren St. Clair added 11. Both are freshmen. The
veteran on the perimeter, junior Milena Flores, pushes the ball at
a pace that borders on being out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, especially to Yamasaki and senior Regan Freuen, have
slowed the Cardinal's progress and made the early-season
roller-coaster ride even steeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of improvement in the last month, although I
wouldn't say it's reflected in our record,'' VanDerveer said. ``Our
players understand the big picture. They know we have a lot of work
to do and enjoy the challenge of top-caliber competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has lost 14 Pac-10 games in the past decade and two in
the past four seasons. That's a lot of payback waiting to be
delivered. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oregon (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   With 6-1 forward Brianne Meharry and 6-5 center Jenny Mowe
healthy, the Ducks quickly are becoming the team to discover. As if
a program that has gone to the NCAA Tournament in all five of
Runge's seasons needs discovering.
</P>
<P>
   Against DePaul, when Oregon broke open a close game with a
51-point second half, Meharry had 19 points and seven rebounds, and
Mowe, forward Natasha O'Brien and guard Lisa Bowyer (points/steals)
also were within range of a double-double.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having some growing pains as far as the point guard
position,'' Runge said of sophomore Karen Piers and freshman
Shaquala Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Angelina Wolvert, who played extensively as a
freshman, is a reliable 6-3 forward/center who exploded for 26
points and 12 rebounds against ASU last season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Washington (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had lost four of five before a Tuesday night game
against Boise State, with the skid attributable to injuries (6-3
Amber Hall, 6-3 Carli Halpenny, 6-2 LeAnn Sheets) and quality
opponents (Connecticut, No. 21 Kansas, Florida International,
Illinois).
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the two-time Pac-10 rebounding champion with an 11-plus
average both seasons, and guard Jamie Redd are the critical pieces.
They were second (Redd) and fifth (Hall) in Pac-10 scoring last
year, combining for more than 36 points.
</P>
<P>
   After missing two games with a severly sprained ankle, Hall
played a combined 50 minutes in two games before Christmas.
Halpenny, out last season because of knee surgery, has recovered
sufficiently from stress fractures in her feet to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to get healthy and improve, we will be more
than ready for the Pac-10,'' Coach June Daugherty said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Arizona (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, too, have played a rugged schedule (losses to
Purdue, No. 5 Louisiana Tech, No. 11 Colorado State, No. 19
Nebraska) while learning to play without posts Adia Barnes and
Marte Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries claimed guard Monika Crank and forward Shontey Hambrick
for the season, and freshman guard Tysell Bozeman is redshirting as
a partial academic qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coach Joan Bonvicini thinks ``we're on the verge of being
pretty good'' and has victories over Stephen F. Austin (90-76) and
UC Santa Barbara (78-71) as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   UA is guard-oriented (Lisa Griffith, Felecity Willis, Reshea
Bristol) but is seeing improvement from junior-college transfer
posts Tatum Brown and Angela Lackey and freshman Elizabeth Pickney.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4 Brown, out of Central Arizona College, had 16 points and
eight rebounds against Stephen F. Austin; the 6-foot Lackey had 19
points in the comeback win over UCSB; the 6-4 Pickney is tied for
the team lead in scoring (13.1 ppg) and sixth in Pac-10 rebounding
(7.2 rpg).
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is at Arizona on Saturday in a telling opener for both
teams. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Southern Cal (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   Gobrecht's attempt to rebuild the Trojans has stalled because of
injuries, the most recent taking out guards Erica Mashia, Kim Clark
and Kiyoko Miller for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the injury bug that's been so content to have a home
at USC moves on,'' Gobrecht said. ``It's kind of wearing on us. The
good thing is we've learned to take things like this in stride,
keep on going and hold together.''
</P>
<P>
   USC, which hosted UCSB on Tuesday night, started 3-0 _ including
a nice win over Drake _ before losing four of five.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Kristin Clark, 6-4 center Adrain Williams and freshman
guard Tiffany Elmore are among the top 12 in Pac-10 scoring, and
Williams is third in rebounding. Freshman forward Carmen Krause of
Prescott is averaging 15.7 minutes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ASU (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   The much anticipated debut of 6-3 freshman Theresa Jantzen will
not occur at 7 tonight against San Jose State and probably not
until Jan. 7 at the soonest. She still has pain in her fractured
left foot and was to see a specialist Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jantzen could be the best player for a program that must split
in the Pac-10 to achieve its first winning season since 1992-93 and
contend for a WNIT berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Theresa back,'' Coach Charli Turner Thorne
said. ``Everything we set out to do and the realistic goals we set
were based on having everybody and not based on playing the
preseason without Theresa and definitely the Pac-10 without her.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jantzen joins 6-3 Rachel Holt and 6-2 Leah Combs in the
post, ASU has a chance to get bigger at small forward by using
Kristine Sand or Kisha White, both 6-foot, in lieu of 5-9 Leaf
Newman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils also expected to return White tonight, but she
will not regain eligibility until Saturday's game against USC. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Washington State (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   So which is it?
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars who beat Colorado, 81-76, and took Utah into
overtime in an 81-70 loss? Or the Cougars who struggled to a 75-70
victory over a Gonzaga team that lost to Washington by 35 points
and ASU by 44.
</P>
<P>
   Alke Dietel, a 6-4 sophomore from Germany, leads the Pac-10 in
scoring (20.6 ppg), and sophomore guard Tricia Lamb is tied for
third (18.1).
</P>
<P>
   With Dietel playing at forward and looking to score and 6-foot
Sheri Quinton at center, rebounding is an issue. Washington State
is last in Pac-10 rebounding margin (minus 6.3). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oregon State (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers take a league-best seven-game win streak into
conference play and are receiving votes in the AP top 25, but that
might not mean much when battle-tested Stanford comes calling
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we put together a decent schedule,'' Coach Judy
Spoelstra said, although only two of her opponents have an RPI of
64 or higher, and the others are 122 or lower. Colorado State put
the only loss on the Beavers, 79-61.
</P>
<P>
   Spoelstra hopes to coax a full season out of 6-4 Sissel Pierce
by resting her knees whenever possible. She is surrounded by four
new starters: 6-3 power forward Tammy Arnold and freshmen Felicia
Ragland and twin guards Chassie and Cherrith Wiersma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning to play defense better and better,'' Spoelstra
said. The Beavers are second in Pac-10 scoring defense (58.3 ppg)
and in scoring margin (plus 10.4). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cal (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Before facing Florida, the Bears were on their longest win
streak since 1992-93 and already had equaled their win total of
each of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, in her third season, has been successful in blending
talent left from the Gooch Foster era with newcomers such as 6-4
freshman Shavaki Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Jennie Leander and Sherisse Smith, junior Paige Bowie
and sophomores Courtney Johnson and Laura Ashbaugh have ability and
experience. &QL;

OLD-SCHOOL IDEAS PROPEL SEMINOLES 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-DEFENSE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His voice is raspy from testing its range most every afternoon
for the past five months, and his sharp tongue can cut through
inflated egos like a tender rib roast.
</P>
<P>
   Ask almost any Florida State defensive player the main reason
the Seminoles are ranked first or second in the country in four
defensive categories and they will point to defensive coordinator
Mickey Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year coaching veteran who learned the game under Paul
``Bear'' Bryant, Andrews doesn't believe the basics have changed
much since the early 1960s, when he played on two championship
teams at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``You recruit good players and you try to get a little more out
of them than they think they can give. Assignments are learned in
the classroom, and no one gets coddled on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the good coaches I've been around, they've been that way,
too,'' Andrews said. ``When you went to practice, you went to war.
The thing we try to do is do the biggest part of our coaching
inside. I don't want a guy asking me a bunch of questions when we
go on the field. It's time to work. If you don't do it right,
you're not going to get a bunch of hugs and sugar.`
</P>
<P>
   Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden calls Andrews the best
defensive coordinator in America, and it's hard to argue with the
results at Florida State, which plays Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 4. The Seminoles' rise to national prominence coincided
with Andrews' arrival in Tallahassee 1984, after a year as
defensive coordinator with the Arizona Wranglers of the USFL.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State then began recruiting better athletes for its
defense, and Andrews and his staff knew what to do with them. He is
relentless, his players say, in his demands that things be done in
a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good a player you are or who you are, he doesn't
favor anybody,'' said Cardinals defensive end Andre Wadsworth, an
All-American last year at Florida State. ``He'll let you have it in
a minute, regardless if you are a two-time All-American, so you can
respect that. He's very unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that you can't coach the '90s athlete
that way. They're spoiled, soft, can't take criticism. Andrews just
shrugs in a way to let you know he doesn't buy into that.
</P>
<P>
   The results at Florida State back him up. With mostly young,
unproven players, the Seminoles defense has been molded into one of
the nation's best. It ranks first in the country in total defense
and second in scoring defense. It is first against the pass and
second against the run. In the Seminoles' 23-12 victory over
Florida in the final regular-season game, the Gators gained only
204 yards, their lowest total in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews deflects all the credit. He praises his staff and the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just remarkable how far some of our young people have
come,'' Andrews said. ``This time last year, they weren't very good
football players. Somehow or the other, they have made themselves
good football players, and you've got to believe it's because it's
important to them.`
</P>
<P>
   It's a defense devoid of nationally known stars, and that's
become a rallying point for the players, who have found an identity
in their anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew one thing about them from the very beginning,'' Bowden
said. ``They could run. That was my biggest brag on them. They are
probably our fastest defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The question this season was how fast the youngsters would
develop. At Florida State, there rarely is much of a dropoff in
talent. Not many schools have better defensive linemen than ends
Tony Bryant and Roland Seymour, tackle Jerry Johnson and nose
guards Larry Smith and Corey Simon. The linebackers _ Lamont Green,
Demetro Stephens, Brian Allen and Tommy Polley _ are fast. And a
young secondary has matured greatly.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles are also deep, and Andrews isn't afraid to play
youngsters. His theory is that playing a lot of people not only
keeps the starters fresh, but it helps prepare for the future. This
year, the Seminoles have allowed 45 points in the second halves of
games, compared with 93 in the first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, we've lost three or four national championships around
here because we couldn't finish the fourth quarter,'' Andrews said.
``We have to have great people to do it. Your 22 ought to be better
than their 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lost titles haunt Andrews, as do all blown opportunities.
He tries to drum that into his players' heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach is not the type of coach to let you know that you're
doing a damn good job,'' cornerback Mario Edwards said. ``He's the
type of coach who makes you feel like, `OK, you made one great
play, can you make another one?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a 24-7 victory over Wake Forest, Edwards set a school record
with four interceptions, but it was the 56-yard touchdown pass
Edwards allowed that caught Andrews' attention.
</P>
<P>
   It happened when Edwards and a teammate collided when going for
the tackle. Edwards came to the sideline looking for a place to
hide, but Andrews found him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Coach, I'm going to make it up.' He said, `There's no
such thing as making up seven points!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards can laugh about it today, but Andrews made his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them right off, if winning a championship is not a
part of your life, you don't need to be here,'' Andrews said.
``You're not going to come here and eat cake and ice cream and show
up on Saturday and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to decide somewhere that it's worth all of it.'' &QL;

NO-STAR DEFENSE FUELS VOLS' DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Typically, a college football player who spends all night away
from home receiving ``massage therapy'' (wink, wink) would raise a
few eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, Tennessee linebacker Eric Westmoreland did
pull an all-nighter two days before the Sept. 19 Florida game. And
maybe more than any play this season, that event defined the
Volunteers' defense in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Westmoreland suffered a severe ankle sprain in
practice. When told his his availability for Saturday was doubtful,
the sophomore opted for drastic measures: an all-night outing in
the training room that involved a combination of ice and massage
therapy every 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tired the next day,'' he said. ``But it was worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly for Tennessee. Westmoreland played nearly every snap,
and the Volunteers beat the Gators for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the athletes today wouldn't have played,''
defensive coordinator John Chavis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the best defense, in terms of talent,
that we've had here, but it's the best in terms of chemistry and
working together. This team started out being committed to each
other, to not wanting to disappoint one another. I think peer
pressure's a great motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   For a unit that lost seven starters, the defense has been the
surprising hero in Tennessee's amazing 12-0 season. It will need to
perform similar magic Monday when it takes on Florida State in the
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers rank in the top 20 nationally in total defense
(17th), rushing defense (sixth), pass efficiency defense (17th) and
scoring defense (ninth).
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phillip Fulmer acknowledges that he was concerned last
spring. The Volunteers were missing All-America linebacker Leonard
Little, the secondary was returning only one starter and the line
was in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Starting defensive end Shaun Ellis was involved in an auto
accident the day before spring practice and suffered multiple
injuries, including a dislocated hip. Key backups Billy Ratliff
(knee, neck) and Ron Green (knee) missed the spring because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of `ifs,' '' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   They all recovered. Ellis started every game this season, and
the Volunteers got depth help from a pair of true freshmen, ends
Will Overstreet and Bernard Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee felt good about its linebackers and was confident that
Al Wilson would make a smooth transition to middle linebacker. But
what would the secondary do? Could the defense endure?
</P>
<P>
   Chavis knew the players were wondering the same thing. Before
the season, he called the defense together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew there were questions, so he gave us an identity,''
cornerback Steve Johnson said. ``He said, `Hey, we're going to be a
very aggressive defense. If you don't like it, if you don't like
getting in a receiver's face, if you don't like blitzing the
quarterback, then you need to transfer. That's the kind of defense
we're going to play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chavis calls this a no-star defense, it's hard to
ignore Wilson. The Volunteers design their defense to free Wilson
and put him in situations to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   He made his biggest mark in one of the most important games of
the season, forcing a school-record three fumbles and making 12
tackles against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   On other weeks, different players seemed to rise to the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a defense that's gone out and rolled its sleeves up
every day to work to get better,'' Chavis said. ``That's where the
uniqueness comes in. We haven't had to rely on even one or two
players. It's been somebody different each week that stepped up and
made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Auburn, Ellis' 90-yard interception return for a
touchdown keyed a 17-point first quarter. Against Georgia, the
defense forced four turnovers. Against Alabama-Birmingham, the
starting linebackers combined for 29 tackles. Against Arkansas,
sophomore Deon Grant blocked a field goal and had an interception
in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we go on?
</P>
<P>
   Against Kentucky, the defense sacked Tim Couch six times.
Against Vanderbilt, it intercepted four passes and recovered two
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeastern Conference championship game, Tennessee
rallied from a 14-10 fourth-quarter deficit and secured the victory
with a 26-yard touchdown pass that was set up when defensive end
Corey Terry forced Bulldogs quarterback Wayne Madkin to fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any respect because we really didn't have any
big-game experience,'' junior safety Fred White said. ``We had to
come out and show people that we were going to fight as hard as we
had the years before. . . . People are finally saying, `Hey, those
guys are pretty good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to be pretty good to stop a talented Florida State
offense that features one of the best receivers in college
football, Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very silky-smooth, elusive-type receiver,'' Johnson
said. ``You never know what direction he's going. He never gives
you any tendencies to pick up as to what route he's going to run.
The key is to get in his face and challenge him every route and
every pass they throw to him.''

THE ABCS OF FIESTA SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 4, 1947, Hardin-Simmons beat Denver, 20-0, in the Alamo
Bowl, which is not to be confused with the game of the same name
that was played between Kansas State and Purdue on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo Bowl of '47 died after one year, only to be revived in
1993. But this less-than-memorable game now shares a place in bowl
history with the Fiesta Bowl. Of the 776 bowl games that have been
played, counting this year, they are the only two scheduled to kick
off as late as Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear why the original Alamo Bowl picked such a late
date, although it does seem apparent that the populace of San
Antonio wasn't too receptive. But as far as the Fiesta Bowl is
concerned, it's as simple as ABC _ TV.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bowl Championship Series was put together, it was
determined that the bowl hosting the presumed title game _ the
Sugar, Orange, Rose or Fiesta bowl _ would not be played on Jan. 1
to avoid a conflict with other bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   But Jan. 2 and 3, 1999, fall on a Saturday and Sunday, which
happen to be when the NFL playoffs begin. Although the Fiesta Bowl
kickoff is scheduled for 6:18 p.m., after the NFL games are
finished, ABC wanted this game to stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a scheduling standpoint, ABC wanted separation between
this and the other bowl games, which we appreciate for a lot of
reasons,'' Fiesta Bowl Executive Director John Junker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, with ABC in the ownership role of the telecast
right, clearly they have a continuing interest in football
properties on Monday nights.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, consider the Fiesta Bowl an extension of
``Monday Night'' ``Football''.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created a tremendous franchise in terms of viewership,
beyond just football viewers,'' Junker said. ``The numbers always
show that. Their numbers are extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Junker also noted that the NCAA basketball championship always
is played on a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been proven that Monday night does very well for
collegiate events,'' he said. ``All those things combined is why
we're on January 4. It fit this year.''

JOB SATISFACTION  
 AIDES: NO GREENER PASTURE THAN FLORIDA ST. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are the fast, skilled athletes, a head coach who
simultaneously accumulates success and friends, and let's not
forget the original Tomahawk Chop.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State means all that, not to mention the double-digit
victories each year and Top 4 poll finishes and bowl game wins that
are as inevitable as a New Year's hangover.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most unique aspect of the program, and one of
the cogent explanations for its success, lies less visible. Players
come and go, sometimes during the same season. The Seminoles are on
their third quarterback this year. The coaches, however, remain.
Probably no other staff in the nation enjoys the same longevity and
continuity. Popes have less job security.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it takes great players. But communication, knowledge of
each other and what to expect, and knowing how things are done
without having to ask provide one more edge that makes Florida
State, well, Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to reinvent the wheel every year,'' running
backs coach Billy Sexton said. ``When you get that familiarity on
how to solve problems, it's such a time saver.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's coaches are as much part of the Tallahassee
landscape as Spanish moss, and just as enduring. During head Coach
Bobby Bowden's first season, 1976, Memphis State beat the Seminoles
and Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford. But in continuous service,
defensive ends coach Jim Gladden has even Bowden beat. Retained
from the previous staff, Gladden is in his 24th year at Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   This is Sexton's 23rd year at Florida State. It's 17 years for
linebackers coach and assistant head coach Chuck Amato, 15 for
defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews and 13 apiece for offensive
coordinator Mark Richt and offensive line coach Jimmy Heggins.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to these guys, the wide receivers coach would need a
name tag if he wasn't the head coach's son. Jeff Bowden has been an
assistant for a relatively modest five years. So has defensive line
coach Odell Haggins who, along with Heggins and Jeff Bowden, played
for Bobby Bowden. John Lilly, the tight ends coach, might still
need a map to get around campus. This is only his fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   It averages out to more than 13 years for each coach. The staff
has remained intact since four assistants, including offensive
coordinator Brad Scott, left after the 1993 national championship
season.
</P>
<P>
   Scott became head coach at South Carolina and was just fired,
replaced by Lou Holtz. He never got the Gamecocks program
untracked, reinforcing the belief that unless another situation is
clearly better, why leave? As Gladden put it, ``The grass may be
greener on the other side of the fence, but when you get over
there, you realize you still have to cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladden likes the view from his side of the fence. When he first
came to Florida State in 1975 as a graduate assistant under Darrell
Mudra, he figured he'd spend a few years there and ``climb the
normal ladder of progression.'' But the schools suited his young
children, and Tallahassee proved to be a nice place to live for the
Springfield, Mo., native.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great place,'' Gladden said. ``It's got a small-town
atmosphere. It's kind of a warm and fuzzy place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton, who grew up in Tallahassee before going to Alabama, only
to transfer back to Florida State and play quarterback for half of
the 1973 season, didn't need to be sold on the place. ``It's the
simple things, really, and this is just a good working
environment,'' he said. ``You're obviously at a place where you can
recruit athletes that give you a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has evolved into an elite program, and Gladden
said he now can now walk into the home of any athlete in the
country ``and at least get his attention.'' But the state of
Florida is such a fertile recruiting field, coaches step into the
back yard and pluck athletes like grapefruits off a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very strategic place,'' Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Bowden factor. Folksy and affable to outsiders
and the media, Bowden is a somewhat more forceful, demanding leader
than the public perception. His one vote outweighs all the others.
But he delegates responsibility and trusts his assistants, who
describe him in terms we all wish we could apply to our bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with Coach Bowden,'' Sexton said, ``He just
treats you like a professional.''

IN THE HOT SEAT  
 ALL EYES WILL BE ON SANDERS' OFFENSIVE DEBUT

<P>
   Randy Sanders need only stare across the field Monday to fully
digest the degree that his life has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was being recruited out of high school, one of the top
coordinators in the country was Mickey Andrews,'' Sanders said of
Florida State's defensive coordinator. ``Here I am coaching my
first game against him. He's been doing this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was named Tennessee's offensive coordinator on Dec. 18
when David Cutcliffe left to take the head job at Mississippi.
Pretty heady stuff for a 33-year-old who has spent his entire
playing and coaching career with the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And what a debut. He gets to square off with the top-ranked
defense in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you draw up the perfect scenario, this isn't exactly what
you draw up,'' he said. ``But it's also a great challenge. Going
against the Number 1 defense in the country, you get everyone's
intensity and everyone's attention. Players will probably study and
work a little harder. It's a hard way to start and a great way to
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll forever be linked to it, no doubt about that. But if we
win and then go 0-11 next year, I'll still get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Auburn Coach Terry Bowden, in the Valley to watch his
father, Bobby, coach Florida State, believes Sanders' performance
will be one of the keys to the game Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a way to debut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' promotion is a product of his success as the team's
running backs coach and recruiting coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he helped tailback Jamal Lewis rush for 1,364 yards
and earn national Freshman of the Year honors. When Lewis suffered
a knee injury against Auburn this year and was lost for the season,
Sanders helped keep the offense balanced thanks to the development
of Travis Henry and Travis Stephens. Tennessee ended up leading the
Southeastern Conference in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over as recruiting coordinator in 1994, the
Volunteers' classes have ranked among the best.
</P>
<P>
   How much will this matter Monday? Not much, except that he
already has the respect of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Cutcliffe was really serious all the time and had a
knack of rubbing in a mistake too much, to the point you almost
didn't want to practice any more,'' quarterback Tee Martin said.
``Coach Sanders is more like your favorite teacher in high school.
You can talk to him, but you still have respect for his job. . . .
He just handles it in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders grew up near Knoxville, Tenn., and was a standout
quarterback at Morristown East High School. He attended Tennessee
but primarily was a backup. He served as a volunteer coach and
graduate assistant for several seasons before being hired full time
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He worked closely with Cutcliffe, who had been on the staff
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our philosophies are very similar,'' he said. ``I
think that's why David and I had such a compatible working
relationship. I kind of knew what he was thinking, he kind of knew
what I was thinking. It made it good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, I'm not David Cutcliffe and I don't want to be
David Cutcliffe. I'm going to do what I do within the framework of
what Phillip wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders insists fans won't notice a dramatic difference in the
offense Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to suddenly start running the option or lining
up in the wishbone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Head Coach Phil Fulmer, too, insists he's not concerned. The
head coach said he doesn't remember much about his first game as an
offensive coordinator, although ``it wasn't a national championship
game against the Number 1 team in the country,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy will be fine,'' Fulmer said. ``It's so much a team
effort and a staff effort. If I had any concerns, I wouldn't have
done it. I'm confident he'll do as well as anyone can do against
the Florida State defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. The Seminoles allow just 214.8 yards per game,
which is 42.9 yards less than second-place Ohio State. The defense
is also No. 1 against the pass and second against the run and
score.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is you attack their weakness,'' Sanders said.
``I just haven't found a weakness yet. We just have to go out
there, be ourselves and do what has won us games and then be ready
to adjust.''

TENN. FOOTBALL: IT'S A WAY OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - ``T'' is for tradition, a place where they
write poems about their athletes, live for their athletes, stand in
line for hours just to see their athletes walk to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``T'' is for titanic, a great big ship of a stadium resting on
the Tennessee River, second-biggest of its kind and never an empty
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``T'' is for traitor, anyone who doesn't have an orange ``T''
somewhere on their automobile or article of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``T'' is for tourist, a person who emerges from a tiny airport
and finds an athletic factory in the foothills of the Smoky
Mountains, a city that has created the perfect haven for
impressionable high school kids possessing the most important ``T''
of all.
</P>
<P>
   Talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an athlete, there's no place on earth better than
this place,'' said University of Tennessee quarterback, last name
Martin, first name . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tee, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the mall, and I hear people cheer,'' he said.
``Sometimes I feel like I'm in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand one city's love affair with its football team is
to understand there are three Tennessees: Memphis, the western hub,
caretaker of Elvis; Nashville, considered the cosmopolitan center,
home of country music; and Knoxville, the eastern town blessed by
the paintbrush of God.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, in the latter, that a city stakes its image and
reputation on the Volunteers, a program that is the biggest source
of civic pride, the response for all the backwater jokes.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive in Arizona, searching for their first national
championship since 1951. But they have been a phenomenon in college
football for over half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different than any place I've ever been,'' said Mike
Barry, a first-year offensive line coach, a veteran whose career
stops include Arizona and USC. ``The tradition and magnitude of
football is incredible. I try to keep a low profile, but I get
stopped in grocery stores, stopped in airports, because I'm wearing
orange. The best way and the easiest way to say it is it's a way of
life here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee football began in 1891, emerged under the direction of
Gen. Robert Neyland, a coach for 26 years and a visionary who twice
left for military duty. In 1968, it produced the first Black player
to suit up for a varsity game in the Southeastern Conference. In
1977, Johnny Majors took over after winning a national championship
in Pittsburgh, adopting a rallying cry of ``Follow Me To
Tennessee.'' And in 1998, a big ol' ex-offensive lineman named Phil
Fulmer has them on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are _ spoiled is not the right word _ but people
have high expectations,'' Fulmer said. ``I think we created a lot
of those expectations, almost to the point where we've created a
monster. And it would be very gratifying, very satisfying to top
this off with a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, it's never been about championships. This is an
unconditional love affair, where competitiveness and a bowl game is
all that's really required.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Tennessee hosted the largest crowd ever to see a
college game, a gathering of 107,608. In 1997, it posted the
highest average attendance in college history _ a whopping 106,538.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, 73,000 people showed up for a spring game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all those people inside, and it blows your mind,''
Martin said. ``And then you realize there are still more outside
the stadium who can't get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance that is simply staggering. Or, as a sign in town
contends, ``Michigan _ Ours Is Bigger Than Yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, you're going to get over 100,000 people,''
said Arizona Cardinals safety J.J. McCleskey. ``If you're a bank
robber, on game day, you could go in there and take 75 percent of
Knoxville.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what it's all about. Game day. When thousands of
people line up, regardless of weather, to cheer their heroes on
their walk to the stadium. The six-figure crowds that bounce to
``Rocky Top,'' a song written in 1967 and incorporated as official
song of Tennessee 15 years later.
</P>
<P>
   That rally around Smokey, the eighth bluetick coonhound to serve
as mascot. That live for the words of local legend John Ward, a
retiring broadcaster who sparks the fire by claiming, ``It's
football time . . . in Tennessee!'' That erupt when the team runs
onto the field, amid a giant ``T'' formed by the Pride of the
Southland band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facilities, the stadium, the ``Rocky Top,'' the fanatic
supporters _ that's what makes it a great program,'' said Lee
Corso, an ESPN college football analyst. ``It's just a fantastic
place for college football.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which has led to a recruiting bonanza. Fulmer can sell
the mountains, the lakes, the scenery, the bowl games, the
television dates and the lengthy scroll of alumni playing in the
NFL. It's not a small town, nor is it a metropolis. But
geographically, Tennessee is in a perfect spot on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids think we're a Northern school, and they come from
the South; Some kids think we're a Southern school, and they come
from the North,'' Fulmer said. ``We're halfway between New York and
Miami, so you have a lot of people in striking distance. It gives
us the opportunity to recruit a lot of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it's the townsfolk who get it done. The ones who
have perpetuated the success. The ones who make the athletes feel
like kings, and what 18-year-old doesn't want that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't let it go,'' McCleskey said. ``I can't let go of the
Vols. The way I was treated, the way they put players on a
pedestal, that's what makes you come out and work extra hard. I've
never been around an atmosphere like the University of Tennessee,
and I was a walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will die a Vol, and there's nothing you can do to take that
away.'' &QL;

FSU RELIGION NOT SO OLD-TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - They know how to worship here, deep in the
South, land of clapboard churches and the Good Book. The city's
showpiece cathedral, red brick, pews of aluminum, rises where
Pensacola Street hits Champions Way.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful gather at Doak Campbell Stadium six Saturdays a
year, 80,000 strong. Their vestments are garnet and gold. The
highest ritual is a chant accompanied by 80,000 right arms thrust
forward in unison, chopping.
</P>
<P>
   The sermon begins and ends _ the state's capital city lives and
dies _ with four words.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State Seminoles football.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the big church, on his way to one more
pre-Fiesta Bowl practice, Chuck Amato wears a taut smile. The
Seminoles' assistant head coach, he came to Florida State from
Tucson 17 years ago. Jan. 4 in the desert will be huge, he says,
but then so are the other 364 days in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three seasons around here,'' Amato explains. ``You've
got football season, recruiting season and spring practice. Does
that say it all in a nutshell?''
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly. This I know, have lived firsthand _ my college
diploma, issued in 1988, says Florida State. So does the flag above
my desk, my dachshunds' collars, 14 coffee mugs, my computer's
screen saver and half my T-shirt collection.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds overzealous, in Tallahassee it qualifies as
restrained, the football equivalent of attending church only on
Christmas. There, half a thousand buildings sport the war-painted
face of Chief Osceola, FSU's mascot; there, the Yellow Pages
contain not just Seminole Blueprint, but Seminole Pressure Cleaning
and 50 other ``Seminole'' entries; there, the big mall, Governor's
Square, has ``three'' ``official'' Florida State apparel shops.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of campus, at Bill's Bookstore, Manager Hunter Snow
is awash in things Seminole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it,'' he says. ``We used to have toilet seats. We
stock every kind of shirt. We tried to sell condoms once, but we
figured that wasn't quite right.''
</P>
<P>
   See what I mean? You can't use ``abstinence'' and ``FSU
football'' in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   For all its abundant faith, this city of 140,000 came to
football late: Florida State was a girls school from 1906 to 1947.
After an 0-5 first season, the baby Noles became a small-college
juggernaut, winning 24 of 26 over the next three years. Former
Oakland Raiders star receiver Fred Biletnikoff took FSU to its
first bowl game in 1964. By the late 1970s, the start of the Bowden
Era, poll-vaulting had become the norm, capped in 1993 by a
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   A randomly tapped shoulder at Bullwinkle's, a Tennessee Street
bar, produces a virtuoso recitation of Seminole dogma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost at Doak since 1991,'' says Scott Maller.
``That's 40 straight at home. And we've been ranked in the top four
11 seasons straight. Beating Tennessee will make 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere in the city, they stand ready to turn westward _
grown women who've gotten tomahawk tattoos at Capital City Tattoo,
FSU-hatted old men who down Old Milwaukee on decrepit porches in
Frenchtown, restaurateurs who've put Bowden's picture on every
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Fans like Jerry DeLoney spare nothing _ not time, not heart, not
expense. In the shadow of the big church, the congregants believe
in Florida State with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   DeLoney, a veterinarian, has spent $3,000 to have his specially
decorated FSU ambulance driven 52 hours to Tempe. He'll be hard to
miss: The ambulance has an 8-foot-tall Tennessee player screwed to
its roof, with a 10-foot spear protruding from his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida State football is what our world circulates around,''
says the doc. ``This whole town's Seminole.''
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick: Church or football?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer,'' DeLoney says, ``but when it comes to that or
going to the stadium, I'm going to the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one word needs saying. Amen. &QL;

THOSE WHO WAIT  
 GLOOMY FUTURE NOW BRIGHT FOR VOLS DUO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee tailback Travis Henry and fullback Shawn Bryson,
patience has been not only a virtue but also fairly rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, a sophomore tailback, was so sure after last season that
he had no real future with the Volunteers that he had decided it
might be best to transfer to another school.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson, a senior fullback, knows all about those emotions. He
wasn't particularly happy before last season when he was asked to
move from tailback to fullback.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryson has emerged as one of the country's most versatile
fullbacks, cut in the mold of the Cardinals' Larry Centers. At 6
feet 1, 230 pounds, he runs a 4.38 40-yard dash, averages 9.5 yards
a carry and has caught 38 passes over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And Henry emerged this season as the Volunteers' leading rusher
after starter Jamal Lewis suffered a season-ending knee injury four
games into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how things work out.
</P>
<P>
   Henry and Bryson will be together in Tennessee's backfield in a
national championship game when the Volunteers take on Florida
State in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perseverance has worked well for both of those guys,''
Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``Shawn is the most complete
fullback we've had at Tennessee in terms of blocking, running and
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Travis, his thoughts on transferring were strictly `I'm
not going to get to play.' With Jamal, it didn't look like there
were going to be enough balls to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After gaining more than 4,000 career yards during his high
school career, it was a tough adjustment for Henry, especially
considering Lewis also was a freshman last season and won the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Frostproof, Fla., Henry's friends couldn't
understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wondering, `How can a kid who rushed for 4,000 yards
not play?' '' Henry said. ``I was getting it everywhere I went.
`Why aren't you playing?' It took a lot to just say things didn't
go right the way I had planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry lost ground early when he showed up at Tennessee with torn
knee cartilage. Then Lewis rushed for more than 1,300 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, everybody had some advice to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' Henry said. ``I was trying to listen to
everybody, and they were pulling me in all kinds of directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry was ready to transfer to Central Florida or Southern
Florida. He would be closer to home, and by moving to a school in a
smaller classification, he would be eligible immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter if it was a smaller school. I just wanted to
play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry decided to heed other advice than that coming from his
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally went and talked to my mom, my grandma and my high
school coach,'' he said. ``They let me know Tennessee was the right
choice, and I needed to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, my mom told me to have faith and everything would
all right. She basically said, `I know you're good, and things are
going to work out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bryson had to work out his own career with Lewis and Henry in
the program at tailback and the Volunteers shorthanded at fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that had to happen,'' he said. ``We had a
couple of fullbacks who went down, and I was the only one who had
any experience at the position. I was all they had left.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryson may have helped his own prospects for playing beyond
Tennessee. His speed, size and pass-catching abilities will make
him attractive to NFL teams looking for a versatile back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see myself as a tailback,'' he said, smiling. ``But
I'm versatile enough to play fullback. I'd like to get a chance to
do it at the next level, but right now I'm just worrying about a
national championship.'' &QL;

CREATING A LEGEND  
 SEMINOLES' MINOR STEPPING OUT OF SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following the Louisiana legend in high school wasn't nearly as
difficult as following him in college.
</P>
<P>
   But, through perseverance and patience, Travis Minor feels he's
ready to move into the fast lane of famous Florida State backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to make a big impact now,'' Minor said after the
Seminoles' workout Tuesday at Mountain Pointe High School.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles know that to beat top-ranked Tennessee in Monday's
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, they're going to have to run. With fullback
Lamarr Glenn having carried only 15 times for 41 yards this season,
that responsibility belongs mainly to Minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to always be prepared to take over the game running
the ball,'' Minor said. ``The team that runs the best usually
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor hopes to take the heat off of quarterback Marcus Outzen,
who will be making only his third career start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flusters you if your running game isn't going,'' Coach
Bobby Bowden said. ``It puts the ballgame in one guy's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor, a 6-foot-1, 190-pound sophomore, is used to playing big
in big games. He did it in high school, where he followed Warrick
Dunn at Baton Rouge Catholic High and topped Dunn's marks, rushing
for 2,649 yards and 33 touchdowns his senior season, and was named
to All-America teams.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida State, Minor has tried to make his own name. Instead
of wearing Dunn's number, 28, which Minor wore in high school, he
chose 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of the same things,'' Minor said. ``We're both
track runners, too. But it's time for me to do my own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State offensive coordinator Mark Richt knew the running
game was sound once Minor became the starter midway through the '97
season. On his first play of his first start, against Virginia,
Minor ran 87 yards for a score.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the season with 623 yards on 112 carries and was
voted the Atlantic Coast Conference Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely does a line block so well that you can stick any back
in there and be a great rushing team,'' Richt said. ``There aren't
that many great rushing teams that don't have a great back.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Minor has rushed for 857 yards and scored seven
touchdowns, despite missing two games and being limited in two
others because of an ankle injury suffered in the Southern
California game the fourth week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Minor was expecting so much more after rushing for 146 yards in
the season opener against Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' he said. ``I wanted to get right back out
there after the injury. But you have to be patient. I could have
gone, but I probably would still be hobbling around right now. I
had to work through the injury, rehab it and wait my turn again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was healthy, he got the yards we needed,'' Richt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that the first guy takes him down. He usually gets
the extra two or four yards.''
</P>
<P>
   If Minor can't break loose, sophomore reserve tailback Jeff
Chaney is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney relieved Minor while he was injured and had a career-best
133 yards on 30 carries against Maryland. Chaney, who has gained
573 yards on 120 carries this season, figures to be in there
against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new quarterback, they're expecting us to run more
than in the past,'' Chaney said. ``We'll get the respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect starts up front with the linemen, led by All-America
tackle Jason Whitaker .
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep our defense off the field as much as we can,
so the run game is very big part of our offense right now,''
Whitaker said. ``We need to get about 200 yards on the ground.''

KNEE INJURY BENCHES FSU NOSE GUARD  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida State nose guard Larry Smith, a second-team All-Atlantic
Coast Conference selection suffered a sprained medial collateral
ligament in his right knee during Tuesday's practice and is not
expected to play in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seminoles are loaded at defensive line. First-team
All-ACC selection Corey Simon, who shared the position with Smith,
simply will be counted on to play more.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden said that Smith suffered the injury in a
nine-on-seven ``inside drill.'' He said Smith got blocked and
somebody rolled over his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suffered a sprained ankle in the first series of the first
game against Texas A&AMP;M and missed two games. He gradually got
stronger and had one of his best games against Florida, helping
shut out the Gators in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden didn't second-guess Tuesday's hard first practice in full
pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go light on your kids and not do much work and have
them all healthy for the game, or you go out and prepare like we
think we have to and take a risk,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ready to go &QL; 
 &QL; 
The news continues to improve for Tennessee starting defensive
linemen Jeff Coleman and Corey Terry, who were both questionable
coming into Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who suffered a knee injury in the Southeastern
Conference championship game, practiced Monday and Tuesday and is
further along than the Volunteers expected. Terry, who has a groin
injury, ``has made steady progress,'' Coach Phillip Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think both will be full speed by game time, which is really
encouraging,'' Fulmer said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Welcome, visitors
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of familiar faces at Florida State's first
practice in Arizona Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward
watched practice, as did former Auburn Coach Terry Bowden, a son of
Florida State's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy for the guys this year,'' said Ward, who has
plenty of time on his hands these days. Ward is a point guard for
the New York Knicks and was available to fly out West because of
the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps close tabs on the Seminoles and is impressed with
sophomore quarterback Marcus Outzen, who has started two games. ``I
think his confidence is growing,'' Ward said. ``He'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bowden resigned at Auburn during the season when it became
apparent to him that he would be fired at season's end. He said he
has no plans to coach next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in football all my life,'' he said. ``I was raised
under the rule of thumb `Don't go into coaching unless you cannot
live without it.' Maybe it's just a year to see if you can live
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he is interested in becoming a television analyst
next season. ``I enjoy TV work. It didn't seem to hurt Lou Holtz or
Jimmy Johnson or those guys.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A kick away &QL; 
 &QL; 
David Leaverton will start as Tennessee's punter Monday, but his
early performance might dictate if he remains in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Leaverton, who struggled down the stretch, could be replaced
later in the game by senior kicker Jeff Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's been kicking well in practice, but then he always
seems to,'' Fulmer said. ``We'll just have to see how it goes.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Arriving in style
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Pointe football Coach Karl Kiefer, in the role of
security guard for Florida State's practices at Mountain Pointe
this week, was impressed by the black stretch limo that Bowden
arrived in for Tuesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   How does Kiefer, the state's all-time winningest high school
coach, get to practice?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my old, beat-up '87 Bronco,'' he said. ``It's about
to die.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
High Price &QL; 
 &QL; 
The genesis of the airborne high-five that has come to define
Tennessee receiver Peerless Price's post-touchdown celebrations was
a pre-game conversation between Price and fellow receiver Jeremaine
Copeland before the team's opener at Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Price recounted this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Copeland: ``What are you going to do after you score?''
</P>
<P>
   Price: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland: ``Let's give a high-five.''
</P>
<P>
   By midseason, receivers coach Pat Washington informed Price that
other receivers were outjumping him during the celebration. So now
the post-touchdown event had come down to a
who-has-the-best-vertical-leap competition. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Civic duty &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coaches, players and bands from Tennessee and Florida State will
attend the Fiesta Bowl kickoff luncheon at the Phoenix Civic Plaza
today.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon begins at 11:30 a.m. and is open to the public.
ESPN's Chris Fowler, Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit will host the
event. Tickets can be purchased at the plaza. &QL;

WAKE-UP CALL COMES EARLY  
 SEMINOLES REDEDI CATE THEMSELVES AF TER LOSS IN 2ND GAME 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-YEAR-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that Florida State lost a game this season wasn't so
shocking to the Seminoles and their fans. After all, Florida State
has had only one unbeaten season, in 1950, and even then it had to
squeak by Sewanee, 14-8, at homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was whom the Seminoles lost to _ lightly regarded North
Carolina State _ and when they lost, Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State hadn't lost that early in the season since 1989,
when it opened the season with losses to Southern Mississippi and
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're going to lose only one game a year, it's best to
do it early. The Seminoles had time to recover in the polls, and
after winning 10 straight, they finished the year ranked No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Seminoles will play No. 1 Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 4, with the winner likely to be crowned the consensus
national championship. Here's how the Seminoles earned a trip to
Tempe. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 23, Texas A&AMP;M 14
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles outscored the Aggies, 13-0, in the second half to
win the Kickoff Classic at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's young defense was dominating, limiting Texas A&AMP;M
to 133 total yards and forcing two turnovers that led to 10 points.
The victory, however, might have led the Seminoles to think they
were better than they actually were. &QL;  &QL; 
N. Carolina St. 24, Florida St. 7
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke was intercepted six times
as the Wolfpack stunned the Seminoles in one of the season's
biggest upsets.
</P>
<P>
   It was the turning point for the Seminoles, who committed
themselves to working harder in practice and not letting the season
fall apart. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 62, Duke 13
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles were out to demolish the next team they played,
according to offensive guard Jason Whitaker. Unfortunately for
Duke, it was next up, and the Seminoles scored 52 points in the
second and third quarters to blow the game open.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke threw for three touchdowns and, more important, wasn't
intercepted. In fact, he did not throw an interception the
remainder of the season. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 30, USC 10
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles defense continued to come of age, limiting the
Trojans to 189 total yards, including only 23 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Peter Warrick shared the spotlight with the defense by
catching six passes for 112 yards and a touchdown. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 24, Maryland 10
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Janikowski tied a school record by kicking five field
goals to help win a game that was much tougher than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles led, 16-10, at halftime and added two field goals
and a safety in the second half. Sophomore running back Jeff
Chaney, filling in for an injured Travis Minor, rushed for 133
yards on 30 carries. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 26, Miami 14
</P>
<P>
   Warrick caught seven passes for 190 yards, accounting for nearly
half of the Seminoles' offense. The Seminoles ran for only 95
yards, but Weinke threw for 316 yards and two touchdowns, one of
them a 62-yarder to Warrick, who made a brilliant leaping grab.
</P>
<P>
   The defense continued to dominate, yielding only 69 yards
rushing on 39 attempts. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 48, Clemson 0
</P>
<P>
   Weinke passes for 302 yards and four touchdowns, each to a
different receiver. The defense allowed Clemson only 129 total
yards. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 34, Georgia Tech 7
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech was the best offensive team the Seminoles had
played, yet Florida State shut things down again, limiting the
Yellow Jackets to 199 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Seminoles led by only three entering the fourth
quarter. Then, Warrick broke loose for two of his three touchdowns,
one on a reverse that went 16 yards. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 39, N. Carolina 13
</P>
<P>
   Weinke passed for 338 yards and two touchdowns, a 56-yarder to
Warrick and a 49-yarder to Laveranues Coles.
</P>
<P>
   The defense recorded five sacks. Linebacker Tommy Polley led the
Seminoles with 10 tackles, including two for losses. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 45, Virginia 14
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' impressive victory was marred by an injury to
Weinke, who left the game shortly before halftime. He was later
diagnosed with a herniated disc in his neck, ending his season.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Outzen came on in relief and completed 5 of 6 passes. The
defense did its part again, holding Virginia to 64 yards in the
second half. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 24, Wake Forest 7
</P>
<P>
   Outzen was 11 of 19 passing for 164 yards in his first start. He
was intercepted once and sacked four times.
</P>
<P>
   With an inexperienced quarterback, the Seminoles turned
conservative, rushing 47 times for 175 yards. Cornerback Mario
Edwards set a school record with four interceptions. &QL;  &QL; 
Florida St. 23, Florida 12
</P>
<P>
   Outzen proved he could handle the pressure of a big game,
completing 13 of 22 passes for 167 yards and a touchdown. He
fumbled twice in the first half but was solid in the second as the
Seminoles extended their home winning streak to 40.
</P>
<P>
   But defense was again the story, turning in one of the best
performances in Florida State history in the second half. Florida
was 0 for 13 on third-down conversions and managed only 204 yards
of offense, its lowest total in eight years. &QL;  &QL;

TALENTED VOLS A TEAM OF DESTINY  
 EVEN AS INJURIES TOOK TOLL, YOUNG STERS MATURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee has been described as both a team of immense talent
and one of destiny. The truth appears to be a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Questions surrounded the Volunteers in 1998 because they had
lost their superstar quarterback (Peyton Manning), their top
receiver (Marcus Nash) and an All-America linebacker (Leonard
Little).
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them to listen to their coaches, and they responded
the way we hoped they would,'' Coach Phillip Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected a 12-0 season, but the Volunteers endured by
allowing a talented but inexperienced quarterback, Tee Martin, to
mature and a defense with seven new starters to grow. A consistent
place-kicker and the return of several injured players helped.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee also had to overcome adversity. Tailback Jamal Lewis
suffered a season-ending knee injury in the fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers survived and enter the national championship game
against Florida State as underdogs. Again.
</P>
<P>
   They like it that way.
</P>
<P>
   What a long, strange trip it's been: &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 34, Syracuse 33
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers' undefeated season almost wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   They led, 24-13, after three quarters, but the Orangemen rallied
behind quarterback Donovan McNabb and took a 33-31 advantage with
2:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin was 6 for 29 in the game, he connected when it
mattered and directed Tennessee's final drive, setting up Jeff
Hall's 27-yard field goal at the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis finished with 140 yards and one touchdown. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 20, Florida 17 (OT)
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers beat the Gators for the first time since 1992
despite managing only 64 passing yards to Florida's 409.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee trailed, 3-0, but bounced back with a 57-yard Shawn
Bryson scoring run and 29-yard Martin-to-Peerless Price touchdown
pass. Hall was again the hero with a 41-yard field goal in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Al Wilson had 12 tackles, a sack and a school-record
three forced fumbles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 42, Houston 7
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers had a chance to catch their breath. Martin had
his most accurate game to date, completing 14 of 19 passes for 234
yards and four touchdowns. The defense also dominated, holding the
Houston running game to 39 yards on 31 carries. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 17, Auburn 9
</P>
<P>
   It was a good-news, bad-news game for the Volunteers. They beat
Auburn but lost Lewis for the season because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee scored all its points in the first quarter, starting
with a Shaun Ellis 90-yard interception return for a touchdown. On
its next offensive play, Lewis ran 67 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The defense hung tough with a four-play goal-line stand from the
6-inch line. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 22, Georgia 3
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers demonstrated that there is life after Lewis as
sophomore tailbacks Travis Stephens and Travis Henry accounted for
160 yards. The defense again made its mark, forcing four Georgia
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee loosened the reins a bit on Martin, whose confidence
was growing. He threw for 156 yards and two touchdowns. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 35, Alabama 18
</P>
<P>
   Price, who had gone largely unnoticed while Tennessee tried to
get its passing game on track, returned a kick 100 yards for a
third-quarter score after the Crimson Tide had closed to within
three.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Henry each scored twice on short runs to account for
the other scores. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 49, South Carolina 14
</P>
<P>
   This was Martin's day to come of age. He completed his first 23
passes and finished 23 of 24 passes for 315 yards, four touchdowns
and no interceptions. Price had 10 catches for 165 yards. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tenn. 37, Ala.-Birmingham 13
</P>
<P>
   Martin ran and passed for touchdowns as the Volunteers reached
8-0 for the first time since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game with significant ramifications. Coupled with Ohio
State's upset loss to Michigan State, the victory pushed the
Volunteers to the top of the polls and in first place in the Bowl
Championship Series standings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 28, Arkansas 24
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers appeared ready to fall out of the top spot. The
Razorbacks led from early in the first quarter and held a 14-point
advantage in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee kept chipping away and found itself with the ball
at midfield with 1:43 left in the game thanks to an Arkansas
fumble. Henry scored the game-winning touchdown with 28 seconds
remaining to cap a 197-yard day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 59, Kentucky 21
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers trailed, 7-6, late in the first quarter but
scored the game's next 32 points. The defense sacked quarterback
Tim Couch six times en route to securing the Southeastern
Conference Eastern Division title.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Jeff Hall contributed 15 points and became the SEC's
all-time leading scorer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 41, Vanderbilt 0
</P>
<P>
   While the offense rolled up points, the defense intercepted four
passes and recovered two fumbles, one for a touchdown by Chris
Ramseur. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee 24, Mississippi St. 14
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers' season ended the way it began . . . with drama.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs took a 14-10 lead midway through the fourth quarter
after scoring on an interception return and a punt return.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin found Price for a 41-yard score, and after the
kickoff, Tennessee's Corey Terry forced Bulldogs quarterback Wayne
Madkin to fumble. Eric Westmoreland recovered and Martin soon found
Cedrick Wilson wide open for a 26-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   It made the Volunteers the undisputed leader in both polls
because of losses that day by UCLA and Kansas State. &QL;

   UT ends year with numerous scientific developments
</P>
<P>
   By Dick Stanley
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ No replacement human organs were grown; no parts
of the new International Space Station were built; no cures were
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But a blast of radiation from a distant star hit Earth just as a
University of Texas astronomer predicted that it could, a hopeful
new way of quickly diagnosing cancers began development, and South
Africa announced plans to duplicate the university's biggest
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   So went 1998's science and engineering developments at UT.
Herewith, in chronological order and with advice from experts such
as Mary Ann Rankin, dean of the College of Natural Sciences, are
the candidates for the top UT-Austin science and engineering
developments of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good mixture,'' Rankin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chip breakthrough: Chemical engineer C. Grant Wilson and
colleagues announced in February development of a new chemical
concoction, called amorphous polyolefin, that could save the
microchip industry billions of dollars. It's expected to extend the
life of the industry's manufacturing methods long enough to make
chips up to 100 times as powerful as current ones.
</P>
<P>
   Electric guns: Maturing projects at the 8-year-old Institute for
Advanced Technology, directed by physicist Harry Fair, drew
increasing visits from military generals in March. They came to see
how electricity can be used to give combat vehicles Star Trek-like
shields, as well as power their guns and super-quiet engines. The
Army spends $10 million a year on the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Twin telescope: The South African government announced in June
that it will build a duplicate of UT's new Hobby-Eberly Telescope,
North America's largest, to study celestial objects visible only
from the southern hemisphere. UT will provide blueprints and
expertise in exchange for observing time.
</P>
<P>
   Germ defense: Biochemical engineer George Georgiou and
colleagues took the lead in the race to find a speedy defense
against whatever lethal new germs terrorists might someday turn
loose in airports, malls or stadiums. The researchers said in June
that they should, within a few years, have a bacteria-based system
for developing therapies against terrorist germs within 96 hours of
their discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic tongue: Chemist John McDevitt and colleagues began
preparing in July to seek private financing to perfect a silicon
device that uses hundreds of chemical microsensors to mimic the
sophistication of human taste buds. In addition to testing new food
and drink products, the electronic tongue may someday speed up
standard medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell Galaxy: Astronomer Fritz Benedict spent more than a
decade studying a far-away galaxy that, in ground telescopes, was
little more than a smudge of light. Then, in August, the Hubble
Space Telescope snapped Benedict's galaxy, and, suddenly, he had
all the collaboration he could desire for what looks like a
brilliant red jewel in a blue halo of twinkling stars.
</P>
<P>
   Wake-up call: Astrophysicist Robert Duncan and a colleague
predicted in 1992 that a radiation blast from a magnetar, a newly
discovered kind of star, might hit Earth some day. In September,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced that it
had happened the previous month, overloading the sensors of some
satellites and harmlessly engulfing part of the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting dots: Internet traffic could get a lot speedier
thanks to a September announcement by electrical engineer Dennis
Deppe and colleagues. They've developed the first method of making
artificial atoms called quantum dots perform as data-carrying
lasers on low-cost semiconductors. The technique could make
fiber-optic technology and its rapid transmission of Net data more
readily available to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Squishy cells: Biophysicist Josef Kas and colleagues drew
federal financing in October for an experimental laser device to
examine suspicious human cells for squishiness, which Kas has
discovered is a sign of some cancers and, perhaps, all of them. The
laser promises to be cheaper and cause less discomfort for patients
than current diagnostic methods, and may be capable of finding more
cancers in time to cure them.
</P>
<P>
   Flood warning: Environmental engineer David Maidment and
colleagues were making headway in November, one month after the
historic flooding of Central Texas rivers, in completing the first
precision digital map of Texas terrain elevations. It will improve
the accuracy of National Weather Service flood warnings, as well as
help home-buyers, developers and insurers better determine the
location of flood-prone areas.

 &HT;    Legal eclipse puts Moon Pie dessert on the waneBy Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Kudzu Cafe doesn't sell RC Cola, and it can no
longer sell its Moon Pie dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta restaurant, which sold a mountainous chocolate
dessert called the Kudzu Ice Cream Moon Pie, has settled a federal
trademark lawsuit filed by Moon Pie-maker Chattanooga Bakery. Kudzu
now calls its high-calorie dessert the Kudzu Ice Cream Pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a favorable settlement for us,'' Chattanooga Bakery
executive Tory Johnston said of the confidential agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga Bakery began making Moon Pies in 1917 and now sells
more than 50 million a year. The sales numbers didn't get fat until
the 1950s, when country duo Lonzo and Oscar recorded ``Give Me an
RC Cola and a Moon Pie,'' securing the chocolate wafer and
marshmallow sandwich a permanent spot in Southern pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu Cafe began selling its Moon Pie dessert six years ago. In
response to Chattanooga Bakery's lawsuit filed in May, the
restaurant said it did not know that anyone claimed the trademark
or brand name rights to Moon Pie. Instead, the restaurant said, it
believed the term Moon Pie was the ``generic'' name of a chocolate
wafer and marshmallow sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Kudzu's $6.95 dessert item is much more
extravagant than the genuine Moon Pie. It has two fudge brownies
sandwiched around layers of vanilla ice cream, creme de menthe,
marshmallows and peanuts, topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and
more peanuts.

 &HT;    Toilet seat museum flush with artistry
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMO HEIGHTS, Texas _ Barney Smith's Toilet Seat Art Museum is
small enough that you can see the hole thing _ make that the whole
thing _ in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Since the museum is in Barney's garage behind his house in this
town surrounded by San Antonio, it wouldn't take a huge crowd to
make the attraction standing-room only. Or would that be the urinal
museum?
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if you've seen 500 toilet seats hanging in a garage
before,'' boasted Smith, the museum's curator, creator and sole
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the museum is made up mostly of toilet seat lids, not
seats, although there are a few seats.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 77, a retired master plumber, has decorated each of the
500 toilet lids and seats in his museum with everything from photos
of Miss America to knives, forks and spoons he removed from sink
traps while working as a plumber. He's been working on his toilet
seat lid collection for more than 30 years. He paints some of the
lids and drills intricate designs into them with a rotating drill.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the Picasso of Plumbing, and his museum is the Louvre
of Toilet Seat Lids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps me at home,'' Smith joked of his hobby. ``It keeps me
out of the singles bars, since I haven't been married but 59
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's wife Louise says she doesn't mind her husband's hobby so
long as it doesn't grow any larger. ``He's supposed to stop at 500
(lids),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no admission charge, and the place is open only when
Barney Smith is home. So call ahead for an appointment (210
824-7791).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there are a few toilet seats in among the toilet lids that
cover the garage walls and doors. I was impressed with the toilet
lid and seat combination decorated with dead wasps.
</P>
<P>
   Smith glued the bugs to the toilet seat. The festive red Orkin
sticker on the lid grabs the viewer's attention. ``Please open
slowly. Do not disturb,'' reads the message on the lid. When you
lift the lid, you see the dead bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are yellow jackets,'' Smith said as he proudly displayed
his handiwork. ``One of them stung me on my head, and I just said,
'I'll put you on my toilet seat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's what I call revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Smith picked toilet seat lids as his canvas because he has a
ready supply of brand-new lids damaged during shipping and given to
him by plumbing suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a master plumber, and I can get these toilet seats for
nothing, and you can't beat that,'' Smith explained. ``I figured I
ought to stick with my trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 500 works is numbered, and each features a different
theme. The ``Eat'n and Drink'n'' lid is covered with those little
plastic restaurant steak markers that tell you if your rib-eye is
cooked well, medium or rare. Another lid is covered with dog tags
(for canines, not soldiers). Yet another lid is decorated with a
swizzle stick collection that a couple donated to Smith. Each
toilet lid has a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember O.J.?'' one lid title asks. A lone glove is
glued to that lid. Much of the stuff you see on the lids was given
to Smith, including the chunk of insulation he says came from the
1986 Challenger space shuttle explosion over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fellow from Alamo Heights said he was there on the beach
when the Challenger blew up,'' Smith said. ``And (the chunk)
floated up while he was standing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith takes his museum seriously. While we were visiting, a man
and his daughter walked up to browse. The man asked Smith what one
of the decorated toilet lids would cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not for sale,'' Smith told him. ``This is a museum.
You couldn't buy 'em for love nor money.''
</P>
<P>
   More amazing than Smith's toilet lids is the intricate way he
files the materials he puts on the lids. You'll find hundreds of
shoeboxes toward the back of Smith's garage, lined up in rows on
shelves. Each shoebox is labeled with the item you'll find inside
the box _ tennis balls, moss, ``ash, volcanic'' (used on the Mount
St. Helens toilet lid), billfolds, wild turkey feathers, vacuum
cleaner bags, ``mink fur,'' split peas, fishing lures, window
locks, toys, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   So that Smith can easily find each item, each shoebox is
inventoried in a book by shelf letter and box number. The dog tags,
for example, are stored in shoebox U-23.
</P>
<P>
   Smith even decoupaged a real marijuana leaf to his ``Stop
Drugs'' toilet lid. He says he plucked the leaf from a pot plant he
stumbled across while repairing a hot water heater in a rent house
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Smith took the pot leaf to the police station to get permission
to put it on one of his toilet lids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it up to the police station between two pieces of glass
and asked, 'Do I have a marijuana leaf?' '' Smith recalled. ``And
(the cop) said, 'You sure do.' '' Smith said the policeman told him
it was OK to use it in the museum, as long as it was for display
purposes only.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Miss America toilet lid with photos from the pageant
and the message, ``The dream lives on.'' There's a toilet lid
called ``Trolling Around'' covered with little rubber long-haired
troll toys.
</P>
<P>
   Smith keeps a guest book for visitors to sign. He says about
1,000 people, from as far away as ``Moscow, Russia,'' stop by each
year to look.
</P>
<P>
   Do the neighbors complain? Not yet. But that could change if the
toilet seat museum becomes flush with success.
</P>
<P>
   ``These neighbors of mine, they said when you let tour buses in
here, that's when we're gonna shut you down,'' Smith said.

 &HT;    Don't sweat life if your name isn't ``Furby''
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're in that post-holiday funk, here's a
thought to cheer you. It could be worse. You could be a Furby.
</P>
<P>
   Your value could have plummeted to a fifth of what it was on
Thursday. Only last week, millions worshipped and adored you, would
have done anything for you, paid any price. Only last week, you
were the heart's desire of millions of children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning America awakened to realize you are bug-eyed
and make an unattractive noise.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Ronald Brown. The Eaton, Ohio man was in the right
place at the right time, and bought three Furbys at retail. One he
set aside for his 7-year-old daughter; the other two would plump up
her college fund _ or so he thought. Brown found no takers for the
Furbys he advertised in the Dayton Daily News for $150 each _ in
the lower price range among the dozens of ads hawking Furbys. ``I
think the demand was hyped,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   So his daughter found three of the season's hottest toys under
the Christmas tree. ``I can't get them to shut up,'' said Brown.
``Even when you put them to sleep they act like they snore.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the week after Christmas, the week expectation meets
reality, extravagance meets regret. Did we really buy that
overpriced, poorly made toy with the 3,000 parts we'll be stepping
on for the rest of the year?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, my children never uttered the word ``Furby.'' Yet
by early Saturday afternoon, the china teapot had shattered, the
Dirt Devil Jr. had choked on some family heirloom. My husband was
doing battle with the ``Doomsday Duel'' electric race car set, the
most coveted toy on our son's Christmas list. His heart's desire.
</P>
<P>
   Jim struggled most of the day to put the blasted thing together,
muttering words like ``shoddy'' and ``piece of junk'' and others
not printable, extinguishing our Christmas spirit more handily than
Jacob Marley. ``I'm having kill-your-boss feelings about this
toy,'' Jim groused. ``You'd have to have an engineering degree to
put this together. Who thought it was a good idea to buy this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa,'' Alec reminded.
</P>
<P>
   Surely it's not greed or frivolity or anything but dumbstruck
love that makes us so desperate to give our children their heart's
desire. But if we love them, we must show them it is not to be
purchased at all costs. Not at the cost of $300 for a $30 toy, or _
in one particularly humiliating promotion _ Furby-wrestling with
other moms in the mall.
</P>
<P>
   If we love our children, we must help them to understand that
you can't always get what you want.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Ron Scherer. Remember him? He's the 48-year-old
Columbus, Ohio bachelor who paid about $1,500 for a full-page ad in
the Kettering-Oakwood Times looking for ``Kathy of Kettering,'' the
woman he met briefly at Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie last summer. She
called him and they had a ``wonderful conversation,'' Scherer said.
But she was dating another guy.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one other woman in his life he has felt that
strongly attracted to, Scherer said: ``So it was fun to talk to
her, but bittersweet...You'll always wonder what could have been.''
Could Kathy the Real Woman ever live up to Kathy the Impossible
Dream? This way, they'll always have Put-in-Bay.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe we shouldn't work so hard to manufacture the magical
moments. Maybe we should let them come to us. Like Christmas
morning, when, before tearing into his presents, Alec presented me
with the very first gift he had picked out and paid for himself: a
heart-shaped necklace with the slogan ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a gift Santa won't need to refund. No batteries, no
$300 price tag, no Yoda-like squeaks. Just a priceless holiday
reminder that having each other should be all our hearts desire.

 &HT;    Voters fed up with 2 major parties; time for more Jesse Venturas
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If the Democrats continue to defend immorality and
criminality and Republicans continue to be led around by
white-supremacist, immigrant-bashing, narrow-minded Bible thumpers,
then Americans should elect Hulk Hogan president.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Minnesota voters elected Jesse (The Body) Ventura, a
middlin' former professional wrestler, to be their governor.
</P>
<P>
   Voters appear ready to make the leap with Hulk Hogan, a revered
name when the conversation turns to body slamming.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the November 2000 presidential election rolls
around, Americans will have had sufficient time to evaluate Gov.
Jesse (The Governing Body) Ventura's first two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   And if Minnesota's shaved-head governor does a good job, as I
hope, American voters may decide to boot Democrats and Republicans
alike out of the political arena. Their acts have gotten ugly and
stale.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ventura could make it exciting by tossing his head scarf
into the ring with Hulk Hogan _ except he promised Minnesota voters
that he would serve out his four-year term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now if Jesse were a Democrat or a Republican, voters could
expect him to go back on his word. But voters hold professional
wrestlers to higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Minnesota voters elected Jesse over St. Paul Mayor
Norm Coleman, a formidable Republican candidate, and Hubert
Humphrey III, the state's attorney general and the son of a
Democratic political legend.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican parties have been losing the
support of the American people for years. It's just that Bill
Clinton, his Democratic defenders and a string of Republicans
including Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott, Bob Barr and Dan Burton have
accelerated the desire of Americans to avoid contact with either
political party.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when nearly every adulnsite. It is a
politically progressive state with an informed electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota voters elected Jesse Ventura to send a message that
they couldn't take another bite of the politics-as-usual diet fed
to them by professional Republican and Democratic politicians. A
professional wrestler would be better.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse happened to run on the Reform Party ticket, a fact that
meant little to the candidate and apparently less to the voters.
What was important was that he was neither Democrat nor Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas billionaire Ross Perot established the Reform Party and
got 19 percent of the vote in 1992 even though he quit the race and
provided ample evidence that he was a nut case.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's success in 1992 should have caused Democrats and
Republicans to re-examine their take-no-prisoners partisanship, but
it didn't. Partisan nastiness only intensified.
</P>
<P>
   The more President Clinton's behavior is revealed to be immoral,
criminal or just plain disgusting, the more he is defended by the
likes of porno king Larry Flynt and Democrats who fear losing an
inch of ground to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to disgusting, however, it's hard to top the
Republican leadership that has moved from huckstering for big
business to moralizing for the fundamentalist Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary enough that Republicans appear intent on forcing
narrow religious beliefs on all Americans, but now Americans learn
that Republican leaders have been cozying up to the Council of
Conservative Citizens, a group that promotes white racial purity in
a way that echoes the hatred spread by the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are looking for something better. Do you hear that,
Hulk?

 &HT;    New Year's Eve revelers get an extra second of fun
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wait a second.
</P>
<P>
   This New Year's Eve, something's not going to be quite right:
During festivities celebrating the advent of 1999, scientists will
add an extra ``leap second'' of time at precisely 6:59:59 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the 22nd time a ``leap second'' has been added to the
world's clocks since 1972, a move to keep what's known as
coordinated universal time in alignment with the time determined by
the Earth's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Humans have gotten more punctual than the planet they live on.
Man's oldest clock used to be the Earth, which takes 24 hours to
complete a rotation _ give or take about .001 second per day.
That's ``more than enough accuracy for most people,'' according to
the U.S. Naval Observatory, which will add the extra second in
America.
</P>
<P>
   But, over time, that small discrepancy adds up. Without leap
seconds, sunrise would come at noon 10,000 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of atomic clocks, which operate by measuring
the resonant frequency of given atoms, we can be far more accurate
_ to within one-billionth of a second per day.
</P>
<P>
   Which, by comparison, makes the Earth similar to your
grandmother's cuckoo clock.
</P>
<P>
   When the difference between the two times is within 0.9 second,
the International Earth Rotation Service calls for a leap second.
</P>
<P>
   So who actually needs to change their clocks? Space programs,
computer programmers and phone companies. And, of course, those who
make time their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be terrible,'' said Bernie Tekippe, owner of Classic
Clocks in Atlanta, ``if a clockmaker wasn't on time.''

 &HT;    1998 was a very weird year
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some years, the ball drops on New Year's
and you weep a little, sad that the previous year has passed so
quickly. But years like 1998, well, they just don't pass fast
enough. As if the hanky-panky at the White House wasn't enough, we
elected a wrestler to be a governor. We watched a World Series
baseball champion sell off all its best players and finish in last
place. We had astronomers telling us an asteroid would smack us
into oblivion in 30 years _ only to tell us two days later that
they goofed up their calculations and that we'd all be just
hunky-dory for at least a few hundred more years. What next?
Computers going haywire at the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1,
2000??? Nah. That could never happen....
</P>
<P>
   Hey, nice looking barka
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Coat Factory recalled hundreds of winter parkas from
its stores after discovering they were trimmed with the fur of dogs
slaughtered in China.

 &HT;    'Art cars' allow drivers to have fun _ as well as make a
statement
 &HT;    By Stell Simonton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thousands of picture-perfect new cars glide off
assembly lines each year. Their new paint jobs look dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   But another breed of car can make them look dull as dishwater:
It's the ``art car.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Carrington's lemon-yellow van, for example, is covered
with a garden of bright red, blue and green flowers painted in a
childlike hand.
</P>
<P>
   Along one side are portraits of five children. Plastic figurines
from McDonald's kids' meals and other sources dot the hood, and
small discarded toys are glued here and there.
</P>
<P>
   It all started in the late 1980s, when Carrington, who lives in
Atlanta's Inman Park, ran a small child-care business in her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``See these little bitty hands?'' Carrington asks, pointing to
small multicolored handprints near the van's rear. They were the
first thing painted on her 1983 Ford Club van, on a day when she
brought out the latex acrylic paint and gave her preschoolers a
hands-on project. In the ensuing years,
</P>
<P>
   Carrington switched to providing after-school care for
elementary school kids, and each group has left its mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put paint out here and turn them loose,'' she says.
Carrington affixes objects, including the cross-section of a doll's
head, with glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recycle plastic,'' she says. And sure enough, a vertical
line of small plastic cylinders _ the tops of Magic Markers _
marches up one side of a door.
</P>
<P>
   One day, ``I was outside and this guy came walking down the
street,'' Carrington said. ``He looked like he was probably
homeless. He had this old metal chair over his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrington, who had been painting the van, occupied him with a
paintbrush while she went inside to get some money. His
contribution is still visible on the side of the van: the small,
simple outline of a chair. The mailman also happened along during a
painting session and added a green face.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington isn't the only person to use her car as a mobile
canvas. Each year, art cars parade through Houston in what
organizers call the largest and oldest art car parade in the world.
Houston is also home of the Art Car Museum, and San Francisco hosts
the ArtCar Fest. A Web site, http://www.artcars.com, is devoted to
the subject, with lists of events, pictures of cars and links to
many individual sites.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy ... in a good way
</P>
<P>
   John Robinson, who lives in Atlanta, has a 1983 Honda Accord
that until recently was covered in swirling red and white stripes
with a deep blue hood with sponge-painted white stars. The rolling
rendition of the American flag was painted in honor of the Fourth
of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at work think it's crazy, but not in a bad way,'' says
Robinson, who works for United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   He said other drivers honk and send him a thumbs-up sign as he
drives around town.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, before he painted his car, Robinson saw the
film ``Wild Wheels'' on public TV. The documentary by filmmaker
Harrod Blank showed car after car bedecked in wild ways.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, Robinson and his children, Noah, now 9, and Mari, now
7, swept over their car with fluorescent green paint, aiming for a
Halloween look. Unhappy with the result, they repainted _ and now,
changing the car's look is a seasonal tradition. Last fall, the
family made stencils from fallen leaves and covered the car with a
leaf design. It can be viewed at
http://members.aol.com/Jrfanbelt/index.html/. (Select Photo Gallery
and then Wild Wheels.)
</P>
<P>
   The look of the car was a concession to Noah, Robinson said.
After seeing ``Wild Wheels,'' Noah wanted to copy the car artist in
the film who glued grass seed all over his vehicle, watered it, and
kept it garaged under plastic until a complete lawn sprouted. ``Why
don't we paint it instead?'' Robinson suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he wouldn't confine his car art to an older model.
``I'd love to buy a Mercedes and have someone do paisley all over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Sotus-Holbrook, who lives in Atlanta, sometimes transports a
group of kids around via a zebra. It's really her 1973 Volkswagen
van, transformed to look like a zebra. Zebarella, as the van is
called, was painted by artist friend Ken Proteau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a picture from Ranger Rick (children's) magazine,''
Sotus-Holbrook says. ``I gave him the magazine and said 'This is
what I want.' ``
</P>
<P>
   People stop and wave at the van, she said, and once a woman
slowing down to look at it caused an accident.

 &HT;    Lunch with Loretta: 10-year-old Paul loves being Frank
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sure, your kid sings in the back seat.
Like, maybe the Barney song.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Sinatra's 'Summer Wind'?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 2 years old, and we were listening to Sinatra in the
car,'' says Anthony Iacono, whose 10-year-old son, Paul,
impersonates Ol' Blue Eyes. ``I turned the radio off, and he just
kept singing that song. Three times. And he wasn't actually
speaking then.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Paul holds court wherever he goes. He is not
self-conscious. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a cone of strawberry ice cream, he belts out Fly Me to
the Moon in the middle of Sprinkles in Palm Beach. Volume, vibrato,
verve. And no formal training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show tunes are my favorite,'' he says, dabbing his mouth with
a napkin before bursting into an Ethel Merman medley. ``But really,
I like anything catchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-grader _ a regular on The Rosie O'Donnell Show _ was
in town recently to perform at a Leukemia Society benefit at
Mar-a-Lago. The event, which raised about $150,000, was more than
just a gig for Paul. He was diagnosed with the disease in January
'97 and has about six months of chemotherapy to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared until I learned more about it,'' says Paul, who
lives in Secaucus, N.J. ``If you're going to get cancer, this is
one of the best kinds to get. I'm going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell became smitten with Paul last year after she heard
there was some kid bellowing Broadway hits to folks waiting in line
for tickets to her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to meet him, and that very day she put him on,''
Anthony says proudly. ``He upstaged Eddie Murphy! Now, he has a
standing invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul, meanwhile, rates standing ovations for his Sinatra shtick.
He sports a tuxedo, peppers his act with jokes and swaggers around
with a ``drink'' in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But props aren't required to get him in the mood. All done with
his ice cream, Paul breaks into You Make Me Feel So Young as
passers-by pause to gawk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get nervous,'' he says, un-fazed by the crowd. ``I've
been doing this since I was a kid.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In one take this week.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: The sponsors of the censure push defeated in the House
Judiciary Committee made much of the fact that it called for a
joint congressional resolution that President Clinton would have to
sign like any other law. Does this mean he would have the option of
vetoing it, if it were to pass both chambers of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: The proposed censure resolution is not a bill or law; it is
an official reprimand. So long as both the House and Senate agree
to a censure of the president, he cannot ``veto'' it. A president
can choose to sign a censure to simply show that he admits the
charge and accepts the punishment. President Clinton already has
stated that he would sign such a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a program recently on Frank Lloyd Wright and the
tragedy he suffered with the murder of members of his family at his
home. Could you tell me what happened to the murderer?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the worst single incident of mass murder to occur in
Wisconsin, seven innocent people were murdered on Aug. 15, 1914 at
Taliesin, the estate of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The dead
included Mamah Bouton Borthwick, Wright's mistress, her two
children and four staff members. According to The Capital Times in
Madison, Wis., Herbert Fritz, one of two survivors, identified the
perpetrator as Julian Carleton, a servant who had been employed
earlier in the summer but whose last working day at Taliesin was to
have been Aug. 15. It wasn't clear whether he was leaving his job
on his own volition or was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   After bolting the doors and windows of the staff dining room,
Carlton set fire to the house. He then went to the other end of the
house where Borthwick and her two children were eating, and
attacked them with a hatchet. Carlton was found hiding underneath
the fire-ravaged house, semi-conscious and suffering a burned
esophagus from having swallowed hydrochloric acid. He died in jail
seven weeks later from starvation. Though he made two court
appearances before his death, he never revealed a motive and never
was tried.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently an insurance agent told me that life insurance death
benefits are free of income tax to the beneficiary. Is this true?
Or is it considered income and taxed as such by the IRS?
</P>
<P>
   A: In most cases, life insurance benefits are not taxable. There
are some exceptions to this rule. The benefits are taxable if the
policy was turned over to you for a price. Also, some portion of
the benefits may be taxable if you elect to receive them in a lump
sum rather than in installments. A detailed explanation of when and
if life insurance benefits are taxable can be found in IRS
publication 525. You can order a copy of it from the IRS at
1-800-TAX-FORM. It's also available on the IRS web site at:
http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/formspubs/pubs/p525toc.htm (The
section you'll want to look at is called Income Not Taxed.).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have several Series EE savings bonds I bought about 10
years ago. Are there are Web sites or other resources to tell me
how much they're worth before they are cashed in?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bureau of Public Debt has a Web site that addresses
savings bonds' valuations:
http:www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/sav.htm Then download the free
valuation application, Savings Bond Wizard (which is still in its
beta, or testing phase).
</P>
<P>
   Series EE bonds come in eight denominations: $50, $75, $100,
$200, $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000. You pay half the face
amount for them, and the bonds increase in price over 17 years to
the face value. That price increase stems from interest payments.
These are based upon a formula that's tied to five-year Treasury
rates. If five-year rates are high, then EE bonds can reach their
maturity value early.
</P>
<P>
   If you redeem Series EE bonds within five years of their issue
date, then you give up three months of interest as a penalty. After
five years there's no penalty, and those who cash in their bonds
receive their principal plus accumulated interest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few months ago, President Clinton announced that he would
be getting spiritual counseling from two or three prominent
Christian pastors. Who are the pastors, and what has happened since
the announcement?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Rev. Gordon MacDonald has spent at least two nights at
the White House in recent weeks, according to his office. MacDonald
is pastor of the Christian church Grace Chapel in Lexington, Mass.
Another spiritual adviser, the Rev. Tony Campolo, is an American
Baptist who teaches sociology at Eastern College in Pennsylsvania.
Campolo was with Clinton last Saturday during the impeachment
votes. A third clergyman is the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, minister at
Foundry United Methodist, the Washington church that the president
often attends. ``This is a zone of privacy,'' Wogaman told Cox
Newspapers when asked about his private counseling efforts with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item in the newspaper said that on Dec. 6, 1884, Army
engineers completed construction of the Washington Monument. I
thought it was done in two phases. Can you clarify? Also, what is
the current status of the monument's reconstruction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cornerstone of the monument to our first president was
laid in 1848, but quarrels over construction and lack of private
funds to support the project slowed work down. The Civil War
finally halted it completely. When the building resumed in 1880
with government funds and the War Department's Corps of Engineers
in charge, the new marble came from a different part of the same
Maryland quarry _ thus the color change about one-fourth of the way
up the monument's side. It was finished in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   There now are scaffolding and a translucent sheath around the
monument to protect workers as they patch the outside, replace the
lifting machinery in the elevator, which dates to 1959, and
renovate the heating and cooling system. For the first time in 110
years the Washington Monument is closed to the public until the
middle of May. It will be reopened for the summer tourist season
and closed again in August until repairs are finished.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The International Monetary Fund makes loans to countries in
need, as is currently proposed for Brazil. What is the collateral
for these loans? Are the loans ever repaid? What happens if the
loan is in default? Does the IMF ``foreclose'' on a country? Is the
term ``loan'' simply a euphemism for ``gift''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The IMF ls like a giant international credit union supported
by 182 member countries. Rather than asking for collateral, the IMF
issues loans in exchange for the implemetation of IMF-prescribed
corrective policies by the borrowing government. These
prescriptions are designed to remedy the situation that got the
country's economy in trouble in the first place, and the loans come
in installments as the country shows strong efforts in improving
its policies.
</P>
<P>
   No country has ever defaulted but some have been late in paying
back their loans. So far the IMF has been able to work with such
countries to get payments back on schedule. Obviously, the IMF
can't foreclose on or repossess a country, but, if a country failed
to pay back the IMF, it would be frozen out of credit markets
around the world, a devastating situation. So an IMF loan is hardly
a euphemism for a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We know that human habitation in space is limited by zero
gravity. Why was a spin-stabilized design that would generate
artificial gravity through centrifugal force not used in the design
of the international space station?
</P>
<P>
   A: A spin stabilized space station, like the great donut-shaped
stations in the movie 2001, would have been vastly more expensive
than the version of the International Space Station that is now
under construction. In view of the fact that it is likely to cost
$100 billion to build and operate for 10 years, economics have a
lot to do with the decision. The international partners are having
a hard enough time anteing up for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper published an article about the White House
Christmas decorations and pictured Hillary Rodham Clinton in what
looked like a very glittering setting. It all sounds very
expensive. Who pays for it, private contributors or U.S. taxpayers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pastry chef is paid by taxpayers, of course, and his
gingerbread house is federally financed, and the florists are
federal employees with a federal budget for flowers, wreaths, etc.
but much of the other stuff _ such as the White House Christmas
tree _ is donated and the Democratic National Committee pays for
some stuff such as the Christmas card.

 &HT;    Prince's resurrected song to get a lot of air time
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At long last, it's time 2 party like it's ``1999.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 16 years after a relatively unknown musician named
Prince released the ultimate party song about closing down the
1900s, the apocalyptic disco dance tune ``1999'' is experiencing a
comeback this week.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. Records, which holds the rights to the song, has
reissued two versions of ``1999'' _ the original six-minute album
version and a 3:35 edited version _ to radio stations across the
country. This hasn't exactly thrilled The Artist (formerly known as
Prince), who feels his 18-year contract with the label was
exploitative. So he's planning to release seven brand new mixes of
the song on his own NPG label, including reggae and hip-hop
versions. However, he can't use a note from the original master,
which is owned by Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   _ MTV will air the video nonstop for 24-hours, beginning at
12:01 a.m. Saturday on sister station M2 (available to satellite
customers).
</P>
<P>
   _ VH1 is going to unveil the world premiere ``pop up'' version
of the tune on its ``Pop Up Video/New Year's Edition'' at 11 p.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ No doubt, the organ-fueled song will be a staple at year-end
blowouts around the world. (Can't you just see everyone doing that
``two thousand zero zero'' hand move to the sound of popping
corks?)
</P>
<P>
   All this is translating into a gold mine of exposure, and no
doubt broadcast royalties, for the Purple One himself, who is said
to be planning his own live version of the anthem when he previews
his new EP on Friday and Saturday at the MGM Grand's Studio 54 in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone had kind of forgotten about the song, but
then Warner Bros. sparked interest again,'' says Tom Calderone,
senior vice president of music and talent for MTV. ``It reminded us
that it's a great video, and we played it first. So we figure
`1999' will get about 300 plays over New Year's on M2 and MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether The Artist was aware of the song's
phenomenal marketing potential back in the early '80s when he wrote
and recorded ``1999,'' an irresistible pop song whose lyrics were
interpreted by some as a reaction to the Reagan-era military
buildup. The then-23-year-old wasn't a star and had never had a
major hit. The single stalled on the charts, only to be eclipsed by
the second release from the ``1999'' album, the Top 10 hit ``Little
Red Corvette.'' After that success, Warner Bros. re-released
``1999,'' which came with a splashy, sequined video featuring a
hair-sprayed Prince with members of what would later become his
most famous band, the Revolution. As a result, the song went to No.
12 on the Billboard pop charts during the summer of 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it says a lot about the foresight of somebody like
Prince to do a song like that so long ago,'' says Loren
``Hollywood'' Henderson, producer of the morning show on rap
station Hot 97.5. ``It's like an insurance policy _ he's cashing in
on it now.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV's Calderone can think of no other song ``that can actually
capitalize on the year mentioned in (its) title.''
</P>
<P>
   We're too late for ``December 1963'' by the Four Seasons. David
Bowie's ``1984'' came and went with little fanfare. Bryan Adams
recorded ``Summer of '69'' in 1984. Guess we'll have to wait for
the comeback of '70s pop duo Zager &AMP; Evans' hit ``In the Year
2525'' _ if we're still alive.

 &HT;    Recipe for success: Mother of Ricky shares Williams family
recipe
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At 10 a.m. on New Year's Day, tacos may not
sound too appetizing. But by the end of the Longhorns' four
quarters in the Cotton Bowl _ halftime even _ the favorite meal of
Ricky Williams' family will hit the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The souped-up taco meal, with cilantro and green onions in the
meat filling and two kinds of cheese on top, is so good that
Longhorn players have been known to call Sandy Williams, mother of
the University of Texas Heisman Trophy winner, for the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the kids were growing up we had these once or twice a
week,'' says Sandy, who learned how to make the tacos in
California. ``Now we have these for special occasions, when we want
to see each other. Other than Thanksgiving, this is the meal that
brings everyone together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's taught all her kids how to make the tacos, but she still
holds the trophy for preparing them. Oh, the girls do a pretty good
job, she says. ``And Ricky may claim that he can make them as good
or better than me. Yeah, right. He doesn't know the difference
between mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese. He just gets white
cheese,'' says his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky can run.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy can cook. Mommy Tacos, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Mommy Tacos
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 pounds ground lean beef or turkey
</P>
<P>
   1 beef bouillon cube (if using ground turkey)
</P>
<P>
   2 1-ounce packages taco seasoning mix
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon garlic powder (not salt)
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch green onions, chopped, including tops
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch cilantro, chopped, including stem
</P>
<P>
   1 head lettuce, shredded
</P>
<P>
   3 tomatoes, juice and seeds removed, diced
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 cups shredded mozzarella
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 cups shredded sharp cheddar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2 ripe avocados, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salsa to taste
</P>
<P>
   18-24 thick corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown meat, breaking up until
crumbly. Drain grease from meat. Stir taco seasoning mix into meat.
Fill each seasoning envelop with water and add. (If using ground
turkey, add 1 beef bouillon cube to enhance flavor.) Sprinkle in
chili powder and garlic powder.
</P>
<P>
   Combine chopped green onions and cilantro in a large bowl. Add
half of mixture to the meat mixture. Stir well and allow to simmer
about 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   To the remaining cilantro/green onion mixture, add the shredded
lettuce and diced tomato. Mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Place shredded cheeses in separate bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Place avocado slices in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Heat about an inch of oil in a Dutch oven or skillet and, using
tongs, dip tortilla in hot oil on each side briefly to soften. Then
fold tortilla in half and fry on both sides, about 10 seconds each.
Fry to desired crispness. (The Williams family preference is medium
soft.) Repeat with remaining tortillas. Drain taco shells on paper
towels.
</P>
<P>
   Assemble tacos as desired or in this order: meat, a sprinkle of
cheeses, cilantro/salad mix, sour cream, sliced avocado, salsa,
more cheese. (Hint: Use your hands to put the cheeses and salad
mixture on.)
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 18-24 tacos, depending on how heavy-handed with the
meat.
</P>
<P>
   Soft flour tortillas can be substituted if you want to be
healthy and avoid frying. Prepared taco shells also could be
substituted.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In one take this week.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: The sponsors of the censure push defeated in the House
Judiciary Committee made much of the fact that it called for a
joint congressional resolution that President Clinton would have to
sign like any other law. Does this mean he would have the option of
vetoing it, if it were to pass both chambers of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: The proposed censure resolution is not a bill or law; it is
an official reprimand. So long as both the House and Senate agree
to a censure of the president, he cannot ``veto'' it. A president
can choose to sign a censure to simply show that he admits the
charge and accepts the punishment. President Clinton already has
stated that he would sign such a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a program recently on Frank Lloyd Wright and the
tragedy he suffered with the murder of members of his family at his
home. Could you tell me what happened to the murderer?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the worst single incident of mass murder to occur in
Wisconsin, seven innocent people were murdered on Aug. 15, 1914 at
Taliesin, the estate of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The dead
included Mamah Bouton Borthwick, Wright's mistress, her two
children and four staff members. According to The Capital Times in
Madison, Wis., Herbert Fritz, one of two survivors, identified the
perpetrator as Julian Carleton, a servant who had been employed
earlier in the summer but whose last working day at Taliesin was to
have been Aug. 15. It wasn't clear whether he was leaving his job
on his own volition or was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   After bolting the doors and windows of the staff dining room,
Carlton set fire to the house. He then went to the other end of the
house where Borthwick and her two children were eating, and
attacked them with a hatchet. Carlton was found hiding underneath
the fire-ravaged house, semi-conscious and suffering a burned
esophagus from having swallowed hydrochloric acid. He died in jail
seven weeks later from starvation. Though he made two court
appearances before his death, he never revealed a motive and never
was tried.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently an insurance agent told me that life insurance death
benefits are free of income tax to the beneficiary. Is this true?
Or is it considered income and taxed as such by the IRS?
</P>
<P>
   A: In most cases, life insurance benefits are not taxable. There
are some exceptions to this rule. The benefits are taxable if the
policy was turned over to you for a price. Also, some portion of
the benefits may be taxable if you elect to receive them in a lump
sum rather than in installments. A detailed explanation of when and
if life insurance benefits are taxable can be found in IRS
publication 525. You can order a copy of it from the IRS at
1-800-TAX-FORM. It's also available on the IRS web site at:
http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/formspubs/pubs/p525toc.htm (The
section you'll want to look at is called Income Not Taxed.).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have several Series EE savings bonds I bought about 10
years ago. Are there are Web sites or other resources to tell me
how much they're worth before they are cashed in?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bureau of Public Debt has a Web site that addresses
savings bonds' valuations:
http:www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/sav.htm Then download the free
valuation application, Savings Bond Wizard (which is still in its
beta, or testing phase).
</P>
<P>
   Series EE bonds come in eight denominations: $50, $75, $100,
$200, $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000. You pay half the face
amount for them, and the bonds increase in price over 17 years to
the face value. That price increase stems from interest payments.
These are based upon a formula that's tied to five-year Treasury
rates. If five-year rates are high, then EE bonds can reach their
maturity value early.
</P>
<P>
   If you redeem Series EE bonds within five years of their issue
date, then you give up three months of interest as a penalty. After
five years there's no penalty, and those who cash in their bonds
receive their principal plus accumulated interest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few months ago, President Clinton announced that he would
be getting spiritual counseling from two or three prominent
Christian pastors. Who are the pastors, and what has happened since
the announcement?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Rev. Gordon MacDonald has spent at least two nights at
the White House in recent weeks, according to his office. MacDonald
is pastor of the Christian church Grace Chapel in Lexington, Mass.
Another spiritual adviser, the Rev. Tony Campolo, is an American
Baptist who teaches sociology at Eastern College in Pennsylsvania.
Campolo was with Clinton last Saturday during the impeachment
votes. A third clergyman is the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, minister at
Foundry United Methodist, the Washington church that the president
often attends. ``This is a zone of privacy,'' Wogaman told Cox
Newspapers when asked about his private counseling efforts with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item in the newspaper said that on Dec. 6, 1884, Army
engineers completed construction of the Washington Monument. I
thought it was done in two phases. Can you clarify? Also, what is
the current status of the monument's reconstruction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cornerstone of the monument to our first president was
laid in 1848, but quarrels over construction and lack of private
funds to support the project slowed work down. The Civil War
finally halted it completely. When the building resumed in 1880
with government funds and the War Department's Corps of Engineers
in charge, the new marble came from a different part of the same
Maryland quarry _ thus the color change about one-fourth of the way
up the monument's side. It was finished in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   There now are scaffolding and a translucent sheath around the
monument to protect workers as they patch the outside, replace the
lifting machinery in the elevator, which dates to 1959, and
renovate the heating and cooling system. For the first time in 110
years the Washington Monument is closed to the public until the
middle of May. It will be reopened for the summer tourist season
and closed again in August until repairs are finished.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The International Monetary Fund makes loans to countries in
need, as is currently proposed for Brazil. What is the collateral
for these loans? Are the loans ever repaid? What happens if the
loan is in default? Does the IMF ``foreclose'' on a country? Is the
term ``loan'' simply a euphemism for ``gift''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The IMF ls like a giant international credit union supported
by 182 member countries. Rather than asking for collateral, the IMF
issues loans in exchange for the implementation of IMF-prescribed
corrective policies by the borrowing government. These
prescriptions are designed to remedy the situation that got the
country's economy in trouble in the first place, and the loans come
in installments as the country shows strong efforts in improving
its policies.
</P>
<P>
   No country has ever defaulted but some have been late in paying
back their loans. So far the IMF has been able to work with such
countries to get payments back on schedule. Obviously, the IMF
can't foreclose on or repossess a country, but, if a country failed
to pay back the IMF, it would be frozen out of credit markets
around the world, a devastating situation. So an IMF loan is hardly
a euphemism for a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We know that human habitation in space is limited by zero
gravity. Why was a spin-stabilized design that would generate
artificial gravity through centrifugal force not used in the design
of the international space station?
</P>
<P>
   A: A spin stabilized space station, like the great donut-shaped
stations in the movie 2001, would have been vastly more expensive
than the version of the International Space Station that is now
under construction. In view of the fact that it is likely to cost
$100 billion to build and operate for 10 years, economics have a
lot to do with the decision. The international partners are having
a hard enough time anteing up for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper published an article about the White House
Christmas decorations and pictured Hillary Rodham Clinton in what
looked like a very glittering setting. It all sounds very
expensive. Who pays for it, private contributors or U.S. taxpayers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pastry chef is paid by taxpayers, of course, and his
gingerbread house is federally financed, and the florists are
federal employees with a federal budget for flowers, wreaths, etc.
but much of the other stuff _ such as the White House Christmas
tree _ is donated and the Democratic National Committee pays for
some stuff such as the Christmas card.

 &HT;    Stockton fills Dawson's kicking shoes just fine
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSITY PARK, Texas _ Kris Stockton has had his moments,
talked some righteous trash.
</P>
<P>
   To defensive backs. In practice. Bold talk for a scout-team
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know the names of the plays; I just run them,''
Stockton said. ``I'll catch a few passes. When I make a play on a
first- or second-teamer, I'll say, `I burned you _ and I'm a
KICKER.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not what the muscular sophomore placekicker does with his
hands _ or his mouth _ that is the reason for this story. It's what
he's done with his right foot in replacing the most accurate kicker
in Texas Longhorns history.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would tell me I had big shoes to fill,'' Stockton said.
``I think they were trying to scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Phil Dawson would be enough to scare most kickers.
Dawson, who spent the season on the New England Patriots' practice
squad, finished his Longhorns career as the school's all-time
leader in scoring and field-goal accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concerned about following in his footsteps,''
Stockton said. ``I knew I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore from Katy made 16 of 21 field goals this year,
including 16 of 17 inside 49 yards, and hit game-winning field
goals against Oklahoma State and Texas A&AMP;M in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know a lot about Kris,'' UT Coach Mack Brown said.
``I knew he had a great leg, but I didn't know how he'd respond.
The only thing is Phil Dawson told me he'd be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Dawson had some advice for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil told me not to worry about what the coaches said. He
said, `You know what you're doing,' '' Stockton said. ``He said
just blow them off. Let it go in one ear and out the other.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman Stockton handled kickoffs in place of Dawson, who
handled only PATs and field goals as he recovered from
knee-reconstruction surgery. Last season, with Dawson at full
strength, Stockton redshirted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was the best thing for me,'' Stockton said. ``It
allowed me to step back, taste college life. The biggest part was
the mental factor. It threw me back. I didn't feel prepared at the
start of this year; didn't feel my focus was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stockton was able to hit a 52-yarder in his first
collegiate attempt, the second-longest first field-goal try in
school history (Mark Schultis tried and hit a 55-yarder in his
debut, against Texas Tech in 1994). Starting with a 48-yarder
against Oklahoma he hit nine straight, including three in a win
over Oklahoma State, the last a 29-yarder that glanced off the left
upright at the final gun in a 37-34 win. He had four against A&AMP;M,
coming back from misses from 50 and 28 yards to hit a 24-yarder in
the closing seconds for a 26-24 win.
</P>
<P>
   Hardee McCrary, the UT assistant coach who works with the
kickers, credits long-snapper Jay Humphrey and holder Bryan White
for assisting in Stockton's success. McCrary also said Stockton has
been effective on kickoffs, even though he has only 15 touchbacks
in 67 kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a pretty good job,'' McCrary said. ``Statistically
he's about 80 percent accurate at putting it where we want him
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton also handled the punting duties most of the season,
before giving way to Ryan Long. The double-duty was both a blessing
and a curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motions are different,'' Stockton said. ``When I was
punting it kept me focused in games. I was always focused, but it
was an added pressure. When you're backed up near the end zone,
it's scarier than trying a 44-yard field goal. If you shank it, it
could lead to an opponent's score.''
</P>
<P>
   With Long returning and recruit Shane Hudnall of Tyler Lee,
ranked one of the top kicking specialists in the nation, enrolling
at midterm, Stockton probably won't be required to continue
punting, though Hudnall could give him a challenge for the
placekicking job during spring practice.

 &HT;    All things considered, not a bad year for OSU's Diggs
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No man walked onto the Boston Red Sox roster in the '40s or '50s
and outhit Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Nor joined the Cleveland Browns in the '60s and outran Jimmy
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Nor became a Los Angeles Laker in the '80s and outplayed Magic
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Na'il Diggs did something close this year at Ohio State. In
his first year as a starter, he outplayed Andy Katzenmoyer, the man
considered at season's start the best linebacker in college
football.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't just the wild rantings of a writer. Diggs was
selected by the Big Ten coaches as a first-team all-conference,
Katzenmoyer wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   That's strong, because coaches look at films, not hype. What
they saw in the films was this 6-foot-4, 235-pound sophomore from
Los Angeles flying around, leading the Buckeyes in solo tackles,
tackles for loss and sacks.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in local terms, it's as if Diggs came to this town and
made a better bowl of gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   His first name, for the record, is pronounced ``Ny-ELL,'' and is
Arabic for ``the successful one.'' It was his father's idea, and
his father turned out to be prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like that name when I was in grade school,'' Diggs
said. ``Nobody ever got it right, so I just started signing my
name, `Nile.' Now I like it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs' secret isn't much of a secret at all. It's like asking
how Frank Lloyd Wright became a great architect. Well, let's see _
he studied.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs came to Columbus in 1997, a great athlete out of Los
Angeles but without a clue to the intricacies of the game. OSU
defensive coordinator Fred Pagac said all Diggs did in high school
was run to the ball, which was fine at that level. But not at this
one.
</P>
<P>
   When Pagac told him there is more to defense than running to the
ball, Diggs didn't argue, he set about to transform himself. He
watched what Katzenmoyer and Greg Bellasari did, and emulated them.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say he popped opponents' game tapes into the VCR and
ran them back and forth until the connector cords were smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs has become the king of tape study, so much so that he can
say with a straight face, ``Little things that teams do that they
don't know they do, I know they do.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a better way to put it, but no better way to do it.
Diggs digs football. There's a whole lot of talent involved, and a
whole lot of instinct, but the best of them study as if they're
trying to rewrite the equation for the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs knew next to nothing about Ohio State when he arrived in
Columbus for his official visit in 1997. He had originally signed a
letter-of-intent to go to Southern Cal, but when USC fired its
basketball coach, who had been dating Diggs' sister, Na'il took the
letter back, tore it in half and began looking again.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew about Ohio State was Eddie George and Terry
Glenn,'' Diggs said. ``I didn't know the tradition or the pride. I
didn't know that everybody in Columbus bleeds Buckeyes. But I found
out quick. When I made my visit, Stanley Jackson and Eddie showed
me around and sold me.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed before he left to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I like the most?'' Pagac said. ``All he's gonna
do is get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, when the Buckeyes play Texas A&AMP;M in the Nokia
Sugar Bowl, Diggs will be at his outside linebacker spot, looking
for the Aggies to give away the next play without even knowing
they're doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's had three weeks to study films. And he's seen the
little things.

 &HT;    Legal eclipse puts Moon Pie dessert on the wane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Kudzu Cafe doesn't sell RC Cola, and it can no
longer sell its Moon Pie dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta restaurant, which sold a mountainous chocolate
dessert called the Kudzu Ice Cream Moon Pie, has settled a federal
trademark lawsuit filed by Moon Pie-maker Chattanooga Bakery. Kudzu
now calls its high-calorie dessert the Kudzu Ice Cream Pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a favorable settlement for us,'' Chattanooga Bakery
executive Tory Johnston said of the confidential agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga Bakery began making Moon Pies in 1917 and now sells
more than 50 million a year. The sales numbers didn't get fat until
the 1950s, when country duo Lonzo and Oscar recorded ``Give Me an
RC Cola and a Moon Pie,'' securing the chocolate wafer and
marshmallow sandwich a permanent spot in Southern pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu Cafe began selling its Moon Pie dessert six years ago. In
response to Chattanooga Bakery's lawsuit filed in May, the
restaurant said it did not know that anyone claimed the trademark
or brand name rights to Moon Pie. Instead, the restaurant said, it
believed the term Moon Pie was the ``generic'' name of a chocolate
wafer and marshmallow sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Kudzu's $6.95 dessert item is much more
extravagant than the genuine Moon Pie. It has two fudge brownies
sandwiched around layers of vanilla ice cream, creme de menthe,
marshmallows and peanuts, topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and
more peanuts.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A multicultural America for kids from _ William
Bennett?
 &HT;    (Eds: This is the column that normally moves on Thursdays,
moving early this week to accommodate holiday deadlines.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose I've outed myself, if anyone saw me slinking out of
the bookstore with a copy of William Bennett's ``The Children's
Book of America.'' A lifetime of cultivated iconoclasm blown in a
rash moment of public cultural conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is one of the era's genuine pains in the neck, a common
scold for whom most Americans are a perpetually failed people,
little if any better than the good-time Charlies of Sodom and
Gomorrah. I suppose Bennett, with Dr. Laura and our other plaster
saints, must live a seamlessly virtuous life, for which I
congratulate him and can only wish _ I'm sure hopelessly _ that he
would keep it to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I snatched up his kid's book to add to the little
library we keep at the house for reading to our granddaughters, one
newly 6 and the other just about 5.
</P>
<P>
   The time will come when they will hear from scolds on the other
cultural shore that this is a sexist and racist country, and a
military bully to boot _ the degraded last gasp of a worthless
civilization wrought by dead European white men.
</P>
<P>
   Well, nobody's perfect. And while all this is whipped-up
nonsense, it IS true that the country enslaved Africans, segregated
their descendants and gave Native Americans an ever-shorter end of
the stick.
</P>
<P>
   But there is time for dealing with our lapses later in their
lives, when a nuanced understanding is possible. I want Shelby and
Chelsea to begin by knowing they are part of a decently intentioned
nation, with good stories to tell of itself; a nation that, as no
other before it had, lit the lamp of liberty and held it up as a
beacon to a world on which little such light had ever fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, happy to say, delivers all the standard and welcome
tropes of juvenile Americana with pride and patriotism _ and
delivers some surprises, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the tall tale of Paul Bunyan, the story of the first
Thanksgiving, the lovely legend of Johnny Appleseed, the power of
steel-drivin' John Henry. The lyrics of patriotic songs are treated
as poems _ ``America the Beautiful'' and others.
</P>
<P>
   But there are fine additions to the canon. Our soapbox
rightists, Bennett ironically among them, deplore
``multiculturalism'' as somehow un-American, but Bennett's book is
comfortably multicultural, beginning with the Asian, black and
native, as well as the white, kids on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Women star, as in the stories about Abigail Adams and, new to
me, the philanthropist ``Margaret of New Orleans.'' There's a
Native American folk tale. Slavery is not ignored, with the moving
story of a slave mother so forlorn she had to be talked out of
drowning herself and her baby. Father Junipero Serra builds
missions up the California coast. Martin Luther King Jr. confronts
discrimination. Immigrants are hymned in Emma Lazarus's ``The New
Colossus.'' Even gay America is there, sort of, though
unacknowledged, in poet Walt Whitman's ``I Hear America Singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rightly unapologetic in rehearsing the old tales, Bennett also
has found new stories to nurture children growing up in an America
different from the one he and I grew up in. Good for him. Good for
us.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ Iris Murdoch, the celebrated author of 26
rigorously intellectual novels, stood uncertainly in the doorway of
her living room, her face frozen in the blank expression that is a
sure badge of Alzheimer's disease. It was only when she saw her
husband, the critic, professor and novelist John Bayley, that a
flicker of comprehension sparked in her eyes. But it was gone, as
quickly as it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, darling,'' Bayley said tenderly, as if speaking to a
beloved child. ``Wouldn't you like to come and sit down?''
</P>
<P>
   It felt at first like a terrible intrusion, being in the house
with the couple. It was unbearably sad to see the once-brilliant
Miss Murdoch, 79, shuffle slowly into the room, sit stiffly and
then do nothing but stare intently ahead. And it was unbearably sad
when Bayley began explaining in his unself-pitying, slightly
quizzical way what life is like now that Alzheimer's has his wife
firmly in its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But Bayley and Miss Murdoch, whose relationship began more than
40 years ago when he saw her bicycling past his window in Oxford
and fell instantly in love, have never had an ordinary
relationship. And by the end of a morning with them, it was
impossible not to believe that _ however odd it may seem _ they
have made their peace, and are alone together in a world that
somehow suits them.
</P>
<P>
   Bayley, who at 73 seems like a wholly sweet and slightly
eccentric uncle, dressed in indifferently fitting, indifferently
laundered clothes with a few strands of fluffy white hair flowing
from the back of his otherwise bald head, makes a passionate case
for this view in his new memoir, ``Elegy for Iris.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which is being published in the United States by St.
Martin's Press, has drawn glowing reviews, both as a lyric
description of the arc of a singular marriage and as an unflinching
account of the frustrations of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   There were slight rumblings in the British news media about
Bayley's motives for writing the book. Wasn't it cruel to expose
Miss Murdoch this way, they asked? But Bayley is not embarrassed by
his wife's state, and neither should anyone else be, he said.
``When something like this happens, you lose all sense of shame and
privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Bayley said, stuttering as he does when he
speaks quickly, he fought and raged against his wife's descent into
unknowingness. But he is past that now, and his anger has given way
to acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is no longer bringing the pair of us `closer and closer
apart,' in the poet's tenderly ambiguous words,'' he writes, in a
typically graceful passage. ``There is a certain comic irony _
happily, not darkly comic _ that after more than 40 years of taking
marriage for granted, marriage has decided it is tired of this and
is taking a hand in the game. Purposefully, persistently,
involuntarily, our marriage is now getting somewhere. It is giving
us no choice _ and I am glad of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into two parts. The first, ``Then,'' tells
how Bayley, a young and spectacularly unworldly scholar, was
smitten from the moment he glimpsed Miss Murdoch. But she, a
brilliant rising star who was then teaching philosophy at St.
Anne's College, Oxford, proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   When they embraced for the first time, speaking in a childish
shorthand, ``with arms around each other, kissing and rubbing
noses,'' he writes, he began to understand that she needed him as
much as he needed her.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding not to have children, they both went on to have
glittering careers, although Miss Murdoch's was the more public
success. As she was producing novel after novel and being made a
Dame of the British Empire, Bayley was making his own mark, as a
teacher (he retired several years ago as the Warton professor of
English literature at Oxford), reviewer and literary critic whose
many books include studies of Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen and Henry
James, as well as four novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegy for Iris'' is studded with literary references _ it is
clear that he has found solace in literature _ but in conversation
Bayley is so self-effacing that it is easy to forget his formidable
intellect.
</P>
<P>
   To him and his wife, marriage has always meant a refuge from
aloneness, a secure haven that allows them their independence
together. In an odd way, Bayley said, this has helped him deal with
the constraints of the present. He looks forward to the end of the
day, when his wife is safely asleep and he can pour himself a drink
and revisit the comforts of one of his favorite books, typically a
well-worn novel by Barbara Pym or Austen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solitary life is splendid, provided you can lead it with
someone else,'' he said. ``That's paradoxical, but it's extremely
true in our case. We've always had that sort of life; she had her
life, and I had mine. And now one can have that same sort of thing.
I do have that solitary life because she's there, and I couldn't
have it on my own. It would simply disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayley says he would not consider putting Miss Murdoch in a
nursing home unless she became completely unmanageable and no
longer recognized him. She grows agitated when he is away, and he
loses his purpose when he is alone. ``I don't know what to do by
myself when she's not there,'' he said.

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' the second part of the book, takes up their story in
the mid-1990s, when the first signs of Alzheimer's manifested
themselves. It is a chilling account. Miss Murdoch cannot find her
words during a question-and-answer session in Israel. She sets off
for London and returns three hours later, having forgotten where
she was going.
</P>
<P>
   She has trouble writing, for the first time ever (the novel she
is working on, ``Jackson's Dilemma,'' turned out to be her last,
and Murdoch aficionados were puzzled by the inconsistencies in
character and plot). Later, when a doctor asks her who the prime
minister is, she is stymied. ``She had no idea but said to him with
a smile that surely it didn't matter,'' Bayley writes.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, Miss Murdoch didn't seem aware of what was happening
and didn't rebel against it, partly because she never had much of a
sense of self, anyway, Bayley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have a great deal of consciousness of her own,'' he
said. ``Coleridge mentioned the distinction between writers who
live entirely in their selves and writers like Shakespeare who seem
to live a complex external life inside their creations. Iris was
like that. She was extremely sociable and liked to hear about other
people's lives, but she was very incurious about her own.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bayley finished the book a year ago, Miss Murdoch could
have occasional conversations. Very rarely, she still shows
flickers of her old self, but her condition is much worse now. He
has to lock the front door so she won't wander down the street. He
can't take her swimming in the river they have always loved, for
fear that she will suddenly forget how to swim. One of the high
points of their days together is when ``Teletubbies,'' a children's
television show, comes on.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch is like ``a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband
says, and she needs to be fed, bathed and changed. And there is the
constant strain of meals to be prepared, of dishes to be done, of a
house to keep clean.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have always been careless housekeepers, at best, and
now Bayley admits that he has all but given up. Indeed, their house
is shockingly untidy. Coats are piled high on the kitchen floor,
dirty dishes cover the breakfast table, and the living room is a
hodgepodge of books, old coffee cups, plants in various stages of
decrepitude and what looks like a lifetime's worth of detritus.
</P>
<P>
   But friends say that Bayley is a classically eccentric Oxford
don, one of a breed who have always been famously indifferent to
their surroundings. And Bayley is adamant that he doesn't want, or
need, any help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would get fussed and bothered if someone came and
did it,'' he said. ``For one thing, they'd want to do it according
to much higher standards.'' He chuckled. ``I really don't see any
point in trying to clear it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, Bayley said, he feels the Iris of today _ the
shuffling, uncomprehending Iris _ is the same Iris he knew before,
the one of the sparkling conversation and the endlessly questioning
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's not only the same person, but it's always been the
same person,'' he explained. ``Though I have a very good memory _ I
can remember where we went and what we did _ I can't remember the
feel of it, you see, the sensation of a person who was completely
normal. It's partly a good thing, because she seems perfectly
normal to me at present.''

   For the first time in their long life together, he says, they
are completely entwined, entirely symbiotic. It is a sensation he

   ``Every day, we are physically closer,'' Bayley writes in
``Elegy for Iris.'' ``And Iris' little `mouse cry,' as I think of
it, signifying loneliness in the next room, the wish to be back
beside me, seems less and less forlorn, more simple, more natural.
She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over, and under the
dark escort of Alzheimer's, she has arrived somewhere. So have I.''

   What does he mean? He tries to explain, as a visitor gets up to
leave and is rewarded by the sudden, sweet flash of a smile across
Miss Murdoch's face and a delighted mumble during a goodbye
embrace. ``You feel that they can't do anything else to you, so to
speak,'' he explained. ``It's a loss of fear.''

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After a couple of hours of watching the recent impeachment
debate in Congress, I wondered if I was watching Christian
television instead of C-SPAN.
 &HT;    In a day of speeches, House members pontificated on the Bible
nearly as much as they addressed the Constitution.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, congressional Bible-quoting fell along
strictly partisan lines. Republicans most often cited Old Testament
moral prohibitions -- especially the Ten Commandments. Democrats
favored the New Testament. They frequently quoted Jesus: ``Judge
not, lest you be judged'' and ``Let he who is without sin cast the
first stone.''
 &HT;    This biblical partisanship reflects deep divisions in our
nation's theological consciousness. Republicans, whose public
theology is largely shaped by conservative Christianity, tend to
depict God as a wrathful deity. Democrats, whose civic piety is
determined by religious liberalism, preach a God of love.
 &HT;    When looking to scripture to support public religious
pronouncements, Republicans turn toward the stern God of the Old
Testament. Democrats find the forgiving Jesus of the New Testament
more appealing. One side warns of judgment, the other proclaims
mercy.
 &HT;    Accordingly, God either wants Bill Clinton condemned or welcomed
home like the Prodigal Son. Since the Republicans hold the
majority, God-as-Judge won in the House of Representatives.
 &HT;    This is, however, problematic. Public theology is about as
textured as a piece of typing paper. Bible-spouting aside, most
congressional representatives proved themselves lousy theologians
in this argument.
 &HT;    During the debate, Congress fell for the oldest trick in the
book: dividing God into neat categories of justice and mercy. In
the second century, a church leader named Marcion argued much the
same thing -- that the New Testament taught a Gospel of Love over
and against the Old Testament's wrathful God.
 &HT;    Other Christians rejected this view, insisting instead on a
fundamental unity between the two testaments. The God of the Old
Testament and the God of the New are, in spite of the theological
disagreements between Jews and Christians, the same God.
 &HT;    Although this position became orthodoxy, Christian tradition
continued to struggle with the tension between God's justice and
love. For most of its history, the church has tended to emphasize
God's justice over God's mercy. Very few Christians understand the
orthodox position: God is both just and merciful at the same time.
 &HT;    In the 16th century, the problem of justice and mercy tormented
the Protestant reformer Martin Luther. Convinced he would be
rightly damned for his sins, Luther could not conceive of a loving
God. Indeed, Luther said he hated God because of God's unrelenting
justice.
 &HT;    After years of prayer and study, Luther realized that God is,
indeed, just. But God's justice is not distant and condemning
judgementalism that sends sinners to hell. Rather, God justifies
humankind through grace. Luther became convinced that God's justice
is God's grace that justifies -- ``makes right'' -- humanity. God
does not condemn. God makes us holy -- no matter how bad or sinful
we have been.
 &HT;    Luther's theological realization, referred to as the Lutheran
paradox, is the heartbeat of biblical faith. The Old Testament God
is not a wrathful judge. Rather, throughout scripture God is a
wooing lover calling creation into union with the divine presence.
Justice melts into mercy; and vengeance belongs only to God's
mysterious providence. God's justice is God's love; God's love is
God's justice.
 &HT;    What has all this to do with Bill Clinton and Congress? Plenty.
God's justice is that God loves Bill Clinton, Ken Starr -- all
those desperate Democrats and those mean Republicans alike. And
God's love is that none of them know -- or begin to understand --
the counsels of God. Whatever they do, is ultimately nothing. It
is, as the Old Testament teaches, ``The flower that fades, the
grass that withers.'' Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.
 &HT;    However relevant this paradox may be, public theology can never
embrace it. By its nature, civic piety demands clarity. So,
Bible-quoting politicians proclaim they know the mind of God.
Condemn with glee. Forgive and forget. Paradox can not exist in
this clear-cut, vote-counting world.
 &HT;    Watching the president, however, on the White House lawn after
the vote, I thought: ``This man finally understands.'' Clinton said
nothing glib that Saturday afternoon. He was, in effect, without
words.
 &HT;    But for those with eyes to see, God's justice was momentarily
visible. Throughout, Hillary held his hand. It was not public
theology; it was the mystery of love. The paradox of the one most
wronged still standing with her beloved.
 &HT;    A wife and her errant husband. God and straying humanity. Mercy
redeems sin. Hillary Clinton, rather than a scripture-spouting and
self-righteous Congress, embodies biblical virtue.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Weather was the really big story of '98
 &HT;    For release Jan. 3, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of 299 Associated Press newspaper editors resulted in
the Clinton-Lewinsky soap opera being chosen the year's top story.
Here's a dissent.
</P>
<P>
   I really don't understand how the editors could not see the
really big picture right in front of their face, falling at their
feet, smashing at their homes, killing and maiming.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about weather. That was the biggest story of the
year, made so by its worldwide impact and the growing uncertainty
of what lies ahead for us in climatic change.
</P>
<P>
   It has been estimated by the Washington-based Worldwatch that
32,000 people died in 1998 from weather disasters and 300 million
more were driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   We have been so absorbed by the smut and politics of
Clinton-Lewinsky that we seemingly have overlooked the fact that
global weather is going through a permutation _ and not slowly. In
1998, this planet took a heavy hit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Summer floods in China killed 3,656 and destroyed 5.6 million
homes in an area roughly the size of Italy. Bangladesh suffered its
most extensive flooding of the century; one-fourth of its entire
population was displaced. In India, a cyclone and accompanying
tidal wave swept away an estimated 14,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Florida, fires destroyed 485,000 acres, caused 30,000
people to be evacuated. Oregon suffered its worst flooding since
1996. And arid conditions in Texas and Oklahoma resulted in $4
billion in agricultural losses. A January 1998 ice storm in the
Northern states and Canada brought horrendous power outages and
glacial temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Associated Press reported that 1998 likely was the
costliest year on record for weather disasters, while Worldwatch
estimated that the cost of those economic disasters was about $89
billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before Hurricane Mitch formed, Georges was the year's monster
storm, sweeping across the spine of the Greater Antilles and
bringing death, mudslides and widespread destruction. Mitch
followed, and Central America will have to spend an entire decade
(and money it doesn't have) trying to rebuild its towns and
infrastructure. Mitch killed 9,000 and has been judged to be the
deadliest Atlantic storm in two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The change in weather has been dramatic. Reportedly, we
experienced our warmest global temperatures in 600 years. Then
there were El Nino and its sister counterpart, La Nina. As Time
magazine reported, these weather phenomena were blamed for 30-foot
waves off California and houses there sliding into the ocean; for
surprisingly powerful Pacific hurricanes, deadly flash floods in
Peru and Ecuador, typhoons in Japan, torrential rains in East
Africa, fires in Indonesia, snowstorms in Mexico and arid
conditions in Australia. So odd was the year that on a day it was
snowing in Guadalajara, Mexico, the temperature read 50 degrees
Fahrenheit in Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal weather conditions followed us right to the end of the
year, with a deadly cold wave that swept Eastern Europe, brought
ice to Paris in early December and caused heavy flooding in the
United States' Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, we are going through climatic change. Eventually,
it will effect us all in one way or another. It will have a far
longer-lasting impact than Clinton-Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about storms that were the strongest in two
centuries, about the greatest weather-related economic losses in
history, about global temperatures that were the warmest in six
centuries!
</P>
<P>
   The AP poll listed a news package of Hurricanes Georges and
Mitch as the fourth biggest story of the year (behind
Clinton-Lewinsky, baseball's McGwire-Sosa and the world economic
turmoil). Those editors didn't recognize a really big story when
they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch and Georges should not have been isolated from the other
ruinous weather stories of the year. They were part of a cosmic
pattern. Together, they form a terrible tableau of tragedy.

IRAQ VOWS TO CONTEST NO-FLY AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shrugging off an airstrike on one of its missile
batteries, Iraq renewed its threat Tuesday to shoot down US
warplanes patrolling two ``no-fly zones'' that cover most of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad pledged to continue challenging US fighter jets flying
over Iraq with antiaircraft fire. And a senior Iraqi official said
Iraqi warplanes had begun patrolling the no-fly zone in the face of
US warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is still on,'' said Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan. ``Our resistance will continue against any violation'' of
Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, France announced Tuesday that its air force had
ceased participation in the Western air patrols over southern Iraq
following the US-British bombing campaign earlier this month. US
diplomats said France is considering withdrawing from the operation
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   US officials sought to play down the threat to its pilots from
Iraq as bluster. An administration official said the Iraqi air
force typically flexes its wings as a show of defiance following
confrontations with the United States. They said US fighter pilots
would meet any serious Iraqi challenge with force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously take any threats by the Iraqis very seriously,''
said White House national security spokesman David Leavy. ``But as
President Clinton said, the no-fly zones are a key component of our
containment policy and our pilots will take appropriate action to
protect themselves and carry out their mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which suspended Tuesday's flights over northern
Iraq because of bad weather, said it encountered no Iraqi aircraft
in patrols over southern Iraq. But an administration official
acknowledged that Iraqi warplanes had briefly entered the no-fly
zone two or three times since the United States and Britain ended
their four-day bombing campaign on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen is militarily insignificant,'' said an
official who requested anonymity. ``He'll test and probe and make
some incursion into the no-fly zone. It's kind of like a boy who
sticks his head in his big brother's room and shouts: nyah, nyah.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and France imposed the no-fly zones
over northern and southern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War to
prevent Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from crushing resistance
among the country's Kurdish and Shiite Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has never accepted the legitimacy of the patrols,
describing them as a violation of the country's sovereignty and of
the UN Charter. But the country has generally steered clear of
challenging the superior Western warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' Ramadan
said at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the French withdrew from the patrols over northern
Iraq. Anne Gazeau-Secret, a spokeswoman for the French Foreign
Ministry, told reporters in Paris Tuesday that France had ceased
its participation in the patrols over southern Iraq on Dec. 16, the
day the United States and Britain launched Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The French contribute five Mirage 2000-C planes, two Mirage
F1-CRs and a tanker aircraft to Operation Southern Watch, according
to Gazeau-Secret. They have 175 people stationed in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Iraq's tough talk, a Pentagon spokesman said US pilots
in southern Iraq faced no ``disturbances'' Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were normal for the no-fly zone missions and we have
been flying every day,'' said Captain Michael Shavers, a US
military spokesman in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   US officials insisted that a decision to suspend flights over
northern Iraq were not prompted by a skirmish on Monday between US
fighters jets and an Iraqi air defense battery near Mosul.
</P>
<P>
   The US said American F-16 and F-15 fighter pilots destroyed the
missile battery after the Iraqis opened fire on them with three
surface-to-air missiles. Baghdad said four Iraqi soldiers were
killed and seven injured in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq continued to insist, and the United States continued to
deny, that a US airplane was shot down during Monday's missile
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a public pledge of support for its cause from Libya
Tuesday, Iraq acknowledged that it had little hope of convincing
Arab leaders preparing for a major summit in Cairo next month to
take its side in the battle with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a summit, if it convenes or not, will not do much for us
at this stage,'' Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Iraq is objecting to longstanding UN procedures for
removing tens of thousands of land mines and unexploded munitions
in the Kurdish-dominated north of the country, diplomats said
Tuesday, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi grievance, sent in a letter to Secretary General Kofi
Annan, was discussed at Russia's request during a closed-door UN
Security Council session, which avoided a general debate on its
policy toward Iraq. Britain said the complaint was baseless but
there was no immediate resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Foreign Minister Saeed al-Sahaf objected to two
UN subcontractors and two nongovernmental groups removing mines in
northern Iraq since February without Baghdad's permission. Al-Sahaf
told Annan that Iraq shoul be responsible for removing them.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said contracting out the work violated council
resolutions on the need to ``respect Iraq's territorial integrity
and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   But British ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock said the United
Nations, not the Baghdad government, was in charge of humanitarian
activities in northern Iraq, according to council resolutions on
the UN ``oil-for-food'' humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Iraq contributes to the food and medicine
program but it is up to the United Nations to bring in the help
that it needs to complete the program under the resolutions, so
what's the fuss?'' the envoy told Reuters.

both survived and this year have become television monsters. By

 &HT;    Disgusting ``BASEketball'' is rudely, crudely hilarious
 &HT;    By Steve Murray

<P>
   ``BASEketball'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Even without Monica and Bill, 1998 could be remembered as one
crude year. That's not only thanks to the Farrelly Brothers and
``There's Something About Mary'' (which hits video stores Feb. 2),
but also ``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. In
this zesty, disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy (actually written by
director David Zucker), they play two slackers who invent a hybrid
of baseball and basketball that becomes a national sport. The movie
manages to be racist, sexist, homophobic and just about everything
else offensive. But it does so in a way that kiddingly tweaks the
very notion of political correctness. Rated R for profanity and
gross-out humor. Grade: B

 &HT;    Mini reviews of movies on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``High Art'' (R) _ Ally Sheedy plays a once-famous lesbian
photographer who years ago dropped out of the sharky New York art
world. She's rediscovered by a young magazine editor (Rhada
Mitchell), who is lured into Sheedy's world of strung-out,
late-night parties and into her bed. Lisa Cholodenko's independent
film is a moody, beautifully nuanced meditation on the uses and
abuses of art, love, heroin and other potent substances. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Avengers'' (PG) _ At least visually, this update of the
1960s British TV series pays witty homage to the original's vein of
Carnaby Street surrealism. In between sips of champagne and
civilized quips, secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs.
Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) foil criminals plotting against the British
government. But there are two main problems: a half-baked script
and Thurman, who is trumped by the cool, feline memory of the
original Emma, Diana Rigg. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mr. Jealousy'' (R) _ A small-scaled, smart-talking charmer.
Eric Stoltz is so jealous of his new girlfriend's (Annabella
Sciorra) romantic past that he joins a therapy group to spy on her
ex (Chris Eigeman). Noah Baumbach's hip neurotics may not be like
Woody Allen characters, but they're a lot like people who grew up
on Woody Allen movies. And while the film never entirely satisfies
as a rich romantic comedy, it's an accomplished, pleasant
diversion. Grade: B

 &HT;    When Hollywood can't leave well enough alone
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Wilder said it as well as anyone could. He likened movie
remakes to ``running into a girlfriend you slept with 30 years
ago.'' Yet Hollywood keeps (re)making them. Just this month, we've
seen remakes of ``Psycho,'' ``Mighty Joe Young'' and ``The Shop
Around the Corner'' (reworked into ``You've Got Mail''). Other
remakes in the pipeline range from ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' to
``The Night of the Iguana.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a remake is a good idea. David Cronenberg's 1986
version of ``The Fly'' comes to mind. But most of the time, the old
adage holds: If it ain't broke . . .
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few examples of remakes that should never have been
made. In each case, our consumer tip is: Rent the original!
</P>
<P>
   `King Kong'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The original: Made in 1933. Stars Fay Wray, King Kong and the
Empire State Building. Rightly regarded as one of the classic
motion pictures of all time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The remake: Made in 1976. Best remembered as the movie that
almost ended Jessica Lange's career _ and it was her first movie.
In her screen test, King Kong was played by a pillow tied to a
bedpost. In the movie, the Empire State Building is played by the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   `Scarface'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The original: Made in 1932. Produced by Howard Hughes,
directed by Howard Hawks and starring Paul Muni. This thinly
disguised take on the life and crimes of mob king Al Capone is one
of the films that helped define the Hollywood gangster movie.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The remake: Made in 1983. Directed by Brian De Palma, written
by Oliver Stone and starring Al Pacino. Capone, Chicago and
Prohibition are replaced by the Marielitos, Miami and the drug
trade. Worse, a powerful story of a gangster's rise and fall
becomes a mishmash of cocaine freaks and chain saws. But if you
look past the mountains of cocaine, the gore and the overacting,
you can glimpse a young Michelle Pfeiffer as Pacino's trophy moll.
</P>
<P>
   `Stagecoach'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The original: Made in 1939. Directed by John Ford, the master
of the Hollywood western. On board are John Wayne, Claire Trevor,
Andy Devine, Thomas Mitchell, John Carradine and Donald Meek. The
movie made Wayne, then a struggling B-movie actor, a star. And
though it came out the same year as ``Gone With The Wind,'' it was
his role here as a genially drunken doctor that won Mitchell his
Oscar as best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The remake: Made in 1966. Directed by Gordon Douglas, whose
major claim to fame was the ``Our Gang'' comedies. On board are
Ann-Margret, Mike Connors, Red Buttons, Robert Cummings, Bing
Crosby and Stephanie Powers. Alec Cord plays the Ringo Kid, i.e.,
the John Wayne role. It didn't have the same transforming effect on
his career.
</P>
<P>
   `101 Dalmatians'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The original: Made in 1961. An animated feature including one
of Disney's most memorable villains: the fur-hungry Cruella De Vil
(voiced by Betty Lou Gerson). Made before the miracle of
computer-generated images, the picture took 300 animators and three
years to make.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The remake: Made in 1996. Now a cartoonish live-action film,
it stars Glenn Close as Cruella. John Hughes produced and wrote the
script, which explains the interminable finale, which plays like a
feeble rehash of ``Home Alone'' with 99 puppies sharing the
Macaulay Culkin part.
</P>
<P>
   `Born Yesterday'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The original: Made in 1950. Directed by George Cukor and
starring Judy Holliday, William Holden and Broderick Crawford.
Holliday almost wasn't cast as Billie Dawn, the smart-cookie ``dumb
blonde'' she had created on Broadway; mogul Harry Cohn dismissed
her as ``that fat Jewish broad.'' But with a little help from a
pair named Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, who showcased her
in their ``Adam's Rib,'' Holliday won the part. And the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The remake: Made in 1993. It looked good on paper: baby-voiced
Melanie Griffith as Billie and John Goodman in the Crawford part.
OK, so Don Johnson, then married (actually, remarried) to Griffith,
might not be everyone's idea of the next Bill Holden. But the film
was a misguided disaster that seriously damaged Grifffith's career
and her marriage. The career continued; the marriage didn't.

TRAVEL INDUSTRY FEARS COMPUTER NIGHTMARE IN MILLENNIUM 
PREPARATIONS 
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Planes absolutely, positively will not fall out of the sky
because of the Year 2000 computer flaw, aviation experts insist. It
is possible, though, that some will not leave the gate.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of other computer-controlled systems, from hotel door
locks to trains to ordinary traffic signals, could stop working.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem, known to the digerati as Y2K, occurs when
computers that store the year portion of a date as a two-digit
number are confronted with the year after 1999 and conclude that 00
means 1900. In isolation, a computer that is confused about the
date would be a minor annoyance, but computers that are linked
together _ like those in the air traffic control system _ could
stop talking to each other and freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every industry faces problems, but travel and,
specifically, aviation could be particularly vulnerable because of
a huge number of linked systems. The Federal Aviation
Administration, prompted by Y2K to make its first thorough
inventory of hardware and software, counted 155 systems that are
``mission critical'' and must be repaired in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency said that it has found relatively few problems,
and has nearly completed its search, having designed fixes for 153
of the 155 systems. It must still make those changes on computers
in the field and test them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very short time to finish what's left,'' said
Raymond Long, the head of the FAA's $191 million Y2K effort, but he
said that the agency would be ready. It is now turning its focus to
what others in the business, like airlines and airports, are doing
about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic airlines sound confident that they will avoid Y2K
problems, but only after a huge effort. The Air Transport
Association, the trade organization made up mainly of the big
American airlines, allocated $15 million n 1998 and 1999 on Y2K,
mostly on the gathering and dissemination of information; that is
more than the group spent on all activities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But planes will not crash, said Thomas J. Browne, the director
of the association's Y2K program. The only part of a plane that
really needs to know the date, he said, is the flight management
computer, which handles navigation and related chores.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the plane pushes back from the gate, that
computer receives a data feed from a computer on the ground. If the
on-board computer cannot handle the data it is given, it will
display an error message like ``date out of range,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that can be resolved quickly, he added, ``The pilot will
look at it and say, `I'm not taking off in this airplane.' '' Thus,
he said, ``There's no safety-of-flight issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine an FAA inspector walking in to an airline on
Jan. 2 and saying, `All your flights are grounded because all your
pilots' medical exams expired 100 years ago,' '' Browne said. But
the airlines all have written records, too, he said, if such
confusions arise.
</P>
<P>
   Other computers calculate passenger and cargo loads and
integrate weather data to determine how much fuel should be loaded.
All that work can be done by hand, but not smoothly and promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign carriers, and especially foreign air-traffic control
systems, may lag behind their counterparts in the United States.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, acting on a motion
made by the head of the FAA, has agreed to require all member
nations to publicly report by next July 31 their progress in
preparing their air traffic control systems for the rollover.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said that it might ground some flights,
depending on how much progress is made at a destination. Other
airlines have not made public statements but are watching
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers can generally still handle traffic without
computers, just much less of it, meaning that a Y2K crisis might
make the system work the way it does when there is a computer crash
or a big snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   But for planes to fly, lots of other parts of airport systems
have to work correctly, including jetways, fueling systems and even
airport parking-lot cashier stations. Some airports are checking
with the companies that manufacture fire trucks to make sure that
the embedded computer chips in those trucks will not lock up; if an
airport has no fire truck, it must shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Airports differ in their level of preparedness, said Christopher
J. Tebo of the American Association of Airport Executives, and the
responsibility for equipment, like baggage systems or fuel systems,
differs from airport to airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines that see a problem can spend money immediately to solve
it. But, Tebo said, some airports are public entities with
cumbersome appropriations processes, and some did not foresee that
they would need more resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely going to be a level of inconvenience the
traveling public is going to incur,'' Tebo said. ``I don't know
whether it will be having to walk up escalators, or there won't be
as many flights to certain destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   If the system runs badly, he said, it could be like a day when a
major blizzard disrupts air service _ repeated daily for a month or
so.
</P>
<P>
   A few travel agencies are sounding cautious. Unicorn Holidays,
an English company that specializes in travel to Spain, France and
Portugal, does not plan to book any tours for New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The airplanes might work just fine, said Jim Southon, Unicorn's
managing director, but any of a thousand things could go wrong and
ruin a vacation. The computer that runs a municipal water
purification plant could fail _ or one that runs a ski lift, a
telephone system, a power system, an oil refinery that makes jet
fuel, or the traffic lights on the way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther one goes from the states or Northern Europe, the
more trouble there will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, of course, the outbound portion of the trip, in 1999, could
go just fine, but the vacation could be extended involuntarily
because something crucial stops working on Jan. 1, delaying the
return.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of the problems that could strike on a trip could
strike at home, too, perhaps even in St. Albans, north of London,
where Unicorn is based. But, Southon said, ``If you stayed home and
got into all types of problems, you wouldn't come back to me and
say it's my fault.''

REBOOT YOUR GIFT FROM MOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas was a lot simpler when you didn't have to reboot your
presents.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all American homes now contain a personal
computer, and that number will increase in 24 hours, as families
proudly unwrap their new Compaqs and iMacs. Those who already have
a machine or two may content themselves with the latest gaming
software, or perhaps an educational program.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these Christmas revelers will find that their gifts
don't work properly, or not at all. What then?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you can dial up a technical support hotline. Major
computer companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Apple Computer
Inc., will have Santa's helpers on call right through the holidays,
including Christmas Day. But this is their busy season, so bring
along a good book before dialing.
</P>
<P>
   You may have no choice if the computer is totally blitzed. But
if you can fire it up and log onto the Internet, abundant
assistance awaits. Among the handiest information sources are the
America Online and CompuServe computer networks. These services
have 14 million subscribers between them, and their tech forums are
crammed with hints and tips. Nearly every new computer comes with
software and instructions for getting onto AOL and CompuServe, and
the first 100 hours are free. These services are an excellent
lifeline for computer newbies.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're connected, you can venture onto the larger Internet,
where computer companies have published vast databases of
troubleshooting information about their products.
</P>
<P>
   If your new Windows 98 computer is acting up, maybe you should
get in touch with Microsoft Corp. The firm has built one of the
best support Web sites around, at http://www.microsoft.com/support.
If anything, you'll find too much information here--thousands of
detailed reports about computer problems both common and obscure.
Sometimes it's hard to weed out precisely the data you need.
</P>
<P>
   Which should lead you to another excellent Microsoft
resource--the company's own network of Usenet ``newsgroups.''
Actually, these are electronic bulletin boards where you can post a
message on a technical problem, come back in a few hours and read
replies that may help you sort things out. Microsoft's bulletin
boards are overseen by teams of volunteer computer experts called
MVPs--Most Valuable Professionals. They're generally people with
lots of hands-on experience with Microsoft products, and they've
saved my hide on more than a few occasions.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know how to set up your browser for Usenet access,
visit the DejaNews Web site (http://www.dejanews.com). Click on
``Browse Groups'' and then run a search under ``microsoft.public''
for a list of bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's on-line resources are unusually well-organized, but
you'll find plenty of help for other hardware and software
products. Check your instruction manuals; you'll find Internet
addresses for the companies that made the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Game software firms are especially well-represented. If that new
game won't work, visit the company Web site and see if they've
posted a ``patch''--a small program that repairs bugs in a larger
program. Of course it's outrageous that so many computer companies
sell software with known bugs, and force their customers to make
their own repairs. But there it is. Download the patch--and don't
forget to send a snarky e-mail message to the software company.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're on the lookout for software, be sure to visit
the Web site of the firm that made your computer. There you may
find new hardware drivers--little programs that allow the computer
to work with vital systems like the monitor, video card and sound
card. Some game programs won't work unless you've installed the
newest drivers, and if your computer sat on a store shelf for a
couple of months, those drivers may already need replacing. Drivers
are free, and can usually be downloaded and installed in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes no amount of good advice or new software patches will
get that Christmas present going. Sure enough, it's time to switch
the thing off and reboot. It's amazing how often this works. And
the technique has other benefits. Once the hum of the computer
fades, you may notice the laughter of your children at play or
carols on the radio. And maybe you'll decide you've got better
things to do than play Tomb Raider III.

MUSEUMS CHALLENGED BY WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON GARFINKLE   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Web poses a difficult challenge for museums _ one that few
are handling well. Some museums use their Web sites as glorified
brochures. They try to entice Web surfers to come to the museum and
they provide limited directions. They might even provide a
downloadable membership form, which visitors are encouraged to
print out, fill in, and send to the museum using an envelope and
stamp. Most of the time this is frustrating because most Internet
users will never be able to physically visit the museums they can
easily click to on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other museums have taken a different approach. Deciding that
their primary mission is education, and not fund-raising, these
museums have produced dramatic Web-based exhibits that have more
depth and information than anything you would ever see in a
gallery. These exhibits can be quite captivating if you have a
high-speed Internet connection, such as a cable modem or a DSL
line. Unfortunately, for people with a conventional dial-up modem,
a multi-media extravaganza can be more frustrating than uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising, I think, is the relatively small number
of museums that have taken a middle road and built Web sites that
complement their exhibits. This path is perhaps the hardest and the
most expensive to follow. Unlike a brochure, the Web site needs to
be rich with information. But since a complementary Web site must
be relevant to people who have seen the actual museum and those who
have not, such a site frequently needs original content, which
costs more money.
</P>
<P>
   A museum that has been extremely successful in pulling off this
balance is the Salem Witch Museum, with a Web site at
www.salemwitchmuseum.com. The site has general information about
the museum, including detailed maps that describe how to get there
both by public transportation and by car. There is information
about the witch trials of 1692. But there is also an on-line tour
of Boston communities with maps from 1692, drawings, contemporary
photographs, stories, and biographies of historical figures. This
site really involves the visitor, and it provides a lot of
information to a broad cross-section of Internet users that
couldn't really be conveyed in another way.
</P>
<P>
   Another museum that has pulled off the mix of the virtual and
the physical is the Computer Museum, with its Web site at
www.tcm.org. The site has information about the museum's current
exhibits; it also has on-line puzzles and activities that match the
exhibits at the Boston museum. And the Web site has a lot of
historic information about the history of computers, including a
``This Day In History'' page that changes every day. The real
problem with the Computer Museum's Web site is that many of the
site's features are buried and hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum (www.nasm.edu)
is a tremendously valuable on-line resource, with photographs of
aircraft, video clips, and lots of technical information. Many of
the photographs are large, detailed images that can take 30 seconds
or longer to download over the Internet. The museum has rightfully
realized that when people care deeply about the subject matter,
they are more than willing to wait for a big download.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of museums, the Smithsonian is worried about the
potential of theft from its Web site: one way the Smithsonian earns
revenue is by selling publication rights to its photographs. To
deal with this problem, the Smithsonian has put a watermark in the
corner of many of the high-resolution photographs on its site. The
watermark looks like those ``flying logos'' that are increasingly
shown on television channels. They don't prevent theft, but they
make it easier to track down copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Boston Museum of Science's Web site
(www.mos.org) comes up somewhat short. Although there are brochures
for the exhibits and calendars of special events, the museum could
do so much more. For example, the museum could have slide shows or
video clips that preview the Omni theater films; even better would
be an electronic commerce system that would let people purchase
tickets and reserve seats over the Internet. The Web site has
resources for science teachers, such as easy-to-create experiments.
But once again, the site doesn't push the power of the Internet:
most of the experiments are described just with text, rather than
with diagrams or photographs.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see the future of on-line museums, click to
www.imj.org.il, and take the Israel Museum's on-line tour. The Web
site uses a browser plug-in called WebGuide to give you a
virtual-reality tour through three galleries that pertain to the
Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. As you pass through each gallery, you
can click on an object to see it up close. The experience is very
effective, although it does take a considerable amount of time to
download the tour over those trans-Atlantic Internet links.

 &HT;    Genius a group effort in Morris band
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Pat Metheny is a household name, and Bill Frisell a beloved
cult figure, then Boston guitarist Joe Morris is the genius
inventor down the street you never hear about until one day _
kapow! _ when he figures out how to split the atom. On his latest
album Morris gets mighty close, although his distinctly personal
approach to the instrument rejects high-voltage pyrotechics for a
peculiarly metaphysical kind of fury.
</P>
<P>
   These seven instrumentals show off not only Morris' intricate
patterns of cleanly articulated notes _ an advance on the lessons
of 1960s avant-gardists such as Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor _
but a vigorously intuitive quartet whose collective verve radiates
an instantaneous joy. That's rarely more apparent than when
violinist Mat Maneri steps forward on the eight-minute title track,
engaging Morris in the kind of conversation musicians can have only
when they share an original language.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of recently released CDs
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray and Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``No Place That Far''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Evans. RCA. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Down-home Sara Evans has yet to break through to the commercial
mainstream, probably because she's a bit left of the Gap when it
comes to twang.(similar to) But this, her second album since being
plucked out of farm-girl obscurity, is as satisfying as her
uncluttered first effort (which was one of the best country albums
of 1997). With a voice much like the traditional pipes of Patty
Loveless, Evans is sassy and bold in her retro arrangements, which
sample the big-guitar sounds of Bakersfield, boast plenty of
fiddles and employ a pedal steel that should be opening and closing
an Opry show. No wonder: At the helm is producer Billy Sherrill
(Tammy Wynette). And that's George Jones on backing vocals. If
you're looking for new country music that's worth more than the CD
jewel box it comes in, skip the Billboard Top 20 and pick up Evans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc's Da Name''
</P>
<P>
   Redman. Def Jam. 24 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Though he claims that he's always high, Redman moves lithely
through clearly spoken, witty and often comical wordplay on ``Doc's
Da Name.'' It's an effort that should only bolster his
contradictory status as a rapper with ``platinum street
credibility'' _ as he boasts on ``I'll Bee Dat!''_ who has also
made three consecutive gold albums. The only hint that Redman might
be hindered by any chronic herbal indulgence is a reliance on the
same call-and-response structure as his earlier hit ``Whateva Man''
on this album's ``I Don't Kare.'' But before you just say ``no'' to
this, the self-licensed Funk Docta raises his skills above the
clouds on the soaring, searing team-up with drum-and-bass's Roni
Size on ``I Got a Seecret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flesh of My Flesh,
</P>
<P>
   Blood of My Blood''
</P>
<P>
   DMX. Def Jam. 19 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   DMX did as much to draw hip-hop listeners to his
2-million-selling debut seven months ago as he does to distance
them now. Instead of a muscular crowd-rouser like his ``Get at Me
Dog'' or a sweet, street love song comparable to ``How's It Going
Down,'' the first thing out of his mouth is ``I've got blood on my
hands and there's no remorse'' _ followed by a revolting admission
that ends with the word ``corpse.'' Fortunately for fans of the
always powerful DMX, that's about as bad as ``Flesh of My Flesh,
Blood of My Blood'' gets. But with the exception of his easily
accessible ``Coming From,'' with vocalist Mary J. Blige, this
alternating ode to hell-raising and his boys never really gets a
whole lot better either.

 &HT;    Pure multi-genre enchantment photo still to come
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Myth and consequence, illusion and dreams, congas stirring an
erotic pulse while a woman's voice recites a surreal episode and
piano keys rattle and crash in the distance. Kip Hanrahan's albums
are complex affairs, often more akin to a movie than any sort of
conventional batch of tunes. That's because Hanrahan, a New York
producer, tends to use his all-star cast of musicians (drawn from
jazz, Latin and avant-garde circles) as if they were actors,
drifting through a Third World mystery toward some enigmatic
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautiful stuff, even if you can never put your finger on
it. Rescued from out-of-print obscurity by the Canadian label
Justin Time, Hanrahan's 1996 ``A Thousand Nights and a Night'' does
at least have a concrete reference point: It's the first in a
series of projected albums based on the tales of the ``Arabian
Nights.'' It's an intriguing concept _ some of the sexiest music
you'll ever hear _ and, as always, the insistent juju of
Afro-Caribbean polyrhythms underpins nearly every arrangement. But
one of the real treats is hearing pianist Don Pullen, who died not
long after the album was completed. Pullen's intensely percussive
attack is perfect up against a steady array of congas, timbale and
trap drums and, on ``Sleeper Awakened,'' joins with violinist Billy
Bang for a rich, soulful excursion that's no myth at all.

CONSIDER CHOICE OF NEW SCANNER IN LIGHT OF NEEDS, PC CONNECTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've been shopping around for my first scanner. I'm confused.
What are the pros and cons for the different types of scanners? I
see the flat kind, and the kind that pull paper through them. I see
SCSI, USB and parallel-port connections. I just want to scan
photos, some personal papers, maybe something from a magazine or a
book. What should I get?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scanners used to be the province of professional artists and
hardcore computer junkies with lots of money and free time. But
prices on scanners have dropped dramatically, making them the
latest mass-market peripheral. You can thank e-mail, to a certain
extent _ people understand the value of scanning in a photo or some
other item to send to a family member or friend.
</P>
<P>
   But scanners can still be finicky and confusing _ their
friendliness has not caught up with their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in scanning flat objects, such as photos
and paper, a sheet-fed scanner that pulls documents through them
can save space. They're certainly smaller than flatbed scanners.
But flatbeds have an advantage _ they can scan bound items, such as
books and magazines, without the pages being removed.
</P>
<P>
   There are three main ways of connecting a scanner. The most
common is via the parallel port, the same connection used for a
printer. Next is SCSI, which requires that you have a special
interface card installed in your computer. Finally, there's the
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, which is a new type of connection
generally found on PCs sold within the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel port scanner is the simplest to set up _ just
connect to the port, install the software and you're ready to scan.
Usually there's a second parallel connection on the back of the
scanner to which you can connect your printer. However, scanning
through the parallel port can be slow, and some printers don't like
to share the port.
</P>
<P>
   Although SCSI is considered the fastest connection, most
Windows-based PCs don't come with a SCSI connection (though most
Macintoshes do). You need to add a SCSI card, and they are
notoriously problematic. SCSI scanners also tend to be more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   USB-based scanners are perhaps the best solution. They're fast,
inexpensive and they are easy to install. Just plug them into the
USB port, supply the necessary drivers and scanning software and
that's it. However, USB scanners are still somewhat scarce, and you
really need Windows 98 for solid USB support.
</P>
<P>
   I'd recommend a flatbed, parallel or USB scanner in your case.
Only go with the USB if you have a PC with Windows 98 and a USB
port, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an archive of ``sent'' e-mails in Outlook Express that
I need to refer to frequently. Finding the right one is a pain
because I did not plan ahead with more descriptive subject lines.
(Now I do.) Is it possible to edit the Subjects of past sent
e-mails so that individual ones will be more easy to locate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in Outlook Express. You can do this with other e-mail
programs, such as Eudora Pro, which includes a button that lets you
edit received and sent messages; and in Netscape Communicator,
which lets you drag messages to the Drafts folder, change them,
then put them back in the Sent folder.
</P>
<P>
   However, you can create your own set of folders for sorting
purposes in Outlook Express. Give them the names your e-mail
messages should have had.
</P>
<P>
   Right-click on the Inbox, choose New Folder, then give it a name
that indicates what kind of messages are in it. Then, drag the
appropriate messages in your Inbox to that folder. Repeat until
you've sorted all your mail.

TAKE TIME TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR NEW PC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're firing up your very first computer for the very first
time, Friday should be a very merry Christmas indeed. Welcome to
the Digital Age!
</P>
<P>
   Few things are as exciting as owning that first personal
computer, except maybe buying a new PC after holding onto an
ancient one for far too long.
</P>
<P>
   But PC ownership can be as maddening as it is joyful. In many
ways, these machines are not ready for prime time, and mastering
them does still take some work and some learning.
</P>
<P>
   For hard-core computer newbies, I've got some basic advice about
getting along with your computer, and getting around the Internet
once you get online. Those who've been using a computer for a while
might want to consider this a quick refresher course.
</P>
<P>
   _ The most important thing I can urge you to do is to spend some
time learning your computer's operating system. Although you may
feel like you just want to know how to use simple applications like
e-mail, word processing or a Web browser, understanding the basics
of your OS will make your techno-life much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Learn about the network of folders, the storage places for
various files, and understand how to navigate them. For Windows
users, spend time exploring your hard drive through the My Computer
icon on your PC's main screen, which is called the Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem arcane right now, but it will become crucial
knowledge once you start navigating the Internet and receiving
e-mail attachments from friends or grabbing free software off Web
sites. When this happens, you'll save these files in specific
folders, and one of the problems many novices have is locating
their treasure after it's been stored on the computer's hard disk.
You'll also want to know how to copy files from one folder to
another, and understand what happens when you install new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Novices may want to invest in a book on the operating system. I
like the ... ``for Dummies'' series from IDG Books. ``Windows 98
for Dummies'' and ``Mac OS 8.5 for Dummies'' are fun to read and
don't talk down to their audiences, despite the implications of the
titles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Run as clean and simple a system as you can. Your PC may have
come with several programs that automatically start and run in the
background, including a virus scanner or something designed to
monitor software installations. Often, these can cause more
problems than they solve.
</P>
<P>
   I usually advise turning these off, particularly virus checkers,
which can interfere with some other programs, particularly software
installations. However, the threats from computer viruses are quite
real, so only turn these off if you are willing to be diligent
about manually scanning any new software that comes into your PC.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, if you experience problems with your system,
the first thing you should try is turning off virus checkers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn about the maintenance features of your computer. New PCs
come with all kinds of goodies for making sure your computer stays
in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Windows 98 users should know about the System
Information Tool (Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools), a Swiss
army knife for your PC. Also, get familiar with the Add/Remove
module in the Control Panel. You never, ever want to remove a
program just by deleting its folder _ always use the program's
listing in this module. Or, buy a third-party uninstall program,
such as Quarterdeck's CleanSweep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some online veterans may disagree with this, but I'd recommend
that those who have never owned a home computer use America Online
for first-time Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   It remains the easiest way to get online, and AOL's new 4.0
software is both friendly and powerful. Most of the problems that
AOL encountered when it switched to flat-fee pricing _ including
busy signals _ have been solved. However, its Web access can be
fairly slow, and some Web sites don't work like they are supposed
to with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once online, don't be taken in by hoaxes and scams. You'll see
dire warnings about viruses that are spread by e-mail (they're all
bogus) and you'll get junk e-mail inviting you to make tons of
money by mailing off ``reports'' (they're little more than illegal,
pyramid-scheme chain letters). A Web site sponsored by the Computer
Incident Advisory Capability of the U.S. Department of Energy
tracks online hoaxes at ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you'll eventually get lots of junk e-mail, known as
``spam,'' trying to sell you everything from access to adult Web
sites to plans for homemade cable descramblers. Don't respond to
them, even to requests to be removed from their mailing lists.
Often the ``remove me'' addresses are fake, or they are simply
devious ways to confirm valid e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has a feature called Mail Controls that can help
you filter spam. And all the major e-mail software packages _
Outlook Express, Netscape Communicator, Eudora _ let you create
filters for routing spam directly to your computer's trash bin.
They're not perfect, but they can help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, here are some quick online tips. Don't type e-mail
messages in all capital letters _ in the online world, it's
considered SHOUTING! Don't forget civility when you're
communicating with others online _ it's easy to forget that your
recipients are people with feelings, and often nuances and
inflections are lost in e-mail or in message forums.
</P>
<P>
   Never give your computer password to someone who asks for it
online, even if they claim to work for your Internet provider. The
technical support staff at your provider can access your password
via their account records.
</P>
<P>
   Don't launch program files sent to you as e-mail attachments
unless you know the person who sent them. And don't send e-mail
attachments to someone without asking first. Not everyone's e-mail
software can handle them properly.

Bugged by software glitches? New book outlines your rights 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We have laws to help when our Lincoln is a lemon. But
when our Microsoft Windows doesn't work, we have to rely on
toll-free help desks and online advice.
</P>
<P>
   A book called ``Bad Software: What to Do When Software Fails''
brings consumer rights to the Information Age. The book was written
by Cem Kaner and David Pels, both of whom have experience in
software technical support, quality assurance and software law. The
book shows you how to get a refund, fix bugs, find more support
and, occasionally, be compensated for things that quit working as a
result of faulty software.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader calls it a ``how-to book for consumer protection in
the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The book breaks down the steps needed to claim your customer
rights, including how to get a refund quickly; how to decide when
to try and fix it yourself; when to call the help desk; and how to
deal more effectively with the help desk. Should legal action be
necessary, the authors also lay out how to understand and apply
your rights and how to pick a lawyer who knows the industry and can
keep your fees low.
</P>
<P>
   The book retails for about $30. It is available at online
bookstores and at the author's site, which is devoted to helping
customers who have bought bad software. It's at
http://www.badsoftware.com.

after-Christmas sales. Toshiba has released a line of 25-channel,
900-megahertz cordless phones that claim to virtually eliminate
static.
</P>
<P>
   The phones come with an auto-scanning feature that automatically
changes frequencies when you come across static or interference.
Toshiba's Compandor Plus noise-reduction system further cuts
ambient noise. The line of phones is on the high end of the 900-MHz
spectrum, retailing for between $220 and $250.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba's 25-channel phones are a bit less expensive, retailing
for between $80 and $100. They include handset volume control, a
mute button, a 10-speed number dial and a handset locator page key.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-channel phones have a NiteCall illumination feature that
gives a green glow over the handset, making it easier to dial in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-channel model also offers Call Protect, which scrambles
calls so eavesdroppers using scanners or randomly stumbling across
your frequency hear only gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   With a digital answering machine, the 25-channel phone sells for
between $190 and $230.
</P>
<P>
   On-board satellite
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has enhanced its dashboard satellite system for
1999. Three years old, OnStar is now available in 31 GM models and
is standard equipment in Cadillac's Escalade, the upscale
sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar uses the Global Positioning satellite network and
cellular technology to connect the vehicle to the OnStar support
center for 24-hour help with emergency service and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   The OnStar system on the Cadillac Escapade is a three-button pad
built into the overhead console. The driver can speak, hands-free,
into a microphone built into the headliner. The OnStar center
offers directions, diagnostics, information about the nearest
hotels, restaurants and other points of interest. One button is
reserved for emergencies; a third ends calls to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held hotbed
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held computer market surged this year. The 3Com Palm
Pilot is still the market giant, with a 75 percent share, but the
number of models on the market grew from 44 to 62. Of those, half
are Windows CE-supported, according to Intelect ASW, a marketing
services company in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilots are also the least expensive. Prices ranged from
$287 to $360 in 1998. Windows CE devices, which are Windows
95-compatible, ranged from $685 to $550.
</P>
<P>
   The top Windows CE brands were Casio, Philips and
Hewlett-Packard.

AMERICAN LANGUAGE SCHOLARS GO `HOLLYWOOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ American universities are ``going Hollywood,''
judging by this week's movie talk at the professor-packed Modern
Language Association of America gathering in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Pfeiffer's face shimmered on a video screen as
academics viewed a supposedly symbolic moment from one of her early
flicks, a knights-and-damsels epic called ``Ladyhawke.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor who presented a brief segment of the film,
Geraldine G. N. Heng of the University of Texas at Austin,
initially expressed reluctance to waste time showing the footage.
Instantly, numerous audience members said, ``No, no! Show it!''
</P>
<P>
   Then the room packed with literary scholars, language experts,
and critical theorists _ the kinds of folks whose gods are
hyper-erudite European intellectuals such as Jacques Derrida and
the late Michel Foucault _ watched, entranced, as the angelic
Pfeiffer cooed words of love to some medieval studmuffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just watch this instead of talking!'' declared Professor
Seth Lerer, a Stanford philologist (a branch of literature study
that scrutinizes its linguistic content and evolution). That drew a
big laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, academics scorned films as brain-dead cotton candy
for the masses _ but no more. Increasingly, these experts on the
printed word are turning their attention to the impact and deeper
significance of audiovisual media _ especially movies, which
stimulate the human imagination in ways that might have horrified
the staider titans of 19th century literature and literary
criticism, such as William Dean Howells.
</P>
<P>
   Movies were among the many colorful topics at the annual MLA
meeting, which began Sunday at the San Francisco Hilton and
concluded Wednesday. Thousands of members met in hundreds of
sessions to discuss topics ranging from Victorian fiction to
Marxist cultural analysis to modern French music to the impact of
computer networks on language.
</P>
<P>
   Experts held several sessions that assessed the films of David
Mamet, the late Paul Robeson and other figures. The Mamet session _
so packed that people at the back of the room had to sit on the
floor _ reviewed one of Mamet's favorite character types, the con
man who suffers no pangs of conscience as he who bilks sucker after
sucker.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's plays and films _ such as the recent ``The Spanish
Prisoner,'' starring Campbell Scott and Steve Martin _ use the con
man to symbolize the rapaciousness of American life, speakers
suggested. In Mamet's dramatic schemes, ``the war of `all against
all' is at the heart of the American enterprise,'' said Professor
Barry Goldensohn of Skidmore College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of MLA's movie sessions is attested to by their
timing. Heng and her colleagues' session began, she noted, at the
very convenient 10:15 a.m. _ right after breakfast. By contrast,
she added good-naturedly, she was scheduled to speak late that
night on a far more esoteric topic, where ``probably 10 people will
show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Heng's talk was part of a session where scholars discussed how
popular films depict the Middle Ages. Those depictions _ which are
typically jammed with historical gaffes _ often reveal more about
modern fantasies about gender, race and other subjects than they do
about the distant past, scholars argued.
</P>
<P>
   Lerer assessed the deeper meaning of the 1950s science-fiction
film epic ``Forbidden Planet.'' It was the ``Star Wars'' of its day
_ an enjoyable romp on another world, complete with a friendly
robot, an all-American hero (played by the young Leslie Nielsen),
and one of the scariest monsters in modern cinema. But to Lerer,
``Forbidden Planet'' is much, much more: Its plot reflects a
seismic shift in Western political and intellectual circles then
under way in the world outside the movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In a high-speed, witty speech that occasionally seemed tongue in
cheek, and that drew much audience laughter, Lerer argued that the
film's semi-villain _ played by Walter Pidgeon _ symbolized the
guilt-ridden European intellectuals who fled Hitler's conquest of
Europe for America, but ended up despising the cultural shallowness
of their new land.
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon portrayed a scholar who immigrated to a distant planet
and decoded the language of a dead race that had mysteriously
self-destructed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pidgeon character's ``story is a legend of the ambiguities
of learning,'' Lerer argued. His unleashing of dark forces is a
mirror of the dark powers unleashed two decades earlier as the
Nazis took power in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's climax, Pidgeon unwittingly unleashes a monster
that ... well, the ending is too good to give away. (Hint: Brush up
on Sigmund Freud before you scurry to the video store.)
</P>
<P>
   Hence the film isn't so much about outer space as it is about
Earth, Lerer concludes on a triumphant note: ``We may come to see
that the only `forbidden planet' is not somewhere in the stars but
right beneath our feet.'' Thunderous applause followed.

 Downloading Forms From the IRS  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; QUESTION &LR; : When I download forms from the IRS, I receive the
information in a format that my computer can't decipher. How can I
get the forms in normal text? I have Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  The IRS lets you download forms and publications in
several formats, none of which is straight text. Generally, the
most convenient format is PDF, which was developed by Adobe
Systems. PDF (portable document format) makes documents look
exactly the same on the computer as they do in print.
</P>
<P>
   To use PDF files, you'll need the Acrobat Reader software, which
is free. You can download it from Adobe (www.adobe.com), or from
almost any shareware library. Once you install the Acrobat Reader,
you'll be able to print any PDF files that you download from the
IRS or other Web sites (many companies make documents such as
annual reports and product manuals available in PDF).
</P>
<P>
   Check Order of Address
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a friend who is in Thailand (I believe it is in
Bangkok) and the e-mail address I was given ends in (AT
SIGN)ksc.th.com. I tried to e-mail him today and my ISP returned
the message. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   a A: I think you've got the address in the wrong order. The
country code _ in this case ``th'' _ should be the last thing in
the domain name. Try (AT SIGN)ksc.com.th and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   A Word About Overstrike
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I work in Microsoft Word 97, the program occasionally
shifts into ``overtype'' mode. While this can be turned off by
deselecting it in the ``Edit'' part of the Options menu, it's a
pain to have to stop work in order to do this. Is there any way to
prevent Word from turning on the overtype mode, or can I
permanently turn it off?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't have to go into the Edit menu to turn off the
overtype mode. Just hit the Insert key on your keyboard. It lets
you toggle between the overtype and insert mode (which is the
default setting).
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the reason your system is switching to overtype
probably is because you're inadvertently hitting the Insert key.
You can't permanently disable overtype, but you can be more careful
where you put your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the Right Type
</P>
<P>
   Q: This has bugged me for the longest time and a search of
online help, Web sites and even newsgroups has failed me. When I
bring up a Web page in Internet Explorer 4.0, I get ``medium'' as
the font size. If I change the size to ``smaller'' (using the Fonts
option in the View menu), it only works during the current online
session. How can I set the smaller font as the default for all my
surfing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's what you do: Instead of going to Fonts in the View
menu, choose Internet Options. In the General options, click on
Fonts at the bottom of the window. Then choose the font size you
want and click Set as Default.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. The font size will remain the same until the next
time you change it.
</P>
<P>
   Undecided About a Mac
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a children's author, turned author-publisher, and I'm
considering making the switch from PCs to Macs, because of the many
graphics tasks that I'm facing. Is it still true that Macs are
significantly easier to use for people who, like myself, are far
from naturals with a computer?
</P>
<P>
   The other reason I'm considering the switch is that most
graphics designers and art departments in the print media seem to
favor the Mac format over PCs. If I send a book jacket scan and
news brief to print publishers over the Internet, are they more
likely to be able to handle such digital files without hassle if
they're created on a Mac?
</P>
<P>
   A: Early in its history, Apple became the computer of choice for
publishing, thanks to the Macintosh's ease of use, and PageMaker
software from Adobe, which was developed initially for the Mac.
Today, Macs still command tremendous loyalty from graphic artists
and others in the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   However, Windows PCs have caught up with Macs in many ways when
it comes to graphic design. And companies like Adobe now make
nearly identical versions of their products for PCs and Macs.
</P>
<P>
   The one advantage Macs still have is that some print shops still
are better able to deal with Mac documents.
</P>
<P>
   My advice would be to ask people with whom you'll be dealing
which system they use, and go with the consensus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tip of the Week &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You need to copy a page or two occasionally. You want to fax a
letter to a business associate. And you'd like to put some old
family documents in your computer. Instead of spending $400 or $500
on an all-purpose printer-scanner-fax machine, just buy a nice
flat-bed scanner for less than $200. Once you scan a document or
photo, you can save it as a graphics file, fax it or print it,
making as many copies as you like.

New chip from AMD seen as threat to Intel 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is the hegemony of Intel's Pentium processors coming
to an end? The December issue of PC Gamer thinks so. Check out why
in a provocative article about Advanced Micro Devices' new chip,
which the magazine calls Intel's David. AMD's new chip is called
K6-2, and what makes it special is its 3DNOW instruction set. The
magazine says 3DNOW greatly accelerates the chip's ability to run
graphics _ especially 3-D graphics. In other words, games played on
computer using this chip will be screamers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also offers scores of reviews on new games. One in
particular is about the latest Indiana Jones game by LucasArts. The
magazine says Lara Croft of ``Tomb Raider'' better move over _ this
game is exciting and action-packed.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Cyberflix's latest release, ``Redjack, Revenge of the
Brethren,'' is getting good reviews, including one in The New York
Times. This computer CD is a role-playing game based on a story
line about pirates in the Caribbean. The object of the game is to
figure out who killed the great fallen pirate, avenge his death,
steal all the gold and run off with the girl. Available for both
PCs and Macs, ``Redjack'' retails for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new trend in computer CDs in which companies are
linking games with hands-on toys or controls. The latest example is
Hasbro Interactive's ``Star Wars Millennium Falcon CD-ROM
Playset.'' This game comes with a hand-control playset that snaps
onto the computer keyboard. Available only for Windows 95 PCs, it
retails for $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a great place to research a medical condition. A
good place to start is Medscape. This Web site includes 7,000
articles on medical research. There's also a free link to something
called Medline, which has more than 8.4 million abstracts from
3,800 medical journals. You'll find Medscape at
http://www.medscape.com.

THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have heard that there will be no leap year in
the year 2000. Due to some imperfection in the leap-year system,
the century years are skipped. I need to do some system testing
very soon and need confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leapin' Lizard
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LIZARD: Go back to your calculator. Or just take a look at
a calendar. Guess what 2000 is?
</P>
<P>
   Leap years were instituted to keep the calendar honest. It takes
365.2422 days for the Earth to orbit the sun, so you have to make
up for those extra fractions of days every once in a while with a
leap day. It's like when the bank messes up my statement each and
every month, and I have to make an adjustment to my checkbook to
compensate for their stupid mistake.
</P>
<P>
   There's a standard mathematical formula for figuring leap years,
even though it's a bit off. Once upon a time, the head calendar
guys decided there should be 97 leap years for every 400 years,
yielding an average calendar year of 365.2425 days. I know, that
all seems like nit-picking, but even with all those decimal
thingies, the formula is still off by three days every 10,000
years. Imagine how embarrassing that will be for the Daytimer
people, assuming the Earth isn't a smoldering heap of rubble by
then.
</P>
<P>
   We hope the programmers who worked on your software didn't cut
class for the ``Star Trek'' convention the day they taught that in
Math 101.
</P>
<P>
   First, determine if the year is divisible by 4. It's probably a
leap year, but you're not through checking. If it's also divisible
by 100, it's not a leap year. Well, unless, of course, it can also
be divided by 400. You there in the back row, wake up!
</P>
<P>
   There's no real imperfection in the leap-year system, but there
may be in the way your programs were written. But what's the worst
thing that can happen? With all those other undiscovered millennium
bugs contributing to the end of civilization as we know it, we'll
be sitting in caves gnawing on rodent bones by Feb. 29, 2000,
anyway. Save me a tail!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I must be getting dense. I have deleted and
uninstalled programs, but when I go to the Programs menu, the names
are still there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lasting Reminder
</P>
<P>
   DEAR REMINDER: My guess is the guy who wrote the uninstallation
program is the dense one. A good uninstaller is suppposed to take
care of stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just right-click on the Start button. That brings up a
short menu. Pick Explore, and Windows Explorer opens up to the
hard-to-find spot where all the Start menu stuff lives. In the
right pane, click into the Programs folder. There are all the
sub-menus, looking like sub-folders. Search and destroy the ones
for the stuff you've uninstalled.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there access to past columns? Sometimes I
remember having seen something that may be relevant to a problem
I'm having now, and it would be great to search your past columns
for the answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Devoted Reader
</P>
<P>
   DEAR READER: You mean you haven't been keeping a scrapbook? I'm
deeply hurt. You might try a Yahoo! search, but my guess is that
all that past wisdom is like so much snail slime washed away by the
spring rain. Gee, that's so poetic!

DISCOUNTED URNS AND NO OVERHEAD  
 GREETING CARDS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 35, Russel Harmon has made a career of shaking up the
funeral industry. In 1994, he founded Affordable Funeral Services,
a renegade discounter in an industry accustomed to markups ranging
from 300 percent to 1,000 percent and sometimes more. Two years
ago, he sold Affordable to Service Corporation International of
Houston and took a job as an executive there.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``I discovered that you can't be an entrepreneur
and a corporate type at the same time.'' The entrepreneur bug bit
hard last year when one of his employees at Service started a Web
site to sell cremation urns _ the containers that hold the ashes of
deceased people or pets _ directly to the bereaved.
</P>
<P>
   When Harmon failed to persuade Service to buy the Web site,
Discounturns.com, he left the company and bought the site himself.
Last week, he acquired his major competitor, Urnsdirect.com,
expanding his product line and vendors.
</P>
<P>
   As markdowns on vendors' suggested retail prices, his discounts
are relatively small, but they can be substantial when compared
with what funeral homes actually charge. For example, Discounturns
sells the Remembrance, a bronze urn with a recommended price of
$500, for $430, a 14 percent markdown. But it is sold by New York
City funeral directors for close to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon acknowledges that some people feel guilty about shopping
for a discount on an urn. ``Those aren't my customers,'' he said.
In fact, he has introduced a new product line of ``faux finish''
urns made of wood or fiberboard and painted to look like one of
seven hardwoods. The faux containers sell for as little as $29.95
and, he says with pride, have the added advantage of being
biodegradable _ a feature he is trying to patent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to brass and faux models, he offers assorted
hardwood, marble and ceramic urns, plus a line for pets.
</P>
<P>
   Cremation is increasingly popular, now accounting for about 35
percent of all disposal of human remains in the United States and
Canada _ ranging from 4 percent in Mississippi to 65 percent in
British Columbia, according to the Cremation Association of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet, Harmon says, is the best way by far to market
urns. For one thing, he keeps no inventory, passing orders directly
to the manufacturers, who ship them to buyers. For another, he is a
Yahoo merchant, meaning that the big portal site takes all the
orders and processes all the credit-card transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overhead is next to nothing,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is not rid of bricks and mortar altogether. He is
planning a crematory in Washington in which people will be able to
watch fire consume the remains of relatives from behind a glass
partition, if they choose, and even to ignite the flames. Such
features serve an increasingly multiethnic population, said Harmon,
who pointed out, for example, that in Hindu families tradition
calls for the oldest surviving son to light the funeral fire.

site, and it allows would-be senders of cheer, and other
sentiments, to browse through an online selection of more than
5,000 cards from hundreds of publishers. In contrast, industry data
show that the typical neighborhood card store carries 300 to 600
cards, usually from one major publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Variety, Ms. Lindau says, guarantees nuance. As evidence that no
occasion is too uncommon and no late 20th-century family situation
too obscure for the greeting card, she cites a holiday card for a
Christian woman and her Jewish husband.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members wearing rubber gloves at a San Francisco warehouse
pluck cards from shelves and mail them to the Web site's customers.
For an additional 75 cents a card, they sign them (by laser printer
or staff scribe) and mail them on the buyer's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   While the 17 minutes, on average, that a typical customer spends
browsing a card store might not be reduced by online shopping, Ms.
Lindau said, at least it can be done on the shopper's timetable, or
in pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of the ubiquitous digital communique, and with
hundreds of free electronic cards available on the Web, is it
counterintuitive to sell traditional paper cards on the Internet?
Before heading to the venture capitalists, she posed that question
to focus groups and found that ``there's very little overlap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The electronic card is good for novelty,'' she said, adding
that it gets you ``half credit'' if you have missed a birthday. But
``getting something in the mail just feels so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that sentiment is widely shared. The Greeting Card
Association, an industry trade group based in Washington, predicts
a $1.2 billion rise in card sales from 1995 _ the first full year
of the Web's existence _ through 1998, when sales are expected to
reach $7.5 billion in the United States, a 19 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marianne McDermott, executive director of the
association, sees the Internet as a threat _ not to card sales but
to penmanship. ``The subject of discussion isn't whether the
Internet is going to do away with paper,'' she said, ``but rather
that young people aren't writing anymore, because they're on the
computer. We're hoping that young people don't lose the art of
writing and communicating with handwritten notes.''

IT'S ALL HAPPENING AT THE ZOOG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While everyone is puzzling over when exactly the
convergence of computer, television and Internet will happen, the
Disney Channel actually is trying to do something about it with its
Zoog Disney offerings on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle starts on Sunday nights, when a two-hour block of
programming targeted at children between 9 and 14 is overlaid with
a variety of animated show hosts called Zoogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to really create an entertainment experience that
converged the two interests in our audience,'' said Eleo Hensleigh,
the Disney Channel's senior vice president of marketing. ``They
spend a lot of time with television, a lot of time with the
Internet. We want to make sure we're where kids are spending
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zoogs prompt viewers to go online, where they act as online
guides to contests, chat rooms, discussion areas, games, polls,
``shoutouts'' and more, all of it related to themes from that
week's programs, Hensleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   The site then takes the children's responses and incorporates
them into the reruns of the shows the next Saturday, Hensleigh
said. The Zoogs show high scores in the games, contest winners,
shoutouts and more.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how to get viewers to also get on the Web site was
a tricky proposition for the channel, which doesn't want to
cannibalize its audience. It's less of an issue for a
commercial-free outlet such as Disney, but Hensleigh said company
officials thought hard about how to knit together the Web and TV
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see this new medium to be a replacement for
television, it's to broaden the experience,'' said Hensleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment has paid off big time since it began Aug. 7,
Hensleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen is, most importantly, a 50-percent increase in
9- to 11-year-old (TV viewers) in that day part,'' Hensleigh said.
``And we've basically seen a 350 percent increase in our online
traffic. We're now the No. 1-trafficked site on Disney.com. That's
a robust site but we have been the most trafficked area.''
</P>
<P>
   It also may help Disney deal with the difficult transition it
faces in keeping its young fans' attention as they lurch toward
puberty and more sophisticated viewing desires, Hensleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we embrace this computer and online world, we've moved
that acceptance level with older kids just a little bit,''
Hensleigh said. ``As they grow older, it's a challenge for
Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as figuring out how to marry the Internet and television
has proved a challenge to virtually everyone in either business.
Zoogs, however preliminary, offers a glimpse of what that future
might hold.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUND OF SUCCESS: For most of the past two decades, Donald
Katz wrote about technology for publications such as Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's busy creating technology that lets you listen to
publications such as the Wall Street Journal as well as such audio
treasures as John Cleese reading Dante's ``Inferno'' or Walt
Whitman reading his own ``Leaves of Grass,'' with Thomas Edison on
the sound board.
</P>
<P>
   What he's done with Audible Inc. is create a Web site
(www.audible.com) loaded with 17,000 hours of programming that you
can buy inexpensively over the Internet. And his company also makes
a listening device that copies the audio files from your computer
so you can listen to them anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's moved into the world of audio, Katz and his company
remain dependent on print resources as the basis for nearly all
their recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Print is still the mother lode of information,'' said Katz
during a recent promotional swing through Los Angeles. ``When you
think about Audible, all it does is leverage the superior impact of
print over a new medium. People who love this love reading so much
that they want to extend that to places where they can't read.''
</P>
<P>
   It's actually a wonderful idea: Use the Internet and home
computers to cheaply distribute a vast array of digital
information; listen to it on a tiny player that links to the
computer, sort of like the tiny MP-3 music players from Diamond
Multimedia and Saehan.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is so smart that it has attracted a Murderers' Row of
heavy hitter investors, and dozens of content partners.
</P>
<P>
   The product itself is cheap, only $99 if you agree to buy at
least $10 of content every month for a year. That'll get you the
Wall Street Journal and a book a month. If you don't buy the
subscription, the player costs $199.
</P>
<P>
   Among the zillions of other products are Ezra Pound and the
Harvard Business Review, Alan Greenspan speeches and National
Public Radio's ``Fresh Air,'' Stephen King's ``Bag of Bones'' and
the Starr Report, self-help tomes and audio book thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   And you soon won't need the Audible player to take your
information with you, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, free player software will be available for owners of
Windows CE-based hand-held computers and personal digital
assistants. And in March, the software will be standard issue on
the machines sold by four manufacturers, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is getting interest from companies who see it as
a way to distribute such in-house information as product
descriptions and motivational speeches to their sales forces, Katz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is coming out soon with a beefed-up version of
its player, making it capable of storing seven hours of recordings,
compared to the current two, Katz said. New software will include
cover art and author information with each download.
</P>
<P>
   So what's that you hear? It's the Audible sound of a great idea
coming.
</P>
<P>
   FACE TO INTERFACE: And from music critic Fred Shuster comes a
Web recommendation for all you underground music fans. It's called
InterFACE Pirate Radio and is the legal Internet successor to an
illegal broadcaster in London spinning great drum-and-bass, jungle,
house and other electronic dance music.
</P>
<P>
   The music streams in on the RealPlayer plug-in for your Web
browser, but even cooler is the ability to talk with the disc
jockeys and other listeners in an online chat room and to watch a
video feed of the DJs as they mix and play music. Point your
Internet radio dial to www.interface.pirate-radio.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND: If you have a PalmPilot, those
delightful little personal organizer gadgets that are proliferating
like mosquitoes in a Minnesota summer, you should check out the
PalmPilot Gear HQ, at www.pilotgear.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has hundreds of downloadable software files for the
Palm Pilot and its successor, the Palm III, along with answers to
basic technical support questions, and information about
accessories.

ALLEGED RAPIST USED INTERNET TO LURE TEEN, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JIM WALSH   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is a 13-year-old who chatted up a storm on the Internet, and
had connected with what she thought to be a genuinely nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed and impressionable, the Gilbert teen took up his offer
to meet in person _ she even lied to her grandparents to cover up
their rendezvous, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   He turned out to be a monstrous chat-room mistake. Police say
the man drove the girl 1,400 miles to Memphis, Tenn., where at a
trailer park, over a three-day period, he raped her, snapped
pornographic pictures of her and held her captive.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken and scared, the girl managed a call to her grandfather on
Christmas Day. Four days had lapsed since she fibbed to her
guardians that she was going shopping with a friend, authorities
say.
</P>
<P>
   She told her grandfather that ``she was scared and afraid,''
said Sgt. Ken Fixel, a Gilbert police spokesman. ``He told her to
call 911. It was fantastic advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Her call to Memphis police led to the arrest of Patrick Neal
Champion, 35, of Memphis, and his girlfriend, Debra Kay Williams,
46. The pair were accused of rape in a case that Tennessee
authorities say could mushroom into a nationwide child pornography
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Champion also is accused of taking pornographic pictures of the
girl.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was reunited with her grandparents in Memphis on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of relieved she's coming back home,'' said Sgt. Larry
Wilson of the Memphis sex crimes unit. ``She was thousands of miles
away from home, around a bunch of people she didn't know.
Obviously, she had to be terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   When Memphis police arrested Champion, they seized a dozen
cameras, a computer and notebooks listing names and what appeared
to be the sexual preference of victims, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Memphis police are examining pictures and trying to
identify additional victims, but he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also will join the investigation to determine whether
federal laws were violated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Joe Bonner, an FBI spokesman in Memphis, said the
agency is willing to help Memphis police in any way possible, but
added that state laws on pornography usually have more teeth than
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Larry Jacobs of the Phoenix police vice unit said the girl's
victimization is far from unusual as pedophiles flock to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Phoenix police arrested a Seattle man who thought
he was setting up a rendezvous with a 12-year-old boy who was
actually a detective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the Internet is the new location that pedophiles
have used because of the anonymity it offers them,'' Jacobs said.
``It used to be that pedophiles had to go where the children were
to groom them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he is aware of cases where pedophiles have even
mailed airplane tickets to children, hoping they would come visit
and have sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are naive. That's what it comes down to. And kids need
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs warned parents to never allow children to use Internet
chat rooms without parental supervision. He said children should
not reveal personal information about themselves on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I tell any parent is to take a computer out of
a child's room and put it in the living room so they can monitor
it,'' Jacobs said.

World Book Discoveries DVD brings French accent to history 
By Jack Warner  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IBM has entered the field of DVD-ROMs with World Book
Discoveries, a massive encyclopedia devoted to the student of
history and, more or less incidentally, to the student of Gallic
software design.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we encounter those wildly creative Frenchmen in whose
designs form rises like a helium balloon above the American
concepts of function.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is, of course, huge; it covers the contents of five
normal CD-ROMs, in which form it is also available. Being
French-designed, it is of course also beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   As I have remarked in the past, the French software designers
march to the beat of a different drum, and Discoveries presents the
beats of a great many drums, some of them so loud you can scarcely
hear the narration, but that, you will find, isn't really important
because the narration is superficial and usually is repeated in the
text.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is very, very big on sound, most of it signifying
nothing. In the sections on the creation of the universe, for
instance, there is a lot of eerie space music. Discussions of great
battles are accompanied by screaming, yelling and clashing of
spears, and screens on the rise of mammals on earth give rise to
disembodied grunts and snarls.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is undeniably atmospheric, but if you spend very
long at a given screen it can become annoying.
</P>
<P>
   The unifying feature of French design, of course, is
disunification, at least by the standards of U.S. software design.
If you have spent much time with encyclopedic software, you become
used to certain general traits.
</P>
<P>
   Hot spots on a screen are identified by text in a different
color, or by the cursor changing shape as it passes over the spot.
The French scoff at such consistency in the same way a Cordon Bleu
chef would sneer at an underdone sauce.
</P>
<P>
   If you consider the organization of Discoveries in layers, the
top layer is a corridor, or gallery, in which you move down an
ill-lit, portentous hall with back-lit illustrations along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a portal into an era. This, certainly, is a very nice
conceit. It works pretty well, too, but below that upper layer
things seem to get somewhat unsteady.
</P>
<P>
   I could try to explain the more detailed methods of navigation
through this giant CD-ROM, but it would only confuse you because it
certainly confuses me.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering Discoveries
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say Discoveries is truly an adventure; you never
know what you will discover next. The basic keys _ other than
trying to memorize the little manual _ are the sometimes
hard-to-see menus at the top of the screen. These have menus within
menus within menus that will generally get you where you want to go
within a given era.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is aimed for the most part, it would appear, at the
grade- and middle-school level. There are, for instance, five
references to Albert Einstein, who is usually represented by a
photo showing him sticking his tongue out at the viewer. All of
these assure the reader that Einstein was one of the greatest
scientists who ever lived, the man who postulated the theory of
relativity and turned upside down our notions of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   If you need any notion of what his theories amounted to, you'll
have to go elsewhere. I could find no mention anywhere, for
instance, of the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   You may come upon a full-screen picture, very nicely rendered,
of the Trojan Horse, and see little Trojans lowering themselves out
of its belly.
</P>
<P>
   Barely discernible over the lowering orchestral music, a woman
intones: ``Troy, in the time of the legendary heroes: The Trojan
horse.'' If you never heard this story, you may well wonder what is
going on here.
</P>
<P>
   You may well wonder for a long time, because there is no text.
Annoyed, you click on Search and search for Trojan. You find
several references, including one to the picture of the Trojan
Horse. There is, as far as I could tell, no text discussing the
Trojan Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling these Frenchmen may be akin to the least desirable end
of the horse, you return to the picture, and idly passing the
cursor over a part of it and letting it rest, you see it turns into
a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   If you turn it into a microphone at the gate of Troy, you get
the beginning of the legend. If you accidentally hit the mike at
the horse's underbelly, you get the middle of it first.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean World Book Discoveries is a wash? Absolutely
not. The information it contains should be more than enough for any
lower-grade project, and is presented in often unique and useful
ways.
</P>
<P>
   It is ravishingly beautiful. It is entertaining. The student can
lift not only all the text and all the art and copy it into a word
processor, but the sound can be copied, too.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it is an opportunity to see the concepts of
organization the way Inspector Clouseau understood them. And, to be
sure, I suspect French software designers get a few giggles out of
Microsoft Encarta, too.

   ATLANTA _ So you wanna party like it's 1999? Well, there are
lots of folks willing to help you do just that. As millennium fever
sweeps the planet and the Internet, you can check the Web to find
out just how big the party is going to be and how you can join in.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwide Observatory of the Year 2000
</P>
<P>
   (http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/teiffel/an2000uk/) is updated almost
daily and provides users with every millennium-related event from
the scientific to the just plain fun going on around the world. The
interactive forums allow you to send an electronic New Year's card,
talk about the Y2K problem or vote for the most remarkable people
of the last two millenniums. So far, it's a pretty interesting list
that includes Ghandi, Einstein, John Lennon and Kurt Cobain, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you always wanted to know about the millennium and
then some can be found at Countdown 2000
(http://www.countdown2000.com). Organized by topics such as
``Celebrations'' and ``Doomsday News'' (killer asteroids and so
forth), and including an online souvenir shop, Countdown2000 pretty
much contains everything you need to know to celebrate and fear the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
   At Everything2000 (http://www.everything2000.com), you'll find
trivia that's big on celebrating, surveys and the more festive
aspects of the millennium. Here you'll find countdown calendars,
screen savers, surveys and feature stories on how the world is
getting ready for the big day, plus a little sorely needed
millennium humor. The category is a little thin right now and
invites users to send in their own Year 2000 jokes and stories. The
site also boasts the best list of places to go and things to see on
Dec. 31, 1999, in the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium has also provided an excellent excuse for
everyone to make lists of nearly everything that's happened in the
last 100 or 1,000 years. Fiftythings (http://www.fiftythings.com)
offers lists of cultural, environmental, musical and ordinary
things worth saving in the next millennium. The lists change every
month and include everything from bicycles to cats to the Lilith
Fair. A particular favorite is the list of jokes with the
explanation ``you gotta keep a sense of humor in the next
millennium.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a private meeting with executives of Intel Corp. in July
1995, Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., sounded a warning.
As the companies pursued their joint vision of making desktop
machines that could store and crunch ever-increasing amounts of
digital data, Gates predicted they would face a looming challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once networks are extremely fast,'' Gates said, there was ``no
reason intelligence can't be central,'' according to notes taken by
an Intel executive at the meeting, which were submitted as evidence
in the Microsoft antitrust trial. Centralized intelligence,
accessible via fast computer networks, would pose a threat to the
dominant role of PCs _ the model on which Microsoft and Intel had
built their lucrative businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Just three and a half years later, that challenge to the
personal computer seems to be at hand. Even Andrew Grove, the Intel
chairman, acknowledges that ``the center of gravity is shifting.''
But whether that shift is the beginning of a revolutionary
transformation or an evolutionary progression is a matter of fierce
debate.
</P>
<P>
   In one camp are the executives and technologists who argue that
computing is entering ``the post-PC era,'' as advances on many
fronts enable a world of intelligent networks, linked by powerful
hub computers, feeding data to millions upon millions of so-called
information appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the PC continuing to be the center of the computing
solar system, they say, the network will become the universe.
Information appliances, the post-PC proponents explain, can be
thought of as personal communicators _ devices that mainly send and
obtain information to and from the network, instead of creating and
manipulating information the way personal computers do.
</P>
<P>
   The forerunners are digital cell phones, like the Nokia 6160 and
the Qualcomm PDQ, and hand-held devices, like the Palm Pilot and
the Motorola Pagewriter.
</P>
<P>
   And if these diverse digital gadgets are an indication, the
information appliance market will likely resemble the consumer
electronics business, with a flood of different products in every
shape and description, a chaotic grab-bag of wacky failures and
well-designed winners _ a world apart from the beige-box monotony
of the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The post-PC enthusiasts see a future when everything from a
household's car to its coffee maker has its own embedded
microchips, ready to receive remote instruction. From work, a
person could tap into the Internet to, say, program the video
cassette recorder, defrost food and leave a message for a family
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the beginning of a new age where we will have an
explosion of embedded and personal devices,'' said William Joy, a
founder and vice president of research of Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Horn, a senior vice president for research at IBM Corp., is
another adherent to post-PC doctrine. ``The trend is pretty clear
toward a proliferation of different computing devices at the
individual level being fed specialized information from powerful
networks,'' Horn said. ``Instead of millions of personal computers,
you have billions of devices eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of such thinking _ most notably Microsoft and
Intel _ deride the post-PC concept as an amalgam of half-truths
expounded by the losers in the PC revolution. The personal
computer, the industry incumbents concede, must become smaller,
cheaper and easier to use. There is a shift under way, they agree,
toward more of the technology and software development being
focused not on the desktop but on network hub, or server,
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of that, they argue, can and will be embraced by the
evolving personal computer industry, which has the capacity to
expand both upward to take over industrial-strength corporate
computing chores once handled by mainframe computers, and downward
into the market for hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the post-PC era,'' said Craig Mundie, a senior vice
president for consumer strategy of Microsoft. ``We're entering the
PC-plus era.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there will be a place for non-PC appliances, Mundie allows,
but they will be ``complementary to the evolving personal
computer'' _ anchored to the PC, not divorced from it.
</P>
<P>
   What the post-PC revolutionaries underestimate, the PC
incumbents say, is the pull of the 250 million people who now use
personal computers and who represent the infrastructure of modern
computing. Without the personal computer, they say, the Internet
would still be 20,000 academics sending e-mail to each other from
Unix workstations. And they contend that even the star among early
information appliances, the Palm Pilot, owes its popularity largely
to its ability to swap information with the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have hundreds of millions of users, change is
evolutionary,'' said Grove of Intel. ``Computers will become
smaller, cheaper and more mobile. But they will be mostly
full-function personal computers because people are going to want
their same data in a form they are familiar with for years and
years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Exponents of post-PC computing disagree. ``The new era will
escape the dependency on the PC,'' said Donna Dubinsky, a
co-founder of Palm Computing, creator of the Palm Pilot, which is
now part of 3Com Corp.
</P>
<P>
   She has moved on to found a new company, Handspring Inc., that
hopes to help usher in what she calls ``an era of ubiquitous
hand-held computing.'' There is no way, Ms. Dubinsky insists, to
bring the next generation of hand-held devices below $100 in price
without ``disconnecting from the PC'' and making them ``an
extension of the network, not the desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that the personal computer will go away. Indeed,
personal computer shipments worldwide will rise nearly 13 percent
annually though 2002, estimates International Data Corp., a
research firm. What the post-PC faithful foresee, though, is a
shift away from the personal computer as the dominant computing
technology. And they can point to projections from International
Data that by 2005 more information appliances linked to the
Internet _ including set-top boxes, screen phones and hand-held
computers _ will be sold than personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the mainframe industry, analysts say, is
instructive. These big workhorse computers crunch more data than
ever before. But for all intents, the mainframe era ended when the
personal computer moved into the mainstream, with the introduction
of the IBM PC in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Investment and software development focused elsewhere. And the
profit margins on mainframes _ after nearly two decades of pressure
from the economics of the microprocessor and the personal computer
_ are a fraction of what they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Information appliances, notes Steven Milunovich, a managing
director of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., represent a break in the evolution
of the computer industry because they are specialized devices _
designed to perform one or two tasks well _ instead of the
general-purpose computers that both mainframes and personal
computers have been.
</P>
<P>
   All of these new appliances will have digital technology in
common, but they will be tailored for dozens and dozens of
special-purpose niche markets, catering to different needs and
users. It will be a more diverse business, far less susceptible to
being dominated by a few leading technology vendors, as Microsoft
and Intel rule the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging information-appliance industry has attracted the
consumer-electronics giants. Sony Corp., for example, is working to
develop a new class of devices, adapted for what Mario Tokoro, head
of the company's Information Technology Laboratories, calls the
coming era of ``intimate computing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC was created in the image of the monolithic mainframe of
long ago,'' Tokoro, who is a computer scientist, said. In contrast,
Sony expects the information appliance market to produce the
Internet's answer to its ``Walkman'' products _ an opportunity for
innovative new devices not available in the mature personal
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to the post-PC doctrine, the obstacle that prevents
personal computers from being used by more than some 40 percent of
American households is not their cost, which keeps dropping, but
their complexity. One of the intellectual leaders of the post-PC
movement is Donald Norman, a former researcher at Apple Computer
and Hewlett-Packard, whose new book ``The Invisible Computer''
proclaims, ``The Achilles heel of the modern PC is its
difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, Norman says, is the Swiss Army knife of
modern technology. ``While it can fill an amazing variety of needs,
it isn't particularly good at any one of them,'' he writes. The
author's conclusion: ``Information appliances are the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. believes that information appliances are
part of the answer to bringing the 75 percent of American
households not yet linked to the Internet into the online
community. An information-appliance program is an important element
in the long-range strategy behind America Online's $4.2 billion
purchase last month of Netscape Communications Corp. _ a deal that
includes an alliance with Sun Microsystems, whose Java Internet
programming language and Jini technology will be used to feed data
to these simple devices.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the deal was announced, Marc Andreessen, a
co-founder of Netscape, delivered a 12-page memo to Stephen Case,
chairman of America Online, sketching his view of the technological
opportunities for the combined company to extend its reach in the
Internet and in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Internet appliances are clearly part of the plan, enabling
America Online subscribers to get their e-mail and do online
shopping through simple hand-held devices, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online has a big opportunity to drive the acceptance
of these devices,'' Andreessen said. ``It's a consumer company and
for these devices to be successful, you have to work backward from
consumer behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, the strategy is to become the technology plumber for
post-PC computing. The company has decided to leave the appliances
to others, but it plans to supply components for them, from
specialized semiconductor chips that use very little electrical
power to tiny disk drives. IBM is also working on specialized hub
computers, or servers, that have the software needed to act as a
translator for users. These servers could field a request for
information from a consumer and then render it in the form
appropriate for that user _ whether sent to a pager, cell phone,
hand-held device, set-top box or personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Within IBM, the post-PC world is called ``pervasive computing.''
After a yearlong internal study, IBM has set up a pervasive
computing unit to make sure the company's various businesses are
attuned to this emerging market. ``We concluded this is going to be
a big deal and it's going to change the industry,'' said Mark
Bregman, general manager for the pervasive computing unit.
</P>
<P>
   IBM believes change can come without rapid arrival of high-speed
data networks that can deliver movie-quality video and audio to
information appliances anywhere _ the obstacle that opponents of
the post-PC concept say will forestall any major changes. Bregman
says the near-term benefits will be conveniences like calling an
800-number while on vacation and leaving voice-mail instructions so
that several specific e-mail messages you are expecting will be
forwarded to you for reading on the display screen of your cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital investment is beginning to focus on the enabling
technologies of the post-PC era, including new chips for
information appliances, new screen-display technology, and optical
networking, which promises to vastly increase the capacity and
speed of communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The investment and excitement about post-PC computing has some
of the feel of the early 1980s, when the personal computer industry
was starting to take off, observed Richard Shaffer, principal of
Technologic Partners, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shaffer says, the personal computer industry is a mature
business. Winning in that business, he explains, is mainly about
marketing, manufacturing efficiency and inventory management _ with
the success of Dell Computer Corp. as the exemplary case.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We're going back to an era when technology can
really make a business difference again.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: TO TAX OR NOT TO TAX E-SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the final sales numbers were tallied last week, it
was clear that online holiday sales would shoot well past all
expectations. And according to one recent study, the fact that
buyers could make their purchases without paying state or local
sales taxes or use taxes was a strong incentive for shopping on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those who successfully pushed for passage in October of the
Internet Tax Freedom Act, which declared a three-year tax
moratorium for online sales, have reason to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term implications could be troubling. Although the
potential revenue is still too small to pose a serious problem in
the immediate future, what happens a few years down the pike, when
states see as much as one-third of their revenues circling the
drain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, sales tax is the most important source of revenue
for states, so the moratorium is something they're clearly aware of
and worried about,'' said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor
at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Goolsbee, who recently completed a study of the purchasing
habits of online consumers, said his research showed that the
number of online shoppers and the dollar amounts they spend would
drop by 25 percent and 30 percent respectively if they were charged
sales tax on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hue and cry that taxing Internet sales is ``unfair''
to a budding new form of commerce, the Internet in fact only
intensifies a problem that has been brewing for decades in the
mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the legal issue is how to tax purchases that cross
state lines.
</P>
<P>
   A state's sales tax, per se, can only be collected when both
buyer and seller have a physical presence in the state _ meaning
that either there must be a face-to-face transaction or an
out-of-state seller must have an outlet somewhere in the state
where the buyer lives.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few decades ago, this arrangement worked fine. When
mail-order sales started to pick up steam, state governments
decided they had better impose a ``use'' tax on people who bought
items through catalogs (so called because they used their purchases
in the state). Although virtually no one pays such a tax and
virtually no state enforces it, consumers are supposed to
voluntarily pay the equivalent of sales tax on these out-of-state
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers cannot be required by states to collect these use taxes
from their customers, as they collect sales tax, because of
constitutional provisions banning the states from interfering with
interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Although catalog and Internet buyers benefit from this tangled
web, even legendary tax opponents like Arthur Laffer, the
supply-side guru of the Reagan administration, are concerned about
the implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of government is at risk here,'' Laffer said. ``Sales
tax funds virtually everything in the state,'' including police and
fire departments, welfare, roads, schools and mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably the single best tax the state has, because it
has the broadest base and the lowest rate, to collect large sums of
money to fund government services,'' Laffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is something of a political football, says Walter
Hellerstein, a law professor at the University of Georgia who
specializes in the application of constitutional law to state
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that state governments derive at least a third
of their revenue and often more from sales tax, Hellerstein says,
neither the Supreme Court nor Congress wants to be responsible for
the havoc that would be created if the physical presence rule were
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mail-order sellers, since before 1967, have made billions of
dollars in sales and have never collected use tax or filed a tax
return,'' he said. ``Because of that, the statute of limitations is
open'' and, theoretically, sellers could be required to pony up
huge sums of dollars in back taxes, a situation that would put most
of them out of business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other economists are recommending even more radical action. The
Center for Community Economic Research at the University of
California, Berkeley, warned in a paper in August 1995 that ``state
and local government finances are becoming road kill on the
information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   In making its policy recommendations, the center noted that
commerce was increasingly conducted nationally and globally, rather
than locally. Thus, it said, state and local taxes should be scaled
back or even eliminated and replaced with a national tax that is
disbursed back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Stating that ``study after study has shown the regressive nature
of sales tax as a revenue source,'' the paper said sales and use
taxes on mail-order (and, it would follow, Internet) purchases have
more impact on the poor, the disabled and the elderly than on
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the advisory commission on electronic commerce that
was mandated by President Clinton, after the passage of the
Internet Tax Freedom Act, to come up with a solution to the
taxation problem.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was to be made up of equal numbers of
industry and government representatives, is already being berated
by local government agencies like the National Association of
Counties for being lopsided in favor of industry, with powerhouse
companies on board including Time Warner Inc., Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., Netscape Communications Corp. and MCI Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies are not the only ones incensed by the
composition of the commission. ``This does not pass the smell
test,'' said Charles McLure, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute at Stanford University and the economist who wrote the
basis for the Tax Reform Act of 1986. ``This is, `We're going to
build a fence around the chicken coop _ but let's not put any
chickens on it; let's put some wolves.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the commission's final composition may be, one hopes
its deliberations will be shaped by larger societal concerns and
not just the convenience or power of the fortunate few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks they have a constitutional right to buy tax
free when they buy mail order,'' Hellerstein said. ``At some point,
there's going to be revenue shortfall, and then I don't know what
will happen. Right now, everyone's flush and all they can think
about is some other way to cut taxes.''

SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS SAFE IN 2000, CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Monday that the Social
Security Administration had completely fixed all its computers so
that elderly people would receive their monthly benefit payments on
time, without interruption, in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In his most extensive remarks on the subject since July, Clinton
said that elderly people ``can rest easy'' because the Social
Security agency had repaired its computers to deal with the year
2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   He did not address the situation at other agencies judged by the
White House to be inadequately prepared for the year 2000. These
include the Pentagon, the Energy Department and the agency that
runs Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem arises from early computer programming
that often used only the last two digits of the year, making 2000
indistinguishable from 1900 to computers. If the problem is not
corrected, experts say, computers could produce inaccurate data or
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Monday that the year 2000 challenge was ``a
stunning problem'' for computer programmers. But he said: ``The
millennium bug will not delay the payment of Social Security checks
by a single day. The Social Security system is now 100 percent
compliant with our standards and safeguards for the year 2000. To
make absolutely certain, the system has been tested and validated
by a panel of independent experts. The system works, it is secure,
and therefore older Americans can feel more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the computer repairs were a symbol of the policy
changes that had to be made to renovate Social Security and keep it
solvent for the baby boom generation. He again invited Congress to
work with him on this task.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration was known to be ahead of
other agencies in dealing with the year 2000 problem. Social
Security's chief information officer, Kathleen Adams, said she and
her colleagues had been working on the problem since they
discovered it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the White House Office of Management and Budget
said this month that six other agencies were ``not making adequate
progress.'' The six include the Pentagon, the Energy Department and
the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs Medicare
and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Office of Management and Budget said, only 61
percent of the government's ``mission critical'' computer systems
have been fixed. There are nearly 6,700 such systems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's narrow focus Monday, in his first such speech since a
call to action in July, disappointed many experts on the year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., who heads the House Subcommittee on
government Management, Information and Technology, said: ``What
about the departments and agencies that have started their
remediation efforts only within the last few years? The Departments
of Energy, Health and Human Services, Defense, Transportation and
State are all failing in their Y2K repair efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Cohen, a spokesman for the Information
Technology Association of American, a trade group for the computer
industry, said, ``Holding up an example of success shows President
Clinton takes this issue seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Several independent consultants said that what the country
really needed from Clinton was a commitment to make regular reports
on a handful of industries like power, telephones and banks, whose
problems could affect all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is an easy shot,'' said Ian Hayes, president
of Clarity Consulting in South Hamilton, Mass. ``President Clinton
is not giving any reassurance to people who know a lot about the
subject.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton has set March 31, 1999, as the deadline for federal
agencies to have fixed and tested major computer systems to deal
with the year 2000 problem. But in a report issued on Dec. 8, the
Office of Management and Budget said the Pentagon's progress was
``too slow to meet the March 1999 goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said they were worried about
thousands of tiny computers and computer chips embedded in
laboratory equipment and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials said that fixing computers was their
top priority. While scrambling to repair computers, Medicare
officials said they would miss several statutory deadlines for
changes made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. One of these
changes would reduce amounts that elderly people pay for hospital
outpatient services, including diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Even if federal agencies repair their computers, they still must
deal with state agencies, some of which are far behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, for example, is run jointly by the federal government
and the states. A state Medicaid program receives tens of thousands
of electronic claims from health care providers each year. If their
computers cannot cope with the year 2000, their Medicaid payments
may be delayed.

STUDENTS AT HANDFUL OF SCHOOLS IMMERSED IN MULTIMEDIA COMPUTER 
TECHNOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (rl) 
 By LUCILLE RENWICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The excursion to a boulder field in northern Pennsylvania seemed
like any other field trip. Ninth graders from Ed Greaney's earth
science class at Hunterdon Central Regional High School in New
Jersey collected slivers of mammoth volcanic stones, measured them,
snapped pictures and recorded the rushing of waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the students were armed with digital
cameras, laptop computers, tape recorders and the technological
capability to transfer their information directly to computers,
capitalizing on their school's sophisticated use of technology. The
images are now on the school's Web site; they emerge in a 3-D
panoramic tour complete with sound. In the classroom, pairs of
students huddled before computer screens awash in multicolored
graphics as they clicked, downloaded and typed in the information
they had collected for 12-page multimedia reports on the field
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the computer a lot better than just the teacher telling
us or stapling pictures to a piece of paper,'' said Jennifer
Bastian, a 14-year-old in the class.
</P>
<P>
   At Hunterdon Central, in Flemington, N.J., cutting and pasting
no longer means construction paper and glue. The school is among a
handful nationwide that are infusing computers into almost every
aspect of learning. Multimedia software programs, once the province
of graphic art classes, are now being absorbed into every subject.
</P>
<P>
   At Napa New Technologies High School in northern California,
students take notes on computers at their desks and turn in
assignments on disk or by e-mail. In the Olympia, Wash., school
district, students coach teachers in new technologies. In Tucson,
Ariz., students design the layout of computer labs and create and
maintain Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology sucks the students in to the point where they
end up doing additional research and more work on a project simply
because it's fun,'' said Pamela Lee Hopkins, an English teacher who
leads the Tucson program.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Harper of the Olympia school district agreed. ``If we're
training kids to be the future workers in the 2060s, then we've got
to at least move beyond the teaching tools of the 1960s and reach
them on a level and with materials they're used to,'' he said.
``And that's computers and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Salpeter, editor of Technology and Learning magazine, says
that Hunterdon, Tucson, Olympia and Napa are among only 20 to 30
high schools in the United States using computer technology. Most
schools are just beginning to delve beyond word processing and
surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hunterdon Central officials began in 1990 with a plan to embrace
multimedia technology, which combines text, sound, animation and
still and video images. Today, Hunterdon has more than 1,200 PCs
for its 2,160 students. Every classroom has at least six computers
linked by a high-speed network. All students have e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Florence McGinn's creative writing class, which looks more like
a computer lab than a traditional classroom, is a hotbed of
experimentation. Two-dozen computers line the walls, and several
have digital cameras mounted on them for videoconferencing with
student mentors at Rider University, 30 minutes away in
Lawrenceville, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McGinn created the school's online multimedia literary
magazine, Electronic Soup, which some 50 Hunterdon students produce
with peers at Asbury Park High School and at a high school in
Bangladesh. The students edit poetry together by e-mail and digital
video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McGinn's desk is an L-shaped workstation with a 21-inch
monitor linked to her personal computer. A second monitor connects
with each computer in the room so she can scan students' work or
the Web sites they are visiting from her desk, allowing her to make
immediate corrections or suggestions by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity of their interest becomes so strong that the
learning goes beyond grades,'' Mrs. McGinn said.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner, Rick Morrison, 17, was revising his multimedia
interpretation of a poem he wrote using Milton's title, ``Paradise
Lost.'' ``You can convey your feelings so strong, even more than on
paper,'' said Rick, a senior who knew little of computers and less
of poetry last year.
</P>
<P>
   He slid a disk into the CD-ROM drive. The poem came to life in a
presentation that conveyed a feeling of isolation. Images of Rick's
face and body swirled around the screen, superimposed on backdrops
of New York City and a deserted beach and accompanied by classical
music and the fading words of the poem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely more interested in poetry and creative writing
now that I can use the multimedia graphics as part of the
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neela Mookerjee, a junior in Mrs. McGinn's class, was also
relatively unacquainted with computer graphics in September. In
three months, Neela, 16, has become so adept at graphics programs
that she now opts for multimedia presentations for most of her
large assignments. In a project on censorship for a history class,
she created a Web site rather than a written report.
</P>
<P>
   In the Napa Valley of California, the idea for a
technology-centered high school was proposed by local business
leaders. Napa New Tech opened in 1996 with a $250,000 grant from
the federal Department of Education, plus help from nearby
technology companies. There is a computer at every classroom desk
for the 220 11th and 12th graders. Teachers recruited for their
knowledge of technology create lesson plans from online video
files, CD-ROMs, Web sites and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Students are assigned to unpaid internships at technology-based
companies in the Napa Valley for 15 hours a semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through technology the kids see what they can do differently
in school, and better in many cases,'' said JoAnne Miller, director
of external relations at Napa New Tech.
</P>
<P>
   At Desert View High School in Tucson, Ms. Hopkins' business
technology students often arrive with C averages, but improve to
B's or better, spurred on by the prospect of admission to Desert
View's business technology program. Financed with federal
school-to-work funds, the program operates like a small business
inside the school, a sort of internal consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cuban, a Stanford University education professor and
critic of education technology, concedes that computers engage
students around enticing projects. But he worries about a growing
technology gap.
</P>
<P>
   Computer access depends in part on a community's wealth and in
part on administrators who know how to apply for grants. Hunterdon
Central was blessed with both. The school is located in a
reasonably affluent area in southern New Jersey, and district
officials have been able to secure grants from large foundations
and companies like AT &AMP; T. This has enabled the school to pay
$40,000 per classroom for computer equipment, said Ron Pare,
director of information systems at Hunterdon.

PROTECTING PRIVACY IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As 1998 winds to a close (finally!), many in the
online world are sounding an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern: privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Web continues to grow, reaching into the lives of millions
of people, becoming a part of everyday life and emerging as a
trusted medium of communication _ everything from simple e-mail to
delicate financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, that's good. The more people online, the more
useful the Web becomes. And the more people embrace computers and
online communication, the more benefits we all enjoy _ everything
from secure online banking to lively forums on our favorite topics.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the booming online economy has sparked a mad
dash for cash _ money to be earned from anybody and everybody who
goes online. And the money can be made whether or not you've given
a Web site your Visa card number.
</P>
<P>
   How? By selling your information _ your age, your browsing
habits, the advertisements you choose to click on, your hometown
and any other tidbit Web sites can glean from you as your
electronic path crosses their contest entry forms and other tricks
they use to get you to enter personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Online ``cookies,'' nuggets of information Web sites store on
your hard drive, remain as useful to the individual surfer as to
the originating Web site. But cookies, combined with ``data
mining,'' the ability of highly technical software tools to dive
into oceans of seemingly unrelated data and emerge with trends that
can be used to make money, are making the information brokering
business a lucrative one.
</P>
<P>
   Millions, if not billions, of dollars are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   All this has renewed interest and concern over online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites make money by luring as many people as possible
through their electronic doors.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites, especially heavy-hitters such as Yahoo! or
America Online, try to convince the surfing public to begin each
online venture using specific online ``portals,'' or home pages.
They do this by offering free e-mail and the ability to customize
the portal to suit individual desires when it comes to news, sports
and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Once surfers have entered all of their information into the
appropriate online form, they are treated to a more personalized
and somewhat friendlier online experience.
</P>
<P>
   But what's to keep the Web site that just collected all that
data from turning around and selling it?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Although many major Web sites have taken great pains to protect
the privacy of their users, many others continue to operate with
little or no regard to individual privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired News'' recently concluded that despite repeated warnings
from federal regulators, the online community has done a poor job
regulating itself when it comes to protecting the privacy of
individual users.
</P>
<P>
   In a Dec. 22 perspective piece, James Glave of ``Wired News''
indicated that federally imposed consumer privacy protection laws
might be the answer:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Trust us,'' say the Internet lobbyists fighting such laws
under the self-regulation lobby,'' Glave wrote. ``But why should
you? You have no more control over information kept about you than
you did a year and a half ago, when leaders of the Web first stood
up in Federal Trade Commission hearings and argued against laws
that would empower end users.''
</P>
<P>
   The dawning of 1999 may, in fact, bring some type of federal
regulation of online privacy unless self-regulating efforts, such
as TrustE, an industry coalition that hands out ``privacy seals of
approval'' to deserving Web sites, are able to make some
significant headway.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, individual users can do a few things to protect
themselves:
</P>
<P>
   - When using Web sites that require personal information, first
look and see whether they have a posted policy on privacy. If they
do, read it. Make sure you don't need to check a box somewhere or
send someone e-mail to keep them from selling your data. If they
don't have a privacy policy, take your business somewhere else!
</P>
<P>
   - Even if a Web site offers a great privacy policy, think twice
before filling out contest entry forms or other methods of online
registration. Do you really value what you will get in return for
giving up your personal data?
</P>
<P>
   - When faced with an online registration form of any sort, don't
just blindly fill in all the blanks. Often, only certain fields are
required, such as your e-mail address. Many other fields, such as
your annual household income, your age, etc., could be optional.
You can protect some of your privacy by not filling in the optional
fields.
</P>
<P>
   - Like to participate in online forums? No problem with that.
But be cautious about the personal facts you sprinkle throughout
your missives. Messages posted to public forums take on lives of
their own, and personal details you've revealed can be collected
and used by anybody.
</P>
<P>
   - Read more about online privacy and, if you oversee a Web site,
develop your own privacy policy by visiting TrustE's Web site at
www.truste.org/ or the Web site of the Online Privacy Alliance at
www.privacyalliance.org/.
</P>
<P>
   - Want to become more active in protecting online privacy? Check
out the Privacy Watchdog, a new Web site and service created by the
Center for Democracy and Technology. The site, at
watchdog.cdt.org/, is aimed at halting the abuse of online cookies.
It encourages individual Web surfers to participate by rating Web
sites of their choice when it comes to privacy. &QL; 
HOME SERVER NEWS
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers of this column know that I like to rant about
the need for home networks _ systems linked to a home server that
can run electronic appliances throughout the home.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of such home networks exist, but I've yet to see anybody
get serious about making it work in a cost-effective and realistic
fashion. We need, for example, computer terminals designed for the
space where they are to be used, like small, easily cleaned models
for the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as though 1999 will bring us closer to that reality.
</P>
<P>
   First off, industry insiders say the coming year will see the
first products released that meet the so-called ``HAVI'' standards.
HAVI, which stands for Home Audio Video Interoperability, allows
companies to make devices that all can ``talk'' to each other.
</P>
<P>
   A simple example of HAVI's usefulness: You download the latest
album from your favorite musical group from a Web site, but instead
of just saving it to your computer's hard drive, you pass it on for
immediate use to the stereo in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, Matsushita, Hitachi, Toshiba, Sharp, Thompson and Philips
are expected to release the first HAVI devices over the next 12
months. Whether they'll be cheap enough to purchase, I'm not sure.
But this is a step in the right direction!
</P>
<P>
   Another home server development: CEOs are beginning to speak
openly about the home server market and the fact that the
development of such a market will play a key role in maintaining
strong sales of PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This news has surfaced from a variety of sources, including
``Fortune'' magazine's David Kirkpatrick, who managed to speak to
five CEOs at the recent COMDEX computer trade show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway CEO Ted Waitt and Sony Electronics President Teruaki
Aoki both told Kirkpatrick that home PCs would become servers
capable of running a variety of appliances throughout the home.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki went so far as to say that the home server concept is one
of the reasons Sony entered the PC business.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see where the home server idea stands
come this time next year.  &QL; 
THIS WEEK'S DOSE OF HUMOR
</P>
<P>
   I remember back in my school days reading books about
``pioneers.'' Typically, these were folks who did things like
crossing America in covered wagons 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet and the fast pace of computers, we are
now seeing the word ``pioneer'' used with a bit more abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: A recent press release from the public relations
staff behind iPrint.com, an online print shop at www.iprint.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``iPrint.com pioneered the concept of the online print shop back
in early 1997,'' the press release stated.
</P>
<P>
   Good god! Early 1997? That was a loooong time ago! Was Arizona
even a state back then?
</P>
<P>
   Ha!
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's it for this week (and 1998)! Happy computing, and
have a great New Year! &QL;

Military brats using Internet to find old pals 
By Elizabeth Lee  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Diane Atherton, life as a military brat meant a
different school each year. Three schools in seventh grade in New
York. Her senior year in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For her, as for many military dependents, home was wherever you
happened to live at the time. Friendships formed quickly, and often
ended just as abruptly when families moved to other posts.
</P>
<P>
   Now many ``military brats,'' like Atherton, are rekindling
friendships formed decades ago by using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Military Brats Registry, based in California, contains more
than 14,400 names and claims at least one marriage from reunited
high school sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Military Brats Online, created by Vann Baker of
Roswell, Ga., carries reunion notices and reminiscences of base
life.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton, 52, has found many classmates. ``People that I didn't
think I would ever hear from again, like my girlfriend in Denver,
people who live in Hawaii, folks who travel all over the Asian
Pacific Rim, they're all being reconnected,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton and Sharon Wolfe of Denver, a friend from Yamato High
School in Japan, now e-mail each other frequently and travel
together once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a big family, and my sister died about 10 or 12
years ago, so it's nice to have someone who knew the same people I
did,'' Atherton says. ``There's a piece of me that's missing, and
now it's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Others share those sentiments. Valeria Palmer, 44, started
reading military brat newsgroups a decade ago. Her family moved 10
times before she turned 18; on the Internet, she found community.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been very helpful to me is to discover that others
had the same experiences and feelings that I did,'' she says. ``To
learn about how the child I was makes me the person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Curtis of Redlands, Calif., started the Military Brats
Registry site in 1997 while trying to find childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Baker takes another approach with Military Brats Online, which
lists hundreds of alumni groups for military schools.
</P>
<P>
   He's making new friends by organizing metro Atlanta brat
reunions and meeting others through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being of a different ethnic background, but you
don't really look different from anyone else,'' says Baker, 42.
``You fit in, but you know you're not like everyone else. That's
part of what fuels this desire to want to reconnect again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. For others, a little catching up goes a long way. Like a
high school reunion, once you've gotten updates on jobs and
families, there's not much left to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``People you were friends with when you were 8, it's nice to see
them, know they're still around,'' says Zach Fowl. ``But when
you're 27, things change.''

   As acceptance speeches go, it ranked right up there with Cuba
Gooding's jumping jacks and Jack Palance's one-armed pushups. Sure,
it was the Emmys rather than the Oscars, but that hardly put a
crimp in Camryn Manheim's zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' she squealed, clutching the little statue she won for
her role as feisty lawyer Ellen Frutt on ``The Practice,'' ``is for
all the fat girls!''
</P>
<P>
   Such sweet revenge is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   On both network and cable, prime time and daytime, plus-sized
personalities are everywhere, emoting and yukking it up in all
their zaftig glory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Manheim now has an entire sisterhood of full-figured
peers, including Kristie Alley and Kathy Najimy, Star Jones, Emme,
Rosie O'Donnell and Roseanne Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Need further proof of TV's newly democratic stance? Even
``Baywatch'' is flirting with the idea of a character not cut along
the Barbie-esque lines of Pamela Lee or Carmen Electra. According
to a spokesperson, the show's casting director and producers have
met with plus-sized actress Kiki Hall, who is under consideration
for a guest-starring spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a story idea in development,'' the spokesperson says.
``We're always looking for fresh faces.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Alicia Silverstone's chubby arms sent
shockwaves through the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the 1996
Academy Awards, the movie world has also begun to turn its back on
the tyranny of female perfection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all the loving odes to Jennifer Lopez's colossal
behind of late, Kate Winslet's curvy form has also given the status
quo a swift kick in the pants. Though hardly rotund, Winslet
radiates a certain womanly beauty not seen in American films since
the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   And in the teen realm, who has popped up on screen more often
lately than the defiantly pudgy Christina Ricci?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's hip to be hippy these days. But an even bigger stamp
of approval is coming from, of all places, the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   Models, who have long waved the goddess flag, are being held to
much less rigorous standards today. Of course, the pendulum had to
swing a lot further in the other direction first _ the emaciated
likes of Kristen Owen or an Amy Wesson just wouldn't have happened
10 years ago _ there's nonetheless a mini-revolution afoot in Model
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the success of Ten/20, Wilhelmina's booming plus-sized
division. Although there are other New York-based agencies with
healthy plus contingents, Wilhelmina represents the brightest stars
in this particular constellation, including Kate Dillon, Mia Tyler
and Natalie Laughlin.
</P>
<P>
   The division, which celebrates its fourth anniversary in
January, now handles roughly 40 girls on a full-time basis, as well
as an additional 10 to 15 who are either still in school or who
live outside the United States and are only here sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems like only yesterday that Ten/20 director Susan
Georget had to beat the bushes to build her model roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no girls at all at first,'' she recalls. ``I even
started stopping women on the street and in the subway.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spent 10 years at Plus Models before starting the
division at Wilhelmina, Georget is hyper-aware of what a tough sell
large sizes can be. But she's never been more optimistic about the
market's prospects than she is right now.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the scads and scads of catalog assignments her models
routinely land, there are ad campaigns, billboards in Times Square,
even a smidge of runway.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been several magazine profiles and special,
large-sized fashion stories _ primarily in Mode and Galmour _
featuring Dillon, Laughlin and Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle, Georget admits, is incorporation into the
editorial mainstream. In other words, real victory can't be claimed
until full-figured models are booked alongside ``straight-sized''
girls for the same story.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that hasn't happened in any meaningful manner yet,
although a new teen publication, Girl, took a stab at it in its
premiere issue. But while she refuses to give details, Georget says
Dillon will shortly be seen in a major fashion story by a marquee
name photographer.
</P>
<P>
   A watershed event? It is by fashion's snooty standards. For
decades, most of the more influential fashion magazines have
somehow managed to operate in full denial of the fact that American
women grow heavier with each passing year. Depending on which study
is cited, the average U.S. female currently wears a size 12 or
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't just women who are packing on the pounds.
According to the new guidelines set by the National Heart, Lung and
Blood institute (a branch of the NIH) this past summer, 97 million
American adults _ 55 percent of the entire population _ are now
considered overweight or obese. And recent findings by the American
Academy of Pediatrics peg a full 25 percent of U.S. kids as
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable, then, that some may view the media's new
``fat acceptance'' less as a feminist manifesto and more of a
wholesale dropping of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   If it's possible that fashion spreads depicting scarecrow-thin
models can send one message (``Starve yourself''), it's equally
conceivable that layouts featuring large-sized mannequins can
telegraph another (``Eat _ consequences be dammed'').
</P>
<P>
   While neither extreme is ideal, there is little doubt which side
the p.c. faction is weighing in on. One New York-based weight-loss
specialist, Dr. Howard Shapiro, has found himself caught in the
crossfire of various fat acceptance groups when he's made the
rounds of daytime chat shows such as ``Sally Jessy'' and ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an issue with people who push acceptance of fat without
stating the consequences,''he says. ``You can't push for obesity
without telling people that they're at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to be overweight, I have no problem with
that,'' he adds. ``But that person's position should be, `I'm
accepting the fact that I'm overweight and know that the potential
for health risks is greater. I have a higher potential for heart
disease, for certain types of cancer, for a stroke.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent and teen-age girls are in even greater danger of a
health backlash, Shapiro says, if they somehow latch on to the
notion that being fat is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're obese as a kid, and you continue to keep that weight
on as an adult, you will develop the same types of problems at a
younger age.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with people who are struggling is that they'll
take the path of least resistance,'' he adds. ``And if someone
teaches them that being overweight is great, they'd rather do that
than work at being thin. So they find a niche where they're
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's getting easier every day to find that niche. All it
takes these days is a click of the remote control or a quick trip
to the newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't mind being a little more voluptuous now,'' Shapiro
says. ``It's the trend at the moment.'' &QL;

   As acceptance speeches go, it ranked right up there with Cuba
Gooding's jumping jacks and Jack Palance's one-armed pushups. Sure,
it was the Emmys rather than the Oscars, but that hardly put a
crimp in Camryn Manheim's zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' she squealed, clutching the little statue she won for
her role as feisty lawyer Ellen Frutt on ``The Practice,'' ``is for
all the fat girls!''
</P>
<P>
   Such sweet revenge is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   On both network and cable, prime time and daytime, plus-sized
personalities are everywhere, emoting and yukking it up in all
their zaftig glory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Manheim now has an entire sisterhood of full-figured
peers, including Kristie Alley and Kathy Najimy, Star Jones, Emme,
Rosie O'Donnell and Roseanne Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Need further proof of TV's newly democratic stance? Even
``Baywatch'' is flirting with the idea of a character not cut along
the Barbie-esque lines of Pamela Lee or Carmen Electra. According
to a spokesperson, the show's casting director and producers have
met with plus-sized actress Kiki Hall, who is under consideration
for a guest-starring spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a story idea in development,'' the spokesperson says.
``We're always looking for fresh faces.''

   Running out of the house without a scrap of makeup on is a
definite no-no, at least according to the old rules of seduction.
As Estee Lauder pointed out in her autobiography, ``Why should you
look like a faded Polaroid snapshot? Who's going to remember you
that way?''
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're running at the gym? Is it acceptable, or even
wise, to look like a faded Polaroid when you're fighting for breath
on a treadmill?
</P>
<P>
   After all, you never know when a blue-chip bachelor could be
polishing his muscles right next to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many women who met their husbands at the Vertical Club,
and these are women who are very makeup savvy,'' says makeup artist
Laura Geller. ``They did not go to the gym in schmattas or wearing
loose sweatpants. They're wearing G-strings up their tushies, and
they look really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises when a woman goes overboard, troweling on the
foundation, blush and mascara and shellacking her hair with
powerful sprays. This is the look that MAC creative director Frank
Toskan describes as ``eerie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the informal poll of makeup artists below, a host of opinions
surfaced on the topic of workout beauty. While a few were
vehemently opposed to even a drop of coverup, most counseled a
light application of products that breathe.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, minimal mascara and lip balm are considered fine.
For a face that can withstand even the most ferocious kickboxing
class, the makeup artists recommend waterproof and longlasting
formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Several brands, including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome and
Revlon, sell a variety of products that won't budge. And Almay
bills its new Amazing Lasting Sheer Makeup as the base ``that's got
you covered from wake-up to workout.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DICK PAGE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's completely absurd to wear makeup at the gym _
just short of certifiable. It's the urban equivalent of going to
the beach with makeup and jewelry on. Nothing looks worse than
breaking a sweat through makeup _ it's kind of grim _ so I would
not use foundation. I guess you could have your eyelashes dyed. And
maybe a nice lip pencil a couple of shades darker than your lips
and a dot of lip balm.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARIA VEREL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should absolutely wear makeup to the gym. If you see the
man of your dreams and you wish your lashes were a little more
defined, there's no going back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cover the occasional blemish with a spot concealer and
invisible powder. I would highly recommend a waterproof mascara. A
trick for the lips is nude lipliner smeared over lip conditioner to
brighten the color of your lips. And don't rub your face, only
blot!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRED FARRUGIA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't advise a French woman to wear makeup at the gym,
but American women are very put-together and never go out without
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a woman at a sports club should look like she has
a healthy glow, but not like she's wearing cosmetics. Why not stick
on a pair of false eyelashes? And rub in a little bit of gloss on
the lips and eyes and a dot of creamy pink blush on the cheeks. On
the body, hydrating cream makes muscles gleam. A very important
touch: a French manicure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAURA GELLER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can get down and dirty and sweat and still look
good. Try waterproof mascara, a little bit of liner, oil-free
dual-finish powder and long-wearing lipstick. Or put on one of my
Lip Shines if you don't want to look like you're wearing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VINCENT LONGO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen girls wear full-on makeup at the gym, and it's just
not that appealing. But there's a way to look pretty without going
over the top. You can brush your eyebrows with a fixative so they
look nicely arched. You can curl your lashes and put on mascara. I
don't mind if there's a little stain on the lip or on the eyelid.
The best way to achieve this is with pencils because they're more
resistant to perspiration. You can even go to the extent of
applying a light oil on your body as a moisturizer. It gives you
beautiful sheen.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRANK TOSKAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming dependent on makeup psychologically is a mistake.
It's eerie to see a woman with a full face of makeup jogging. If a
woman insists, she should wear products that are translucent and
not powdery-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHASE ASTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think that you should wear makeup to the gym.
But if a woman is living by `The Rules,' then I seriously suggest
she have her eyelashes tinted to a fluttering soft black. If she's
a slave to makeup, she can invest in a lip stain, so she'll always
have that perfect pout. And she should pinch her cheeks
regularly.'' &QL;

A SLOW, RELUCTANT THUMBS DOWN  
 BY HERBERT STEIN
</HEADLINE>
  (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The preliminaries are over. It is time to decide. Should the
Senate convict President Clinton and expel him from office? My
answer, after months of indecision, is a strong ``Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   I had formerly been impressed by the argument that ousting
Clinton would set a precedent for any party having a sufficient
majority in Congress to get rid of any president, which would
convert us into a parliamentary democracy. At one time I had
thought our problem might be solved by the 15th Amendment, which
provides for the removal of a president found unable to perform the
duties of his office. But that required the concurrence of the vice
president, which would surely not be forthcoming. I had also
thought that Clinton might save us a lot of soul-searching by
resigning, but apparently he will not. At some times I thought that
censure or rebuke might do as punishment and expression of
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   I can say exactly when I came to the conclusion that Clinton had
to be removed. It was the morning of Dec. 15, 1998. That was two
days before the House of Representatives was to start action on
impeaching him. It was also one day before he gave orders to bomb
Iraq. I got out of bed that morning, took in the papers, and
scanned the first page. Within 10 minutes I was decided, and not
only decided, but decided with a heat that I rarely feel about
public affairs. What sparked this heat was the picture of Clinton
in Gaza, and the reminder of the picture of Clinton the previous
day, wearing a yarmulke at the grave of Yitzhak Rabin. And I
suddenly thought, ``Is this the man I want representing the
righteousness of America in a land sacred to billions of Jews,
Christians, and Moslems?'' Then I asked whether I wanted him to
represent us anywhere. Do we want him laying the wreath at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier, comforting our mourners, saluting our
heroes? Do I want to see his ``sincere'' face on television every
day? No, decidedly no!
</P>
<P>
   No, even more decidedly no, after the bombing of Iraq. I don't
know whether he decided to bomb Iraq in order to divert us from the
forthcoming impeachment debate. That is the point: I don't know,
and most of the world doesn't know. He has generated the belief
that he is capable of taking such grave action to save his own
skin. Terminating the action in Iraq without any conclusive results
only a few hours after the House voted for impeachment strengthened
that belief. He had started the bombing just in time to give his
supporters the refuge of arguing that to impeach the commander in
chief while our troops were in harm's way would be unpatriotic. He
had stopped the bombing as soon as that argument became useless.
That is an abuse of power! The whole episode shows how unfit he is
to be president. He has polluted the atmosphere within which policy
decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everyone else, I want to get ``this thing'' over
with. But to me ``this thing'' is not only the process; it is also
the Clinton presidency. I don't want to punish him or have a
national catharsis. I want something more practical. I want him off
our screen.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that I never wanted Clinton to be president and never
voted for him. But I was always ``cool'' about it. I have not been
a deep-dyed Clinton hater. Except for the 1993 health care plan,
and his vacillation toward Iraq, his policy has not been terrible,
in my opinion. The performance of the economy during his
administration has been good, and although I don't attribute very
much of that to him, at least he has not been an obstacle. I don't
expect any improvement, or any change, in public policy as a result
of his departure.
</P>
<P>
   An an article I wrote during the 1996 campaign (pre-Lewinsky) I
said of Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ``But he has one serious deficiency as a president. He is prone
to foolish mistakes. Every president, like everyone else, makes
mistakes. Foolish mistakes are ones that could reliably have been
known in advance to be mistakes. There is something in Bill
Clinton--some odd combination of naivete and conceit--that makes
him liable to such mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gone too far in his foolish mistakes, and beyond foolish
mistakes, and I am no longer ``cool'' about him as president.
</P>
<P>
   People who are legally fastidious say it's not the sex, it's the
perjury. For me it is partly the sex. If he had lied under oath
about parking illegally I wouldn't be so disgusted. But for a
married man to have oral sex with a woman employee less than half
his age in the Oval Office--I can't claim not to be offended by
that. I have been told that is an old-fashioned, puritanical
attitude. But even old-fashioned puritans have the right as
citizens to protest the behavior of their president. And it is not
only the perjury. It is the sophomoric deviousness of the perjury
that is an insult to our intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional question remains. Does his behavior add up to
grounds for removal from office? The words in the Constitution,
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' give us much latitude. If the
framers had wanted to limit us more they could have been more
specific. Essentially, they left the judgment to us--not to an
opinion poll or even to our political representatives who are
closest to the people but to our most senior political
representatives, the Senate. My opinion is that not every perjury
is a ``high'' crime, as grounds for removing a president from
office. But I believe that Clinton's performance, before and after
his perjuries, has universally generated such a response of
disapproval, ranging from cynicism to disgust, as to degrade the
ability of the presidency to serve its function. Clinton has said
that it is his goal to degrade the ability of Saddam Hussein to
threaten Iraq's neighbors. But Clinton has degraded the ability of
the president of the United States to lead the nation and the
world. That is a high crime.
</P>
<P>
   I am still concerned about the risk of setting a precedent for
opposition majorities in Congress to remove presidents for purely
political reasons. Future generations will have to deal with that.
For now we have to set the precedent that presidents of the United
States should so behave themselves as to merit the confidence of
the world. This is a big country, and surely we can find men and
women in it who are as capable of being president as Mr. Clinton is
and who are also able to commit themselves to good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a vote of at least two-thirds of the
Senate to convict and expel a president. The Republicans will not
have a two-thirds majority, and Clinton cannot be convicted on the
votes of Republicans alone. That is a good thing. The
precedent-setting risk would be greater if the president were
convicted by a strictly party-line vote. The case against the
president should be strong enough to justify some members of his
own party voting against him. In the case of this president, it is.

LET'S GO BACK AND IMPEACH REAGAN  
 BY MICHAEL KINSLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so it's not about sex. It's about lying under oath,
obstruction of justice, and abuse of power. If the standards used
to impeach President Clinton for those offenses were applied to his
two Republican predecessors, Reagan and Bush, they would have been
impeached too. The fact that they weren't owes less to any lack of
evidence than to a sense of proportion and respect for the popular
will--or call it cowardice, perhaps--in the opposition party (the
Democrats), which then controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Ronald Reagan ever talked about Iran-Contra under
oath was in a deposition for the criminal trial of his former
National Security Adviser John Poindexter. The deposition was in
1990, after Reagan had left office. He claimed that there was not
``one iota'' of evidence that profits from the sale of arms to Iran
had been diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras, that his aides hadn't
lied to Congress about the affair, and so on. All this was
demonstrably false. The only reason he might not be guilty of
perjury is that his mind pretty clearly was going.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that Reagan was never forced to testify under
oath as president illustrates the double standard that has trapped
Bill Clinton. If Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh had operated
like Kenneth Starr, he would have forced Reagan, while president,
to repeat or renounce under oath his public lies about Iran-Contra,
such as those in his first TV address on the subject, when he
declared it ``utterly false'' that arms had been shipped to Iran in
exchange for the release of American hostages. This was as vivid as
Clinton's televised finger-wagging ``that woman'' sound bite, and
just as flatly untrue. Reagan had been at several meetings where
the arms-for-hostages deal was discussed--and, indeed, where
Cabinet members had warned him it was illegal and he'd said he
didn't care. If Walsh had been Starr, Reagan would have faced the
same excruciating dilemma as Clinton: admit to a spectacular public
lie or lie again under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly Reagan was already gaga in 1986, while still president,
though this is not an argument the Republicans now pursuing Clinton
are likely to want to make (or were heard to make back in 1986).
But even before he was officially declared to be losing it, Reagan
benefited from a more general double standard about truth telling.
Reagan and Clinton both are among the great bullslingers of
American history, but somehow Reagan was always regarded as
floating above the truth while Clinton is regarded as wallowing
beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's final report concluded that Reagan ``knowingly
participated or at least acquiesced in'' the Iran-Contra cover-up,
which involved, among other things, Oliver North shredding
thousands of documents that may well have implicated Reagan more
deeply. Any Flytrap cover-up pales in comparison. (The nearest
equivalent involves the mysterious appearance--not
disappearance--of documents, none of which has turned out to be
vital, in a White House closet.) Yet Walsh didn't bring charges
against Reagan, or even depose him to squeeze out information or
set him up for a perjury rap.
</P>
<P>
   The case against George Bush--by the standards being applied to
Bill Clinton--is even stronger. Bush claimed in the 1992 campaign
that he'd given sworn testimony hundreds of times conceding that he
knew all about the arms-for-hostages deal. In fact, when the story
broke in 1986, Bush repeatedly claimed to have been ``out of the
loop.'' He knew we were selling arms to Iran--itself flatly illegal
and spectacularly in conflict with the administration's public
pronouncements--but, he claimed, he had no idea the deal involved
paying ransom for hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Bush claimed not to have attended a January 1986
meeting at which Secretary of State George Schultz and Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger vehemently opposed trading for hostages.
When White House logs indicated that Bush was at the
</P>
<P>
   meeting, he emended his story to say he hadn't caught the drift
of Schultz's and Weinberger's objections. If only he'd known George
and Cap were as bothered as he was, Bush said, he would have tried
to stop the policy. This was his story until 1992, when Walsh
released notes taken by Weinberger at the meeting, recording that
``VP approves'' of the policy Bush claimed to be both ignorant of
and disturbed by.
</P>
<P>
   As president in 1989-93, Bush did his best to thwart Walsh's
investigation. He tightened up on the release of classified
information. A diary he started keeping in 1986 somehow never
materialized until after the 1992 election. And his last-minute
pardon of Weinberger, Poindexter, and others, after he'd lost
re-election, effectively thwarted Walsh's pursuit of Bush himself,
among others. No ``obstruction of justice'' or ``abuse of
presidential power'' in Flytrap comes close.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Bill Clinton's presidency stamped forever with the
shame of impeachment, and why does he face premature removal from
office, when impeachment was never seriously considered for Bush
and Reagan? Perhaps at this point Clinton's critics would like to
revisit their insistence that it's not about sex. The only sensible
distinction is that lies about some things matter more than others.
Henry Hyde, for example, was quite eloquent back in the Iran-Contra
era about how statesmanship and higher principles sometimes require
presidents to lie and break the law.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and others would be tempted to say that lying to free
American hostages and breaking the law to protect Latin America
from communism are more justified than lies to hide a tawdry
affair. I would be tempted to reply that lies and cover-ups
intended to thwart the workings of democracy on an important public
policy issue seem to me to be a lot worse than lies about an
embarrassing personal mess. But perhaps we could agree that David
Schippers, the House Judiciary Committee Counsel, was wrong in his
self-righteous pronouncement ``Lies are lies are lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers himself told a quick series of obvious whoppers during
that same impeachment hearing opening statement. ``When I appeared
in this committee room a little over two months ago,'' he said
(mournful as the Walrus in Through the Looking Glass), ``it was
merely to analyze the (Starr report) referral and to report to you.
Today, after our investigation, I come to a point that frankly I
prayed I would never reach. It is my sorrowful duty now to accuse
President William Jefferson Clinton,'' etc., etc. Raise your hand
if you believe Schippers a) was feeling sorrowful; b) had prayed
that his months of effort to nail the president would be in vain;
c) was being frank; d) had no settled view on the whole matter even
after analyzing the Starr report, until ``our investigation''
(whatever that consisted of). And while your hand is up, would you
care to swear an oath that you believe these unbelievable things?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a witness lies, that witness chips a stone from the
foundation of our entire legal system,'' Schippers intoned. Or does
he make an exception when the witness is himself? Trent Lott, as
Senate majority leader, is overseer of the forthcoming Clinton
trial. He was pictured in the New York Times of Dec. 25 actually
wagging his finger, Clinton-''that woman''-style, as he publicly
lied to get himself out of a fix. On Wednesday he had said about
the Baghdad bombing: ``While I have been assured by administration
officials that there is no connection with the impeachment process
... I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time. Both the timing and the policy are subject to
question.''
</P>
<P>
   It was immediately clear that Lott should not have said this. So
on Thursday, Lott declared that he did support the action, did not
suspect any connection with the impeachment process, and had not
meant to imply otherwise merely by uttering words whose plain
meaning and universal interpretation was the exact opposite. Lott's
sushi-master carve-up of the phrase ``at this time'' was positively
Clintonian in its boldness and artistry. Of course he wasn't under
oath, so that's OK. What made the Lott incident especially
enjoyable is that Republicans all rallied round the obvious meaning
of his original statement even as Lott himself was denying it. Paul
Gigot, for example, got trapped midspin-cycle. In his Friday column
on the Wall Street Journal editorial page, he praised Lott's remark
as ``an honest, considered judgment.'' But how could a conservative
Republican senator and major flag waver for the original Gulf War
honestly oppose punishing Saddam for violating his surrender terms?
Easy: ``This is the surreal politics Bill Clinton has created.
Hawks are now doves and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely, Paul, you don't really believe Clinton bombed
Baghdad to affect the impeachment vote? Well, no, but, ``The
tragedy for American interests is that Mr. Clinton is doubted even
when he might be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Neato. Clinton is thus responsible not only for his own lies and
hypocrisies but also for those of his enemies. No doubt he is
somehow to blame for Iran-Contra too.

AMAZON.COM'S AMAZING TAX BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of days ago, annoyed with Amazon.com because 10 days
had passed since I placed an order and it still hadn't been shipped
yet, I canceled that order and went (in the virtual sense) to
barnesandnoble.com to buy the set of books I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I placed the books in my virtual shopping cart and got to the
end of the checkout line, but when I arrived there I discovered
that my New York address meant that I was going to have to pay the
8.25 percent state sales tax on any orders from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Since Amazon.com charges sales tax only to residents of the
state of Washington, I canceled my barnesandnoble.com order and
returned to Jeff Bezos' site, chastened. Amazon ended up getting my
order, despite its inferior service, because I was able to practice
tax evasion while buying there.
</P>
<P>
   A story with an obvious moral, to be sure, but just because the
moral is obvious doesn't mean that it's unimportant. In fact, in
the glorious hubbub about the inevitable triumph of e-commerce, too
little attention has been paid to the impact of tax-free purchasing
on the demand for buying goods over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard a lot of talk about how online retailing allows
sellers to deliver goods more cheaply and efficiently than in the
offline world. But one of the key reasons why sellers can deliver
goods more cheaply is that almost without exception they're getting
a price break of anywhere from 5 percent to 8 percent depending on
where the buyer is.
</P>
<P>
   And given how dubious these e-commerce business models look even
with the absence of sales tax--companies losing more money, not
less, every quarter--what will happen when the preposterous
three-year moratorium on Internet taxation ends?
</P>
<P>
   That's an especially interesting question because all the
evidence suggests that many online shoppers are there not because
of the convenience, but because of the cheap prices. One recent
much-cited study by Chicago economics professor Austan Goolsbee
suggested that Internet sales would drop by 30 percent if sales tax
were charged.
</P>
<P>
   If you add together sales tax with shipping costs, after all,
most books at the online web sites would be as expensive, or nearly
so, as they are in a real book store. And when you shop at a real
bookstore you don't have to wait three days to read the book when
you buy it. (People who talk about how quick it is to shop online
always seem to omit the part about waiting for the product to
arrive.)
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't have to pay any Internet tax because of the
three-year moratorium pushed through Congress in October. The
moratorium was supposedly intended to protect a nascent industry,
and perhaps to lay the groundwork for a national sales tax to
replace what's inevitably called the current ``hodgepodge'' of
state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But singling out the Internet for what's effectively a subsidy
is exactly the kind of government planning for which everyone now
excoriates Japan's MITI. Giving companies a competitive price
advantage for no reason other than that the Internet is new is an
excellent recipe for ensuring that they'll never really figure out
how to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all these companies are counting on that moratorium
being extended indefinitely. But if e-commerce becomes as big as
everyone says it will, there's no way states will be able to
survive without taxing it.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed impossibility of collecting individual state taxes
is, on the face of it, ridiculous. barnesandnoble.com, for
instance, collects state taxes from citizens of New York, New
Jersey, and Virginia (New York and New Jersey are where B&AMP;N's
corporate headquarters are, Virginia I still haven't figured out).
Would it really be that hard to collect from citizens of the other
states?
</P>
<P>
   What's especially screwed-up about the current system is that it
actually helps pick winners and losers among the e-commerce
players, besides giving a big boost to all the e-commerce people.
In retailing, 5 percent to 8 percent is a huge difference, which
means that Barnes and Noble is at a serious competitive
disadvantage compared to Amazon when it comes to someone like me.
And I'd be surprised if New York didn't account for a
disproportionate number of Internet bookbuyers.
</P>
<P>
   Tax loopholes are always bad ideas. They function as subsidies,
distorting the ability of price to convey information about demand
and making everything much less efficient than it should be. The
Internet Tax Freedom Act may be law, but it's bad law. E-commerce
is for real, but it needs to flourish without subsidies if it's to
be really for real.

MARINES TO INVADE SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GERALD D. ADAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Franciscans may get a front-row seat to a
D-Day-style invasion when up to 700 U.S. troops on a war exercise
storm the shores of the former military base, the Presidio, but the
Marines may have to win a battle with neighbors first.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Operation Urban Warrior, the proposed beach-style assault
in March, complete with gunfire, would launch three days of
communications exercises in what would be the first major military
activity at the Presidio since the 6th Army left four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exercise _ don't call it war games,'' Lt. Col. Gary
Schenkel, spokesman for the Marine Corps Fighting Laboratory at
Quantico, Va., said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Schenkel said the exercise had received tentative approvals from
Golden Gate National Recreation Area Superintendent Brian O'Neill,
Presidio General Manager B.J. Griffin, Presidio Trust Executive
Director James Meadows and Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But not from neighborhood groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to protest it,'' said Ron Miguel, president of the
Planning Association for the neighboring Richmond District. ``It
doesn't make sense when that area is in the process of vital
rehabilitation to start doing an exercise like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Schenkel said environmental assessment of the exercise would
begin Monday. He said he also intended to begin briefing
neighborhood groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to a rock concert or a Fourth of July fireworks
display, we'll be relatively unobtrusive,'' Schenkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Meadows' indication of ``sign-offs'' from himself, Mayor
Brown and Presidio and GGNRA officials, final approvals for
Operation Urban Warrior have yet to be secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to say it's a go,'' said Greg Shine, chief of
the Special Park Uses Group at the Presidio. ``The proposal is
winding its way through different specialists to look at and make
recommendations. We can probably expect a decision in January.''
</P>
<P>
   In the planning stages for the past year, the landing would
begin March 15 when the first Marine contingent of 125 would land
via Hovercraft at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent landings would bring 700 Marines from three offshore
Navy ships, the USS Bonhomme Richard, the USS Pearl Harbor and the
USS Coronado.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Marines would use firearms, Schenkel said that
standard M-16 rifles and M-240 machine guns would be shooting blank
ammunition. ``They would be making some racket but only
sporadically, and only between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of local concerns about harming environmentally
sensitive areas, Schenkel said no heavy military equipment would be
permitted to lumber across beach sand dunes, nor would the Marines
permit soldiers to enter forested areas.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of Operation Urban Warrior, Schenkel said, is to
experiment with newly developed electronic equipment in an urban
setting so that field commanders ``can know where our people are''
during battles in populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Developed at Caltech and in Silicon Valley, the equipment would
consist of navigational aids including a palm-size computer, an
Ericsson radio and a global positioning system, or GPS.
</P>
<P>
   Schenkel said similar operations recently had been conducted
with public approval in Chicago, New York City, Charleston, S.C.,
and Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're generating local business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, Schenkel pointed out, has a
multimillion-dollar contract with an unnamed Silicon Valley firm
that manufactured the electronics equipment for the exercise. He
also said the Marines would pay overtime and assessment fees to
park, police and environmental workers during the operation and
estimated the ship tours would attract more than 300,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Preceding the proposed Presidio operation, the same Marine
detachment will conduct a similar but more sophisticated exercise
at Monterey. There, on March 13-15, a chemical-biological
instant-response force will rehearse decontaminating areas
subjected to a poison-gas attack by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're testing technology and capabilities,'' said Marine Corps
information office Lt. Col. Jenny Holbert. ``If we fail, it's not
so bad. Better in peacetime than in war.''

CHAMPAGNE SHORTAGE EXPECTED FOR 2000 CELEBRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's a new Y2K problem: a shortage of premium
bubbly to ring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just are going to run out of prestige name-brand sparkling
wine,'' says Joy Sterling, partner in Sebastopol-based Iron Horse
Vineyards, which ages its sparking wines for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   The run is already on for next year's collective toast: Hotels
and casinos are stockpiling cases of top-notch brands while
retailers receive rationed supplies. Many consumers started buying
their New Year's Eve sparkling wines six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to Richard Cartiere, publisher of the Calistoga-based
Wine Market Report, if just a quarter of all the U.S. drinking-age
adults consume just one additional glass of sparkling wine during
the next year, the industry will be at capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Got Milk?' was the question of the 90s, `Got Champagne?'
may be the quintessential question of the year 2000 decade,'' says
Cartiere.
</P>
<P>
   Cartiere predicts U.S. demand for sparkling wine will increase
from the current 13 million cases a year to as much as 17 million
cases next year. He expects demand for premium ($9 a bottle and up)
wines to reach 3.4 million cases next year while supply will be
just 3.1 million cases.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne makers say their production is limited because they
only have so many grapes in their vineyards, especially the best
grapes for their high-end products.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding that, the sparkling wines take a minimum of 18
months to age _ and longer for the good stuff _ so the fine
sparkling wines for next year have already been produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just make more. Your vineyard is your vineyard.
There's a finite amount,'' Iron Horse's Sterling explains.
</P>
<P>
   Premium brands in particular will be in greater demand since
people are expected to ``trade up'' to a higher quality for the
millennium experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cartiere says the problem will be particularly acute when it
comes to California blends because the sparkling wine industry is
younger and less developed than in France.
</P>
<P>
   But Catiere says France, which is home to the Champagne-Ardennes
region for which Champagne is named, may be prove to be the savior
for consumers as 2000 approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I've seen the (French Champagne) caves and there's
plenty of Champagne waiting for the millennium to start,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, other industry experts argue that even with French
re-enforcements, sparkling wines will be in short supply as next
year draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   So is this just a bunch of hype to spur early demand and
buttress expected rising prices?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a perception or actual fact. But we are
already on allocation for both the French and California sparkling
wines _ everything from Gloria Ferrer to Veuve Cliquot,'' says Tony
Giovanzana, owner of Coit Liquor in North Beach. Allocation means
retailers are limited to a certain number of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Werley, master sommelier at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas,
admits the hotel-casino has already started to stockpile Champagne
with next New Year's in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever it's available, I bring in all I can bring in. I do
have a fair amount, especially the big names,'' she says, adding
she was loading up particularly on the French Champagnes. ``We took
a strong position on Dom Perignon this year, Cristal and Salon.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Boone, chairman of Concord-based Beverages &AMP; More, says
some of his customers began purchasing sparkling wines for the
millennium celebration six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're loading up on the real hard to get, high quality
products,'' he says, giving Roederer Cristal, which can sell for as
much as $200 a bottle, as an example. ``We do not anticipate
running out of Champagne, period. Just the highly sought-after
products won't be on the shelves this time next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers confirm prices will rise, but it's too early to say by
how much. Boone expects to see markups for the top brands to reach
as high as 35 percent. The Wine Market Report's Cartiere puts the
price hike at 50 percent for the most sought-after sparkling wines.
</P>
<P>
   Many local sparkling wine producers have also produced special
vintages for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Iron Horse's Sterling says the winery will sell individually
numbered commemorative jeroboams (the equivalent of four bottles)
starting at $400.
</P>
<P>
   Mumm Cuvee Napa in Rutherford has a 21st Century Cuvee made
predominantly with the 1997 harvest and reserves from special wine
blends.
</P>
<P>
   The winery's brand manager, Trevor Lawrence, agreed that elite
products may be hard to find, but is convinced there will be enough
Champagne to go around. ``We don't foresee running out,' she said
of the non-vintage brands. ``Coming on line next year will be wine
from the 1997 harvest which was bountiful. We were very lucky
nature provided so much raw material.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear. New Year's revelers will not be able to stop
at their local liquor store and pick up a 1990 bottle of Dom
Perignon _ considered one of the top vintages _ anytime close to
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Fredrikson, a partner with the San Francisco-based wine
consultant firm of Gomberg Fredrikson &AMP; Associates, does expect a
sparkling wine shortage, but adds this caveat: ``Who knows what
people will do on the millennium. They may hike to the top of the
Himalayas and drink tomato juice.''

PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING DOMINATES CABLE TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wrestling was huge in the late 1980s, until bad
story lines, reports of steroid abuse and defections of wrestlers
from the once-dominant World Wrestling Federation to now-rival
World Championship Wrestling (a television creation from the mind
of Ted Turner) severely crippled the business.
</P>
<P>
   But both rival ``leagues'' survived, and this year have become
dominant television monsters.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint was simple, but effective:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hone the serialization of stories both in the ring and out,
which makes viewers tune in like a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a tacit admission to what everyone knew all along: The
competitions are rigged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a beachhead on Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add profanity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add sexual innuendo, sexual suggestion and, depending on your
definition, sex. Take last Monday's ``Raw is War.'' In one
tag-team, two-man match, a wrestler was forced to go it alone
against two bad guys. Why? His partner, Sexual Chocolate (yes, that
is wrestler Mark Henry's common nickname), was back in the dressing
room, handcuffed to a table with a ball gag in his mouth. He was
smothered in whipped cream as two lingerie-clad women whipped him.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody care for a little holiday entertainment for the kids?
Remember, the profanity bleeped out for television will be heard in
the arena. Once cartoonish, wrestling has purposefully taken on a
more serious, sinister veneer.
</P>
<P>
   But at its heart the _ what? Sport? Exhibition? Contest? You
decide _ remains true to its ultimate formula that has remain
unchanged since its earliest days: Present simple and succinct
morality tales. Good vs. evil. Bad guys vs. good guys. And make
them switch sides once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   What makes wrestling different today is how fans have taken to
once supposed bad guys like The Undertaker and Austin (conversely,
ultimate good guy Hulk Hogan of WWF became bad guy Hollywood Hogan
of the WCW _ yet is still liked by fans). Bad is good, badder is
better.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it is a show, but not all fantasy: When you see
someone fly off the top turnbuckle, he really is jumping 12 feet in
the air, and really does have to land on someone or thing.
</P>
<P>
   You can't fake that.

ULSTER AVOIDS, FOR NOW, A SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Nearly ten years after a Protestant
extremist broke into their home and shot her husband, Pat, in front
of her and their three children, Geraldine Finucane suspects that
the British government bears some responsibility for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years after his parents and nine other Protestant
civilians were killed by the IRA in Enniskillen, Julian Armstrong
does not know why they died, despite the IRA assertion that the
bomb was meant for British soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years after her brother, Jackie, and 13 other
Catholic civil rights marchers were shot dead by British troops in
Londonderry, Kay Duddy does not know if the soldiers panicked or
were under orders to open fire.
</P>
<P>
   From the mean streets of Belfast to bucolic hamlets in the
countryside, there are thousands of people in Northern Ireland
nursing grief and grievances who remain unsure why or how their
loved ones were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to know what happened to Jackie, what really
happened,'' Duddy explains, speaking for many.
</P>
<P>
   If the Good Friday Agreement reached last April and endorsed by
voters in May was testimony to the promise of politics in this
famously divided society, its inability to answer those questions
exposes its limitations and the vast gulf between peace and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   For despite an absence of war, there is a paucity of forgiveness
and reconciliation here. Some say that reconciliation cannot occur
until there is some account of how and why about 3,500 lives were
taken over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no obvious public demand for a truth commission
modeled after the one in South Africa that recently complied an
official record of the terrible deeds done there by the apartheid
regime and the rebels who fought against it.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for this apparent apathy is the concern that the
fragile peace process would founder under a torrent of
recrimination were a truth commission to plumb the past.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process in general and the Good Friday Agreement in
particular were built on the premise those obsessed with the past
could at last look to the future. But many here fear that to
explore the last 30 years would trigger a morbid, self-righteous
body count that would make the political compromises still needed
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There are many wounded people in Northern Ireland - not from the
shrapnel and bullets that sent some 40,000 of them to the hospital
over the last 30 years - but by the failure of anyone to take
personal responsibility for the injuries inflicted on them or their
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the open warfare that left tens of thousands dead in
places like Bosnia and El Salvador, the civil war in Northern
Ireland was a relatively low intensity affair, even though some of
its human rights abuses matched anything in places where far more
people died.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dirty war where the outnumbered Irish Republican Army
resorted to assassinations and bombings to force the British to
quit Northern Ireland. The British replied in kind by condoning
police abuses and dispatching covert squads to kill IRA operatives.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelmingly Protestant police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, ensured that the IRA would have a steady stream of
recruits by routinely harassing, and sometimes torturing, young
Catholic men. Adding to this lethal mix were loyalist paramilitary
groups - Protestant extremists who routinely murdered and tortured
innocent Catholics to snuff out support for the IRA in the
community from which it sprang.
</P>
<P>
   All sides accuse the others of having engaged in terrorism while
denying that the term applies to them.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rolston, a sociologist at the University of Ulster, studied
the experiences of 17 truth commissions from Argentina to Zimbabwe
over the past two decades. ``Every example of repression or
totalitarianism is unique to some extent. So every attempt to reach
the truth about the past will be different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there needs to be some process of truth telling and
truth acknowledgement,'' he continued. ``In countries where they
chose not to do it, it has come back to haunt them. In Brazil, the
police came out of the military junta with the attitude they could
get away with murder. Now they're killing street kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, after delivering a British government report on
victims of violence, Kenneth Bloomfield concluded that the time was
not right for a truth commission, even though many victims said
they wanted one.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield, a former head of the civil service in Northern
Ireland who survived an IRA assassination attempt, cautioned,
``Truth can be used as a weapon as well as a shield. While some in
our society are talking of amnesty... others are arguing that their
sufferings can best be recognized by punishment visited upon the
perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, whose party represents the IRA,
also doubts that now is the appropriate time to create a truth
commission. ``Sinn Fein is not opposed to it in principle,'' Adams
said. ``But having a truth commission before you have a final
settlement could create more problems than it would resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Some attribute Adams' reticence to the fact that the IRA has
killed more than half of those who died in the Troubles, or to
fears that his exploits as an IRA commander in the 1970s would be
exposed. But Adams insists that the British government has the most
to fear from a truth commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you think of the IRA, they claim responsibility for
their actions,'' said Adams. ``The same cannot be said of the
British government.''
</P>
<P>
   The British government officially holds that it is too early to
establish a truth commission because the nascent political process
in Northern Ireland remains too fragile at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Irish government, London's partner in the peace
process, agrees. Privately, a senior Irish government official
says, ``We don't really oppose one, even though now is not the
right time. But the British would never go along with one. They
have too much to answer for, and their system of government is not
given to prying loose state secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, under Prime Minister Tony Blair, the British government
has taken steps to find the truth about some of the estimated 400
killings by British forces. Last spring, for example, Blair ordered
a new investigation into Bloody Sunday, the day in 1972 when
British troops killed 14 civil rights marchers. In doing so, Blair
tacitly acknowledged that an investigation done shortly after the
shootings that cleared the soldiers was at best flawed and at worst
a coverup.
</P>
<P>
   It could prove more difficult to pursue allegations of collusion
between government agents and Protestant loyalist assassins, such
as those who killed Finucane, a lawyer who defended IRA suspects.
Attempts to obtain such information in civil law suits have failed
under the catch-all ``national security'' exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomfield, who talked with victims of government
violence, ``Their firm view was that the revelation of the full
truth of such killings was far more important than any other
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   While truth commissions in South Africa, El Salvador and Chile
explored the transgressions of insurgent groups, Rolston found the
focus of most such bodies was on human rights violations by
government forces.
</P>
<P>
   That approach poses problems in Northern Ireland because
government agents are drawn almost exclusively from the Protestant
community. The police force, for example, is more than 90 percent
Protestant. If a truth commission focused on government forces,
Protestants would consider it a vehicle to persecute them and
excuse IRA crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were a public consensus on the need for a truth
commission, more chasms would open in determining its scope, powers
and leaders. Rolston is not alone when he questions if there is
anyone in Britain or Ireland of the towering moral authority of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who led the South African commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be led by someone Irish or British?'' Rolston asks.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that the commission currently charged with
reforming the police force is subtlely serving as a truth
commission. Christopher Patten, the last British governor of Hong
Kong who chairs that commission, acknowledged, ``It's inevitable
some people will see our work in that light.'' But he cautioned
against expecting too much, because his commission has neither the
powers nor mandate to do such work.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office here, Patten also warned that a truth
commission ``doesn't necessarily lead very easily to the spirit of
healing and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston said that in countries where governments were reluctant
to set up truth commissions, church groups took the initiative. He
thinks it is possible for the Catholic and Protestant churches here
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need something,'' he said. ``We just don't know what it is
yet.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  (The following information cannot be read by the people for
whom it is intended _ the babies to born in 1999 in the United
States _ so an adult with a pair of scissors is essential for the
following transmission.)
</P>
<P>
   All right, you little people: listen up! We only go through this
once. I repeat: This is not a drill. This is the real thing. It's
called life. One of you lands here about every 10 seconds. Don't
blow it. The Old Sarge here is detailed to explain to you all you
need to know to get through life. It is not all that complicated
for most humans.
</P>
<P>
   First off, congratulations on being born in the old US of A.
This just happens to be the richest and most powerful country in
all of recorded history. There will be more than six billion people
like yourselves riding this old planet this year. A lot of them
wish they were American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Good grub, plenty of space outside the cities, and cable
TV, just to mention three reasons. Clean air, clean water, most
places, and freedom to do as much or as little as you want to do,
those are three more reasons.
</P>
<P>
   We start out 1999 just a tad shy of 272 million people in our
fair country. But I warn you all to watch your step. Don't do
anything stupid, like drive drunk, screw around with drugs, or
engage in unprotected _ well, I'll leave that part for later.
</P>
<P>
   Someone dies every 12 seconds in this country, most of them old
people who had a full shot at life. The most important thing to
remember is that you don't have to make things harder than they
already are. That sounds so obvious, right? But you'd be amazed at
the number of people who make life harder for themselves. All in
all, smart is better than dumb.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lord _ I'll explain the Lord thing in a later briefing,
when you're a little older _ the Lord seems to look out for a lot
of folks who are not blessed in the brainpower department. In fact,
some of the smartest folks are the unhappiest, too. A great deal of
the success in finding contentment in life is recognizing your
limitations and adapting to circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest and smartest and richest are terribly
unhappy. And some of the frailest, sickest or least-favored are
remarkably successful human beings with lives that are full and
rich and meaningful. There's a real trick to understanding how this
all works. One of the secrets to happiness is being able to free
yourself from hate. The more riled you get at others who are
different, the worse you tend to feel. Some people spend most of
their time hating others. You'll learn to identify them soon
enough, I'm afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, they have narrowed eyes, cruel lips, aggressive
manners, high blood pressure, fragile stomachs, and a history of
being knocked around, and knocking other people around. Generally
speaking, these bullying personalities tend to blame someone else _
anyone else _ for their problems, They carry a lot of
self-loathing. Try not to get into that state. Some people never
get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, you are responsible for your own good time. If you
find yourself becoming unhappy more than a modest amount, make some
changes in your life. It's the same as when you learn to handle
your money: No one watches out for your money the way you do; and
no one is as responsible for your own happiness as you are. The
most important arguments you will have on this Earth are the ones
you have in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well start early on learning how to get along with
people who are different _ in skin color, attitude, language,
customs, religion. You really have no other choice but to get
along. Americans are only about 1-20th of mankind. There are more
people of color than there are who are white. By the time you folks
are 50 years old, there will be as many nonwhites and
Hispanic-Americans as white Americans. Whatever your skin color,
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are not real smart, you can make yourself really
educated. Learn the difference between inspiration and
perspiration. Teach yourself how to work. Reading, figuring, and
computing will be necessary if you want a good life. The earlier
you learn, the better. The more time you spend with books, the
richer your life will be.
</P>
<P>
   By the time you are 30, for every two of you working, one
American will be retired and drawing on Social Security. That's
money that will come out of your paycheck, basically. That'll set
up a lot of conflict between your generation, and mine. Deal with
it. It was this generation that fed, housed, safeguarded and
educated yours, after all.
</P>
<P>
   That's one basic issue _ fairness _ that my generation hasn't
solved yet. Maybe you people can do a better job. There's more
trouble ahead with immigration _ population flow from poor to rich
countries. Basically, everytime something big and bad happens _
war, famine, drought, earthquake, typhoon, epidemic _ people move
to higher, safer, more fertile ground.
</P>
<P>
   With six billion people _ and more arriving every day _ we're
running out of clean water, arable land, and safe space. You people
are going to have to figure out how to deal with people who come
here, legally or illegally. I can't give you much help; we've made
a hash of it so far. That's enough for now. Now, get some sleep,
people; you've got a whole century ahead of you.

THE NATION'S NO. 1 UNDERDOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ They weren't supposed to be here, of course. Not
many people outside of the Volunteer Army that packs Neyland
Stadium with more than 107,000 people for each home game even
thought they could win their own division, much less the
always-tough Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   And as for winning a national championship? Why, that hadn't
been done by the Tennessee Volunteers since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure a 12-0 record, a No. 1 ranking, and a legitimate
chance of beating No. 2 Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl Monday
night _ a victory that would indeed make coach Phil Fulmer's team
national champions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Volunteers are not getting the respect that, say,
Florida, their main nemesis in the SEC East, or once-beaten FSU are
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain that Tennessee is a 5 1/2-point underdog?
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain that if Tennessee does go a magical 13-0, it
will still come as a surprise to some folks?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been something magical about this team,'' said
linebacker Raynoch Thompson, part of a Volunteer defense that has
made the difference this season. ``We believe in each other and
have earned everything we've gotten. Some people say we've been
lucky. I say we've been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has been both, which is a difference from previous
years when the Volunteers had quarterback Peyton Manning executing
those X's and O's with Heismanlike precision but still couldn't
find a way to beat Florida in the annual showdown.
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone project that with Manning gone and virtually
untested quarterback Tee Martin taking over the offense, the
Volunteers would find a way to beat not only the Gators (20-17 in
overtime), but everyone else _ though the record includes what most
consider a gift 28-24 come-from-behind win over Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Lose either of those games, and the Vols are back in the
familiar neighborhood they have inhabited for the past decade, as
one of college football's better programs but not one capable of
getting out of its own league, much less winning a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The climb has been steady, at times spectacular. This was the
Vols' second consecutive SEC title and third this decade. It showed
Volunteer fans that life goes on after Manning, who is and was
revered but never got his team to a true national championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with a defense that is as good as any in the country
_ with the arguable exception of Florida State _ and with Martin
making big plays from the opening game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin says the success has been earned, despite the skeptics
pointing to the gift fumble by Arkansas, which turned a sure loss
into a stunning victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' said Martin, who completed 57 percent of
his passes for 2,164 yards this season while throwing 19 TD passes
and only six interceptions. ``This is all we've been working hard
for since the offseason. We knew we had some big shoes to fill and
prove a lot of people wrong _ even our coaches, who had some
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches, particularly Fulmer, no longer have any doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day of practice, this team had something to
prove,'' said Fulmer. ``They labeled themselves a blue-collar team.
They rolled up their sleeves and got to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer no longer feels the need to ``sell'' the Tennessee
program to recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beyond that now,'' said Fulmer, meaning that recruits
know the goal at the start of a season _ as it is at Florida State
and Nebraska _ is not merely to win a conference championship, but
a national championship. And it has become a realistic goal.

<P>
   WEYMOUTH, Mass. _ He lived with field rats in the tall reeds
that line the Southern Artery. He drank so hard with royalty _
Prince Philip vodka _ that he poisoned his pancreas. He lost the
sensation in his fingers and feet to frostbite, and his sense of
smell to another homeless drunk who kicked his face in.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chaput, 46, who earned a birdlike nickname as a teenager
soaring into the forbidden waters of the Quincy quarries, had hit
rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But then one summer's day, an outreach worker from Father Bill's
Place reached Chaput moments before his next bottle did.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the man's simple plea _ ``Come back in!'' _ pierced the
alcoholic haze that had already killed half the members of Chaput's
Quincy clan of homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as street people in Boston mourned the latest of six
deaths among their own during the past month, the Clinton
administration announced $850 million in aid to homeless Americans
_ $33.5 million for Massachusetts _ and cited Chaput's success
story as one of the sweetest of the season. He is an exemplar,
officials said, of how the confluence of external resources and
internal resolve helped guide one man down the road of recovery
from a place from which few return.
</P>
<P>
   Lying at death's threshold himself, advocates for the homeless
say, Chaput followed the outreach worker's words on a journey of
redemption that took him through days of hand-trembling sobriety,
months of tough-love halfway-house discipline, and regular
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The path ultimately led him to a
board of directors' seat at the homeless shelter that once barred
him, a reunion with his teenage son, prospects for reviving a
furniture refinishing business, and his own blessed two-bedroom
apartment not far from his boyhood home.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of Chaput's success is more complex and less
certain for the man who now has his own singular phone listing for
the unique spelling of his childhood moniker, Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   As Chaput works toward his next goal _ finding a job _ he must
fight, day by day, to maintain his foothold in what he calls ``the
sober world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to look at some of the people who walk in here and
say, `Gee, is there any hope?' '' said David Phillips, executive
director of the Quincy Interfaith Sheltering Coalition, which runs
Father Bill's, a homeless shelter in Quincy. ``Then you look at
someone like Byrd and say, `There is hope.' ''
</P>
<P>
   From his federally subsidized duplex decorated with a crucifix
above his mahogany bed, the wizened Byrd Man of Weymouth now
awakens each morning holding a black book of AA bromides instead of
a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a better way,'' Chaput tells himself, and the
remaining survivors of the street. ``I remember every day now.''
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, Chaput's life was a photo album of futility,
strung together by drinking and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He had his first drink at 14. By 17, he was pouring rum into his
sodas while hanging at Burger King. That same year, he was
introduced to heroin by a friend who injected him under the Hingham
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Chaput drifted from job to job, state to
state. He settled in California in 1979, met a woman, and fathered
a son born in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Chaput had a good job as a machinist in the aerospace industry.
He'd duck into the bathroom to shoot heroin and then return to
making parts for the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Chaput came back to Massachusetts after a nasty split
with his son's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he got caught transporting 15 bundles of heroin
from Rhode Island to Massachusetts. It was not his first arrest.
Facing a lengthy prison term if he was arrested again, Chaput used
methadone to drop his $1,000-a-day habit, feeling his skin crawl as
the heroin left his body.
</P>
<P>
   But each day, Chaput descended to his family's cellar, downing a
quart of rum a day in the glow of science-and-nature shows droning
on television.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Patrick's Day 1992, Chaput awakened in the Intensive Care
Unit of South Shore Hospital to startling news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You died at 3:30 in the morning,'' he heard the nurse say.
</P>
<P>
   Even that near-death experience didn't scare Chaput into
sobriety. His family tried to get him help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need it,'' Chaput told them.
</P>
<P>
   By December of that year, Chaput had drunk himself out of a home
and into the detox center at Bridgewater State Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After five months of forced sobriety, surviving long bouts of
vomiting and the shakes, Chaput was released and took a cab to
Bridgewater center. Within 20 minutes, he was guzzling a bottle of
vodka.
</P>
<P>
   With no place to go, Chaput in the spring of '93 joined an
encampment of about 15 street people living in a clearing inside
the 12-foot-high reeds off Route 3A. They slept on the ground,
showered under a cemetery spigot, ate macaroni and cheese in soup
kitchens. They sat on milk crates and talked about important issues
of the day, such as how they'd rustle their next drink.
</P>
<P>
   Chaput sold his food stamps, while others cadged quarters and
redeemed empty bottles and cans. Together, they would scrape up
$9.59 for an almighty jug of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was carefree,'' said Chaput. ``We'd go out and get a drunk
on, and next day we'd do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, Chaput saw one of the group lying completely still
on a pile of cut grass. Chaput put his hand to the man's face. In
the 80-degree heat, it was stone cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was dead,'' Chaput said. ``I didn't want to eat that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rousted from the weeds that fall, the group spent the winter of
'94 in cheap motel rooms after one of the homeless men turned up
with a $10,000 windfall from a family settlement. With the heat and
color TV blasting, the group dispatched a cab driver to bring back
six jugs of booze at once. They drank until they passed out.
</P>
<P>
   But they were forced to move from motel to motel after a major
problem: Chaput's drinking buddies began to die, one after another.
The motel run finally ended when the homeless man with the money
also died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (him) that he'd never see the end of that money,''
Chaput said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaput spent the next two years bouncing between a 4-by-7-foot
utility room of a city parking garage, abandoned buildings, a
homeless shelter, and hospital beds, where his shattered face and
diseased pancreas were treated.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, 1996, the FatherBill's outreach worker found Chaput
and the remaining crew in a clearing of trees behind a nearby Star
Market. Breakfast was on order: the day's first bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byrd, come back in,'' was the familiar refrain.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Chaput had humored the shelter's new federally funded
outreach nurse and social worker, saying, ``I'll be there
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   But that morning, he said, some serendipitous force made him
move his legs toward the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me at the right time,'' said Chaput, chain-smoking
Camels. ``My life was in shambles.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaput spent 13 days at Father Bill's. For almost a week, he was
too shaky to hold a glass of water, too sick to hold down food.
</P>
<P>
   Then he spent two months in a halfway house. He attended group
and solo counseling sessions. He scrubbed toilets _ and his
self-defeating attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get honest with yourself,'' he said. ``I had to
face my problems and admit that I was an alcoholic and wanted to
change my life _ one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaput said he knew he was sincere about his recovery when a
staff member tried to goad him into cutting his long hair and
Chaput didn't lose his cool _ or his own stretch of sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not big enough or bad enough to make me want to pick up
a drink,'' Chaput told him.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, 1997, the shelter helped relocate Chaput into his
own apartment. The move gave him comfort, he said, although he was
nervous about how he was going to spend his free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said Chaput, now trying to make ends meet on a
$614-a-month disability check. ``For the first time in my adult
life I was in the sober world.''
</P>
<P>
   His calendar is now crowded. Just this month, Chaput joined
business people and clergy at his first shelter board meeting. He
just moved into a two-bedroom place, where he is building a
computer room for his son, Donovan, 15, now living with him full
time after almost five years apart. And the president's people
wanted a piece of his story.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, Chaput said, he will raise a glass of
hazelnut-flavored tea and make a humble toast to his future: ``I
hope that tomorrow is like today.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he still rebuilds his own life, Chaput said, he
feels obliged to make time for street friends: fielding their
desperate late-night phone calls, driving them to detoxes, keeping
them out of the reeds.

AN OFFER WITH A SALARY CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I read your article on job classifications and it raised a
question for me. I have been working as an independent contractor
with a local nonunion company for over a year, but it seems as if I
meet the criteria of a full-time employee. Partly in response to
the legal issues involved, my company has recently offered me a
full-time position. It is nice of them to make the offer, but they
are making it a mandatory offer. In other words, if I don't take
the position, I cease working for them altogether. The biggest
problem with that is the job comes with a substantial pay cut.
Currently, as a contractor, I am making $40 per hour, or about
$80,000 per year. The company is withholding taxes, but I receive
no benefits. The position I am being offered pays $50,000 per year,
doing exactly the same work I've been doing for $80,000 and with
only one year's experience doing it. I understand there are some
costs associated with offering benefits, but I don't believe it
adds up to the $30,000 per year I would be losing if I took the
job. Since the job offer is mandatory, so is the pay cut. It seems
that in the effort to protect itself legally, the company is using
the opportunity to save money by enforcing the pay cut. My question
is, `Is this legal?'
</P>
<P>
   B.S., Boston &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's legal, all right.
</P>
<P>
   So says Boston lawyer Herb Turney, a partner at employment law
firm Jackson Lewis. He said companies spend, on average, an
additional 30 to 35 percent on benefits. That means if you earn
$10, your boss chips in an extra $3 for paid vacation, sick time,
workers' compensation, or disability insurance. Turney said your
$80,000 salary as an independent contractor probably was reduced to
reflect those added costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing illegal about a company saying, `We believe
we should treat you as a full-time employee, and we also believe
your full-time compensation should be $50,000,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an independent contractor, this employee is getting no
benefits,'' he added. ``He may have to buy insurance as an
individual. He needs vacation pay. He needs workers' compensation
insurance. He needs sick time, but all these things are costly.
Once he becomes a regular employee, the employer pays those
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for some information and thought you might be
able to help. I am a member of a day-care cooperative in Cambridge,
Mass. I have two kids in the school. This year, parents formed a
committee to evaluate how to provide better compensation packages
to our highly skilled day-care staff. It soon became &QC; 
clear, however, that if we simply raised &QC; 
salaries, the corresponding tuition increases would place us out of
the market in terms of admissions costs. We are searching for
innovative ways to create value &QC; 
in the salary and benefits that the day- &QC; 
care co-operative provides to its staff. Do you have any references
that might help us in our effort?
</P>
<P>
   L.C., Cambridge &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I called Hewitt Associates in Chicago, Ill., for information.
Hewitt is known for its research on workplace benefits. It
recommends you contact Michael Esser, a Hewitt associate in
Scottsdale, Ariz., at 603-994-1373 for sample research and surveys
on benefit packages and costs for day-care providers. For more
specific information on worklife benefits at day-care centers and
cooperatives, contact Carol Sladek at Hewitt's Lincolnshire, Ill.,
office, at 847-295-5000. Locally, the Massachusetts Association for
Day Care Agencies may be able to help. Ask for Bill Eddy at
617-442-0711.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I currently work for a company that has grown in the last two
years from about 10 full-time employees to 30. The company does not
contribute to an employee health plan. What are the guidelines
dictating when and to what extent a company must contribute to
employee health benefits? If regulations are based on the number of
full-time employees, do commissioned employees _ such as
salespeople _ count as full-time?
</P>
<P>
   C.C., Lynn, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no requirement that an employer contribute to a
health plan, or provide health care coverage, says Richard Alfred,
a partner at Hill &AMP; Barlow, a Boston employment law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, benefits such as health care, sick time, and paid
vacation were won by unions. These benefits, along with the 40-hour
work week, are now part of the employment landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``So many employers provide health care coverage and
contribute to that coverage in various percentages that it would be
difficult for an employer in today's competitive marketplace to
attract employees if they did not offer benefits,'' said Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where should a 54-year-old African-American male go to seek
and develop a mentoring relationship? Is 54 too late an age to
still attempt to salvage a once productive career and contribute
``value'' to a future employer? Is there someone who would be
willing to talk to me or at least put me in touch with someone who
can assist me? I have the motivation to follow up; I just need to
get pointed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   H.S., Lexington, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of organizations in Boston that offer
services to people who are 50 and older. One is Operation Able, at
617-542-4180. It provides training and career-oriented counseling,
and it has a small group program whose goal is to help older
workers market themselves. Ask for executive director Ruth Ann
Moriarty. She also works one-on-one with participants and provides
guidance. A second option: Jewish Vocational Services in downtown
Boston. Ask for Roni Nolan or George Zeller at 617-451-8147 (office
closed until Jan. 4). Zeller offers mentoring; Nolan counsels those
who need guidance in switching careers.

<P>
   I've been on what my mother would call a movie jag.
Simultaneously, I've been on a running jag, a temperance jag _ not
the same temperance jag from two summers ago, this is a different
one _ and a reading-to-avoid-the-real-work-of-writing jag. Maybe my
life is just an accumulation of jags. The groundwork for New
Psychology of Jags . . . or mindless column fodder? You be the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   My movie jag started several years ago, when Kevin Costner's
pre-``Postman'' debacle ``Waterworld'' _ the pre-debacle debacle,
as it were _ came out. I decided to write a column on famous movie
flops and rented ``Ishtar'' and ``Heaven's Gate.'' ``Ishtar'' was
indeed awful, but ``Gate'' was excellent. (``A picture that has
some extraordinary things in it'' _ Martin Scorsese.) Yes, a tad
long, as they now say of both Tom Wolves, but magnificent. And I
even liked ``Waterworld,'' so that column never left the ground.
But the jag was on.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been feeding the jag at the video store and also at
my new favorite Web site, reel.com, an amazingly well-supplied
video store that I wish were located in Watertown instead of
Berkeley, Calif. However, the site has allowed me to scratch some
of my nagging film itches, including:
</P>
<P>
   --Surf movies ``Big Wednesday'' and ``Endless Summer.'' I lost
my ``Endless Summer'' notes, but suffice it to say that the Day-Glo
orange and pink poster that hung in my room during grade school had
a lot more juice than this Super-8-look movie travelogue. (I now
have Mark Foo's picture on my wall, for those of you who know who
Mark Foo is.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday,'' which has developed a cult following based on
director John Milius's gift for self-promotion, is also awful, but
in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slow-paced movie about nothing,'' my notes say, but that's
not really fair. It does function as a trivia graveyard for B
stars: Patti D'Arbanville before she became Mrs. Don Johnson and
the pre-``Dallas'' Steve Kanaly. And there's memorable C-minus
writing: ``Nobody surfs forever''; ``I might move inland, get a
job, pay taxes''; or the moving elegy spoke over a surfer's grave:
``He had a good cutback, he rode the nose real well.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Kurt Russell ``Snake'' movies, ``Escape from New York''
and ``Escape from L.A.'' I don't know where I was when these
masterpieces came out, but they're great! Aside from the titles,
it's hard to tell these two masterpieces apart. ``N.Y.'' was made
in 1981 and set in a hypothetical future of . . . 1991. ``L.A.''
was made in 1996 set in 2013, but Kurt Russell hasn't aged a bit!
Do he and Goldie use the same plastic surgeon?
</P>
<P>
   In both movies, Russell plays Snake Plissken (Plissken? Sounds
like a radiologist), superbad fellow not be messed with. At stake?
``The survivial of the human race,'' Lee Van Cleef assures us in
``N.Y.'' Better than ``Waterworld!''
</P>
<P>
   --Dirty movies I missed at the cinema, e.g. ``White Mischief,''
not dirty enough by half and a pale shadow of the excellent book.
Also the great, manic, pre-career-dive Michael Keaton in ``Night
Shift.'' And overrated art movies, like Krzysztof Kieslowski's
tiresome ``Red,'' ``White'' and ``Blue,'' which I watch merely to
torture myself. One of my sons walked in during ``Blue,'' and
asked: ``Doesn't anyone talk in this movie?'' Hushyermouthkid, it's
art!
</P>
<P>
   Do I ever see first-run movies? Sure. Just recently I took in
``A Simple Plan'' (grim) and ``Celebrity'' (grotty). Yes, I saw
Gwyneth Paltrow and Co. in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which more than
merits its effusive welcome. (Hey _ skinny Gwynnie! I think that's
Oscar on the line . . .)
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I've missed ``The Faculty,'' which takes a page from the
fourth-grade classic ``My Teacher is an Alien.'' I'll get to it.
``Faculty'' was co-authored by teenquake screenwriting hack Kevin
Williamson, who helped create the ``Peyton Place'' of the
14-and-under crowd, the WB's ``Dawson's Creek.'' Williamson
likewise wrote ``Scream,'' ``Scream II,'' and ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' movies that no sane adult has ever sat through.
</P>
<P>
   A Kevin Williamson retrospective at the Harvard Film Archive to
coincide with next year's release of ``Scream 3''? I'll be first in
line.

<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ After browsing through KaBloom, a new flower
store here cofounded by Thomas Stemberg of Staples fame, one
customer compared it to a ``walk through a garden.''
</P>
<P>
   It also may be a walk through a new kind of retail concept, one
that could shake up the world of day-old gladiolas and overpriced
roses.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly fragmented $14 billion industry of mom-and-pop
florists, KaBloom hopes to grow quickly beyond the two stores it
has just opened in Newton and Wellesley by offering US consumers a
European approach to buying flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Within three or four years, KaBloom wants to be a 150-store
operation, as it races to become one of the industry's first truly
national chains. Plans call for as many as 30 stores to open within
Interstate 495.
</P>
<P>
   The key to such rapid growth, KaBloom believes, is to take the
same inventory controls and distribution methods that Staples
brought to office supplies and apply them to flowers.
</P>
<P>
   If that philosophy means more variety and better prices, KaBloom
customer Debbie Reinemann seems to be all for it.
</P>
<P>
   From a flower lover's point of view, it was ``painful'' to move
from the Netherlands back to the United States, the Dover resident
says on her second visit to KaBloom. In Europe, fresh flowers are
cheap and plentiful. Not so in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenal selection,'' Reinemann says of KaBloom.
``And the flowers are affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   That's music to the ears of KaBloom president David Hartstein,
the chain's other cofounder and a former Staples executive. When
Hartstein sees a rose, he also sees an ``SKU'' _ retailers' jargon
for a standard stock-keeping unit.
</P>
<P>
   KaBloom has 72 rose SKUs, he says proudly, including long-stem
and short-stem, not to mention a variety of exotic hues.
</P>
<P>
   Roses and more are on view in the 1,500-square-foot store's
chief innovation: A walk-in self-service cooler where customers
pick out flowers that are identified by name and price.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, flowers are only an occasional purchase,
something they buy for someone else. There are carnations for
weddings, gladiolas for funerals, and roses for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing a florist asks you is, `How much do you want
to spend?' '' says Hartstein, adding: ``We let customers make their
own choices about what they want and how much they want to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   By operating in convenient locations, KaBloom looks to make
flowers part of everyday life and to become a store that consumers
visit several times a month.
</P>
<P>
   Will such a European approach work in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told, `Don't you know? Americans don't decorate their
homes with flowers the way Europeans do,' '' Stemberg says. ``But
the reason Americans don't is that high-quality flowers are either
inconvenient to get or they're unaffordable.''
</P>
<P>
   (A KaBloom investor, Stemberg plays no active role in the flower
chain's day-to-day operations.)
</P>
<P>
   As a concept, KaBloom traces its roots to early 1997 when
Hartstein was looking for an idea for a new retail chain.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the former Israeli diplomat toyed with opening a
Boston Chicken-style restaurant with a health foods menu.
</P>
<P>
   But at a dinner with Stemberg, the Staples chief executive
became excited about a flower chain he had seen in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As the two looked to see if they could adapt the German chain's
format for the United States, research turned up something
Hartstein thinks is quite remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   In consumption terms, Americans rank near the top of most retail
categories, but they're 12th in flower purchases.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't surprise Peter Moran, a vice president of the
Society of American Florists. Per-capita consumption of flowers in
Western Europe is four times greater than here, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hartstein is betting that price and convenience have a lot to do
with that discrepancy. After a rose is plucked in Ecuador, it goes
through several layers of middlemen before an American consumer can
buy it at a local florist about a week later. Each middleman adds
to the price, so a rose can end up costing 6 1/2 times more in the
United States than it does in Ecuador, he says.
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating some of the middlemen, KaBloom believes it can
sell a fresher rose at a better price and still make a profit. At
KaBloom, a dozen long-stem roses cost just under $20; at many other
florists, they can cost $40 or more, Hartstein says.
</P>
<P>
   And by applying the economies of scale of a larger chain,
KaBloom hopes to offer even better prices as it expands.
</P>
<P>
   By Moran's count, there are about 25,000 florists in the United
States, many of them mom-and-pop stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes very little capital to get a flower store going,'' he
says. ``But it takes a fair amount of business expertise _ and a
whole lot of hours _ to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long period of stability, the industry is seeing big
changes. Dole Food Co., the fruit grower, has just branched out
into flowers; wholesalers have begun to consolidate; and the
Internet has become a hotbed for flower retail. KaBloom, among
others, has big plans for its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a team of former Blockbuster video managers is also
looking to launch a national chain of florists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen more industry changes in the last 18 months than I
did in my previous 14 years here,'' Moran says.
</P>
<P>
   Why has a national chain been slow to emerge? Part of the answer
may be the perishable nature of flowers and their wildly
fluctuating prices. But the real reason is that the business is
very labor-intensive, Moran says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's always squawking about labor and finding good
workers,'' says Moran, who adds: ``The companies doing the best are
second- and third-generation family businesses where the mortgage
is paid off, and the owners put in a lot of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   KaBloom thinks it can keep a large staff motivated by offering
workers stock options and health benefits, something many small
florists can't do, Hartstein says.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Flowers, a family-owned local chain of five stores, has
checked out KaBloom and doesn't see it as a direct threat.
</P>
<P>
   Catering to an upscale clientele that might spend several
thousand dollars on holiday floral arrangements, Winston focuses on
quality and service, says marketing director Cathy Somers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When looking for a gift, people come to our designers and say,
`I know you'll create something beautiful that will leave the
person who gets it in awe,' '' Somers says.
</P>
<P>
   Picking out flowers for themselves is not something most Winston
customers want, says Somers. They're looking for the services of a
designer who'll match a bouquet to the color schemes of a
customer's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, KaBloom is pressing on. A KaBloom store costs
$250,000 to open, and the initial aim is for each to generate
$600,000 in annual sales, Hartstein says. So far, the average check
at KaBloom has been about $16.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, KaBloom is scouting for more sites at places such
as Newbury Street, the Burlington Mall, and Harvard Square.
</P>
<P>
   And long-range plans might include a public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to test the format in various locations,'' says
Maurice Segall, a senior lecturer at MIT's Sloan School of
Management and a member of KaBloom's board of directors. ``If it
works, we'll multiply it nationally.''

   PARIS _ Mayors in French mountain regions are demanding a
crackdown on skiing ``hooligans'' after a series of serious
injuries over the Christmas holidays and a disturbing rise in the
number of accidents last year.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Bresse in the Vosges has called for
gendarmes-on-skis to be stationed on every slope. Several villages
and towns in the French Alps have given the force of law to the
``ten commandments'' in the safety code of the international skiing
federation.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher approach of the public authorities follows a 17
percent increase in the number of accidents on the French slopes in
the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   It also follows a fracture-strewn opening to the 1998-99 season,
attributed partly to a vogue for new equipment, such as mono-skis
and snow-boards.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and ski professionals also report a surge of
outright bad and thoughtless behavior. ``We are in a time of
everyone-for-themselves, of selfishness,'' said Jean-Louis Costerg,
president of the French association of ski-slope managers. ``It's a
social problem, which starts in the towns, not in the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   The stricter public tone was set by the deputy chief prosecutor
in Albertville earlier this month, when he called for a three-month
prison sentence for a teenager who collided with and killed a
ten-year-old boy on a slope at Courchevel two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be very severe this winter with everyone who
thinks they can do whatever they please on the slopes,'' said Rene
Ternoy. In the event, the court passed a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Vaxelaire, mayor of Bresse, a ski-station in the Vosges,
called for direct policing of the slopes on Saturday after four
serious accidents in the mountains around his village in the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the time has come to put gendarmes on the slopes, as a
means of prevention but also as a warning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Prefect, or chief national government officer, in the Vosges
departement said he that sympathized with the request but doubted
whether it would be possible to implement such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the number of injuries is attributed partly to the
use of high-performance equipment by relative beginners. The
sharpest increase in the number of broken bones has been recorded
on the green and blue slopes, which are supposedly relatively safe
and easy.
</P>
<P>
   But local officials also blame the increased use of
``snow-boards'' by people who cut thoughtlessly through groups of
slower skiers. &QL;

<P>
   You may well be reading this surrounded by the detritus of
Christmas, a pile of his-and-her gifts stacked in the corner. Some
will very definitely be hers; perfume, earrings, lingerie, the
``must-have'' scarf. Others are indisputably his; not just boring
old socks, but all kinds of gadgetry including the year's newest
gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   And looking down on all this, the Christmas cards that really do
have the yuk factor about them: those whiter than white, purer than
pure depictions of the Madonna and Child.
</P>
<P>
   Images of that sort, together with all those bottles of eau de
cologne and dinky bits of lace, put women firmly in their place and
say that the best way to be is the traditional way to be. Dutiful
mother, with _ to spice things up a bit _ a touch of the whore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these abiding images are confused this year's end with some
extraordinary ones; of an edition of Newsnight on the four-day Iraq
war in which the presenter in London, the interviewer talking to
Vice President Al Gore in Washington, and the correspondent out in
the field were all female.
</P>
<P>
   Film from the front showed women, thumbs up, returning from
successful air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Never was it more apparent that the price of progress involves
women taking on the nastier roles formerly belonging to men, and
having to deal with the mess made by politicians, even if it means
using war as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these extreme moments of the past few weeks showing
women in their ultra-conventional guise, and the depressing
spectacle of them as partners to men at their beastliest, there is
still cause for cheer.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, more than any other year, is one we can salute as the
year of women.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, more than two-thirds of professional jobs are likely
to be taken by women in the coming year. Careers such as the law
are attracting more and more bright young female graduates, so that
now the majority of lawyers under 30 are female.
</P>
<P>
   The change has come about so fast that in the past 10 years, the
number of female lawyers has increased by 153 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of the young lawyer in 1999 being a woman is
matched by the chance that a doctor will be one. The proportion of
women reading medicine is now so high that in the coming 12 months,
just over half of the newly registered house doctors in this
country will be female.
</P>
<P>
   That these professions should attract women in such numbers
makes perfect sense. The nurturing and listening skills, combined
with the tact and people-friendly talent which so many women appear
to have as if by instinct, suit careers which involve dealing with
members of the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the tougher, more cutthroat world of business will also see
women securing more and more of the plum jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, women in the office will not be so much typing letters
as dictating them _ together with the terms of the company. Not
just in Britain, but across the corporate world, the misogynist
will have to stand aside. There will be more females at the top of
the business world than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   And every day in 1999, we will have a reminder of just how far
women have come whenever we use a bank note. Not only will there be
the Queen's head on it, but a woman's signature too. Merlyn
Lowther, the Bank of England's new chief cashier, starts her job on
Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Women's emergence in both business and the professions puts paid
at last to the idea that they only go to work to fill in time
between leaving school and having a family.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries have gone up too, and in areas where skills are in
short supply _ such as accountancy, management consultancy and IT _
pay is just about equal.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But can it get any better? And what about
poorer women in lower-grade work?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that for women both at the top and the bottom of
the ladder, the image on the Christmas card _ that of mother and
child _ comes back to haunt us still.
</P>
<P>
   For women at the top, the ultimate sacrifice so many are
expected to make is that of not having children. At the apex of the
corporate pyramid, there are very few women indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of the most senior positions in Fortune 500
companies are held by women, be they chairmen or chief executives.
And the characteristic which makes top women achievers quite
different from men is that far more of them remain childless.
</P>
<P>
   Slip back down the rungs of that career ladder, and you will
find women at the bottom also have a problem with children. This
time it is having them.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer struggle of successfully combining the raising of
children and the demands of a job means that women continue to make
up the majority of the low-paid.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are skewed by the extent to which many of these
low-paid jobs which women opt for are part-time. Without adequate
child care, there is little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Not all is lost. When Britain's national minimum wage becomes
law this year, two million low-paid workers will get the biggest
boost to their pay packets they will ever have received _ an
average of 30 percent. And for low-paid, read women.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy on low pay, together with new policies on child
care, will make 1999 the year when we will judge just how far the
Blair government reality matches up to its early rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the working family's tax credit system
comes into force, enabling those going back into work the chance to
set the cost of child care against their tax bills. This will form
a major plank of the National Child Care strategy, which will also
include the greater regulation of child care services.
</P>
<P>
   And that has to happen; without guarantees that nurseries are
safe places to leave children, mothers won't be going anywhere near
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   If all these moves in the lives of women (be they corporate
queen bees, professionals with purpose or working mothers) do make
1999 a true year of womankind, what more fitting finale to the 20th
century _ a hundred years which brought universal suffrage, the
opening of countless educational and career doors, and the dignity
bestowed by control over fertility, safe childbirth and public
repudiation of conjugal violence.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of increased opportunities, we still have a
long way to go. Look again at those Madonna and Child cards lining
your shelf. See how tightly encircling the arms are.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it time they stretched out to others, so that women are no
longer alone with their children? A casting aside of the corrupting
influence of strident individualism, so that we become a community
of women and men together _ now that would be real progress in
1999. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   You may well be reading this surrounded by the detritus of
Christmas, a pile of his-and-her gifts stacked in the corner. Some
will very definitely be hers; perfume, earrings, lingerie, the
``must-have'' scarf. Others are indisputably his; not just boring
old socks, but all kinds of gadgetry including the year's newest
gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   And looking down on all this, the Christmas cards that really do
have the yuk factor about them: those whiter than white, purer than
pure depictions of the Madonna and Child.
</P>
<P>
   Images of that sort, together with all those bottles of eau de
cologne and dinky bits of lace, put women firmly in their place and
say that the best way to be is the traditional way to be. Dutiful
mother, with _ to spice things up a bit _ a touch of the whore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these abiding images are confused this year's end with some
extraordinary ones; of an edition of Newsnight on the four-day Iraq
war in which the presenter in London, the interviewer talking to
Vice President Al Gore in Washington, and the correspondent out in
the field were all female.
</P>
<P>
   Film from the front showed women, thumbs up, returning from
successful air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Never was it more apparent that the price of progress involves
women taking on the nastier roles formerly belonging to men, and
having to deal with the mess made by politicians, even if it means
using war as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these extreme moments of the past few weeks showing
women in their ultra-conventional guise, and the depressing
spectacle of them as partners to men at their beastliest, there is
still cause for cheer.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, more than any other year, is one we can salute as the
year of women.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, more than two-thirds of professional jobs are likely
to be taken by women in the coming year. Careers such as the law
are attracting more and more bright young female graduates, so that
now the majority of lawyers under 30 are female.
</P>
<P>
   The change has come about so fast that in the past 10 years, the
number of female lawyers has increased by 153 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of the young lawyer in 1999 being a woman is
matched by the chance that a doctor will be one. The proportion of
women reading medicine is now so high that in the coming 12 months,
just over half of the newly registered house doctors in this
country will be female.
</P>
<P>
   That these professions should attract women in such numbers
makes perfect sense. The nurturing and listening skills, combined
with the tact and people-friendly talent which so many women appear
to have as if by instinct, suit careers which involve dealing with
members of the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the tougher, more cutthroat world of business will also see
women securing more and more of the plum jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, women in the office will not be so much typing letters
as dictating them _ together with the terms of the company. Not
just in Britain, but across the corporate world, the misogynist
will have to stand aside. There will be more females at the top of
the business world than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   And every day in 1999, we will have a reminder of just how far
women have come whenever we use a bank note. Not only will there be
the Queen's head on it, but a woman's signature too. Merlyn
Lowther, the Bank of England's new chief cashier, starts her job on
Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Women's emergence in both business and the professions puts paid
at last to the idea that they only go to work to fill in time
between leaving school and having a family.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries have gone up too, and in areas where skills are in
short supply _ such as accountancy, management consultancy and IT _
pay is just about equal.
</P>

   So far, so good. But can it get any better? And what about

<P>
   1999 will mark the start of a dangerous ``new era'' for
hurricane activity, weather scientists predict, with potentially
devastating consequences for densely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The past four years have seen the most extreme hurricanes since
records began, according to analysis by Professor William Gray, an
atmospheric scientist based at Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   If the pattern is sustained, he argues, severe winds will
continue to blow stronger and more frequently than ever _ and the
pattern is likely to be sustained for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 10 hurricanes and three ``intensive''
hurricane systems, with winds at more than 110 mph _ almost twice
as many in both categories as normal.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane ``season'' climaxed with Hurricane Mitch, the
fourth most powerful storm ever seen in the Caribbean, which killed
10,000 people, devastating Nicaragua and Honduras. The U.S.
government described Mitch as ``the worst disaster we have seen in
this hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Gray's team _ which also includes a senior U.S. government
meteorologist _ predicts that in 1999 there will be nine hurricanes
and four intense ones.
</P>
<P>
   The latter are particularly important, says Prof. Gray, because
``they cause the majority of hurricane-spawned destruction.''
Although they make up only about one quarter of all major storms,
they are responsible for 80 percent of the damage and loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists estimate that in 1999 the Caribbean and the
United States' Atlantic coast will be twice as likely _ and the
U.S. Gulf coast one-and-a-half times as likely _ to be hit by one
of these intense hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that because of the population build-up along
the U.S. East Coast, property damage could be severe,'' adds Prof.
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the scientists say, there have been 33 hurricanes
and 15 intense ones, making the period the ``most active four
consecutive years of hurricane activity on record.'' The effect is
all the more dramatic because the 25-year period up to 1994 was
unusually ``quiescent.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists base their predictions for 1999 on studies of a
whole series of weather phenomena, ranging from the temperature of
the Pacific Ocean to rainfall in the West African Sahel, which have
proved to be good indicators of hurricanes in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The ``La Nina'' cold current in the Pacific goes with hurricanes
in the Atlantic. It began to take hold last year and the scientists
expect that it will persist through the next hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   Wet years in the Sahel are also linked with Atlantic hurricanes:
more rain fell than usual this year, and this too is expected to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Stratospheric winds, which change direction every few years, are
expected to go on blowing from the west, which produces hurricanes.
And global warming is also thought to make the storms worse as they
draw extra energy from warmer seas.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor, scientists believe, is the North
Atlantic Conveyor Belt Current, which carries warm water from the
Caribbean to east of Greenland as the Gulf Stream, and takes a deep
cold water current back again.
</P>
<P>
   When it is strong, they say, there are plenty of hurricanes.
They believe it strengthened between 1994 and 1995 and is now more
forceful than for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the current may well continue, bringing more
intense and frequent hurricanes ``for two or more decades.'' &QL;

 By JOHN LICHFIELD  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The excited children aged 9 and 10 were learning about
the euro in the school parking lot. They were also trying to stand
on one another's feet when Madame was not looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurobus _ touring Normandy for the past three months,
spreading the gospel of the single currency _ had come to town. Or
in this case to the village of Cambes-en-Plaine, just north of
Caen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will the euro mean to you?'' asked the bright, young
woman wearing jeans, and a stud in her nostril.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will mean we have less money, because everything will be
divided by six,'' said little Philippe. ``No,'' explained the
patient woman from the Treasury. ``Your pocket money will seem less
but it will buy as many sweets as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Florian, aged nine, piped up: ``The euro will mean we are
stronger because we will be 11 countries working together, instead
of one. It will mean that we don't have to pay to change our money
when we go abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright, young woman beamed. Florian's Papa, it turned out,
is a bank manager.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, faced with the historic prospect of the abolition of
the franc, the class displayed remarkable knowledge _ and blithe
indifference. Something similar could be said of France as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because the everyday consequences seem so far away, with
the franc remaining in circulation for another three years, France
will greet the new year launch of the single currency with a wave
of apathetic enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent polls, almost 70 percent of French people
regard the euro positively. But the government and business
representatives who have manned the Eurobus through Calvados since
September report a surprisingly low level of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older people are making a bit of a drama out of
it. They complain that they still think in old francs (abolished in
1960),'' reported Claire Godillon, director of judicial affairs for
the Caen Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, people don't seem to care much either way. There
are a few who are strongly in favor, a few who are violently
against. The great majority are mildly curious and accept it's
going to happen, whatever they think.''
</P>
<P>
   Although France voted only narrowly for the Maastricht Treaty
for shadowing the euro, the anti-single currency camp, on both the
left and right, has failed in recent efforts to stir up indignation
or concern.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates and inflation at historic lows, the economy
reasonably strong and the Bourse (stock market) at record highs,

both currencies. Customers can pay in euros, by check or banker's
card, but only if the establishment is ready to accept them.

</P>
<P>
   The euro is, however, transforming the lives of at least two
people. The state Loto organized two special jackpot draws, just
before and just after Christmas. In each, the first prize was seven
million euros, so creating the first euro-millionaires. &QL;

   PARIS _ The excited children aged 9 and 10 were learning about
the euro in the school parking lot. They were also trying to stand
on one another's feet when Madame was not looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurobus _ touring Normandy for the past three months,
spreading the gospel of the single currency _ had come to town. Or
in this case to the village of Cambes-en-Plaine, just north of
Caen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will the euro mean to you?'' asked the bright, young
woman wearing jeans, and a stud in her nostril.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will mean we have less money, because everything will be
divided by six,'' said little Philippe. ``No,'' explained the
patient woman from the Treasury. ``Your pocket money will seem less
but it will buy as many sweets as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Florian, aged nine, piped up: ``The euro will mean we are
stronger because we will be 11 countries working together, instead
of one. It will mean that we don't have to pay to change our money
when we go abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright, young woman beamed. Florian's Papa, it turned out,
is a bank manager.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, faced with the historic prospect of the abolition of
the franc, the class displayed remarkable knowledge _ and blithe
indifference. Something similar could be said of France as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because the everyday consequences seem so far away, with
the franc remaining in circulation for another three years, France
will greet the new year launch of the single currency with a wave
of apathetic enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent polls, almost 70 percent of French people
regard the euro positively. But the government and business
representatives who have manned the Eurobus through Calvados since
September report a surprisingly low level of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older people are making a bit of a drama out of
it. They complain that they still think in old francs (abolished in
1960),'' reported Claire Godillon, director of judicial affairs for
the Caen Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, people don't seem to care much either way. There
are a few who are strongly in favor, a few who are violently
against. The great majority are mildly curious and accept it's
going to happen, whatever they think.''
</P>
<P>
   Although France voted only narrowly for the Maastricht Treaty
for shadowing the euro, the anti-single currency camp, on both the
left and right, has failed in recent efforts to stir up indignation
or concern.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates and inflation at historic lows, the economy
reasonably strong and the Bourse (stock market) at record highs,
it's difficult to make a short-term, economic case against the
euro. The political, sentimental case appears to have gone by the
board, for now.
</P>
<P>
   What will change from next month? Apart from the invisible but
vital fact that control of France's currency will pass to the
European Central Bank in Frankfurt, not very much.
</P>

   All restaurants and shops have been asked to display prices in

COUGHLIN IS CAUTIOUS ON BRUNELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Brunell already has one miracle to his credit, and all eyes
will be on him in Jacksonville as he goes for his second Sunday
against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the highly talented Jaguars quarterback was injured
in an exhibition game in Giants Stadium. The doctors said he tore
his knee apart and would be out for the season. Brunell said they
were wrong and he would prove it.
</P>
<P>
   He played four weeks later, and eventually carried his team into
the playoffs and himself into the Pro Bowl as he topped the AFC in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Brunell injured his ankle four weeks ago, and now he
hopes to make it back for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference this time,'' cautions Jaguars coach Tom
Coughlin. ``When he came back a year ago, he had a full week of
practice, taking all the snaps, to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't happen that way this time. If he is ready to play,
we'll just have to throw him in and see what happens. There won't
be any period of grace. He'll either be able to do it or he
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell ``practiced'' last Friday for the first time since the
injury, but it was mostly limping around, throwing in noncontact
seven-on-seven drills. Today he will pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will practice, but he will be limited,'' said Coughlin.
``The good part is that his ankle did not swell up after he worked
out last Friday. But he still has a problem with it. I hope he can
take about one-third of the snaps in practice, come out of it OK,
and then improve the next day. We will look at his situation day to
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody works harder at coming back to play than Mark does. He
is in the training room every spare minute he has trying to get
this thing better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even guess right now what his status will be for
Sunday. I will make the call, and I will not put him out there
unless he can defend himself. I will not let him play if he can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one point in Monday night's win over Pittsburgh, the Jaguars
had three defensive players on the field who were on practice
squads a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about Eric Storz?'' says Coughlin, referring to the former
Boston College linebacker. ``We had him in training camp and had to
cut him because we had other people who were better. When we got
all the injuries, we had to bring him back a couple of weeks ago,
and he played against Pittsburgh. Did a good job on special teams,
and he'll probably dress against New England Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin does not expect first-round draft choice Donovin
Darius, a safety, to play because of an abdominal injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hurt us,'' said Coughlin. ``He was playing very
well for us. The kid is a real hitter and played very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Mad Monday, when five NFL head coaches were
fired, this was Bill Parcells's reaction:
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, 10 head coaches were fired. Last year it was
four more. This year there are six already, and probably two more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 30 teams. Twenty head coaches have lost jobs in the
last 24 months, and two more probably will move on. In what other
industry do businesses get rid of their top management person the
way this one does? Seventy percent of the head coaches will be
changed in two years. It's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The buzz around the league Tuesday was that Mike Holmgren will
end up with the Carolina Panthers. The speculation soared when the
Panthers kept Gil Haskell as offensive coordinator while letting
most of the staff go. Haskell and Holmgren are very close friends.
The feeling is that owner Jerry Richardson would not force Haskell
on the next coach _ unless that coach was Holmgren. Word is that
Holmgren's agent has told teams his client is going to have to be
head coach and general manager, meaning he can hire and fire all
football personnel in the organization, all the way down to the
video man. Also surfacing are reports that 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci will be let go if his team loses to Green Bay (and
Holmgren) this weekend. Mariucci was offered a contract extension a
few weeks back but didn't sign it because there were no guarantees
that he would have control over player personnel or the draft . . .
Consider this. After Holmgren leaves Green Bay, only four coaches,
out of 31, will have been with their teams five years: Marty
Schottenheimer in Kansas City, Jeff Fisher in Tennessee, Bill
Cowher in Pittsburgh, and Dennis Green in Minnesota. Sounds like
the NHL.

 By JOHN LICHFIELD  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The owner of my favorite bar in Paris is not a
philosophical sort of man. He rarely says anything at all. The
other day he came to my table and gave a long soliloquy about the
euro (a subject dear to his heart, and pocket, since he replaced
his till and portable bankers' card machines to prepare for the
partial launch of the new currency next month).
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, the soliloquy was not negative. Nor was it
especially positive. He was convinced, in a matter-of-fact kind of
way, that the coming of the euro was the ``real beginning of Europe
as one country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did any of it mean, there, in Brussels, until now?
Nothing. But money, that people understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that in 50 years' time, everyone in Europe would
have two nationalities and two languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I feel Breton and French. In the future, they will feel
French or Italian or German, and at the same time, they will feel
European. Everyone will talk their own language and also English.
Except you, the English. You will always talk only English.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is right, and the Daily Telegraph is right, and the French
Euroskeptics like the former interior minister, Charles Pasqua, are
right, this week marks the beginning of the end of the nation state
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Where _ apart from in Britain _ are the forces of national
resistance? Where are the violent street demonstrations? Where are
the new European civil wars, predicted in a book serialized in The
Times a couple of years ago? Where are the legions of currency
speculators, determined to bring the whole cumbersome apparatus
down?
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the euro is the story of a whole pack of dogs
which did not bark. The recession, and uprisings, predicted as a
result of the spending cuts forced by the euro guidelines have not
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the Euroland countries, with record low
interest rates and low inflation, are resisting the turbulence in
the world economy better than most.
</P>
<P>
   The visceral opposition of the German public has evaporated. The
French public _ like the other nine euro publics _ is apathetically
enthusiastic: hugely in favor, according to the polls, but not
especially interested.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year gap between the political launch of the single
currency this week and the appearance of alien, monopoly money in
people's pockets looked like a huge hostage to fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out to have been a political masterstroke: lulling
the Europeans into a gradual acceptance of the euro, like someone
drowsing in the bath with the hot tap turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone fundamentally pro-European, it is bizarre, even
disturbing experience, to see a proud and great country like France
sleep-walking into something so elemental to its future.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, the husk of the franc will remain in French
pockets, but the franc, as an independent, national currency, as an
instrument of national economic policy, as a symbol or tool of
national sovereignty, will have ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of the franc against the euro and the 10 other euro
currencies will be fixed in concrete. Decisions on interest rates
and money supply will be taken by the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt, under the chairmanship of a Dutch banker who looks like
one of the many incarnations of Dr. Who.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jan. 1, 2002, the euro will have a strange life as a
virtual currency, a plastic currency, an electronic currency. There
will be euro checkbooks (smaller than existing ones to set them
apart). There will be euro-compatible bankers' cards. But there
will be no foldable euro notes or spinnable euro coins.
</P>
<P>
   Big business in Euroland is expected to switch to making paper
and electronic transactions in Euros immediately. For the next
three years, small businesses, restaurants and shops have the
option of accepting Euros in plastic or check form _ or not, as
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from street level, the whole business looks like a bit of a
non-event. But the Paris bar owner, Charles Pasqua and the Daily
Telegraph are right.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the single currency is a quantum leap in the
creation of a common European identity and a single European
political and economic entity (even if the f-word, federalism, is
banned now in France and Germany as much as in Britain).
</P>
<P>
   It is a quantum leap partly for the reasons the bar owner gave.
Once the euro becomes a real currency in three years' time, Europe
will become part of daily life, something palpable and meaningful
to ordinary, non-farming Europeans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   This could, ultimately, help to create the kind of political and
democratic legitimacy which the European Union _ always a top-down,
elitist kind of notion _ has never really had. Small wonder that
the Euroskeptics loathe the idea of the euro as they do.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge dangers also, from the pro-European
perspective. If the European economies falter or crash before the
euro becomes fully accepted, the single currency and the European
Central Bank will be easy and obvious demagogic targets.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency is a quantum leap for other reasons, which
pro-Europeans prefer to smooth over.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why many Britons have never emotionally
accepted the EEC/EC/EU is that it was sold to them as a simple
common market, which it never really was.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Blair government, under withering Euroskeptic
fire, tends now to minimize the significance _ in terms of
sovereignty, in terms of loss of economic control _ of joining the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the existence of a single currency is likely to force
the Euroland governments, little by little, to take many more
economic and political decisions together.
</P>
<P>
   Scope will remain for independent policies on taxation (as even
the individual U.S. states or Canadian provinces have). But the
otherwise destabilizing effect of differing national economies will
force the Euroland governments to coordinate economic policy more
and more closely.
</P>
<P>
   To this extent, the decision of the new German government to
drop the Kohl-fired opposition to such a notion is not so much a
swing to the left as a recognition of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, the case for more direct democracy at
European level _ also inevitably a federalizing force _ would
become unanswerable.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the EU has been one of setting seemingly purely
economic targets _ the common market, the single market, the single
currency _ which turn out to be deeply political targets.
</P>
<P>
   Removing economic barriers forces the removal of political
barriers (something Baroness Thatcher failed to grasp). The coming
of the euro sets that clock ticking again, more powerfully than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. There are good economic arguments for the Euro. There is a
case for more political unity in Europe, short _ far short _ of the
arrogant, bureaucratic, federal superstate of Euroskeptic
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   But the closer you come to real lives of real people, as the
euro does, the more you need to be sure that the real people accept
what is happening in their name and why.
</P>
<P>
   The indifference with which the phantom phase of the euro will
be greeted throughout Euroland next week may baffle Euroskeptics;
it should also unsettle the pro-Europeans. &QL;

   PARIS _ The owner of my favorite bar in Paris is not a
philosophical sort of man. He rarely says anything at all. The
other day he came to my table and gave a long soliloquy about the
euro (a subject dear to his heart, and pocket, since he replaced
his till and portable bankers' card machines to prepare for the
partial launch of the new currency next month).
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, the soliloquy was not negative. Nor was it
especially positive. He was convinced, in a matter-of-fact kind of
way, that the coming of the euro was the ``real beginning of Europe
as one country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did any of it mean, there, in Brussels, until now?
Nothing. But money, that people understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that in 50 years' time, everyone in Europe would
have two nationalities and two languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I feel Breton and French. In the future, they will feel
French or Italian or German, and at the same time, they will feel
European. Everyone will talk their own language and also English.
Except you, the English. You will always talk only English.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is right, and the Daily Telegraph is right, and the French
Euroskeptics like the former interior minister, Charles Pasqua, are
right, this week marks the beginning of the end of the nation state
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Where _ apart from in Britain _ are the forces of national
resistance? Where are the violent street demonstrations? Where are
the new European civil wars, predicted in a book serialized in The
Times a couple of years ago? Where are the legions of currency
speculators, determined to bring the whole cumbersome apparatus
down?
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the euro is the story of a whole pack of dogs
which did not bark. The recession, and uprisings, predicted as a
result of the spending cuts forced by the euro guidelines have not
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the Euroland countries, with record low
interest rates and low inflation, are resisting the turbulence in
the world economy better than most.
</P>
<P>
   The visceral opposition of the German public has evaporated. The
French public _ like the other nine euro publics _ is apathetically
enthusiastic: hugely in favor, according to the polls, but not
especially interested.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year gap between the political launch of the single
currency this week and the appearance of alien, monopoly money in
people's pockets looked like a huge hostage to fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out to have been a political masterstroke: lulling
the Europeans into a gradual acceptance of the euro, like someone
drowsing in the bath with the hot tap turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone fundamentally pro-European, it is bizarre, even
disturbing experience, to see a proud and great country like France
sleep-walking into something so elemental to its future.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, the husk of the franc will remain in French
pockets, but the franc, as an independent, national currency, as an
instrument of national economic policy, as a symbol or tool of
national sovereignty, will have ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of the franc against the euro and the 10 other euro
currencies will be fixed in concrete. Decisions on interest rates
and money supply will be taken by the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt, under the chairmanship of a Dutch banker who looks like
one of the many incarnations of Dr. Who.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jan. 1, 2002, the euro will have a strange life as a
virtual currency, a plastic currency, an electronic currency. There
will be euro checkbooks (smaller than existing ones to set them
apart). There will be euro-compatible bankers' cards. But there
will be no foldable euro notes or spinnable euro coins.
</P>
<P>
   Big business in Euroland is expected to switch to making paper
and electronic transactions in Euros immediately. For the next
three years, small businesses, restaurants and shops have the
option of accepting Euros in plastic or check form _ or not, as
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from street level, the whole business looks like a bit of a
non-event. But the Paris bar owner, Charles Pasqua and the Daily
Telegraph are right.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the single currency is a quantum leap in the
creation of a common European identity and a single European
political and economic entity (even if the f-word, federalism, is
banned now in France and Germany as much as in Britain).
</P>
<P>
   It is a quantum leap partly for the reasons the bar owner gave.
Once the euro becomes a real currency in three years' time, Europe
will become part of daily life, something palpable and meaningful
to ordinary, non-farming Europeans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   This could, ultimately, help to create the kind of political and
democratic legitimacy which the European Union _ always a top-down,
elitist kind of notion _ has never really had. Small wonder that
the Euroskeptics loathe the idea of the euro as they do.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge dangers also, from the pro-European
perspective. If the European economies falter or crash before the
euro becomes fully accepted, the single currency and the European
Central Bank will be easy and obvious demagogic targets.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency is a quantum leap for other reasons, which
pro-Europeans prefer to smooth over.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why many Britons have never emotionally
accepted the EEC/EC/EU is that it was sold to them as a simple
common market, which it never really was.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Blair government, under withering Euroskeptic
fire, tends now to minimize the significance _ in terms of
sovereignty, in terms of loss of economic control _ of joining the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the existence of a single currency is likely to force
the Euroland governments, little by little, to take many more
economic and political decisions together.
</P>
<P>
   Scope will remain for independent policies on taxation (as even
the individual U.S. states or Canadian provinces have). But the
otherwise destabilizing effect of differing national economies will
force the Euroland governments to coordinate economic policy more
and more closely.
</P>
<P>
   To this extent, the decision of the new German government to
drop the Kohl-fired opposition to such a notion is not so much a
swing to the left as a recognition of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, the case for more direct democracy at
European level _ also inevitably a federalizing force _ would
become unanswerable.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the EU has been one of setting seemingly purely
economic targets _ the common market, the single market, the single
currency _ which turn out to be deeply political targets.
</P>
<P>
   Removing economic barriers forces the removal of political
barriers (something Baroness Thatcher failed to grasp). The coming
of the euro sets that clock ticking again, more powerfully than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. There are good economic arguments for the Euro. There is a
case for more political unity in Europe, short _ far short _ of the
arrogant, bureaucratic, federal superstate of Euroskeptic
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   But the closer you come to real lives of real people, as the
euro does, the more you need to be sure that the real people accept
what is happening in their name and why.
</P>
<P>
   The indifference with which the phantom phase of the euro will
be greeted throughout Euroland next week may baffle Euroskeptics;
it should also unsettle the pro-Europeans. &QL;

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the week when Europe starts its gigantic experiment, the
launch of a single currency for 11 members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   It will soon be possible, for the first time since the fall of
the Roman Empire, to travel from the Channel to the tip of Italy
without having to change money.
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork quilt of currencies that Europeans have used in
their daily lives for more than 1,500 years is being replaced with
a single one.
</P>
<P>
   The euro becomes a legal entity on Jan. 1, 1999. It will swiftly
replace the national currencies and, within three years francs,
marks, pesetas, lire and so on will have become history.
</P>
<P>
   It is an experiment in the sense that there is no precedent for
such an event. There have been currency reforms, of course, where a
country has decided to replace an old currency with a new one:
Germany has done so three times this century.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes countries have chosen to link their money to that of a
foreign power _ many to the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
   There have been attempts by countries to bind their currencies
together: there was an attempt at a European currency in the last
century, which failed.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been occasions when a country has had its own
money replaced with a foreign one, usually as a result of conquest,
colonization or some other political shock.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, the first time that a group of countries which
are not part of a political union and which have not been conquered
or colonized have agreed to give up their own currencies for
another.
</P>
<P>
   So anything said or written about the launch of the euro, and in
particular its political and economic consequences, has to be taken
with a pinch of salt. We have to guess; we cannot know. This is a
journey without maps.
</P>
<P>
   What we can do is make a stab at gauging some of the effects of
this decision. There is one clear political consequence, and a
number of less clear economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the political impact of the new European Central
Bank, the body that will ``run'' the euro. Up to now, the European
political institutions have been quite weak. The key decisions
supposedly imposed by the Brussels bureaucracy have almost
invariably been approved by national governments; power still lies
with the ministers of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
   As for the importance of the European Parliament _ well, a quick
test: can you name a Euro MP? Now there is a new institution for
Europe. All national countries have some sort of central bank to
run their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The recent trend has been to make that central bank more
independent of the government, to give it more power. But central
banks operate within the framework of a national government: the
Bank if England has its independence because that has been given to
it by a powerful parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new European Central Bank in Frankfurt has been given its
independence too, but the counterweight of the European Parliament
is much weaker.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, having a new independent body running the euro
compensates for the weakness of other European institutions. In
another sense, Europe has created a new focus of power, sharply
reducing the scope for national parliaments to exert their own
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Europe is not just getting a single currency. It
is getting a single interest rate, too.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least is the theory. If you ask practical questions as
to how the European Central Bank will exert its power, the answers
are guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Will European interest rates be high or low? Will the currency
be strong or weak? Will the bank pay more attention to the needs of
the countries on the fringe or will the big battalions dominate?
</P>
<P>
   If we do not know what sort of currency the euro is going to be,
judging its economic effects is obviously hazardous. But some
things can sensibly be said. For a start, giving Europe a single
currency will give a spur to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that prices are fixed in the same unit will mean that
they will tend to converge. Buy a new car in Inverness and it will
be pretty much the same price as one in Truro; buy a car in
Copenhagen and the price will be very different from one in
Seville. Expect those differences to narrow swiftly _ and expect
the prices to narrow down, not narrow up.
</P>
<P>
   That will have an enormous impact on companies. Those with
plants in different countries, with different wage rates and
productivity levels, will immediately be able to compare those
differences. They will be forced to improve efficiency and Europe's
economy will become more competitive as a result.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other effects. We are already seeing the impetus
for cross-European mergers; expect that to proceed apace. We are
already seeing the impetus for a cross-European tax policy; the
single currency will inevitably encourage that process, not because
some politicians and officials are determined to impose common
taxes, but because the scale of the differentials will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for companies to pay similar taxes across Europe
will grow, for if large differentials remain, they will relocate
towards the lower tax zones.
</P>
<P>
   So the European economy will become more integrated and more
efficient. Some parts will benefit; others will find the new burst
of competition very tough.
</P>
<P>
   The single interest rate will be a particularly powerful
discipline. It is not just that some parts will have to operate on
interest rates that are too high for their local needs, others that
are too low. It is also that finance will tend to flow towards
areas and projects that deliver the highest returns.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will think pan-European, rather than in little
national boxes. The leaders will bound forward, the laggards will
suffer still more.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that investors have a new common zone in which to
operate will have one further impact _ one that will, if the euro
is successful, change Europe's place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Second World War there has been a single global
currency standard, the dollar. It has been challenged at times by
the yen and the German mark, and in the early postwar years
sterling was bracketed alongside.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar has really dominated. No longer. The euro will be
close in value to the U.S. dollar, backed by an economy of similar
size. The world's currencies will have two anchors, not one.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be a source of tension or will they coexist happily?
Will people trust the euro?
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the greatest question of all. Will the euro
succeed?
</P>
<P>
   History is littered with attempts at currency unions that have
failed. I suppose the failure of the sterling area, made up of many
members of the former British Empire, is as good an example as any.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been no lasting currency union without a
political union. So what Europe is attempting is a great daring,
romantic leap into the unknown. &QL;

<P>
   This is the week when Europe starts its gigantic experiment, the
launch of a single currency for 11 members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   It will soon be possible, for the first time since the fall of
the Roman Empire, to travel from the Channel to the tip of Italy
without having to change money.
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork quilt of currencies that Europeans have used in
their daily lives for more than 1,500 years is being replaced with
a single one.
</P>
<P>
   The euro becomes a legal entity on Jan. 1, 1999. It will swiftly
replace the national currencies and, within three years francs,
marks, pesetas, lire and so on will have become history.
</P>
<P>
   It is an experiment in the sense that there is no precedent for
such an event. There have been currency reforms, of course, where a
country has decided to replace an old currency with a new one:
Germany has done so three times this century.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes countries have chosen to link their money to that of a
foreign power _ many to the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
   There have been attempts by countries to bind their currencies
together: there was an attempt at a European currency in the last
century, which failed.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been occasions when a country has had its own
money replaced with a foreign one, usually as a result of conquest,
colonization or some other political shock.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, the first time that a group of countries which
are not part of a political union and which have not been conquered
or colonized have agreed to give up their own currencies for
another.
</P>
<P>
   So anything said or written about the launch of the euro, and in
particular its political and economic consequences, has to be taken
with a pinch of salt. We have to guess; we cannot know. This is a
journey without maps.
</P>
<P>
   What we can do is make a stab at gauging some of the effects of
this decision. There is one clear political consequence, and a
number of less clear economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the political impact of the new European Central
Bank, the body that will ``run'' the euro. Up to now, the European
political institutions have been quite weak. The key decisions
supposedly imposed by the Brussels bureaucracy have almost
invariably been approved by national governments; power still lies
with the ministers of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
   As for the importance of the European Parliament _ well, a quick
test: can you name a Euro MP? Now there is a new institution for
Europe. All national countries have some sort of central bank to
run their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The recent trend has been to make that central bank more
independent of the government, to give it more power. But central
banks operate within the framework of a national government: the
Bank if England has its independence because that has been given to
it by a powerful parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new European Central Bank in Frankfurt has been given its
independence too, but the counterweight of the European Parliament
is much weaker.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, having a new independent body running the euro
compensates for the weakness of other European institutions. In
another sense, Europe has created a new focus of power, sharply
reducing the scope for national parliaments to exert their own
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Europe is not just getting a single currency. It
is getting a single interest rate, too.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least is the theory. If you ask practical questions as
to how the European Central Bank will exert its power, the answers
are guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Will European interest rates be high or low? Will the currency
be strong or weak? Will the bank pay more attention to the needs of
the countries on the fringe or will the big battalions dominate?
</P>
<P>
   If we do not know what sort of currency the euro is going to be,
judging its economic effects is obviously hazardous. But some
things can sensibly be said. For a start, giving Europe a single
currency will give a spur to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that prices are fixed in the same unit will mean that
they will tend to converge. Buy a new car in Inverness and it will
be pretty much the same price as one in Truro; buy a car in
Copenhagen and the price will be very different from one in
Seville. Expect those differences to narrow swiftly _ and expect
the prices to narrow down, not narrow up.
</P>
<P>
   That will have an enormous impact on companies. Those with
plants in different countries, with different wage rates and
productivity levels, will immediately be able to compare those
differences. They will be forced to improve efficiency and Europe's
economy will become more competitive as a result.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other effects. We are already seeing the impetus
for cross-European mergers; expect that to proceed apace. We are
already seeing the impetus for a cross-European tax policy; the
single currency will inevitably encourage that process, not because
some politicians and officials are determined to impose common
taxes, but because the scale of the differentials will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for companies to pay similar taxes across Europe
will grow, for if large differentials remain, they will relocate
towards the lower tax zones.
</P>
<P>
   So the European economy will become more integrated and more
efficient. Some parts will benefit; others will find the new burst
of competition very tough.
</P>
<P>
   The single interest rate will be a particularly powerful
discipline. It is not just that some parts will have to operate on
interest rates that are too high for their local needs, others that
are too low. It is also that finance will tend to flow towards
areas and projects that deliver the highest returns.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will think pan-European, rather than in little
national boxes. The leaders will bound forward, the laggards will
suffer still more.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that investors have a new common zone in which to
operate will have one further impact _ one that will, if the euro
is successful, change Europe's place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Second World War there has been a single global
currency standard, the dollar. It has been challenged at times by
the yen and the German mark, and in the early postwar years
sterling was bracketed alongside.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar has really dominated. No longer. The euro will be
close in value to the U.S. dollar, backed by an economy of similar
size. The world's currencies will have two anchors, not one.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be a source of tension or will they coexist happily?
Will people trust the euro?
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the greatest question of all. Will the euro
succeed?
</P>
<P>
   History is littered with attempts at currency unions that have
failed. I suppose the failure of the sterling area, made up of many
members of the former British Empire, is as good an example as any.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been no lasting currency union without a
political union. So what Europe is attempting is a great daring,
romantic leap into the unknown. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for General Winter, and the stillness that for a few
frozen months, at least, was supposed to lie across the tormented
land of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, when Christians fight Muslims across the
snowy hillsides of the southern Balkans, not even Christmas can
halt the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   British and German troops may once have respected a truce of
sorts in the trenches of Flanders, but in 1998, when Serbs and
ethnic Albanians are in the field, Christmas Eve is when
cease-fires collapse. And not only cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important casualty of the violent Christmas
weekend is the old notion of how this dirty war might be ended.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed until now, over the past few weeks, its contours have
subtly shifted. Previously there was no argument about the villain
of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   This was Slobodan Milosevic's war. He had started it back in
1989 (and with it the entire Balkan tragedy that would follow) by
scrapping the autonomy Kosovo and its overwhelming Albanian
majority had previously enjoyed, and even now, he retains the prime
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   His savage, utterly disproportionate crackdown on the ethnic
Albanians last spring set the stage for a summer of fighting which
would make refugees of a quarter of a million people, pit Russia
against the West and ultimately have B-52s waiting, engines
revving, on British airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the October cease-fire agreement, providing for
Serbian withdrawal, the start of political negotiations, and the
dispatch of 2,000 unarmed international observers to make sure
everyone kept their word.
</P>
<P>
   This time however, no matter how much you detest the regime in
Belgrade, matters are not so simple. The Kosovo Liberation Army is
at least as much to blame for the collapse of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Serbs are overreacting: is a column of tanks
really required to avenge the death of a single policeman? But the
KLA, too, is spoiling for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   It has acquired new arms, above all anti-tank weapons to nullify
the most potent asset of the Serb forces, and shows absolutely no
interest in the political talks which are supposed to start next
month. Bomb Milosevic, says the heart. But this time the head
resists.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, and despite every vow made by Western foreign
ministers at meetings without number, Kosovo looks more like Bosnia
with every passing day.
</P>
<P>
   The killing, admittedly, is nowhere near on the same scale. But
even before half of them have even taken up their stations, the
OSCE monitors are acquiring an uncanny resemblance to the unhappy
men of UNPROFOR earlier in the decade, the Bosnian ``peacekeepers''
with no peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday OSCE teams were sent to the village of Obranca, focal
point of the latest fighting. How long, one wonders, before some of
their number are taken hostage, or killed in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   So what next? Conceivably, of course, this being the season of
hope, good will, and irrational optimism, events might yet get us
off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, after a decade of slaughter and barbarity, 1999 will
prove to be the final year of this most terrible of the 20th
century's Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year will at last see the demise of the Milosevic
regime, brought down peaceably from within by the economic misery
and international obloquy it has inflicted upon the Serbian nation.
Maybe its successor will be more sensible and less nationalist,
open to a reasonable accommodation with the Kosovan Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too, sweet reason will also descend on the shoulders of
these latter, despite the atrocities and humiliations heaped upon
them by Belgrade. And then again, 1999 may be when Saddam Hussein
makes a state visit to Washington. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 625. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In practical terms, the West faces the dilemma of dealing with a
conflict in which the middle ground of political negotiation,
freely entered into by both parties, is now scorched earth.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, we cannot let the two sides simply fight it out. In the
short term, this would probably lead to another cycle of Serbian
repression, horrific media pictures and public clamor forcing
Western governments to intervene in much haste, but to little
lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if crackdown is unacceptable, so too _ at least for now _ is
an independent Kosovo, which the Western chancelleries argue might
tear Macedonia apart. For even autocrats cannot ignore the body bag
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, the cost of enforcing control could prove too
high even for the Serbs, and the Albanians who outnumber them nine
to one in Kosovo would have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the spectre of an inchoate ``Greater Albania,'' which would
further destabilize an already unstable region and perhaps drag
Greece, Bulgaria and, worst of all, Turkey, into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, I have reluctantly come to believe, mono-ethnic
states of this kind are the only bricks with which to build the new
Balkans. Right now, however, there is barely a smaller Albania, let
alone a greater one.
</P>
<P>
   But this violent Christmas has at least one merit: it has laid
bare the harsh and central truth about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is adjudged the best solution _ whether to defy Balkan
logic and attempt to maintain an ethnically-mixed Kosovo somehow
linked to Serbia, or to lay the ground for a new Albanian political
entity in the southern Balkans _ only a credible Western military
presence will allow it to be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   And we are not talking about unarmed observers, monitors or
``verifiers,'' but ground troops with all the hardware they need,
in Kosovo for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, in short, will have to become another Bosnia. Not, we
must ensure, in the sense of the brutality and slaughter which
preceded the settlement imposed by the Americans at Dayton, but in
becoming a de facto Western protectorate as Bosnia now is,
installed under the guise of another Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, of course, the instigators of this accord would be
European statesmen, and the troops who make it stick should be
European troops. But Kosovo has come too soon for Europe, whatever
the agreement on a future European defense identity between Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
   The prime mover will have to be NATO, in other words the
Americans. The United States will not like it, no more than it
liked the prospect of its ground troops committed to Bosnia _ and
perhaps even less, for in Bosnia a presence which was originally
meant to last six months has now become open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. and its allies to meet some predetermined
artificial deadline to withdraw, Washington knows full well, would
simply invite disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And so in Kosovo too. But a permanent military presence there
would almost certainly prove as effective as it has in Bosnia, with
remarkably little loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   It would guarantee the essentials: the Kosovo Albanians would be
freed from the threat of Serbian oppression and violence; the Serbs
would be assured of access to their holy sites, political and
religious.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it would buy time, to wait out Slobodan Milosevic. &QL;

BOSTON TEAMS ARE IN A STATE OF CONFUSION

<P>
   The phrase keeps popping up in my head.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Annus horribilis.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   That's how Queen Elizabeth II described a recent 12 months of
British history during her annual end-of-the-year address to her
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The time is here for my own annual State of the Teams
assessment, and it doesn't even matter that two of our five local
professional sports franchises had, or soon will have, postseason
play, that one has a dynamic coach who improved the team by 21
games and that another, its current little slide notwithstanding,
is a respected team described by its own general manager as a
``contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it seems as if every year in sport _ here, there and
everywhere in sport _ is an (itals)annus horribilis(unitals) as
sport drifts farther and farther away from the grasp of the common
man. We are entrenched in a major corporation/luxury box/club
seat/greedy and lying free agent world. Throw in local politics
(and a Happy New Year to you, too, Mr. Speakah) and it's a totally
depressing sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, pass the hemlock.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the teams will be discussed in alphabetical order.

BRUINS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They have a terrific first line. They have a quality goaltender.
They have a civic monument defenseman. They have a top-drawer
coach.
</P>
<P>
   They also have the most loyal and deserving fan base of any team
in town. And they deserve more than they get.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a Harry Sinden fan. I don't think the game has passed him
by. I simply believe that if he had the resources that are
routinely given other general managers he could put together a
juggernaut, not just a feisty, hard-working team from which its
cop-on-the-beat coach extracts everything there is to get.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Bruins isn't here. It's in Buffalo. That's
where owner Jeremy Jacobs lives, and he doesn't have one Gene Autry
corpuscle in him. The Cowboy died rich, frustrated, and unhappy at
91 without ever seeing an American League pennant raised in
Anaheim, and it wasn't because he didn't try. He spent and spent
and spent.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy takes and takes and takes. His heart isn't in it. After
all these years, we don't even know if he could tell you how many
men are on a team.
</P>
<P>
   So Harry does what he is supposed to do, and he's good at it.
Like Red Auerbach before him, he takes better care of his owner's
money than the owner would. Harry doesn't throw any money around _
and it shows. If you don't throw money around in the NHL, you have
no chance of winning the Stanley Cup, which, Jeremy Jacobs's penury
aside, is what this enterprise is supposed to be all about.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound contradictory? Wasn't I decrying the big-money
stranglehold on sport? Sure, but it's reality. The Bruins keep
trying to pretend otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELTICS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? There's no league. No games, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say there was. Would Antoine Walker be here? I don't
know. Would there be someone half-decent in the middle? Probably
not. Would Kenny Anderson be healthy enough to play most games?
Maybe, maybe not. Would Paul Pierce be a big plus and a new fan
darling? My guess is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Would Rick Pitino have whoever he'd have in uniform playing
tough, gritty basketball? Oh, absolutely. But would they be any
closer to real contention than they were last year? Nope. Would we
spend a disproportionate amount of our time reminiscing about the
Good Old Days and feeling completely sorry for ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   Whaddya think?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
PATRIOTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm surprised someone hasn't trotted out the old joke about a
guy being capable of (naughty wording)-up a one-car funeral and
applying it to Bob Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   First he harasses football's best coach out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Then he moves the team.
</P>
<P>
   He and No. 1 Son Jonathan seem oblivious to the fact that they
are planning a move to foreign territory, not simply moving into a
new house down the street. This is no value judgment on Hartford
and the state of Connecticut; it's a statement of fact. The closer
it gets to the actual moving day, the more Mr. Kraft will be
reviled hereabouts. He's got Tom Finneran as a punching bag now,
but three years from now that business will have died down, and
Kraft will be regarded as the man who ripped the team out of
Boston, Mass. Period.
</P>
<P>
   His team is in decline. It is no longer a Super Bowl threat, and
things will get worse in the division as Indianapolis and Miami
improve. By the time it really does move out of here, it could be
one of those forgettable 4-12 outfits, and that might even help
Kraft in a perverse way since by then people will be saying, ``bon
voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   The question du jour is whether or not Pete Carroll is the kind
of coach who can get you to the so-called ``next level,'' and this
is not exactly a brain teaser. Regrettably, the answer is no. The
problem is that Kraft has both a financial and emotional commitment
to the Anti-Tuna, whom he gifted with a five-year contract that was
a textbook overreaction to the entire Parcells episode.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have had major injury troubles, as we all know, but
that has nothing to do with the spectacle we witnessed last Sunday
in the Meadowlands. Players always have to be held accountable for
their actions, but when you see something like that, it tells you
there is more to the story. Something is fundamentally amiss.
</P>
<P>
   They might even beat similarly battered Jacksonville, but then
they head to Denver. Are you actually looking forward to that?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
RED SOX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, they finally won a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dan Duquette assures us that by signing Jose
Offerman he has replaced Mo Vaughn's ``on-base capability,'' as if
ol' No. 42 were Chuck Knoblauch or somebody. Nor should we forget
Mark Portugal, and please remember to light a daily candle so he
stays healthy enough to make 25 starts.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to Mike Stanley and Reggie Jefferson, but the idea
that one of them will be the Opening Day No. 3 or 4 hitter is
preposterous. Nomar Garciaparra will have to acquire patience,
which, up to now, has been an abstract concept for him. He will
miss Mo terribly.
</P>
<P>
   But you already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   One last Mo thought: He was not coming back once he became a
free agent, but it never should have come to that. I think Messrs.
Harrington and Duquette were never worried because they truly
believed they'd sign someone to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   So what else do you want to know? Dan Duquette still doesn't
believe the game is played by people. John Harrington is being
slowly revealed to be a very fortunate man who is in over his head
trying to run this baseball team. That pathetic whining on TV about
this being the ``silly season'' and the Red Sox being subjected to
unfair scrutiny for ``50 or 60 years'' is very interesting. If he
believes that, he's stupid. If he is merely trying to shoot the
messenger after he is caught doing something asinine, he is
devious. Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   If you still care about the franchise, know this much. You are
not in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
REVOLUTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What, am I going to lie? Am I going to pretend I go to games or
can name five players on the team?
</P>
<P>
   All I know is that this is one of the most solid franchises in
the league. They attract fans. I am also wondering, as an aside,
why Thomas Rongen could have been so successful elsewhere and so
unsuccessful here that he couldn't even finish the season.
</P>
<P>
   There is a place in the great American sporting smorgasbord for
soccer. It won't be the place it has in Europe, South America,
Asia, Africa, and the southern part of this continent, but the
sport will continue to thrive, and it looks as if there's always
going to be a team around here, at least until Mr. Speakah finds
out that Bob Kraft owns this one, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for General Winter, and the stillness that for a few
frozen months, at least, was supposed to lie across the tormented
land of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, when Christians fight Muslims across the
snowy hillsides of the southern Balkans, not even Christmas can
halt the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   British and German troops may once have respected a truce of
sorts in the trenches of Flanders, but in 1998, when Serbs and
ethnic Albanians are in the field, Christmas Eve is when
cease-fires collapse. And not only cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important casualty of the violent Christmas
weekend is the old notion of how this dirty war might be ended.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed until now, over the past few weeks, its contours have
subtly shifted. Previously there was no argument about the villain
of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   This was Slobodan Milosevic's war. He had started it back in
1989 (and with it the entire Balkan tragedy that would follow) by
scrapping the autonomy Kosovo and its overwhelming Albanian
majority had previously enjoyed, and even now, he retains the prime
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   His savage, utterly disproportionate crackdown on the ethnic
Albanians last spring set the stage for a summer of fighting which
would make refugees of a quarter of a million people, pit Russia
against the West and ultimately have B-52s waiting, engines
revving, on British airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the October cease-fire agreement, providing for
Serbian withdrawal, the start of political negotiations, and the
dispatch of 2,000 unarmed international observers to make sure
everyone kept their word.
</P>
<P>
   This time however, no matter how much you detest the regime in
Belgrade, matters are not so simple. The Kosovo Liberation Army is
at least as much to blame for the collapse of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Serbs are overreacting: is a column of tanks
really required to avenge the death of a single policeman? But the
KLA, too, is spoiling for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   It has acquired new arms, above all anti-tank weapons to nullify
the most potent asset of the Serb forces, and shows absolutely no
interest in the political talks which are supposed to start next
month. Bomb Milosevic, says the heart. But this time the head
resists.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, and despite every vow made by Western foreign
ministers at meetings without number, Kosovo looks more like Bosnia
with every passing day.
</P>
<P>
   The killing, admittedly, is nowhere near on the same scale. But
even before half of them have even taken up their stations, the
OSCE monitors are acquiring an uncanny resemblance to the unhappy
men of UNPROFOR earlier in the decade, the Bosnian ``peacekeepers''
with no peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday OSCE teams were sent to the village of Obranca, focal
point of the latest fighting. How long, one wonders, before some of
their number are taken hostage, or killed in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   So what next? Conceivably, of course, this being the season of
hope, good will, and irrational optimism, events might yet get us
off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, after a decade of slaughter and barbarity, 1999 will
prove to be the final year of this most terrible of the 20th
century's Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year will at last see the demise of the Milosevic
regime, brought down peaceably from within by the economic misery
and international obloquy it has inflicted upon the Serbian nation.
Maybe its successor will be more sensible and less nationalist,
open to a reasonable accommodation with the Kosovan Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too, sweet reason will also descend on the shoulders of
these latter, despite the atrocities and humiliations heaped upon
them by Belgrade. And then again, 1999 may be when Saddam Hussein
makes a state visit to Washington. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In practical terms, the West faces the dilemma of dealing with a
conflict in which the middle ground of political negotiation,
freely entered into by both parties, is now scorched earth.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, we cannot let the two sides simply fight it out. In the
short term, this would probably lead to another cycle of Serbian
repression, horrific media pictures and public clamor forcing
Western governments to intervene in much haste, but to little
lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if crackdown is unacceptable, so too _ at least for now _ is
an independent Kosovo, which the Western chancelleries argue might
tear Macedonia apart. For even autocrats cannot ignore the body bag
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, the cost of enforcing control could prove too
high even for the Serbs, and the Albanians who outnumber them nine
to one in Kosovo would have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the spectre of an inchoate ``Greater Albania,'' which would
further destabilize an already unstable region and perhaps drag
Greece, Bulgaria and, worst of all, Turkey, into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, I have reluctantly come to believe, mono-ethnic
states of this kind are the only bricks with which to build the new
Balkans. Right now, however, there is barely a smaller Albania, let
alone a greater one.
</P>
<P>
   But this violent Christmas has at least one merit: it has laid
bare the harsh and central truth about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is adjudged the best solution _ whether to defy Balkan
logic and attempt to maintain an ethnically-mixed Kosovo somehow
linked to Serbia, or to lay the ground for a new Albanian political
entity in the southern Balkans _ only a credible Western military
presence will allow it to be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   And we are not talking about unarmed observers, monitors or
``verifiers,'' but ground troops with all the hardware they need,
in Kosovo for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, in short, will have to become another Bosnia. Not, we
must ensure, in the sense of the brutality and slaughter which
preceded the settlement imposed by the Americans at Dayton, but in
becoming a de facto Western protectorate as Bosnia now is,
installed under the guise of another Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, of course, the instigators of this accord would be
European statesmen, and the troops who make it stick should be
European troops. But Kosovo has come too soon for Europe, whatever
the agreement on a future European defense identity between Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
   The prime mover will have to be NATO, in other words the
Americans. The United States will not like it, no more than it
liked the prospect of its ground troops committed to Bosnia _ and
perhaps even less, for in Bosnia a presence which was originally
meant to last six months has now become open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. and its allies to meet some predetermined
artificial deadline to withdraw, Washington knows full well, would
simply invite disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And so in Kosovo too. But a permanent military presence there
would almost certainly prove as effective as it has in Bosnia, with
remarkably little loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   It would guarantee the essentials: the Kosovo Albanians would be
freed from the threat of Serbian oppression and violence; the Serbs
would be assured of access to their holy sites, political and
religious.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it would buy time, to wait out Slobodan Milosevic. &QL;

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Lidia Bastianich is cooking Sunday lunch in
Julia Child's kitchen and it's hard to tell which of the women is
more excited. Bastianich, the New York restaurateur, pulls a tray
of luscious-looking meat on the bone from the venerable Garland
range in the famous kitchen. ``This is stinco,'' she announces. And
pauses.
</P>
<P>
   Since starring in her own cooking show, Bastianich has perfected
her timing. As it turns out, stinco means shank in northeastern
Italy, where Bastianich was born. She arranges five veal shanks,
bone end up, on one of Julia Child's platters, and fills the center
with fresh herbs. ``Stinco,'' repeats Child in a breathless voice
and it's hard for the guests to stifle giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Lidia Matticchio Bastianich has been invited here because Child
admires her. ``Lidia is a wonderful cook,'' she says. The ``French
Chef'' likes the way the Italian chef handles food _ and people.
Bastianich is the co-owner of three New York restaurants _ Felidia,
Becco, and Frico Bar _ all given high ratings for cuisine and
friendliness in the Zagat Survey. ``Lidia's Italian Table,'' a
26-part public television series, will begin airing Jan. 9 at 9
a.m. on PBS. A companion book, ``Lidia's Italian Table'' (William
Morrow), was published earlier this year. With the release of the
series, another serious food show is born.
</P>
<P>
   The host is an unlikely TV star. Large-framed and dressed in
outmoded flowery prints, Bastianich works in her own Douglaston,
N.Y., kitchen, which is overrun with fresh flowers and overloaded
with food. It's gaudy. At first glance, it seems that this show
couldn't possibly work. Until you watch it for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bastianich is all charm, her food is an appealing step up from
peasant farmhouse kitchen, and she's a knowledgeable teacher,
completely natural on the air. The dishes she makes, she explains,
were all cooked in ``real time.'' That means a half dozen veal
shanks weren't waiting off-camera to be presented in various stages
of doneness.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Geoffrey Drummond of A La Carte Communications, who
worked on the Master Chef series with Julia Child _ and met
Bastianich on a segment with Child _ stopped filming when the crew
needed to wait for the food. It never worked the other way round,
which means the food is as beautiful and appetizing as if it were
pulled from your own stove.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the air, Bastianich pulls the stinco from the oven and it has
a voluptuous quality. The show has all the sizzle sounds of a
professional kitchen, billows of smoke from browning meat, and no
jabber. Bastianich talks when she has something to say and you see
her big capable hands scoop up vegetables, fly down the length of a
carrot with her chef's knife, and whisk pan juices into a dark,
syrupy, meaty sauce.
</P>
<P>
   This is hearty fare, ``not what people expect Italian food to
be,'' says Alan Richman, restaurant critic of GQ magazine. ``This
food was made for the great red wines of Italy. It is so rich, so
full of flavor. It's the most amazing food.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastianich, 52, is cooking from old family recipes used by her
mother and grandmother. In Italy, her grandmother ran an osteria,
an informal restaurant, in the courtyard outside their house. When
it rained, the tables and chairs were moved into the wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made their own olive oil,'' Bastianich says, ``and I can
still smell the oil. We used it with our own bread. We made our own
wine. They distilled their own grappa.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this took place on the peninsula of Istria, which juts
out into the Adriatic Sea. At one time a part of Italy, it was
seized by Yugoslavia after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Istria turned Communist and Bastianich's parents fled with her
and a brother to Trieste, which was close to the border but on the
Italian side. ``We spent two years in a refugee camp,'' she says.
``Let me tell you, it was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 12 when her family arrived in New York. ``I found Wonder
Bread, this bread that would squeeze,'' she says. She also
discovered grapefruit, peanut butter, tapioca, Jell-O, Duncan Hines
cake mixes, baked beans, and frozen peas, all of which delighted
her. ``I became acclimated to American life within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastianich met her husband, Felice, at her 16th birthday party.
Another emigre from Istria, he was hired to play the accordion for
her guests. By the time they married, both were interested in food.
Their first two restaurants were in Queens, where they lived. In
1981, they opened Felidia in Manhattan. Becco and Frico Bar were
launched by her son, Joseph, who had announced to her that ``we
need something else.'' She sent him to Italy. ``Go out and have a
look and bring me a proposal,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she says, ``it's very rewarding to share it with the
children.'' Her mother, Erminia, 77, lives with her and works at
Felidia every morning.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, her son and David Wagner, who had worked for
Castello Banfi wines (one of the show's sponsors), opened Lidia's
Kansas City, in Missouri. ``I didn't change my style,'' she says.
``I just brought what I do. It's the same thing for the camera.''
The lines to get into the Kansas City restaurant are long.
</P>
<P>
   Customers wouldn't be happy if she changed her style. ``She's an
institution,'' says GQ's Richman.
</P>
<P>
   Bastianich spends most of her time cooking with her staff,
teaching them. ``On a daily basis, I visit the other restaurants.
One of the greatest thrills is working with different young
people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say she teaches ``mamma cucina.'' Certainly, one of
the reasons for her television success is that she comes across as
everyone's mother. ``Viewers call in and want to know where to buy
her flowered dresses,'' says producer Drummond.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bastianich says she was embarrassed to see herself on the
screen. But watching the daily clips, ``I felt very good about
them. I touched on the things I wanted to do: I did a lot of
technique, told a lot of stories, and got my family in there. It
was sort of like recording a biography for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The series has already begun in other markets around the
country, and Bastianich says the mail is pouring in. ``I already
know what they like about it and it's really moving _ it's the
straightforwardness. They love the way the food looked. They
related to the stories,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And the stories are endearing. On the stinco show, she tells
about an aunt who took her to the market every day. The aunt had
jet-black hair, pulled into a thick braid that was twisted up into
a kind of bun. With big earrings and ``white skin that looked like
a peach,'' she charged through the marketplace at Trieste with her
little niece in tow. ``She was a chef to wealthy families.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes on, and so does the cooking. She interrupts
herself to teach the viewer how to make the veal shanks a deep
golden brown. ``Take some of the sauce and take some honey and mix
them well. Baste the meat with it for the last 10 to 15 minutes of
cooking. That's how you get a mahogany color.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the veal shanks emerge from the oven looking
extraordinarily dark and shiny. Bastianich continues with her story
about the market, about women who were ``like sirens luring you to
come by.''
</P>
<P>
   But she, too, lures the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Richman isn't surprised by Bastianich's wide appeal. ``The key
to being successful on TV is for people to be comfortable. And how
can you not be comfortable with her?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so warm, so caring, so giving. She makes Emeril
(Lagasse) look like a snob.''

SAMPLING OF DISHES FROM `LIDIA'S ITALIAN TABLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These recipes are adapted from ``Lidia's Italian Table,'' by
Lidia Matticchio Bastianich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTASIO CHEESE CRISP &QL; 
(Frico di Montasio) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The frico gets quite crisp when it cools to room temperature.
Fricos can be served unfilled as an hors d'oeuvre. Traditionally,
they are filled with potatoes and onions. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Montasio cheese, rind removed and coarsely shredded
(about 2 1/2 loosely packed cups)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place a 4- to 5-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and
heat until a shred of the cheese begins to sizzle 2 to 3 seconds
after it hits the pan. Scatter a quarter of the cheese in an even
layer over the bottom of the skillet. Cook without disturbing it or
moving the pan until the fat that separates from the cheese begins
to bubble around the edges, about 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, shake the skillet gently to free the cheese crisp
from the bottom of the pan. If it sticks, let it cook for 1 or 2
minutes more, then try again. If the crisp is still sticking in
places, carefully work a heatproof rubber spatula underneath to
free it. After 6 to 7 minutes of total cooking time, the underside
of the crisp should be an even golden brown and the crisp should
slide very easily in the pan. Slide the crisp onto a small plate,
then invert it back into the skillet. Cook the other side as you
did the first.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the crisp out onto a baking sheet and keep it warm in the
oven while cooking the remaining fricos. Pat the fricos with paper
towels before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 crisps. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED VEAL SHANKS &QL; 
(Stinco di Vitello Arrosto) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When brought to the table, bone and all, this dish makes an
impressive presentation. The bones should be left at the table for
your guests to pick on _ the gelatin that has caramelized is a
special treat. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 whole veal shanks (3 to 3 1/2 pounds each)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large carrot, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 fresh sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 cups meat stock, chicken stock, or canned low-sodium chicken
broth
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Pat the shanks dry with paper towels and season them generously
with salt and pepper. In a flameproof roasting pan large enough to
hold the shanks comfortably, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil over
medium heat, using two burners if necessary. Cook the shanks,
turning often, until well browned on all sides, about 12 minutes.
Transfer the roasting pan to the oven and roast for 30 minutes,
turning the shanks occasionally with a pair of sturdy tongs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons
of olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrot, onion, garlic,
rosemary, and sage, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook
until the vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tilt the roasting pan and spoon off the excess fat. Add the
sauteed vegetable mixture and pour in the wine and 2 cups of the
stock. Return the pan to the oven and roast, turning and basting
the shanks occasionally, until the meat is very tender and its
surface nicely caramelized, about 2 hours. Add some or all of the
remaining stock as needed to prevent the vegetables from drying
out.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the shanks from the pan. Strain the contents of the pan
into a bowl. With a wooden spoon or ladle, mash the vegetables in a
sieve and force as much of them as possible through the sieve.
(Alternatively, you may pass the vegetables and liquid through a
food mill fitted with the fine disk.) Skim all the fat from the
surface of the liquid. Return the shanks and liquid to the pan.
Roast, basting the meat with the sauce occasionally, until the
sauce is syrupy and forms a rich glaze on the meat, 10 to 15
minutes. There should be about 3/4 cup of sauce.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, hold each shank by the bone with a kitchen towel and,
with a carving knife, cut 1/4-inch-thick slices parallel to the
bone, turning the bone until all the meat is removed. Arrange the
slices on a platter and drizzle the sauce over them.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWISS CHARD AND POTATOES &QL; 
(Bietola e Patate) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of this dish improves when it is made ahead and
reheated. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds Swiss chard
</P>
<P>
   4 quarts salted water
</P>
<P>
   3 medium Idaho (baking) potatoes, peeled and each cut crosswise
into 4 pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trim the ends from the Swiss chard stems. Cut off and discard
any wilted or yellow parts of the leaves. Strip the stems from the
leaves and cut the stems into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut the leaves
lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Wash
the leaves and stems thoroughly, then drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Boil the salted water in a large pot. Add the potatoes and cook
for 10 minutes. Add the Swiss chard and cook until the potatoes and
chard stems are very tender, another 20 to 30 minutes. Drain in a
colander.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over
medium heat. Add the garlic and cook just until it begins to brown,
about 1 minute. Add the drained Swiss chard and potatoes, and
season them lightly with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring and
mashing the potatoes, until the liquid has evaporated and the
potatoes are coarsely mashed. If the potatoes begin to brown,
reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of
olive oil, season to taste with salt and pepper, stir, and serve
hot.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

THEOLOGY PROFESSOR FINDS DEEPER MEANING IN STAR TREK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ With a doctorate in theology and a collection of
137 Star Trek action figures, Lois Daly was probably destined to
teach a course called ``Star Trek and Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   An unusual combination, perhaps. But not illogical, as Spock
would say.
</P>
<P>
   This semester, students at Siena College learned what fans of
the show have known for years _ that underneath the tight uniforms
and campy dialogue lies a serious examination of major themes,
including religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to do was teach students to take religion
seriously,'' says Daly, 41, the college's dean of arts. ``Pop
culture is one way of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   From her most un-deanlike of dean's offices, Daly glances at her
collection of figures and explains that metaphysics plays a natural
role in a show that explores ``the final frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The class is about opening up what religion means in the late
20th century,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's class, which alternates video sessions with readings in
theology, is one of several around the nation exploring the deeper
implications of the popular TV show.
</P>
<P>
   An Indiana University course examined the show's links to
religion, and the University of California in Harrisburg, Pa.,
recently provided the unusual offering ``Star Trek and Modern
Man.'' With the release of the hit movie ``Insurrection,'' ``Star
Trek'' is more popular than ever. Books probe the biology, physics,
even management techniques of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Trek' does things that `E.R.,' `N.Y.P.D. Blue' and `Law
&AMP; Order' couldn't possibly deal with,'' says student Harry Chauss,
a recent Siena graduate from Round Lake who majored in religious
studies. ``In a kind of heartfelt way, it discusses how people
should behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics should tune in to ``Rightful Heir,'' an episode from
``Star Trek: the Next Generation'' that poses an interesting
question for Christians: What would happen if the prophesized
Second Coming of Christ actually occurred?
</P>
<P>
   As the episode begins, Worf, the Enterprise's hawkish security
chief, is beginning to doubt the ancient stories about Kahless, the
warrior hero at the center of Klingon myth. Worf finds he can no
longer tell the old tales and seeks solitude in a place where
legend says Kahless will one day return.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, someone appears. This is the distant future, so
Worf doesn't have to rely on faith; he performs a DNA test. The
result: It's Kahless, in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the Klingon powers-that-be dismiss the being.
Worf's belief is nonetheless restored, even after he learns, in a
bizarre twist, that the would-be Kahless is a clone. The episode is
about faith and whether physical evidence is necessary to sustain
that faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter that he's a clone,'' Daly tells the
class one night in early December. ``It's the message that
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly came to ``Star Trek'' late in life. Scared off at age nine
by an episode involving a giant monster, Daly didn't grow up
repeating catch phrases like, ``Beam me up, Scotty,'' or, ``Set
phasers on stun.'' She got hooked when she went to college in rural
Indiana, where television picked up stations from several nearby
cities and she could watch up to three episodes a day.
</P>
<P>
   She became fascinated with what she calls the show's ``cultural
refraction'' _ the way it mirrors present-day conflicts and
prejudices. Her collection of action figures from the show's four
television versions and nine movies became a natural adjunct to
that fascination. She believes one figure _ Tasha Yar of the ``Next
Generation,'' cut from the show early _ is rare and worth a lot of
money, but she isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the way they look,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, the class is no walk on the Holodeck. Daly's
students are required to read dense theological tracts, including
the works of prominent skeptics like Freud and Marx. Though a
handful criticized its nontraditional approach (one student, in a
class evaluation, wished for ``more respect for established
religion'') most seemed to welcome the fresh look at familiar
material. One student said the course gave her a new appreciation
for religion.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FITCHBURG, Mass. _ John Kelly, the man standing in the middle of
the gym, is a one-man soundtrack. A booming soundtrack. He wears a
sweatsuit and has a whistle draped around his neck. What nerve.
Kelly is a basketball coach who certainly doesn't need a whistle to
get anyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   He opens his mouth to begin a Notre Dame Prep practice and,
soon, the rest of his face is crimson. If he were your neighbor at
this moment, you'd either cover your ears or ask him to close his
mouth. Some of his players might like to do the same thing. That
way, they wouldn't have to keep their hands up on defense, as he is
now telling them to do. And they wouldn't have to participate in a
drill that requires them to hop _ on their tiptoes _ along the
sidelines and baselines, a drill that has several young men rubbing
their burning calf muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Modibo Diarra, a 6-foot-10-inch center, does all the drills
without rubbing his calves. He does not ask for a break. He
remembers the soccer games he used to play back home in Segou,
Mali, so he doesn't mind the sprints. And his journey here just
over a year ago was enough to teach him about all the things Kelly
demands of the young men who will play ball for Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Toughness? You tend to learn what that is when you and two
friends have limited resources and have to get from Mali to a
neighboring country, Guinea, just for a chance to play basketball
in the United States. When you can take a shaky transportation
system, you do. When you can't, you walk.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Guinea, you learn about patience when months and months
of calling embassies does not produce a visa. Once the visa comes,
you learn about the resiliency of your spirit because one of your
friends, a 6-8 basketball player named Solomon with dreams similar
to yours, does not make it to the US; he contracts malaria and dies
before ever playing basketball here.
</P>
<P>
   And you. You are 18 years old and come from a historic land
known for Timbuktu and Songhai kings. But most of your country is
poor and your family _ your father, two mothers, and 13 brothers
and sisters _ is poor. Health care is not good at home, and once
you arrive in America, you also are diagnosed with malaria.
Initially, you weigh 200 pounds and your eyes are bloodshot. You
speak your native language and French, but at the time of your
arrival the only English you know is ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the reality lesson. Who can teach you about that
better than you? Your father is retired. Like you, he is a Muslim,
so no one at home thinks it strange that he has two wives. And no
one finds it strange that among the man and his wives money is not
plentiful. So one day you see a coach from the United States who
talks to you about playing in America, playing for a man from
Leominster named John Kelly. You focus on that. You focus on it
because you love basketball. You focus on it because you love your
parents and say, ``I don't play basketball for me. I play for my
parents. I don't have money now. But one day I will and I'll give
it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your hands up on defense,'' you hear Kelly yell. ``Work!
Work! Work!''
</P>
<P>
   It is work. It makes you sweat. But it's nothing you can't
handle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The look of a jewel
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After pausing to think about Diarra's story one more time, Scott
Spinelli says, ``If you were to take kids from America to Africa
and show them the type of environment where 'Dibo played
basketball, I think they would be a lot more appreciative of what
they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinelli, also from Leominster, is an assistant basketball coach
at American University in Washington. He used to be the head coach
at Winchendon, where Kelly was his assistant. Spinelli's game is
recruiting and, as he said, ``Every assistant from the smaller
colleges is looking to find that jewel of a recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA rules prohibit him from saying that Diarra, a Notre Dame
junior, is that jewel. But that fact is obvious from the box that
Diarra keeps near a wooden dresser in his room. Diarra recently
removed the box and carried it to the Notre Dame cafeteria. Once
there he spilled its contents onto a table: The table was quickly
littered with letters from eager college recruiters. Many of the
recruiters saw Diarra at a Sonny Hill tournament last summer in
Philadelphia. Diarra was the tourney's MVP, the first junior to
gain that honor. Leo Papile, the Celtics' head scout, compared
Diarra to a young Bill Russell. ``And you know, as the head scout
of an NBA team, I'm not going to throw praise around like that
lightly,'' said Papile, who has nicknamed Diarra ``Good Man''
because of his easy demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   It was that demeanor that attracted Spinelli early in 1997. The
coach had developed international contacts while recruiting a
forward from Mali named Saliou-Benet Telly, now a sophomore at
American. Those were the days when Spinelli would call AT&AMP;T and
request a translator who could communicate with prospective players
in West Africa. Spinelli went to Africa again in '97, trying to
persuade a 7-2 center from Mali to come to America. The player
opted for pro ball in Slovenia. So a dejected Spinelli took a trip
to the basketball courts in Mali, planning to watch a pickup game
to ease his mind.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he saw a young man whose facial features reminded
him of Golden State Warrior Adonal Foyle. No one knew his name. All
they knew was that he was easily dunking on everybody and blocking
nearly every shot that went in the air. But this was far from
polished basketball. Many of the players wore sandals on the court.
Others were barefoot. And, admittedly, Diarra had been playing the
game for only a couple years. He could pick it up quickly; the
problem would be getting to the States. He would be a perfect fit
for the program Spinelli's friend, Kelly, was starting at Notre
Dame. But authorities determined that Diarra's visa would have to
come from Guinea, where he also has family, not Mali. All he knew
was that he would have to leave. Somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can play (pro basketball) in Africa,'' he said. ``You can
make some money. But not like in America. I like to play
basketball. I like to play defense and get rebounds. If I don't do
that, I don't want to talk to nobody. People ask me if I play for
the chance to make money. No. I play for the chance to help my
parents. The money is for them first and then me. I play for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Diarra did leave. He arrived here, mourned his
friend, was diagnosed with malaria himself, eventually put on 35
pounds, and then began to play basketball. Kelly and Notre Dame
athletic director Bill Barton pushed him hard early, but he didn't
mind. Kelly drilled him on postups, the importance of rebounding
and shot-blocking. Actually, he drilled them on shot blocking. ``At
times in practice, you learn that it's not a good idea to take the
ball to the hole on 'Dibo,'' said TeJay Anderson, a 6-5 Notre Dame
forward who is also Diarra's roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Barton became one of his English tutors. That has worked out for
Diarra, too, because he was able to give a 20-minute interview
without help from a translator. His understanding of written
English is still at a grade-school level, but his comprehension of
the spoken word is unusually high. So much so that he now says his
two favorite subjects at Notre Dame _ a 90-student school about 30
miles north of Boston _ are math and English. He also has mastered
American pop culture. When a public phone rang in his residence
hall, he quickly picked it up and tried to figure out who was
calling whom and what their intentions were. He loves playing a
video game called ``Resident Evil'' and he likes to sing along with
a rapper named Jay-Z, who sampled parts of the musical ``Annie''
and put them into a song called ``Hard Knock Life.'' He likes Karl
Malone because ``he has nice moves and he runs a lot. I like to
run, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a 17-year-old from Dorchester, said that sometimes he
likes Diarra to teach him some things. So sometimes they listen to
his music from Mali because ``the drumbeats help me think.'' Music
is not the only thing Diarra knows. He said he likes many things
about America, but the common approach of parent-child is not one
of them. He believes in total submission to his parents. For life.
That is why he is here, ``trying to make things a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA will have room for Diarra one day. There are not many
6-10 centers at any level of basketball, and not many who enjoy
rebounding, blocking shots, and defending, excess points be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly will have one of his practices again soon. He will raise
his voice. He will demand excellence. He will make his team run.
Some players will grumble that the coach is pushing too much.
Diarra will not be one of them. He will practice. Then he will
sweat. And then he'll write a letter to his parents.

FASTPITCH _ BUT NOT BY NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's in a name? For the first time, softball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some market research and a lot of people didn't know
the name fastpitch,'' said John Carroll, commissioner and CEO of
the league called, until this month, simply Women's Pro Fastpitch.
``Fastpitch is the style of play. We went back to identifying it
with just the basic game.''
</P>
<P>
   So, on Dec. 5, the league announced it has a new name: the
Women's Pro Softball League.
</P>
<P>
   There are other changes as the six-team league, which started on
the heels of the US women's gold medal in the 1996 Olympics, heads
toward its third season trying to build name recognition outside
the Southeast. The Durham (N.C.) Dragons, Carolina Diamonds
(Gastonia, N.C.), Georgia Pride (Columbus, Ga.), Virginia Roadsters
(Hampton, Va.), and Tampa Bay Firestix will remain, while the
Orlando franchise has folded and been replaced by one in Akron,
Ohio, giving the league a Midwest presence for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is really fervent in the Midwest,'' said Carroll,
whose plan is for the league to grow to 18 teams in the next five
years. Although Carroll grew up in Quincy, he won't commit to
expanding into New England without a further look at the interest
level in the region. Andrea D'Innocenzo is one of the few players
in the league with ties to the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Another new twist is the ability, as of Friday, for national and
Olympic team members to play in the league without losing their
Olympic eligibility. Asked if there is a chance any of the 1996
gold medalists will sign on, Carroll said: ``Absolutely. We're
having discussions with several of them right now.'' No one doubts
that a few marquee names from the Atlanta Olympics would likely
increase the league's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time, coaches will be employed full-time,
year-round, relocating to their team's market and assuming
responsibilities for increasing community support.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, eight games were shown on ESPN2 on Monday nights.
Carroll said he hopes for a few more in 1999, and said the
combination of steady national television exposure and solid
backing (AT&AMP;T Wireless Services has renewed its title sponsorship)
should keep the league from going the way of the late American
Basketball League. ``They truly were trying to do something
outstanding for women,'' said Carroll. ``But if you do not have a
television ingredient, you do not have a dimension the national
sponsorships need to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The league will begin its 66-game regular season on May 13.

D'INNOCENZO PUTS LIFE INTO PRO SOFTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ It was just a goofy little game in their
backyard, a 3-year-old brandishing a Wiffle bat as her father
gently sailed the ball toward it. Suddenly, the ball was in the
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Little Andrea had hit it over the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at my wife and said, `well, that's her sport,' '' Len
D'Innocenzo says.
</P>
<P>
   How right he was. When Andrea, now 25, returned home from North
Carolina for the holidays, she brought with her a .284 batting
average, .415 slugging percentage, and 25 RBIs in 50 hits for the
Durham Dragons, one of six teams in the Women's Pro Softball
League, which plays mostly in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   And she could stay only a few days, because she also brought
something else: the title of Player/Account Executive, keeping her
busy year-round and guaranteeing that her impact on the
two-year-old league will not end each season when her uniform is
laundered for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in September, the WPSL All-Star and former standout at
the University of Connecticut began directing the Dragons'
fastpitch instruction program of community workshops, coaches'
clinics, and one-on-one instruction. And when she isn't helping a
Durham youngster improve her batting stance, she puts on a third
cap as an energetic member of the Dragons sales force.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who never expected to play pro softball _ there was
no pro softball until two years after her playing days at UConn had
ended _ D'Innocenzo has become immersed in every facet of the game,
becoming one of the few players in the league to live year-round in
her team's community and among the first to work for the league in
the offseason. This she knows: While softball may be fun, akin to a
Christmas gift she gets to unwrap again and again, it's not just a
goofy little game anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a more active role,'' she said. ``If this
league doesn't take off, what am I going to do? I want to play
softball. Yeah, I could go find another job in the business world,
but I want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dena Lambert, general manager of the Dragons, is glad she does.
``She was the best one for the job,'' Lambert said. ``People just
really like Andrea. People just enjoy her. She's a great asset.''
</P>
<P>
   If the league has its way, she won't be the last player to
establish herself in the front office during the long offseason.
``We want to provide more year-round opportunities for the women so
they can think of this as a true career, and not just a part-time
fill-in for the summer months,'' said John Carroll, commissioner
and CEO of the league. ``The No. 1 mission is to develop a career
opportunity for these women, and that could mean beyond their
playing days.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her father's stature as a top sales consultant and
co-author of ``The Agile Manager's Guide to Customer-Focused
Selling,'' D'Innocenzo's eight-months-a-year career in sales and
marketing is less surprising than her other four months as a
professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   From tee-ball to Little League baseball in Sudbury to her high
school softball team in Ohio to a career at UConn that saw the
two-time All-American play in the College World Series in 1993 and
be chosen Big East Conference Player of the Year in 1995,
D'Innocenzo's attitude was serious enough on the field but notably
casual when she came off. If a scholarship came her way, fine. If
not, whatever. If she had to miss every summer hanging with her
friends back at the beach house in Humarock to go to endless camps
just to get noticed, well, no thanks. When she did finally forego
some tan time in favor of a couple of summer camps, she was quickly
snatched by UConn only to strike out three times in her first
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember crying to my father, these girls are so much better
than me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't last long, but even when she got a letter in 1993
asking her to try out for the 1996 Olympic team, she hardly jumped
at the chance. ``I didn't think much of it because I knew I
wouldn't make it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, though, she quit ignoring her mail. That's when she got
a letter from the fledgling women's pro league, explaining what
they were up to and asking if she would be interested in entering
the draft pool. Yes, she wrote back. Despite 12-hour bus rides,
flat tires, broken air conditioners (``Outside in Tampa was cooler
than inside that bus'') _ the growing pains of a new league and
meal money that doesn't allow for many meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is with a startup,'' she said. ``They do the
best they can with what they have. You hate it when you're doing
it, but then you laugh. We're doing all the grunt work so that the
athletes who follow can have it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to assure that the league lasts long enough for more
players to follow will be D'Innocenzo's mission until she picks up
a bat again on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident,'' she said, citing her upbringing.
``Everything I've learned, I've learned from my father. There are
people twice my age still learning things that he taught me. I've
read his book twice, just because I want to make sure I have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sequel should be on Wiffle ball.

THE GRADUATION GAP BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (First of two parts.)
</P>
<P>
   When the Associated Press named Bill Snyder of Kansas State
University the 1998 college football coach of the year, he said he
was happy to be with a university with ``people who cared, who were
more than willing to help and who wanted to provide us with the
support necessary.'' He said, ``I appreciated the sincerity of
those people, and how important it was to them that Kansas State
football move in a different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Caring, support, and sincerity at Kansas State seems to apply
only to what happens on the football field. On the field, Kansas
State rose briefly to a No. 1 ranking before finishing as the AP's
fourth-ranked team in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Kansas State was No. 1 in a far more dubious
category. Kansas State graduates only 7 percent of African-American
players in annual statistics kept by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association. It was the worst rate among the 46 teams that
are either among the AP's Top 25 ranked major college teams or are
playing in this season's bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee finished the regular season as No. 1 on the field.
Coach Phillip Fulmer was second to Snyder for coach-of-the-year
honors. ``It's really been fullfilling from a program standpoint
and from a personal standpoint,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a lot of empty conversation if Fulmer talked
about his program from a graduation standpoint. Of the 46 teams,
Tennessee has the fourth lowest graduation rate for
African-American players. It graduated only 15 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Football News coach of the year was Houston Nutt of
Arkansas. He guided the 11th-ranked Razorbacks from mediocrity to a
major bowl berth in just his first season at the helm. He said the
season ``has been a dream come true for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Arkansas is a nightmare. Its 11 percent
graduation rate for African-American players is second only to
Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to my third-annual Graduation Gap Bowl, the bowl where
winning often comes with an abominable mockery of the phrase
``student-athlete.'' The 1998 NCAA Division 1 report is based on
the percentage of athletes who entered school between the 1988-89
year and the 1991-92 year and graduated within six years.
</P>
<P>
   This year's most embarrassing ``winners'' are Tennessee, Ohio
State, Kansas State, Florida, Texas A&AMP;M, and Arkansas. They
comprised six of the top 11 teams in the AP rankings. They were
also six of the worst 11 teams in graduating African-American
players.
</P>
<P>
   The plantation status of Tennessee, Ohio State, Kansas State,
and Florida is cemented by the fact that they have either shown no
improvement in their graduation rates or suffered declines.
Tennessee graduated 27 percent of African-American players in the
1996 and 1997 reports before falling to its current 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State graduated 29 percent in the '96 and '97 reports
before slipping to 27 percent. Kansas State was at seven percent in
all three reports. Florida graduated 31 percent of African-American
athletes in the '96 and '97 reports before falling to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Graduation Gap Bowl applauds colleges that win and graduate
players. But the applause is brief. Of the AP's top 12 teams, only
four, Florida State, UCLA, Wisconsin, and Tulane had team or
African-American graduation rates equal to or above the average for
Division 1. The graduation rates in Division 1 are 52 percent for
the entire team, 43 percent for African-American players and 61
percent for white players.
</P>
<P>
   The five highest graduation rates belong to 17th-ranked Notre
Dame (80 percent team, 79 percent African-American), 13th-ranked
Virginia (74 and 78), 22nd-ranked Penn State (74 and 76),
10th-ranked Tulane (74 and 71) and 14th-ranked Nebraska (66 and
64). Florida State, Tulane, Nebraska, Air Force, Oregon, Miami and
Mississippi State were schools that graduated at least 50 percent
of African-American players and had team averages equal to or above
that of the general student body.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the exploitation at the top outweighs any
exclamations. Twenty-one of the 46 teams had African-American
graduation rates of 38 percent and less. Tennessee's team
graduation rate of 27 percent is only half that of the general
student body. The 20 percent graduation rate for African-American
players at eighth-ranked Texas A&AMP;M is less than half of the 44
percent graduation rate for regular African-American students.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's African-American player graduation rate befits a
school that graduates only 14 percent of its regular
African-American students. When Kansas State lost the game that
cost it a chance to be No. 1, Snyder said, ``The greater the
investment, the greater the pain.'' In the classroom, the pain is
great at Kansas State because there is no investment at all.

POPE'S CUBA VISIT, CLINTON WOES AMONG TOP STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Religion, for good and for ill, continues to make a major mark
on our world. Here, in no particular order, is a purely subjective
listing of the year's top religion stories:
</P>
<P>
   Bringing hope to Cuba: As many as 1 million Cubans cheered Pope
John Paul II in Havana's Revolution Square as the pontiff made a
historic visit in January to one of the world's last Communist
strongholds. He called on Fidel Castro to give more freedom to
Cubans, while at the same time denouncing the US government's
economic embargo against the Caribbean island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The visit boosted the strength of the Cuban Catholic Church. One
tangible response: The Cuban government made it legal for
Christians to observe Christmas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Morality and the White House: The scandal that erupted over
President Clinton's sexual relationship with White House intern
Monica Lewinsky ignited a national debate on sin, forgiveness, and
redemption. Some religious leaders called on Clinton to resign for
the moral good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But other clergy said Clinton should stay in office and have the
opportunity to repent and rebuild his personal life through
prayerful reflection. Clinton called on three well-known ministers,
including the Rev. Gordon MacDonald of Lexington's Grace Chapel, to
serve as spiritual advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Church and state in conflict?: The contentious issue of
government support for religious schools continued to percolate. In
November, the US Supreme Court allowed Wisconsin to continue
providing financial help to poor students attending religious and
private schools in Milwaukee. The decision was expected to buoy
nationwide efforts to allow tax dollars to flow to religious
schools. Civil libertarians vowed to fight any such campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The proper role for women: The Southern Baptist Convention
outraged women's rights advocates at its annual meeting when it
voted that wives should ``submit graciously'' to their husbands.
Southern Baptist leaders claimed they were responding to the
breakdown of families. The move reflects the growing conservatism
of the nation's second largest Christian denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality and the church: A United Methodist church court
decided not to convict the Rev. Jimmy Creech, an Omaha minister
accused of violating church doctrine by performing a same-sex union
ceremony. The church later strengthened the prohibition against
same-sex marriages by making the doctrine a church canon. But, as
with so many other mainline Protestant denominations, the issue of
homosexuality promises to continue to divide Methodists.
</P>
<P>
   Religion and tolerance: The slaying in October of Matthew
Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten
and lashed to a wooden fence, provoked national outrage. Some
liberal religious activists blame the religious right for fostering
an antigay climate. Prior to Shepard's killing, the Family Research
Council, a conservative religious group, had placed newspaper ads
saying homosexuals can change their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust and the Roman Catholic Church: In March, the
Vatican released a long-awaited document expressing remorse for the
failure of some Christians to defend Jews against Nazi
annihilation, but denying that centuries of anti-Semitism within
the Roman Catholic Church had contributed to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The document was harshly criticized by many Jewish leaders for
failing to look at the roots of anti-Semitism in the church and for
defending the wartime pontiff, Pope Pius XII, whom many Jews
believed did not do enough to save Holocaust victims. Catholic
officials say the church will have more to say on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Breach of faith: The legal troubles of clergy continue to shake
the faith of the faithful. In Palm Beach, Fla., Roman Catholic
Bishop Keith Simons resigned after admitting to sexually abusing
boys early in his priesthood. In Dallas, a Catholic priest, the
Rev. Rudolph Kos, was sentenced to life in prison after being
convicted of sexully abusing boys.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the National Baptist
Convention U.S.A., the nation's largest African-American
denomination, was indicted on 56 charges in federal court in
Florida after being accused of diverting church funds for his
personal use. The denomination decided at its meeting to keep Lyons
as leader of the Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Faith and reason: In October, Pope John Paul II marked his 20th
year as pontiff by issuing, ``Fides et Raio'' (Faith and Reason), a
much-anticipated encyclical in which he warns of a growing divide
between modern thought and the ``ultimate truth'' of religions.
This division, the pope argued, is leading to ethical confusion and
a deep sense of cynicism. The pope appealed for a renewed
relationship between theology and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion and politics: For the first time, the US Roman Catholic
bishops jumped directly into the polarized national debate over
abortion, citing it as the the most important political issue of
the day. At their meeting in November, the bishops released a
document challenging Roman Catholic political leaders to abide by
the church's teachings on abortion.

<P>
   --More Americans are willing to open their wallets during the
holiday season, according to a survey on charitable giving
commissioned by Lutheran Brotherhood, a national organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll by Yankelovich Partners, 34 percent of Americans said
they give more money to charity during the holiday than any other
time of the year. Only 4 percent of the respondents said they
donate because they want to increase their tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charitable giving during the holidays comes from the heart _
not from the tax adviser,'' Todd Gillingham, Lutheran Brotherhood's
manager of individual planning, told reporters recently. ``People
seem to believe in the causes they give money to rather than
thinking, `What's in it for me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   About 86 percent of Americans give to charity. About half said
they give because they believe in an organization's mission, while
30 percent said they give because of an organization's religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Minneapolis, Lutheran Brotherhood offers health and
life insurance to Lutherans in the United States and also oversees
charitable programs. The poll was taken in October and has a margin
of error of 3 percent.

JONATHAN SPENCE'S WORKS ARE TALES, NOT JUST TEXTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Jonathan Spence comes to the door looking
slightly concerned. ``My dog is inside with my sister-in-law's
cat,'' he explains, looking over his shoulder. ``They've been known
to have cultural clashes.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, cultural clashes are Spence's stock in trade.
It's just that, in his experience, they tend to be between
civilizations, not species. As America's most celebrated China
scholar, Spence, 62, has spent more than three decades and a dozen
books making intellectual art out of the collision between East and
West.

   ``A great personage,'' James C. Thomson Jr., professsor emeritus
of East Asian studies at Boston University, calls Spence, whom he
likens to the Yale historian's fellow Englishman and Cambridge
University graduate, the actor-director-author Jonathan Miller.
``He's not as flamboyant,'' says Thomson, ``but he has the
extraordinary polymath mind and enthusiasm and taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant may be the last word one would use to describe
Spence. A man of low-key, insomniacal charm, he talks in murmury
viola tones. Four decades as an expatriate have made him a winning
amalgam of English politesse and American earnestness. Yet even at
his most reticent/sincere, Spence's eyes hint at merriment. Framed
by silvery beard and dark brows, they could belong to an Oxbridge
Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   On this sunny Friday, he and his wife, Annping Chin, have driven
up from New Haven with their miniature Schnauzer, Maddux (``named
for the Braves pitcher,'' Spence says), for a family gathering.
</P>
<P>
   It was a busy autumn. Despite a full docket of teaching and
administrative responsibilities at Yale, Spence managed to visit
China at the end of September (``I tend to go back every 18 months
or so''). He's writing about Mao Zedong for the new Penguin Lives
series of concise biographies. He also has a new book out. In both
its eclecticism and artfulness _ not to mention its colorful title
_ ``The Chan's Great Continent: China in Western Minds'' is classic
Spence. It ranges from Marco Polo to Franz Kafka, Voltaire to
Richard Nixon, to give an overview of how the Middle Kingdom has
captured the imagination of Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   Spence is a past winner of a MacArthur Foundation ``genius
grant'' and heads Yale's division of humanities. He also chairs its
East Asian studies department and, as Sterling professor of
history, holds one of the school's most prestigious chairs. ``He's
one of our university's real superstars _ in any field,'' says Yale
historian Gaddis Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his starry resume only hints at the singularity of Spence's
accomplishments. In such distinctive, almost novelistic books as
``The Death of Woman Wang'' (1978), ``The Memory Palace of Matteo
Ricci'' (1984), and ``God's Chinese Son'' (1996), he has
transformed the distant, exotic world of Qing Dynasty China into
something immediate and familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's best-known book, ``The Search for Modern China'' is his
least typical. Its sweeping narrative of 400 years of Chinese
history is far removed from the quirks and oddities he usually
prefers to dwell on and from which he manages to extract
astonishing lodes of fact and interpretation. ``I like the idea of
the small kernel containing a lot of truth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that Spence has more in common with Marcel Proust, his
fellow investigator in search of lost time, than he does with other
historians. If his work has a working definition, it's Spence's
description of ``Emperor of China,'' the 1974 ``autobiography'' he
assembled from documents written by the 17th-century Chinese ruler
Kangxi, ``an attempt to explore the power that memory has to
transcend time, an attempt to depict the events of a lifetime as
they can be reborn by a few moments of mental concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence's books are as much life studies and mood pieces as
histories in any standard sense of the term. In some ways, the
archetypal Spence book is the shortest, ``The Question of Hu''
(1988). What makes ``Hu'' emblematic is both the concern with
character conveyed by its punning title (the question of who?) and
its astonishing ability to immerse the reader in another world.
That world belongs to John Hu, a bewildered yet resolute
18th-century Catholic convert who, after becoming one of the first
Chinese to visit Europe, finds himself shut up for 2 1/2 years
outside Paris in an insane asylum.
</P>
<P>
   A novelist would be hard pressed to match such a creation, a
fact Spence acknowledges. ``I've been asked `Why not fiction?' I
don't have an answer, except I look for the kind of anchor history
provides me. Maybe there's a certain nervousness about imaginative
invention on my part. There's so much in terms of triggers from
history itself. . . . People say `atmospheric' about certain of my
books. I love reading about atmospheric things. In Taiping (which
Spence recently visited) I spent a lot of time finding out about
the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence's approach can be highly unorthdox (two of his books, for
example, are written in the present tense). This has gained him a
wide general following _ ``The Search for Modern China'' actually
made it onto The New York Times best-seller list _ but also limited
his influence within China studies. ``I'm not at all sure where I
stand in the field. I mean, I have a fine job at a glorious
university, but . . .'' his voice trails off. ``I know that what I
do upsets some people. They don't think things ought to be done
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   . Those who do think things ought to be done Spence's way are
lavish in their praise. Says Columbia University's Simon Schama,
``I'm just agog with admiration of his imaginative bravery.''
Schama's own field is European history, yet he assigns Spence's
work to his students. ``I teach it as literature rather than as
Chinese history,'' he explains. ``I always think of Jonathan Spence
when I read (the 19th-century British historian Thomas Babington)
Macaulay's line about `history should be burned into the
imagination as well as being received by the reason.' He is the
living embodiment of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence is consistently lauded for his books' writerliness. He
confesses to some bewilderment over this. ``I don't know what their
`literary aspects' are. I mean, I'm interested by trying to tell
the story as powerfully as possible. That may be a literary aspect.
I certainly care about every sentence, which I guess is a literary
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet listening to him speak, one might easily think Spence was a
poet or essayist. He sprinkles his conversation with references to
Wallace Stevens and Tennyson and talks with animation and affection
of the literary critic Harold Bloom, a close friend and Yale
colleague to whom ``The Chan's Great Continent'' is dedicated. The
writers he cites as models, Walter Pater and Lytton Strachey _
``for their economy and a certain stylistic ambition'' _ are as
much men of letters as historians.
</P>
<P>
   A literary career was Spence's original ambition. His pursuits
as a schoolboy and undergraduate had been literary. He edited the
Cambridge student newspaper, coedited the university literary
magazine, and did film and theater reviewing. Forty years later,
his voice warms as he describes what it was like as an
undergraduate to pick up a newspaper or magazine and read Kenneth
Tynan on theater, Cyril Connolly on books, or Francois Truffaut on
film. To the extent Spence thought about a postgraduate career, it
was in literary journalism. When he won a Mellon Fellowship in 1959
for two years of study at Yale, he had an offer to work as a
stringer for The Manchester Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The one inkling of what lay ahead had come during his student
days at Winchester, the famed English public school, when he won a
literary prize: a volume on Chinese painting. Before going to Yale,
he says, ``I knew nothing about China except for vague images of
emperors and porcelain and scroll painting.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this very ignorance that led Spence to China studies.
``It was totally accidental,'' he recalls. The fellowship allowed
him to study any subject, and ``I heard some inner voice say, `Why
the hell don't you do something really difficult that you haven't
done before, since this chance is such a fluke?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Spence decided Chinese history had a suitable degree of
difficulty. His abilities so impressed his professor, Mary C.
Wright, she suggested he learn the language. This was more than
Spence had bargained for. ``Good grief, I said, how could I
possibly do that? And she said, `Well, people do, you know.' So I
plunged into a kind of Chinese 1, and did the basic history, and
then art history; and as soon as I could translate it, Chinese
poetry. So I was caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence has been at Yale, and Chinese history, ever since. It
wasn't for another 15 years, though, that he visited China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shocking: absolutely shattering,'' he says. ``I suppose
I wanted to have a sort of romantic encounter with China's past:
You know, a dawn-strolling-around-the-Forbidden-City kind of thing.
What happened was we just roared straight in, jammed in a group of
buses with the horns blaring and people just jumping out of the
road and babies screaming and people cursing us out. It was the
most horrifying entry. It completely severed that romantic emotion.
We were in the Forbidden City but amidst bad feeling, hot weather,
exhaust fumes _ a rather charged entry into the past,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Spence has found the subject for his next book, an 18th-century
assassination plot. If ``Hu'' reads like a cross between Melville's
``Bartleby the Scrivener'' and Michel Foucault's ``Madness and
Civilization,'' this new work sounds like a blend of Oliver Stone
and ``The Last Emperor'' _ with perhaps the faintest hint of
autobiography thrown in. ``A lot of the plotters were teachers,''
Spence explains, ``which intrigues me.''

PERRY SAVORS AEROSMITH RESURGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Publish or perish is the writer's credo. Adapt or die is the
rocker's equivalent. That's certainly true for Aerosmith, the
veteran Boston band that no longer gets played on many contemporary
rock stations. Instead, the group has found other outlets _ Top 40
radio and movie soundtracks _ which have propelled it back to
superstar status and attracted a whole new generation of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a really exciting time for us. We're reaching a
younger crowd and there's a new energy in the band,'' says
guitarist Joe Perry, who joins his former Toxic Twin, Steven Tyler,
and the rest of Aerosmith for sold-out shows at the FleetCenter on
New Year's Eve and the Worcester Centrum on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The group is again selling out arenas thanks to its first No. 1
hit, ``I Don't Miss a Thing,'' from the ``Armageddon'' soundtrack.
It was one of four Aerosmith songs in the film (which finished as
the year's box-office king with a $206 million gross) and has
Hollywood producers lining up for more Aerosmith tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably one of the most in-demand soundtrack bands
right now,'' says Perry, whose group is sifting through offers.
</P>
<P>
   The Aerosmith megahit from ``Armageddon'' was penned by Diane
Warren, an often sugary tunesmith who has written for Celine Dion
and Bryan Adams. Some old-school Aerosmith fans didn't like the
song's slow tempo, but as Perry says, ``Nobody has booed us when we
play it on stage. And it's helped bring in a lot of people who then
get exposed to our rock 'n' roll songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to find a balance between commerciality and keeping
your soul,'' he adds in a recent chat from his South Shore home.
``It's always an uphill battle in this business, because the whole
industry is geared to the next big thing. It's hard to stick around
as long as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the vultures were circling two years ago when the group
endured rumors about renewed drug use, along with a change in
managers (switching from the Cambridge-based Tim Collins to the New
York-based Wendy Laister), a change in record producers (from Glen
Ballard to Kevin Shirley), and a change in the radio climate that
saw the band dropped from many rock playlists in favor of younger
``alternative'' acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``WBCN won't even play Aerosmith,'' Perry says of the Boston
station (104.1 FM) that was once the band's staunchest ally.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Perry says that one of his favorite stations is the
Cape Cod-based WKPE-FM (``ROCK 104.7'') in Orleans, which plays a
mix of old and young rock bands, from Aerosmith, Van Halen, and
Metallica, to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Scott Weiland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to it down here all the time,'' Perry says from
Duxbury. ``There are some other stations like it around the
country, but not in Boston proper. The Cape station doesn't have
the snob thing that Boston stations have. Some of the Boston
stations make me sick. They're all about age and what's hip this
week. And they're programmed by people who don't live in Boston, no
matter what they tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry loves to tell it like it is _ a trademark of his ever
since Aerosmith released its first album 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perry doesn't like some of today's narrow-minded rock trends,
nor does he like the way that some bands are veering away from the
populist base of the music. He's not happy, for instance, with the
high-priced $300 tickets that the Rolling Stones are charging for
their arena shows in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't pay it,'' he snaps. ``I'd love to see the Stones, but
I wouldn't pay it. How much is enough? They already have enough
money. Hey, it's a capitalist society and you've got to make a
profit, but there are times when it gets greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry extends this belief to signing autographs, which have
become big moneymakers for some sports figures, but he can't abide
their logic. ``I sign 100 autographs a day for free on the road,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a wonderful comeback year for Aerosmith. Not only
has the group been hot on the charts and at the box office, but
it's had the unique thrills of being invited to the White House and
to the recent Cape Canaveral launch of the Discovery shuttle that
took Senator John Glenn into space again after 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch was fantastic. It was extremely loud and the flame
from the exhaust was like an acetylene torch. It hurt my eyes and I
had shades on at the time,'' says Perry, whose group also performed
for some astronauts at the premiere of ``Armaggedon'' at the
Kennedy Space Center in June.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been a crisis-free year, however. Aerosmith drummer
Joey Kramer suffered second-degree burns when his Ferrari caught
fire at a Scituate gas station, forcing the cancellation of a
number of summer shows. Tyler is recovering from a knee injury
after he accidentally banged his leg into a microphone stand.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler is wearing a knee brace and ``he'll have to wear it for a
year,'' says Perry. ``And he's been told by doctors to get off the
road in January to rest it. We were supposed to keep playing right
up until March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy for Steven,'' says Perry. ``He tore the
ligament, which is usually a sports-type injury, and he's been
traveling with a knee therapist. But he's definitely mending.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry expects the band to finish strong with its area shows
(``I'm really excited because the band is tighter than it ever was
before''), then he and Tyler will start writing songs for the
band's next album, before going back on the road for six weeks
starting in April.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the next album going to sound like?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I can do is predict that,'' says Perry. ``But
we've already talked about producers and the form that it's going
to take. It will definitely be funky.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed further, he hints at a fusion between the vintage
hard-rock style of the band's most recent album, ``Nine Lives,''
with the techno slant of the Miami sessions for that disc with Glen
Ballard. Those were scrapped and the group sought out the services
of hard-rock producer Kevin Shirley in New York, though the band
isn't sure about using him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are elements about `Nine Lives' that we loved, and
elements about the Miami sessions we loved,'' says Perry. ``We'll
see if we can combine both.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, don't look for the band to do any sneak gigs at Mama
Kin, the club it co-owns on Lansdowne Street. ``I don't think so,
not this time,'' says Perry. ``We've been out on the longest
stretch without a break that we've had since 1973. We're excited
about the shows at the FleetCenter and Centrum, then we need to
take a break.''

GATED ENCLAVE CLOSED TO SCHOOL PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTO DE CAZA, Calif. _ The four gates, secured by uniformed
guards and monitored by cameras, serve their purpose. They keep out
the world. They keep the grounds safe for residents to ride their
horses, hone their golf games, and relax in the luxury of homes
whose average price exceeded $600,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the southern California enclave called Coto de Caza is under
threat _ from kindergartners, along with first-, second- and maybe
even third-graders. Their parents say there is nowhere else to put
them, since the new elementary school just beyond the gates is
crammed past capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal to open a K-3 school for 400 students within
the isolated foothill development has pitted neighbor against
neighbor and parents against empty-nesters. It has also raised
questions about the legality of locating a public school behind
private gates. The issue has become so contentious that the
homeowners' association is putting it to a communitywide vote that
could quash the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a field day for civil rights lawyers,'' said
Edward Blakely, a professor of urban planning at the University of
Southern California and co-author of ``Fortress America: Gated
Communities in the United States.'' ``A public school has to be
public. So when I roll up to that gate, you have to open it. And
once you're inside, they can't stop you from wandering around
because that would be intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of a public school inside Coto de Caza _ and they are
a vocal group _ said they fear a court could force the gates open
permanently, costing the 5,000-acre Coto de Caza its status and
security. Even Charles Ware, an executive with Lennar Communities,
the developer that donated the land for the school, has concerns.
``I don't think anyone knows if it's true or not that the gates
could come down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the threat to their lifestyles, opponents said they fear
for the students' safety since residents are known to ignore the
speed limits because police cannot issue tickets on private
property. They also worry about traffic congestion, especially
increased traffic by people who would not normally have access to
their streets, although thousands of guest passes are issued
monthly to gardeners, housekeepers, and country club employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased access is definitely a problem,'' said Le Ann Ricks,
a resident working to block the school. ``I had always dreamed
that, as a little old lady, I'd be able to go out no matter the
time of day and feel safe. I don't want that to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters counter that there is no alternative to the
overcrowding at nearby Wagon Wheel Elementary School, which was
built for 720 students, opened with 800 in September 1997, and is
expected to be have more than 1,300 next fall, many of them from
Coto de Caza. Otherwise, they could be forced to bus the youngest
of their school-age children elsewhere next year, as some of the
older ones are now. And even the most ardent school supporters
vowed to relocate the campus before allowing the gates to be
dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little kids, and we're talking little kids, are not
predators,'' said Jill Harmon, a mother of two elementary
school-age daughters whose family moved to Coto de Caza 18 months
ago. ``Other communities are worried about robbers and burglars.
Where are our priorities? It makes me think about what kind of
place I'm living in and whether I want to be here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Coto de Caza, with 10,000-plus residents in 5,200 condominiums,
houses, villas, and estates, is widely considered the largest gated
community in the country. East of Mission Viejo and about a
90-minute drive south of Los Angeles, it is also in one of the
fastest growing regions.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming superintendent of the area's Capistrano Unified
School District 7 1/2 years ago, James Fleming said he has seen the
number of students double, to 42,500. Sixteen schools have been
built. Still, more are needed. At Wagon Wheel, hundreds of students
study in portable classrooms tucked behind the main building.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a school _ actually 20 portable classrooms and three
support buildings _ seemed an obvious solution to some parents and
the school district. Under the deal brokered, the homeowners'
association would swap 2.5 acres set aside as open space for an
8-acre parcel owned by Lennar, the master plan developer. The
association would then lease the property, near a covered picnic
area and sports park but away from any homes, to the school
district for $1 a year. The proposed school could be put up faster
and for far less money than it usually takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Fleming said. ``We thought it
was a slam dunk before this brouhaha.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened, according to opponents, is that they were misled
into believing a small ``learning center'' would be opened in Coto,
local shorthand for the gated community. Only recently, they said,
did they come to understand that the information in the homeowner
association's quarterly newsletter referred to an actual, full-time
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was presented as this quiet, rosy picture, and no one
questioned it,'' said Karen Rose, who has lived in Coto for nine
years. ``We aren't antischool. We just really don't think the
homework was done. There are legal ramifications to doing this, and
there has got to be another way.''
</P>
<P>
   School supporters, however, said their research indicates the
school would be legal. Already within Coto's gates, they noted, are
a public fire station and a small private school whose parents have
standard access cards. Again and again, they stressed that the
students would be Coto children, able to walk to school. But there
are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's inside or outside the gates is irrelevant,'' said
Lisa Metzger, an 11-year resident and PTA parent who helped
spearhead the drive for a new school. ``It's just where the land
is. . . . And logic dictates that most if not all of the students
will be Coto kids. We have more than enough kids to populate this
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Added John Zarian, president of the CZ Master Association, the
homeowners group, ``A school in any gated community is going to be
a hot button. But we felt we were doing a good deed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a community where thousands turn out for the annual
Fourth of July parade and Yule Log lighting ceremony, anger and
arguments have supplanted holiday and community spirit. At one
meeting, Harmon said, a school opponent called supporters ``you
tract people'' _ a reference to the newer, more clustered homes in
Coto.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of the March 3 vote, the genteel days
of the 1960s, when Coto was a hunt club and Hollywood stars such as
John Wayne and Charlton Heston came to ride horses on weekends,
appear to be gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about fighting against chalkboards and tot
lots,'' said Harmon, whose 8-year-old daughter had to sit on a
classroom floor at Wagon Wheel for more than a month until a desk
could be found. ``There's a degree of snobbery here that I never
thought I'd see, not even in Coto.''

TESTING, TESTING, AND MORE TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They have been a classroom fixture longer than the
overhead projector _ darkened dots on standardized tests, marking
answers to questions about Lincoln's assassin, the boiling point of
water, or the square root of 81.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years the results of those tests and what they
say about the educational performance of American students have
become increasingly alarming.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where accountability is the latest lesson of
the day and educators earlier this month planned yet another
statewide test _ this one for second-graders _ they are stoking a
white-hot debate about the tools of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Some students and teachers, who complain about a barrage of
examinations that, they say, imperil self-esteem and often upset
classroom rhythms, are now asking a knotty question of their own:
Are we overdoing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon we'll have a pre-natal exam and begin testing
people from the womb to the tomb,'' said Dr. Charles L. Mitsakos,
the former Winchester school superintendent who now chairs the
education department at Rivier College in Nashua. ``It's like you
hear about this patient who goes through this series of diagnostic
tests in the emergency room and in the clinic, but they die because
no one has looked at the patient as a whole. I think it's a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as big as the disaster that loose standards and
unpredictable testing patterns have wrought, reply test defenders.
Their question is this: Why shouldn't our schools prepare our
children for life in the real world?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a much bigger self-esteem problem when you get out
in the world and you find out that you've failed because you can't
get a job because you've been artificially pushed along in
school,'' said William Guenther, president of the Mass Insight
Education and Research Institute, which promotes higher educational
standards. ``That's the problem with the self-esteem movement. It
has a reasonable basis, but some people have taken it too far.''
</P>
<P>
   While an ivory-tower debate rages in academia and test-score
fallout confronts school committees from Plymouth to Pittsfield,
early reports from the field suggest a weariness among the test
takers and a wariness from some of their teachers, who want to
absorb one battery of tests before preparing for even more.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat with four of her classmates recently in the library
at the Lucy Stone Elementary School in Dorchester, 11-year-old
Tiarra Gabriel slowly shook her head and released a long sigh when
asked about the MCAS exam she completed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was long and it was boring,'' she said. ``It was so long
that it took up more of the work we did in fourth grade and at the
end of the year, we had to make up for all the work we missed while
we were focusing on the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Gabriel: ``I think school should be about learning, not
competing with other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmate Matthew Dunigan, 12, agreed. ``I've got a brother in
the 10th grade and if he does bad on the test I'm going to feel
worried because I might do bad when I'm older,'' he said. ``That's
why I'm really concerned about doing that test two more times.''
</P>
<P>
   They say they want fewer tests, less pressure, and more time
with their teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Those may seem predictable, age-old complaints from students who
have never been too thrilled to have their mettle tested with
unforgiving examinations, even when those results were used
internally and relatively benignly by teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   But now, when test scores can provoke urgent headlines and can
mean the difference between a diploma and despair, some specialists
are arguing that Massachusetts, in a meritorious race for
excellence, is relying too heavily on tone-deaf tests that ignore
the nuances and subtleties that good classroom teaching is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how these tests are supposed to work,'' said
Deborah Meier, an award-winning school reformer and principal of
the Mission Hill Elementary School in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you could give the public some useful information, but
we're giving them nonsense now _ garbage. If students are told that
they're terrible, there's two reactions you can have. One is: I'm
going to work harder. I wouldn't say that's how most people react.
Most human beings, if told they rank very low, that isn't an
incentive for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Neill, executive director of FairTest, a Cambridge
monitoring group that opposes the latest proposal for statewide
reading tests for second-graders, said the state has slipped into
testing ``overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a waste of $700,000 worth of taxpayer money
and likely will be more educationally harmful than helpful,'' said
Neill. ``These tests are exhausting for kids. And everything else
is blown. The emotional intensity surrounding it eats up everything
else. The kids get a couple months of real education and the rest
is test preparation and exhaustion. I think that's what's happening
in Massachusetts right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But some educators say the intensity surrounding tests can be a
good thing. They look at international science and math tests that
rank US students against 25 other nations. The tests, administered
out of Boston College, show that while US 4th graders rank on par
with their international peers, 8th and 12th graders fall behind.
Some researchers contend that US students fall behind because
students in other countries have tough national exams at the end of
those grades, forcing them to focus sharply on academics.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries ``seem to accept as part of their culture that
high academic achievement is important,'' said Michael Sentance,
education adviser to Governor Paul Cellucci. ``We don't have that
same culture here. We have this whole series of conversations about
other things: how the children feel, how happy they are. It's funny
_ we heard last year from a group of Japanese educators how happy
our children seemed in school, so I think that people can learn
from the American experience certain things about nurturing kids,
but I also think we can learn something from other countries about
high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Massachusetts is becoming ``test happy,'' as critics
assert, it has plenty of company. Psychometrics, the science of
measuring minds, is a huge business in the United States. Firms
that market standardized tests have annual sales of nearly $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   And after spending that much money, states are demanding
results. If scores falter, school districts in Michigan can have
their accreditation taken away. In South Carolina, poor-performing
districts can be taken over by the state. In California, officials
want to pay bonuses to teachers who deliver high scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are efforts to improve testing so that even standardized
tests are less of the dumb fill-in-the-blank tests that they used
to be, so they are better measures of what we hope children will
learn,'' said Susan Fuhrman, dean of the Graduate School of
Education at the University of Pennsylvania. ``I think we're in
transition now. We're definitely in a place where testing is more
important. It's a question of balancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald K. Hambleton, a professor in the School of Education at
the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said it's possible to
become overly dependent on cold test scores that are not tied to
classroom curriculum. But he said that isn't happening in
Massachusetts. Indeed, the MCAS tests are more than just
fill-in-the-dot questions, but tests with open-ended and essay
questions designed to test critical thinking. Questions, which are
designed by a group of educators, parents, and policy makers, are
closely tailored to determine how well students have learned each
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing for the sake of testing is a waste of everyone's time
and money,'' said Hambleton. ``But when the tests are carefully
selected and administered properly, the data is useful. It's not an
imposition on the kids and can be an integral part of the
instructional process.''
</P>
<P>
   He said reading is so central to learning, any attempt to flag
early problems, such as the state Board of Education's $700,000
proposed second-grade reading tests, should be embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vetros, principal of the 940-pupil Clinton Middle
School, agreed, saying if the MCAS tests are here to stay, the
second-grade tests will be a worthwhile yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to give us a better starting point on where
we have to go,'' said Vetros, whose teachers instruct pupils in
grades 3 through 8. ``I'd like to know how the kids coming into my
building scored in relation to other kids in the Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lucy Stone Elementary, where fifth graders recently received
their scores from last year's MCAS exams, principal Maria de los
Angeles Montes said she welcomes that data, too, but shares her
students' weariness of more No. 2 pencils filling in more circles.
</P>
<P>
   She wants her students examined with a wide-angle lens, not a
microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a focus on the test and it's not the whole picture,''
she said. ``It's not the whole picture for a school. And it's not
the whole picture for a child.''

THE YEAR WASHINGTON TRIED OUR PATIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ Now ends one of democracy's years of
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1998 is almost certainly less portentous than 1821,
when this state was created as a way to stave off sectional
tensions, or 1861, when the Civil War began and when the first
battle west of the Mississippi occurred near Wilson's Creek here.
It is less momentous than 1868, when Andrew Johnson was impeached
in the middle of the Reconstruction debate, or 1974, when Richard
Nixon was forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was a year of tumult and trial: the year Bill
Clinton fought off allegations of an affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky, finally admitted that he had an improper relationship
with the onetime intern, watched helplessly as independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr delivered a graphic report on the president's
personal behavior to his Republican rivals on Capitol Hill, and
became the first chief executive in 130 years to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But it was so much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   This was an agonizing 12 months when Americans confronted the
limits of their political system and perhaps the limits of their
patience; when Americans debated the most intimate private details
of human experience in public; when the fate of the president and,
it is not too much to say, of the presidency itself, were in the
balance; when Americans discovered that they were more tolerant
than they thought and had a more narrowly drawn view of public
responsibility than did many of the public figures they elect.
</P>
<P>
   This was the year when the American people stood up to the
pundits, confounding them by giving President Clinton astonishing
job-approval ratings and delivering the GOP an election-day
surprise. They stuck with him in the face of a parade of House
Republicans who concluded, whether by conviction or conformity,
that the president should be impeached on a chilly Saturday
afternoon in late December while the rest of the country was at the
mall.
</P>
<P>
   This was the year when Americans expressed their contentment
with their lives and their distress with their political leaders _
an important distinction and an important departure, making the gap
between national life and the national political establishment
impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a level of fatigue in this country right now that's
inordinately high,'' said Senator John Ashcroft, the Republican
presidential contender who retreated to his 155-acre alfalfa farm
not far from here for some holiday relief from the brawls of the
capital. ``The public perception of Washington is that it was
obsessed with (the presidential scandals) through the last year. If
you watched cable it would seem as if nothing else was done in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
found that only one American in three paid very close attention to
the second impeachment of a president in American history. Indeed,
eight news stories commanded more of the public's attention in 1998
than did the presidential scandal and impeachment. The study found
that 49 percent of the nation followed the shootings in Jonesboro,
Ark., very closely, compared with the 34 percent who followed the
House vote to impeach Clinton very closely.
</P>
<P>
   The public's revulsion with the twists and turns of the scandal
can be plotted on a graph, with the president's approval ratings
actually improving each time his position in Washington seemed more
perilous _ the initial revelations, the claims of White House
volunteer Kathleen Willey that the president made an unwanted
sexual advance, the actual impeachment vote. His job approval
rating rose to 71 percent from 61 percent after he was impeached,
according to the Pew researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public understood this year,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat. ``They got lost in Social
Security reform and some of the complications of health-care reform
and on so many of the trade issues. But this everyone understood.
People made their minds up. This wasn't like the Vietnam war, which
gradually revealed itself. On this one, people got it quick.''
</P>
<P>
   But the implications of 1998 on the nation and on its political
system will be slower to reveal themselves. Here are some of the
important questions that historians a decade or more from now may
still be pondering:
</P>
<P>
   _ How did Americans sort out their conflicting views of the role
morals play in national leadership?
</P>
<P>
   This question, the center of the debate over Clinton, was
unresolved throughout the year and remains so at the end of the
year. Randy Tate, the former Republican congressman who is
executive director of the Christian Coalition, argued that ``the
president is not just the chief executive, but a role model for our
kids.'' Tate, in an interview this week, added: ``He has to do more
than balance the budget but to reinforce the kind of values that
moms and dads are trying to teach at home.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion is no longer an unassailable part of the national
consensus. A revealing poll conducted between August and December
by The Washington Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation and Harvard
University found the nation split between those who think the
president ``has a greater responsibility than leaders of other
organizations to set the moral tone of the country'' (50 percent)
and those who believe that ``as long as he does a good job running
the country, a president's personal life is not important'' (48
percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ How did Americans resolve the gap between national life and
national leadership?
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate question of political legitimacy. In the
last three decades, the percentage of the public who express ``a
great deal of confidence'' in the executive branch fell from 41
percent to 12 percent, according to the Harris Poll, while the the
percentage of the public who express ``a great deal of confidence''
in the Congress dropped from 42 percent to 11 percent. These
figures show a crisis of confidence that was underlined by the
constitutional crisis of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did President Clinton cause changes in the nature of the
presidency or did he merely reflect them?
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from one perspective, President Clinton marked a major
departure in the history of the presidency, becoming a man whose
private life was public and whose moral shortcomings were set out
for all to see. But viewed from another perspective, President
Clinton might seem a decade from now to have merely continued a
trend, begun with John F. Kennedy, of melding the public and the
private, of transforming the presidency into an institution of
celebrity and of behaving in a manner more ordinary and less
olympian.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were the Washington sex wars of 1998 a continuation of a
cultural struggle that began in the 1960s or were they the
outgrowth of cultural struggles that were settled in the 1960s?
</P>
<P>
   In memory and myth, the 1960s were a soaring period of
liberalism, when the civil-rights struggle broadened American
horizons for millions and when the activism of the anti-war
protesters produced changes in American foreign policy and in the
nature of authority. In this interpretation, the ascent of Clinton
represents the triumph of the liberal vision of the 1960s. But
there is another view: The 1960s also molded Newt Gingrich, Tom
DeLay and Kenneth W. Starr, and historians may find that modern
conservatism is just as important an outgrowth of the 1960s, or
maybe even more so.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did impeachment become less formidable and forbidding a tool?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1789, an American president has been impeached only twice,
making the tool of impeachment one of the most forbidding in the
political arsenal. But its use has now been contemplated twice in
25 years; Nixon's resignation came in the face of certain
impeachment in the House. It is surely less terrifying a notion now
than it was 25 years ago. In another 25 years we will know whether
impeachment remained a response of last resort or whether members
of Congress tossed around the notion with only slightly more
gravity than they use now when they talk about overriding a
presidential veto. A discussion topic for your New Year's Eve
dinner party: If the Monica Lewinsky imbroglio had preceded rather
than followed the Reagan presidency, would President Reagan have
been impeached for the Iran-Contra affair?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is impeachment such a bad thing anyway?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is determined to prove that his effectiveness
as president won't be eroded by the fact that he is impeached. The
Congress and the public will have to decide whether it believes
that the presidency ordinarily has so little accountability that
the threat of impeachment might restrain the executive branch, or
at least give it second thoughts. The nation might also decide that
impeachment should remain rare, reserved for the most serious
crimes, or used to protect the nation from tyranny or destruction
rather than to punish a chief executive for misdeeds, even those
that go to the heart of the nation's moral code.
</P>
<P>
   None of these questions will be resolved in the next several
months, nor in the next several years. But it is clear that the
past dozen months have changed nation's political institutions,
which were designed to absorb and accommodate change; changed the
presidency, which retired Hood College political scientist Margery
Elfin called ``a peculiarly American institution with a history
that is special to our culture''; changed the American political
culture, which is constantly evolving; and changed the country,
which was founded in the first place on a wave of change.

PAIR OF PARAGONS; DUBIOUS AWARDS; Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if they've never been seen in the same room together, it's
a safe bet that British entrepreneur deluxe Richard Branson and
Arizona Senator John McCain are separate people.
</P>
<P>
   But if separate profiles in separate magazines on the newsstand
now have it right, they're the same kind of admirable fellow most
people would be proud to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, most recently visible for his flight halfway around the
world in a balloon, comes to us via the low-profile quarterly
Strategy &AMP; Business. McCain, who's contemplating a run for the
presidency, is a subject of the January George.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, worth about $3.5 billion today, had virtually nothing
when he started what became Virgin Records in 1969, at age 19. He
turns the common business dictum, ``stick with what you know,''
inside out; the pieces of his empire have nothing to do with each
other, except the Branson touch. He knew nothing about running an
airline, but looked at British Airways, saw an opportunity, and
Virgin Atlantic took off. More recently, he has come out with
Virgin Cola, taking aim on no less than Coca-Cola, perhaps the
world's strongest brand. ``Tell Richard that something is
impossible and watch his eyes light up,'' S&AMP;B quotes David Tait, a
Virgin Atlantic honcho.
</P>
<P>
   His employees, who have the right to address him directly at any
time they feel the need, adore him: They're just as likely to say
they ``work for Richard'' as to say they work for Virgin. And why
not? He insists on fun, is relentlessly enthusiastic, and he
considers nothing beneath him. ``He flies frequently and usually
spends the entire flight chatting with passengers, serving drinks,
leading games over the public address system and helping the flight
crew with even the most menial tasks,'' writer Glenn Rifkin
reports.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has the allure of integrity, too. He was shot down over
Hanoi in 1967, and spent the next five years as a prisoner of war,
two of them in solitary, all of them in severe pain from the
beatings and the deprivation. He could have left earlier, but said
no, it wasn't his turn.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for the House in 1982, and voters have been sending him
back to Washington ever since. For months leading to the November
election, Big Tobacco _ angered by his efforts to make it easier to
sue cigarette makers and more expensive to buy their products _
crusaded to thwart his re-election, but he was returned with 68
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are publicity hounds. Branson says his most important
employee is his communications director, and he reportedly budgets
a quarter of his time for public relations. It's why he was in that
balloon. George's Tom Dunkel reports that McCain's staff jokes
about his being a ``media whore'' who once dragged himself out of
bed at 3 a.m., in Hawaii, during an 18th-wedding-anniversary trip,
to appear on ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other similarities as well, but there is also this
important difference: Branson's commitment to his beliefs is his
strongest asset. But in the perverse public life of America _ where
the president thinks nothing of adopting the opposition's policies
if he can win with them, dissembles under oath, and increases his
popularity _ being principled could be McCain's weak point.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is the kind of man I think we'd all like to be
president if we could appoint the president,'' New Jersey senator
Robert Torricelli is quoted as saying. ``But John's . . . ability
to stand on principle (is) difficult to imagine in a presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   That other beacon of rectitude, Jerry Springer, adorns Esquire's
January cover, appropriately, if fancifully, bloodied. But the
chief attraction is inside, where the Dubious Achievement Awards,
like so much else in this publication's recent past, have regained
some of their luster. It is mean, and ugly, and often hilarious,
and local interests come in for their share of the blugeoning.
</P>
<P>
   Boston magazine earns an early citation for its ``Head Negro in
Charge'' headline, and George Carlin and Mike Barnicle are listed
under the heading ``Fun Couples.'' The celebrated skinniness of
Ally McBeal, who works at a Boston law firm, is explained with
government figures that say Massachusetts is leaner than all but
one other state, and computer imaging illustrates speculation on
what she would look like if she came from Indiana (they're No. 1).
It's not pretty, and neither is the other Bay State reference, the
death of a 20-foot minke whale under the prow of a whale-watching
cruise boat out of Barnstable. Hey, pretty funny, guys.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, a.k.a. the Millennium Bug, may be the end of civilization
as we know it, but at least it continues to provide lots of copy
for lots of magazines. The Utne Reader touts its ``Y2K Citizen's
Action Guide,'' now out on newsstands, and one of Esquire's lesser
virtues is Tom Junod's report from Pat Robertson's conference on
the digital apocalypse. (``The most important thing is finding
hiding places for the Jews,'' a fellow visitor tells Junod. `` . .
.so that they can get back to Israel, so that Jesus Christ can come
again in glory.'')
</P>
<P>
   But it is Vanity Fair that stands out in this trio, with Robert
Sam Anson's scream for attention. Some sound bites:
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the problem is vast: There are 1.2 trillion lines
of suspect code worldwide, plus 30 billion microprocessers; many of
them are linked, and the failure of one could trip millions of
others. (That means that Tuesday's news that Social Security has
been safeguarded is suspect, because it doesn't control all the
computers it depends on.) The cost of fixing it is estimated at
$3.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   --``To fix everything in the United States, it was estimated,
would require every single one of the 1.92 million software
professionals in the country to devote nearly five full months'' to
the problem, Anson reports. And that's just here. Russia has ``11
Chernobyl-type power plants, 22,500 nuclear warheads, and the funds
to fix none of them.''
</P>
<P>
   --Utah Senator Robert Bennett, considered Congress's foremost
Y2K expert, said, ``I'm not yet ready to dig a shelter in the
backyard. But it might not be a bad idea to have a little extra
food and water.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds pretty bad, but maybe Richard Branson could help.

BLACKS STUNG BY GAP ON NORTHERN CAMPUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Shelly-Ann Richmond's family emigrated from
Jamaica to Brooklyn when she was in high school. But it was her
move from Brooklyn to the University of New Hampshire that gave
Richmond the culture shock of her life.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to a freshman rally, Richmond, one of only 73
black students at UNH, searched the crowd for another black face.
She could not find one.
</P>
<P>
   And when students formed a ``snake line'' for freshmen to run
through and get high fives and pats on the back, Richmond says,
what happened next disturbed her even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who was in front of me who was white, everyone gave
them pats and high fives,'' Richmond said. ``As I ran down, (some)
people drew their hands back so they wouldn't touch me . . . It
made me feel really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades after New England campuses began actively soliciting
applications from minority students, a recent wave of racial
disputes on the campuses of New England colleges has educators and
students once again confronting the familiar, fragile balance
between tolerance, diversity, and free expression.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents also underscore an ongoing struggle on northern
New England college campuses _ the quest to attract and retain
minority students and to make them feel as at home at college as
their white classmates.
</P>
<P>
   For many young, college-bound blacks, the incidents reinforce
long-held perceptions that cast New England as a place where cold
climates extend beyond the weather forecasts: When Black Enterprise
magazine recently rated the top 50 colleges for black students in
the United States, not a single school in New Hampshire, Maine, or
Vermont made the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably the main issue is you don't have a large
African-American presence in those states, and the perception of
the schools in those areas suffers because of a lack of a critical
mass of African-Americans,'' said Thomas LaVeist, an associate
professor of health and public policy at Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore who conducted the study upon which Black Enterprise
based its rankings.
</P>
<P>
   At UNH, black and white students together occupied the
president's office in November, securing a promise from school
officials to quadruple the number of African-American students on
campus _ currently less than one percent of the student body, only
73 out of 9,960.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at three other New England campuses, acts of real or
perceived insensitivity triggered protests throughout the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, a Dartmouth College fraternity and sorority
sponsored a ``ghetto party,'' prompting weeks of speak-outs,
walk-outs, and panel discussions.
</P>
<P>
   At Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., earlier this month,
an altercation with racial connotations at a party prompted a vigil
by students calling for greater understanding of diversity.
University officials are investigating, and planning events to
promote tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   And in an episode that raises thorny issues about racial terms
and interpretations of racism, controversy has raged at the
University of Rhode Island since the publication of a cartoon that
some black students saw as racist, even as its white authors said
it was instead an attack against bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The exposed tensions come as the country undergoes a massive,
agonizing overhaul of affirmative action not seen since the civil
rights movement. The URI cartoon was based on a 1996 federal court
ruling that struck down affirmative action in admissions at the
University of Texas of Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, upheld by the Supreme Court, effectively compels
state colleges and universities in Texas, Louisiana, and
Mississippi _ the three states under the jurisdiction of the 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals _ to use a colorblind approach in
admitting students.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the colleges in New England are private, and thus
subject to fewer restrictions. Still, despite the freedom to pursue
a diverse student body, most remain overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting minority students ``certainly is a challenge, being
in this part of the country,'' said Evelyn Silver, director of
Equal Opportunity at the University of Maine at Orono. But, she
pointed out, ``I'm sure North Dakota thinks the same thing, and
Wyoming _ it's not just northern New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, racial disputes also arose this fall at Miami University
in Ohio, where angry protesters blocked traffic after racist slurs
were found on computers and fliers on campus, and at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania. Students, teachers, and staff at
Swarthmore held a rally after the school's Intercultural Center was
trashed.
</P>
<P>
   On college campuses in New England, anger and frustration linger
over racial battles some minority students say should have been
settled in their parents' generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not be fighting this battle,'' said Shaunda Miles, a
Dartmouth senior, referring to the dispute over the so-called
ghetto party. ``This should be a safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Humphreys of the Association of American Colleges and
Universities, which works with the Ford Foundation's Campus
Diversity Initiative, cautioned against judging all of northern New
England based on the recent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect that there aren't more incidents in Northern
New England than all around the country,'' Humphreys said. ``It's
very hard to judge an institution or an entire region based on a
number of incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Humphreys speculated that conservative legal and political
attacks on affirmative action programs could be fueling ``something
of a backlash'' against efforts to promote and celebrate diversity
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   At Dartmouth, the fraternity and sorority that sponsored the
party quickly apologized.
</P>
<P>
   LaVeist, however, said Dartmouth did ``very poorly'' in his
study, which surveyed African-American educators and examined
schools' student population and graduation rates of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At UNH, dissatisfaction was based mostly on numbers: Just 3.4
percent of 9,960 undergraduates are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But state colleges and universities, which draw most of their
students from their own states, are at particular disadvantages in
recruiting minorities: Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, according
to census figures, are each at least 98 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Vermont in Burlington has just 33
African-Americans out of 7,250 undergraduates. Minorities make up
4.4 percent of UVM undergrads.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maine at Orono _ where several students were
disciplined last year for making a threatening phone call to a
black classmate _ has just 57 African-American undergrads of a
total 7,109, with minorities making up 4.4 percent of
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer numbers alone, some students say, make them feel
always the ``other,'' always the exotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically black ambassadors to the University of New
Hampshire,'' said Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Beattie, part-time coordinator of minority student
recruitment and retention at UNH, acknowledged that attracting
minorities to a campus in a predominantly white state can be a
tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it clear to the minority youngsters that it is a
predominantly white environment, and to maintain their academic
(goals) and to adjust socially in this environment is a
challenge,'' Beattie said.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Aziz, president of the UNH Black Student Union, said the
school offered him a good financial aid package, and he liked the
fact that the pastoral campus is only about 90 minutes from his
Dorchester home.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been frustrated at times, and considered leaving
UNH. But he also said he welcomes the challenge to foster changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to be frontiersmen out here _ in 1998,'' Aziz said,
with a tinge of sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   The recent UNH student sit-in secured a number of promises from
the administration. In addition to quadrupling the number of black
students by 2004, UNH has also pledged to increase the number of
black faculty, to improve recruitment and retention of minorities,
and to increase education efforts on minority issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Jackson, a former UNH student body president, said he
believes UNH president Joan Leitzel's heart is ``in the right
place.'' In her tenure, Leitzel has hired a full-time affirmative
action director, appointed a commission on the status of people of
color at UNH, and created the job of vice president of enrollment
management.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of promoting diversity sometimes can't be
answered by numbers alone.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth's minority student population is nearly 25 percent, a
dramatic increase over the past quarter-century, according to
school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Dartmouth students thought holding a ghetto party
would be amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to have diversity,'' said Rahsaan Sales, a senior
from Chicago. ``But without the next level, which is interaction,
diversity is not worth much.''

which sold a glutinous desert called the Kudzu Ice Cream Moon Pie,
has settled a federal lawsuit filed by Chattanooga Bakery and
agreed to no longer use the trademark name for the convenience
store snack cakes. Chattanooga Bakery, which sells Moon Pies, sued
Kudzu for using its name on its $6.95 dessert item. Bakery

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  NORWOOD, Mass. _ Have you ever craved a snack or drink from a
vending machine, only to find nothing there you liked? You may have
wondered who decided what was put in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Very likely, says John Roughneen, it was the truck driver who
serviced the machine. While the driver probably knew what people
wanted, the items he actually loaded into the machine may have been
determined by whether he could avoid going back to his truck, by
using goods he had already brought in.
</P>
<P>
   This was just one quirk Roughneen learned about the vending
industry when he worked for a soft-drink bottling company after
graduating from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1989 _ an
education that led to formation of StreamWare Corp., a company that
aims to bring high-tech to a very low-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The vending companies Roughneen saw were mostly small and family
owned. Many tracked inventory by walking around the warehouse to
see what was running out. Electronic data-collection devices on new
machines weren't being hooked up. And cash flow was more important
than customer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   When he suggested using computer technology to build sales,
``All they wanted was accountability, to make sure they weren't
being ripped off by their drivers,'' said Roughneen.
</P>
<P>
   The more he saw, the more he realized this huge industry, with
1997 US sales of nearly $33 billion, was stuck deep in the past,
and, in his opinion, ripe to join the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Roughneen, now 31, and Glenn Butler, 30, a software writer for
computer operating systems, founded StreamWare in 1991 and set out
to take on the vending-machine world.
</P>
<P>
   Their product, introduced in 1996 and named VendMax, is a
complete business system to track receipts, monitor inventory,
schedule route stops, compute commissions _ and gather data for
market analysis of how to satisfy customer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, though, has proved sizable in an industry that is
highly fragmented, resistant to change, and on average produces
profits of 5 percent or less _ between $150 and $200 per vending
machine each year. And most of the estimated 10,000 vending machine
operators in the United States are small, averaging fewer than
1,000 machines and 25 employees each. Only three are big, and they
are secretive about revenues. Together the three are believed to
control about 20 percent of all sales.
</P>
<P>
   But after seven years of spending their savings and borrowing
against credit cards, Roughneen and Butler expect 1998 to be a
million-dollar year for StreamWare _ and to show a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, with Stephen Pytka, 50, who was hired as StreamWare's
first full-time chief executive in November, they hope to double
that revenue figure.
</P>
<P>
   That new growth, however, will come not so much from VendMax
sales as from exploiting an unexpected secondary market _ selling
vending machine sales data to soft-drink bottlers and snack-food
makers who use it to plan marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting VendMax to market took five years, including a
three-month setback when Apple Computer Corp. pulled its Newton
hand-held computers off the market. Butler had expected vending
route drivers would use the Newton to record sales data, and had to
rewrite all his software for Windows. Palm Pilot hand-held
computers were substituted for the Newton.
</P>
<P>
   VendMax gets high marks from users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to know exactly what is selling,'' said James
Kelly, co-owner of P&AMP;J Vending in Framingham, which operates 400
machines. Kelly said VendMax reduces driver guesswork by accurately
recording what items sell best. With this knowledge, trucks can be
loaded with almost exactly what each machine will need.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the accolades, VendMax has met resistance from an
industry dominated by family-owned firms that function without much
technology. Profit margins run 5 percent or less, industry sources
say, and with the average company owning fewer than 1,000 machines,
most avoid making changes that cost money.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Automatic Merchandising Association in Chicago,
Larry Eils acknowledges his members are a balky bunch. ``The first
response to a new idea is usually, `I hear it doesn't work too
well.' They wait to see if Joe across town uses it first,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, manufacturers of the cold drinks, salty snack
foods, and candy bars that go into these machines have become some
of VendMax's biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy J. Sanford, editor of Vending Times, an industry
magazine, says that is because VendMax is the only vending business
software package, among several available, that can record and
compile sales data in fine detail.
</P>
<P>
   StreamWare's discovery that manufacturers need such data was
serendipitous. It came when Butler spoke at an industry meeting in
1996 about VendMax's ability to compile data from large numbers of
machines. The audience peppered him with questions.
</P>
<P>
   Among manufacturers who count on vending machines producing 15
percent to 20 percent of revenues, he said, ``It was the first time
anyone had seen this kind of data being available.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, he and Roughneen devised another product, named
InfoVend, to put data collected from vending companies that buy
VendMax, in a form that market analysts could use.
</P>
<P>
   InfoVend, sold by subscription, is a database of activity at
more than 50,000 vending machines. Roughneen said customers include
PepsiCo Inc. and its subsidiary Frito-Lay Inc., Coca-Cola Co., and
Hershey Foods Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At PepsiCo, InfoVend has been used to measure response to the
new Pepsi One low-calorie cola, and to gain insight into how well
the company's Fina brand bottled water will sell in workplace
settings.
</P>
<P>
   William Wertz, director of on-premise sales strategy for PepsiCo
in Purchase, N.Y., said previous internal measuring methods gave
little detail about where, and when, certain products sold best.
``We now have a more holistic view of what is selling in our
vending machines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers declined to discuss their use of the
InfoVend service, citing proprietary concerns. But Sanford, at
Vending Times, said Frito-Lay and M&AMP;M/Mars, a division of Mars
Inc., have both endorsed StreamWare's technology by featuring it
prominently in sales presentations at industry meetings.
</P>
<P>
   InfoVend provides data to its subscribers, who then can
manipulate it as they wish. ``In one case,'' said Sanford,
``Frito-Lay described an intricate study that showed a vending
operator could increase dollars by taking one shelf of candy out of
a machine and replacing it with salty snacks. And in the next room
Mars was using the same study and saying it found exactly the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   While the InfoVend database represents less than 2 percent of
the 3 million snack-food and soft-drink vending machines estimated
in use across the United States, Wertz at PepsiCo says it is enough
to provide a strong statistical sample of US consumer response.
</P>
<P>
   Roughneen says with additional sales of VendMax to vending
companies, StreamWare hopes to also produce reports of sales by
region and by types of locations, including health care facilities,
factories, tourist sites, or colleges and schools.
</P>
<P>
   But making those sales remains a challenge. Fewer than 100
operators have bought VendMax, with price _ $4,000 and up per site
license, plus specially programmed Palm Pilot computers at $2,000
each _ cited as a major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Eils, at the National Automatic Merchandising Association, says
thin profit margins _ about 5 percent a year on sales per machine
between $3,000 and $4,000 _ are legitimate cause for pause.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford also cites the industry's status quo attitude. ``A lot
of these guys are second generation operators, doing it the way
that their father or their uncle did,'' he said. ``If they are
doing it right, they are still doing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   StreamWare plans to boost VendMax's appeal with a system that
lets drivers transfer item-by-item data from electronically
equipped vending machines directly into their computers. They now
enter it manually, or, if their company hasn't bought the Palm
Pilot units, record it by hand on paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Roughneen says direct loading could cut a driver's time at a
machine by five minutes. That, with other gains in efficiency from
tighter accounting and inventory control, could increase profits 10
to 15 percent, he says _ more than enough to pay for the new
system, he insists. ``We've got to change behavior.''

TAPPING THE TEEN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, what Steve Kahn knew about teenage
girls' fashions, you could fit in a pot of lip gloss. Now, at age
33, Kahn is king of its domain, the president of Delia's, the
world's largest and one of its trendiest teenage fashion catalog
companies.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have teenage daughters, you may never have heard of
Delia's. If you do, you know it not just as a company or another
catalog cluttering the mailbox, but rather as a cultural
phenomenon, an icon of what demographers are starting to call
Generation Y.
</P>
<P>
   There are 31 million teenagers in the United States _ the baby
boomers' children, just now coming of age. And last year they spent
$122 billion, one-third of it on clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in seven of these teenagers _ 13 percent _ have their
own credit cards, and another 13 percent have credit cards in their
parents' names.
</P>
<P>
   Even among those 17 and younger, nearly one in five _ 18 percent
_ have access to a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Michael Wood, director of Teenage Research
Unlimited, a survey firm in Northbrook, Ill., ``There's more
attention to the teen market than ever before. Everybody's waking
up and taking notice that this group is growing for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   More teenagers have part-time jobs now than ever before. They
belong to the first computer-literate generation. They feel
empowered and entitled. More have parents who are affluent than do
not. And so, Wood noted, ``Everyone is trying to figure out a way
to harness their buying potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kahn found the way. What started as an experiment, run out
of his Greenwich Village apartment, is now a $170 million business
operating from 48,000 square feet of office space in Manhattan and
a warehouse in Pennsylvania 10 times as large.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, who shuffles around his massive headquarters in jeans,
sneakers, and a crew shirt, happened onto this market almost by
accident. An analyst on Wall Street, he was at first attracted to
the direct-mail industry in general. ``The dynamics and growth are
dramatic if you find a customer base that isn't being served,'' he
said. ``You can grow the business very, very quickly if you find
something that works.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and Chris Edgar, a former roommate from Yale, decided to
take a shot. Their original idea was to create a clothes catalog
for college women and to recruit sorority sisters to sell the goods
on campus, like Avon women.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, though,'' Kahn said, ``was we placed ads in the
back of magazines like Seventeen and Sassy, and we started getting
all these orders from high school kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The trickle soon grew to a flood. ``Kids tend to congregate,''
Kahn noted. ``If something's cool, they'll take it to school in
their backpacks. Next thing you know, you have the whole school
calling you for the catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dean, director of W. A. Dean Associates, a
catalog-consulting firm in San Francisco, admitted that Delia's
success surprised everyone in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cataloguers focused on 25- or 30-year-olds, on up,'' Dean
said. ``Nobody was focusing on 18 to 25, much less teenagers. We
all missed two facts. First, these kids have money and credit
cards. Second, they love to get mail _ and they weren't getting
any. They weren't getting any other catalogs, so when Delia's came
along and found them, they gave it their undivided attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key to Kahn's success was that he made Delia's look like
a magazine. ``Magazines are a big part of teenagers' lives,
especially teenage girls,'' Wood said. ``They look to magazines for
advice on beauty and fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kahn puts it, ``We see Delia's as something like MTV or
Seventeen. We're an arbiter of style and taste.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Delia's has attracted a fair degree of brand
loyalty. Other teen catalogs followed in its wake _ Zoe, Just
Nicky, Wet Seal, Moxie Girl _ but Delia's is the one showing
staying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were first on the block,'' Wood said, ``and they built
some equity in their name early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kahn nor Edgar knew much at first about what teenagers
wanted. When the business started taking off, they hired 18- and
19-year-old women, mainly students at nearby New York University,
to staff the telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of them started criticizing some of our product,''
Kahn said, ``saying, `Kids don't want to buy this, they want to buy
that.' So we hired them as our first buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 workers staff the phones these days, 100 of them
working at once in the peak late-afternoon hours. They take phone
orders in a gigantic room at the Delia's headquarters, on Hudson
Street in Manhattan's West Village. Most of them are 18- and
19-year-old women who know the merchandise and who know how to talk
to 14- and 15-year-old customers without condescension.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100 or so employees work on the corporate side, with the
top executives ranging in age from 26 to 36.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Kahn has been diversifying. He has started or bought six
other teen catalog companies, including TSI Soccer (sporting
goods), Content (home furnishings), and Droog (clothes for teenage
boys).
</P>
<P>
   More drastically, he bought a chain of teen retail stores called
Screem, and has opened a couple of Delia's outlets, which he hopes
to expand to full-blown ``lifestyle stores'' that will sell the
entire Delia's family of products.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has not looked favorably on these acquisitions.
After Kahn took over Screem last summer, Delia's stock plunged 30
percent and has not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some uneasiness of what's on the company's plate,''
Kahn acknowledged. ``We have a core group of holders. When they
hear you're moving from one channel to another, they get nervous
about the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean said the big question is whether Delia's can survive the
transfer from mail-order fantasy to retail reality. Some, like
Eddie Bauer, did. Others, like Sharper Image and J. Peterman, are
having troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the history of retail will declare Delia's as
the company that turned teenage girls into a viable market segment.
``We preceded the whole focus on this question, `Can you sell to
girls?' '' Kahn proclaimed. ``We are the focal point for people who
look at this demographic.''

BUSINESSES LEFT OUT DURING NBA LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As she surveys the bar and tables at The Fours, one of
the restaurants near the FleetCenter, Fran Manganiello says she
does not think much about the National Basketball Association
owners and players, millionaires who are fighting over their share
of $2 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   She just wishes they would settle the nearly six-month-old
lockout so she can hire more waitresses and bartenders and get her
business back up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to the point that you are really relying on two nights a
week,'' said Manganiello, an owner and manager. ``Business is off
40 to 45 percent. It's been really difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial impact on businesses large and small is growing as
the NBA lockout drags on. And from the kitchen at The Fours to the
marketing departments at Citizens Bank and Nike, companies are
reviewing their relationship with what was, until the lockout, the
most stable business among the four major sports.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first work stoppage in the NBA that has resulted in
the cancellation of games. The dire consequences of perhaps losing
the whole season _ are starting to sink in for this professional
sports league which has long been considered the leader in melding
its business with the marketing strategies of its sponsors and
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller businesses that benefit from fans spending in
neighborhoods around arenas like the FleetCenter, and big
businesses, that have spent $240 million in sponsorships and
hundreds of millions more every year to plan their advertising
around NBA games, are both beginning to wonder how severely the
cash cow is wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're draining a reservoir of good will that's been built up
over a number of years,'' said the NBA's chief marketing officer
Rick Welts. ``But there's still water in the reservoir. The
question is going to be: If this lasts a long time, how much water
is left?''
</P>
<P>
   For businesses around the FleetCenter, the story is much like
that of The Fours. Many restaurateurs, the people who park the cars
in the lots nearby and the staff inside the arena say that business
is down about 40 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best of all worlds,'' said George West, as he
sold Bruins programs on the loge level of the FleetCenter during a
recent game. ``I'm lucky, though. I am part time here and part time
working at Harvard, so it's not as bad as it might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau has estimated
the lockout is costing about $2 million in lost revenue per game _
$1 million inside the arena, and $1 million for surrounding
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that the $1 million outside of the FleetCenter
is a complete loss, though,'' said bureau executive director Pat
Moscaritolo. ``Economists talk about something called the
`substitute effect,' that is, that money might well get spent
elsewhere in the city, as companies and families decide to do their
entertaining at the symphony or someplace else, instead of with the
Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Fours, Manganiello often feels as though the
`substitutes' have replaced her lost business. For many of the
businesses in and around the FleetCenter, the events there might as
well be the only shows in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are really talking about having to rely on the two seasons
_ hockey and basketball _ and now that there's just one; it's that
much of an impact,'' said Manganiello.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the FleetCenter, President Richard A. Krezwick says they
are working to hit break-even, even if the season is canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources knowledgable about the building's financing say
the visitors bureau's numbers are close: each canceled Celtics'
game represents about $700,000 in lost ticket revenue; about
$200,000 in lost concession revenue for SportService, which is
owned by Jeremy Jacobs and Delware North; and parking rounding out
the $1 million in losses per game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, substantial revenue from the Bruins continues to pour
in, and the FleetCenter is trying to augment that with a number of
sold out concert dates from November through March, including two
Rolling Stones shows and Jimmy Buffett for one show.
</P>
<P>
   Krezwick said the FleetCenter is offering ticket refunds with
interest to Celtics fans, and officials are considering refunding
some of the one-time-only fees that were put up by largely
corporate customers for luxury boxes and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement states that there will be no refunds for strikes
or lockouts,'' said Krezwick. ``But we will be looking to do the
right thing, depending on how all of this works out.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and the players have larger, more direct concerns as the
lockout lingers. Banks, beverage manufacturers and athletic shoe
makers sink hundreds of millions of dollars into the league
annually to sponsor teams and to obtain the athlete's endorsements
for their products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing specialists say that none of those deals are as
valuable as they were before the lockout. Any company that did not
negotiate an exit or rebate clause as part of their current deal is
likely to demand it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Bank decided to proceed with its television advertising
campaign that features Celtic coach Rick Pitino as a demanding
customer seeking financial services. Bank officials say they are
happy with the ads, but they realize their $1 million per year
sponsorship deal with the Celtics is not as valuable as it would
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we wish they were playing because we get a lot of
added visibility at the games,'' said Arlene Fortunato, a vice
president and director of public affairs for Citizens. ``But it has
not hurt us a lot, because a substantial part of that is our
relationship with Rick Pitino _ and we're going ahead and doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtics and bank sources familiar with the deal say Citizens
will get a rebate this year, having secured the provision in
negotiating the deal with the team. Neither side would comment on
the size of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Several individuals who observe endorsement deals with the
players say they are concerned about when and if the endorsements
will recover after the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we have seen the apex in terms of player
endorsements,'' said Irving Rein, a Northwestern University
professor who studies the use of celebrities in advertising
campaigns. ``I think baseball had big problems with this after the
'94 strike, and it never really recovered in terms of endorsement
dollars. Even with Sosa and McGwire, they are still lagging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence is deafening,'' said Bob Williams, president of
Burns Sports, a Chicago-based company that links advertisers and
athletes. ``It's very bad, and the situation is deteriorating. It
happened in baseball, it happened in football and now the one sport
that seemed impervious to a work stoppage has done the unthinkable,
and advertisers are going to begin following the lead of those who
have crafted contracts so that if they are dealing with a work
stoppage, the athletes won't be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   For some companies like Converse Inc. and Reebok International
Ltd., the lockout only furthers what has become a trend. Sales of
athletic shoes have been in decline for almost two years, and more
and more companies are using fewer NBA players to sell their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, we just don't have that many shoe contracts
with players, anymore'' said Dave Fogelson, a Reebok spokesman.
``We had 100 players at one time, a number of years ago, in various
types of deals. Now, we're down to Shawn Kemp, Chauncey Billups and
six to eight other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike, however, the world's largest manufacturer of athletic
shoes, has individual endorsement relationships with 230 players.
The company is a major sponsor of the league, and it outfits 10
teams. Last week, when Nike reported a 51 percent quarterly decline
in earnings, its current television advertising campaign that urges
the owners and players to ``Start the season. Please!'' took on a
new sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the right way to look at it is that if we were a
fashion house, they've taken away one of our critical runways,''
said Nike chairman Phil Knight, when he announced the quarterly
earnings.

REWARDING GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market seems like a fickle place sometimes, trashing
companies in the summer because they miss earnings forecasts by a
few pennies and driving shares of practically any Internet business
through the roof by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the performance of Massachusetts stocks this year and
you can find irrational examples of every stripe. But there is also
a refreshing sense of sanity on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks go down for lots of reasons and the ones that have this
year don't tell any coherent local story. But most of the prominent
winners do. They are relatively large, successful companies that
were rewarded for making the most of powerful positions among their
competitors. They were rewarded for old-fashioned execution.
</P>
<P>
   With two trading days remaining in 1998, there is no doubt that
CMGI Inc. of Andover will be the most successful Massachusetts
stock of the year. Shares of CMGI, which develops and operates a
farm team of Internet companies, were up 736 percent through
Tuesday. CMGI has performed admirably this year, but its outsize
stock advances reflect Internet mania more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   A few other hot smaller companies, including Geotel
Communications of Lowell and Lycos Inc. of Waltham, a key CMGI
investment, generated their own dizzying triple-digit returns.
</P>
<P>
   But the three companies that stand out here are EMC Corp. of
Hopkinton, Staples Inc. of Westborough, and TJX Cos. of Framingham.
The appreciation of their stocks has generated a combined $36
billion in increased shareholder value this year. The lion's share
of those gains was enjoyed by EMC shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't stocks that are getting a big bounce rebounding
from disappointments in 1997. EMC was up 65 percent last year.
Staples gained 53 percent and TJX jumped 46 percent in 1997. Each
company has done even better this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stack up all the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and
only two have outrun EMC's 199 percent gain for 1998 so far: Dell
Computer and Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   EMC didn't have a revolutionary new product in its line to get
that kind of stock market reaction. But it did have a leading
market position in a critical business, computer storage devices,
over big competitors such as IBM Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., and
Data General Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Fears over the impact of Asia's economic problems and the
competitive field never panned out. Quarterly sales topped $1
billion for the first time in this year's third quarter and 1998
earnings per share rose by 44 percent through September. By the
fall, chief executive Michael Ruettgers suggested that EMC had
gained market share.
</P>
<P>
   Staples, a leader in a business with paper thin margins, got
ahead with tight management controls and a series of acquisitions
to help improve its distribution into new areas and specific
categories of business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Staples shares have gained 138 percent this year; most
impressively, they held their own through the turmoil of the summer
and early fall. Competitor OfficeMax took it on the chin all
summer, losing nearly 60 percent in a May-to-October swoon and has
never really recovered.
</P>
<P>
   TJX, the giant off-price apparel retailer, made the most of
stronger sales earlier in the year and protected the bottom line
with tight inventory control later. The result: Sales have
increased about 10 percent while per-share operating profits are up
more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike EMC and Staples, TJX shareholders had to hold on tight
this year. Shares were nearly cut in half from summer to fall but
have rallied since October and hit a record high of 28 9/16
Tuesday. That's up 66 percent for the year.

BUSINESSES LEFT OUT DURING NBA LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As she surveys the bar and tables at The Fours, one of
the restaurants near the FleetCenter, Fran Manganiello says she
does not think much about the National Basketball Association
owners and players, millionaires who are fighting over their share
of $2 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   She just wishes they would settle the nearly six-month-old
lockout so she can hire more waitresses and bartenders and get her
business back up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to the point that you are really relying on two nights a
week,'' said Manganiello, an owner and manager. ``Business is off
40 to 45 percent. It's been really difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial impact on businesses large and small is growing as
the NBA lockout drags on. And from the kitchen at The Fours to the
marketing departments at Citizens Bank and Nike, companies are
reviewing their relationship with what was, until the lockout, the
most stable business among the four major sports.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first work stoppage in the NBA that has resulted in
the cancellation of games. The dire consequences of perhaps losing
the whole season _ are starting to sink in for this professional
sports league which has long been considered the leader in melding
its business with the marketing strategies of its sponsors and
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller businesses that benefit from fans spending in
neighborhoods around arenas like the FleetCenter, and big
businesses, that have spent $240 million in sponsorships and
hundreds of millions more every year to plan their advertising
around NBA games, are both beginning to wonder how severely the
cash cow is wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're draining a reservoir of good will that's been built up
over a number of years,'' said the NBA's chief marketing officer
Rick Welts. ``But there's still water in the reservoir. The
question is going to be: If this lasts a long time, how much water
is left?''
</P>
<P>
   For businesses around the FleetCenter, the story is much like
that of The Fours. Many restaurateurs, the people who park the cars
in the lots nearby and the staff inside the arena say that business
is down about 40 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best of all worlds,'' said George West, as he
sold Bruins programs on the loge level of the FleetCenter during a
recent game. ``I'm lucky, though. I am part time here and part time
working at Harvard, so it's not as bad as it might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau has estimated
the lockout is costing about $2 million in lost revenue per game _
$1 million inside the arena, and $1 million for surrounding
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that the $1 million outside of the FleetCenter
is a complete loss, though,'' said bureau executive director Pat
Moscaritolo. ``Economists talk about something called the
`substitute effect,' that is, that money might well get spent
elsewhere in the city, as companies and families decide to do their
entertaining at the symphony or someplace else, instead of with the
Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Fours, Manganiello often feels as though the
`substitutes' have replaced her lost business. For many of the
businesses in and around the FleetCenter, the events there might as
well be the only shows in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are really talking about having to rely on the two seasons
_ hockey and basketball _ and now that there's just one; it's that
much of an impact,'' said Manganiello.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the FleetCenter, President Richard A. Krezwick says they
are working to hit break-even, even if the season is canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources knowledgable about the building's financing say
the visitors bureau's numbers are close: each canceled Celtics'
game represents about $700,000 in lost ticket revenue; about
$200,000 in lost concession revenue for SportService, which is
owned by Jeremy Jacobs and Delware North; and parking rounding out
the $1 million in losses per game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, substantial revenue from the Bruins continues to pour
in, and the FleetCenter is trying to augment that with a number of
sold out concert dates from November through March, including two
Rolling Stones shows and Jimmy Buffett for one show.
</P>
<P>
   Krezwick said the FleetCenter is offering ticket refunds with
interest to Celtics fans, and officials are considering refunding
some of the one-time-only fees that were put up by largely
corporate customers for luxury boxes and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement states that there will be no refunds for strikes
or lockouts,'' said Krezwick. ``But we will be looking to do the
right thing, depending on how all of this works out.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and the players have larger, more direct concerns as the
lockout lingers. Banks, beverage manufacturers and athletic shoe
makers sink hundreds of millions of dollars into the league
annually to sponsor teams and to obtain the athlete's endorsements
for their products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing specialists say that none of those deals are as
valuable as they were before the lockout. Any company that did not
negotiate an exit or rebate clause as part of their current deal is
likely to demand it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Bank decided to proceed with its television advertising
campaign that features Celtic coach Rick Pitino as a demanding
customer seeking financial services. Bank officials say they are
happy with the ads, but they realize their $1 million per year
sponsorship deal with the Celtics is not as valuable as it would
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we wish they were playing because we get a lot of
added visibility at the games,'' said Arlene Fortunato, a vice
president and director of public affairs for Citizens. ``But it has
not hurt us a lot, because a substantial part of that is our
relationship with Rick Pitino _ and we're going ahead and doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtics and bank sources familiar with the deal say Citizens
will get a rebate this year, having secured the provision in
negotiating the deal with the team. Neither side would comment on
the size of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Several individuals who observe endorsement deals with the
players say they are concerned about when and if the endorsements
will recover after the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we have seen the apex in terms of player
endorsements,'' said Irving Rein, a Northwestern University
professor who studies the use of celebrities in advertising
campaigns. ``I think baseball had big problems with this after the
'94 strike, and it never really recovered in terms of endorsement
dollars. Even with Sosa and McGwire, they are still lagging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence is deafening,'' said Bob Williams, president of
Burns Sports, a Chicago-based company that links advertisers and
athletes. ``It's very bad, and the situation is deteriorating. It
happened in baseball, it happened in football and now the one sport
that seemed impervious to a work stoppage has done the unthinkable,
and advertisers are going to begin following the lead of those who
have crafted contracts so that if they are dealing with a work
stoppage, the athletes won't be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   For some companies like Converse Inc. and Reebok International
Ltd., the lockout only furthers what has become a trend. Sales of
athletic shoes have been in decline for almost two years, and more
and more companies are using fewer NBA players to sell their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, we just don't have that many shoe contracts
with players, anymore'' said Dave Fogelson, a Reebok spokesman.
``We had 100 players at one time, a number of years ago, in various
types of deals. Now, we're down to Shawn Kemp, Chauncey Billups and
six to eight other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike, however, the world's largest manufacturer of athletic
shoes, has individual endorsement relationships with 230 players.
The company is a major sponsor of the league, and it outfits 10
teams. Last week, when Nike reported a 51 percent quarterly decline
in earnings, its current television advertising campaign that urges
the owners and players to ``Start the season. Please!'' took on a
new sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the right way to look at it is that if we were a
fashion house, they've taken away one of our critical runways,''
said Nike chairman Phil Knight, when he announced the quarterly
earnings.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Dec. 31:
</P>
<P>
   NY-VOODOO (New York) _ For tens of thousands of Haitian emigres
who ``serve the spirits'' of voodoo in New York City, basements are
sacred places. In this private, neglected space closest to the
earth, Mama Lola, the 62-year-old matriarch and fifth-generation
mambo, or voodoo priestess, has crafted an intimate
one-stop-shopping center for the spirit in which every square inch
is packed with ritual objects used for healing work. By Patricia
Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ELDERLY-REFURNISHING (Undated) _ The words ``fresh start'' may
be some of the most delightful in the English language. And when
furnishing a new home is concerned, it is a delight for which age
is no barrier. Some residents of Logan Square East, a luxury
retirement high-rise in Philadelphia, have exploded the myth that
all older people who move into smaller quarters try to cram in as
many old pieces of oversize furniture as possible. These people,
all 75 or older and with the desire and budget to rethink their
lives, approached the move with a pioneering spirit. Their new
homes become opportunities to express new attitudes about life. By
Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   HAMPTONS-PROPERTY (New York) _ As Manhattan's real estate market
burbles merrily along _ stock market turmoil or no _ the real
estate market in the Hamptons on Long Island has been more like a
roller coaster. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   CARRYON-LUGGAGE (Undated) _ There was combat in the air and new
edge of tension at airport security check-ins last week. I'm
referring of course to the impact of the new carry-on baggage
policies facing holiday travelers and the resulting rivalry among
airlines, fought out on the dimensions of baggage. United and Delta
are pushing new standards of 22 by 14 by 9 inches or ``45 linear
inches. The linear inch (as opposed to the circular inch?) is an
expression of dimension as unfamiliar to most travelers as say the
airline executive's seat mile. Translated, the three numbers
represent about one and two thirds cubic feet. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   HULANICKI-HOTELS (Undated) _ In the hotel world, where the
interior designer's stylish solution is usually a sterile, Prozac
look, Barbara Hulanicki at least seems to be having fun. For the
past seven years she has been dazzling the locals in the South
Beach area of Miami and in the Bahamas with her exuberant hotel
interiors. For the remodeling of the Pink Sands Hotel, a hideaway
on Harbour Island in the Bahamas, she whisked together 17 colors
for the hotel's main house. She painted a billiard table shocking
pink and stained the patio at a guest bungalow hyacinth blue. No
wonder she wears sunglasses indoors and out. By Lucie Young.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-CLEANUP (Undated) _ In one swift move, the holiday
season upends the typical household in a flurry of trash, drips and
spills _ like a scene in a snow globe. Just as the house starts to
settle from Hanukkah and Christmas, New Year's Eve hits. There's
now enough candle wax on the dining-room table to give it a bikini
peel. The carpet has stocked enough wine _ red or white? _ to throw
a party. And the house has developed its own fragrance, like a
celebrity licensee. Think dirty chimneys, excited babies and
nervous pets, with hints of chocolate and champagne. By William L.
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ARROYO-SECO-GARDEN (Undated) _ Thousands of visitors jet here to
see the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl, and tens of thousands ply
Southern California's freeways to get to New Year's Day events. But
then there are the happy few who simply step out of their Craftsman
bungalows to head down the hiking trails of Arroyo Seco and walk to
the game via the city's majestic river canyon. The ritual trip down
boulder-lined stairways set among the oaks and sycamores and into
the fabled wash is not a short cut but a pleasure, known primarily
to residents of Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions ansewered.
</P>
<P>
   HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Undated) _ The Home Improvement column. By
Edward Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
   With howto drawing.

franchise's long history _ Chicago, St. Louis and then Arizona _
the playoffs have been a rare occurrence, with the last Cardinal
postseason victory coming 51 years ago. But now, thanks to a series
of last-second victories, they will be facing Dallas in the first
round on Saturday.

   FBN-49ERS (Undated) _ The San Francisco 49ers will be playing
host to the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the N.F.L.
playoffs on Sunday. The Packers have become the 49ers' nightmare,
the team that knocks them out of the playoffs one season after
another. By Bill Pennington.

<P>
   FBN-JETS (Undated) _ Bill Parcells has taken a Jets team that
was 1-15 in 1996 and turned them into a 12-4 division winner. He is
tough, cranky, smart and demanding and he clearly makes good use of
all the things he has learned in his long years of coaching. But to
a surprising degree, Parcells also dwells on the negative,
emphasizing the things that result in defeat. It is part of his
philosophy: Before you understand how to win, you must understand
why you lose. By Gerald Eskenazi.

<P>
   BKN-NBA-LABOR (Undated) _ With one week to go before the
N.B.A.'s Jan. 7 deadline to call off the season, both sides remain
locked in a standoff, with no indication that new talks are on the
horizon.

<P>
   FBC-ALAMO-BOWL (San Antonio, Texas) _ Folo on Kansas State's
surprising loss to Purdue in the Alamo Bowl. Kansas State just
missed out in playing for the national championship in the Fiesta
Bowl and instead ended up losing to middling Big Ten team in a far
less glamorous bowl game. By Joe Drape.

retirement high-rise in Philadelphia, have exploded the myth that
all older people who move into smaller quarters try to cram in as
many old pieces of oversize furniture as possible. These people,
all 75 or older and with the desire and budget to rethink their

   CARRYON-LUGGAGE (Undated) _ There was combat in the air and new
edge of tension at airport security check-ins last week. I'm
referring of course to the impact of the new carry-on baggage
policies facing holiday travelers and the resulting rivalry among
airlines, fought out on the dimensions of baggage. United and Delta
are pushing new standards of 22 by 14 by 9 inches or ``45 linear
inches. The linear inch (as opposed to the circular inch?) is an
expression of dimension as unfamiliar to most travelers as say the

look, Barbara Hulanicki at least seems to be having fun. For the
past seven years she has been dazzling the locals in the South
Beach area of Miami and in the Bahamas with her exuberant hotel
interiors. For the remodeling of the Pink Sands Hotel, a hideaway
on Harbour Island in the Bahamas, she whisked together 17 colors
for the hotel's main house. She painted a billiard table shocking
pink and stained the patio at a guest bungalow hyacinth blue. No
wonder she wears sunglasses indoors and out. By Lucie Young.

season upends the typical household in a flurry of trash, drips and

settle from Hanukkah and Christmas, New Year's Eve hits. There's
now enough candle wax on the dining-room table to give it a bikini
peel. The carpet has stocked enough wine _ red or white? _ to throw
a party. And the house has developed its own fragrance, like a

   ARROYO-SECO-GARDEN (Undated) _ Thousands of visitors jet here to

Southern California's freeways to get to New Year's Day events. But
then there are the happy few who simply step out of their Craftsman
bungalows to head down the hiking trails of Arroyo Seco and walk to

 &HT;    WITH NEW INSPECTION SYSTEM, A SHARP RISE IS REPORTED IN MEAT
CONTAMINATION CASES
 &HT;    Advance for release on or after Friday, Jan. 1.
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN and SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly a year after the U.S. Department of
Agriculture handed over many of its food monitoring tasks to the
meat and poultry industry, there has been a sharp rise in reports
of meat products contaminated with a deadly strain of E. coli
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Despite USDA's ``zero tolerance'' policy for E. coli 0157:H7, a
bacteria that can be deadly in very small amounts, a variety of
indicators suggest increased contamination by the pathogen:
</P>
<P>
   - The number of food recalls caused by E. coli 0157:H7
contamination has more than doubled since January 1998;
</P>
<P>
   - An Agriculture Department program begun in 1994 that randomly
samples ground beef has found more E. coli-contaminated meat this
year than in the past four years combined;
</P>
<P>
   - Records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) show that the number of E. coli outbreaks linked to ground
beef jumped from 2 in 1997 to 7 this year. An outbreak is defined
as two or more people getting sick from a single source.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one food industry executive says he saw an increase
this year in contaminated beef. David Theno, an executive for the
San Diego-based Jack-In-The-Box fast-food chain, which has one of
the most intensive bacterial testing programs in the industry, said
his company is finding more improperly prepared beef arriving from
slaughter houses.
</P>
<P>
   Government, industry and consumer groups differ sharply over the
meaning of the increased reports.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye Wachsmuth, an Agriculture Department official, said that
starting late last year, federal scientists increased the amount of
meat sampled in each test. Because of the larger sample size, they
have found more E. coli 0157:H7 and, as a result, ordered more
recalls. However, she added she was surprised by the number of E.
coli-positive tests this year. Also, nearly half of this year's E.
coli-related recalls were triggered by consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Meat industry spokesmen argue the meat supply is cleaner than it
has ever been and the increases merely show that there is greater
public awareness and expanded testing for the bacteria. Janet Riley
of the American Meat Institute said, for example, that emergency
room doctors are more likely to test for E. coli poisoning, thus
making it appear there is an increase in outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   There is also disagreement among consumer advocates. Felicia
Nestor of the Government Accountability Project (GAP), a non-profit
watchdog group, said, ``These numbers really concern me. I think
that demands explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donna Rosenbaum, a director of Safe Tables Our Priority
(STOP), another consumer group, said it is too early to say if the
increase represents any kind of trend.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause for the increase, it comes at a critical time
for federal food safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   Up until January of last year, government meat and poultry
inspections had changed little from the turn of the century.
Thousands of inspectors stationed in meat packing houses and
poultry plants around the nation visually inspected every carcass
and enforced detailed regulations on cleanliness. It was known as
the ``poke and sniff'' method of inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But starting this year, the Agriculture Department began to
phase in a new inspection program called ``Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Points'' (HACCP), which placed much of the onus on
meat and poultry producers to run their own inspection programs
using a series of tests to monitor bacteria levels in their
products.
</P>
<P>
   In this first phase only the 300 largest plants in the nation
were switched to the new HACCP inspection program. Six months after
the program began, the government cited a reduction in the
incidence of Salmonella, a food-borne bacteria in poultry, as a
sign the new program was succeeding. With the start of 1999, HACCP
will be expanded to 3,000 additional plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``HACCP is very new,'' Rosenbaum said. ``It is very early to
even be interpreting numbers. The numbers that are being generated
are Salmonella numbers. They don't necessarily have anything to do
with E. coli 0157:H7. It may very well be that HACCP concepts work
better for poultry than livestock.''
</P>
<P>
   But Theno asserted that one of the unintentional effects of
implementing HACCP has been an increase in E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of testing and refusing to do business with
meat packing plants that supply contaminated meat, Theno said his
company was able to reduce the incidence of E.coli 0157:H7 in their
sampling program to essentially zero in 8,500 tests. But this year,
he said, the company is finding one positive sample in every
thousand tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that (HACCP) is worse,'' Theno said. ``It is just
that there is a transition time where things may not get covered as
well. Some of these plants had been very involved in trying to make
absolutely certain they were all set up to integrate HACCP and all
the regulations and frankly they have kind of taken their eye off
the ball in a couple of instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestor, who works with whistle-blowers in the government such as
federal meat and poultry inspectors, worries that this trend will
only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've only implemented (HACCP) in 300 of the plants,''
Nestor said. ``Those are the most modern and technologically
advanced of the plants. And according to the inspectors, the
startup was really difficult. Now in January they are going to be
implementing it into 3,000 plants They have not seen the challenge
yet at all.''

CROSSING THE LINE WITH NOLTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Nick Nolte looks almost civilized.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice, deceptive change. The eccentric actor usually walks
around in fuzzy pajamas or green surgical scrubs, but today he's
turned out in a sleek, gray-striped suit and a shirt with
silver-linked French cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if Nolte's dressing for success _ and succeeding
at it (the 57-year-old actor is enjoying the best notices of his
career for his work in the films ``Affliction'' and ``The Thin Red
Line''). Almost, but not quite; Nolte's face is framed by three
days' worth of stubble and a lion's mane of flyaway, silver-sandy
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that voice, the crusty growl that gives his most
passionate intellectual insights an animal bite. Clothes can't hide
the fact that Nolte is still one of the movies' most dangerous,
stone-cold rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ferocity? That's fairly easy for me to access,'' Nolte says,
with a smile that does nothing to soften his statement. ``I've been
delving into rage for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   For his whole adult life, it could be said. A failed college
football player who left school practically illiterate, Nolte has
fought a drinking problem, the U.S. government (he was arrested in
the early '60s for selling fake draft cards) and three ex-wives
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a decade to make the move from stage work to
television and movies. And even after the '70s miniseries ``Rich
Man, Poor Man'' and his 1977 feature debut ``The Deep'' established
Nolte's star power, he always brought a rough, hair-trigger quality
to even the most mainstream commercial efforts (the ``48 HRS.''
comedies, Disney's ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills,'' Barbra
Streisand's ``The Prince of Tides'').
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nolte eagerly pursued the most difficult,
over-the-edge emotional challenges the art-film sector had to
offer. In the process, he created a distinguished gallery of movie
malcontents, ranging from the self-destructive protagonists of
``Who'll Stop the Rain,'' ``Q&AMP;A'' and ``Afterglow'' to the doomed
idealists of ``Under Fire,'' ``I'll Do Anything'' and even the
underappreciated ``Jefferson in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that, and a lot more, seems excellent preparation for
``Red Line's'' fire-breathing Col. Tall and ``Affliction's''
profoundly dysfunctional Wade Whitehouse. They are, respectively,
his most furious and poignant performances to date.
</P>
<P>
   In Terrence Malick's all-but-incoherent adaptation of James
Jones' celebrated World War II novel, Nolte provides some
much-needed focus as Tall, an aging but untested West Pointer whose
determination to take a hill on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal
threatens to decimate his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an older man, and he's quite driven,'' Nolte explains.
``I tried to build a man who, when he got to the battlefield, was
self-will run riot. But he has a logical argument on his side, and
I worked real hard to make Col. Tall seem rational in his
assessment of the battle. He has to contrast Elias' character, who
is arguing human compassion on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias is Canadian actor Elias Koteas, whose Capt. Staros balks
at Tall's orders to send his men into a suicidal frontal assault on
entrenched Japanese positions. Koteas confirms that the charged
confrontation between Tall and Staros was reflected off-camera _
and this was a match-up the younger actor had dreamed of his whole
professional life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a huge fan of Nick's; watching him in `Rich Man,
Poor Man' was one of the reasons I became an actor,'' says Koteas.
``I remember crying; I wanted to affect people the way he was
affecting me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years later, you're in this volatile situation with the
man, who's going to run over you if you don't know what you're
doing, cause he knows what he's doing; he came with pages and pages
of where he came from and where he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how strong is Nolte's ``Red Line'' performance? Consider a
typical day at the film's Australian rain forest location.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one scene, where Tall is yelling at Staros over a field
phone, Terry said, `We're going to have full-load howitzers go off
behind you, and you have to be more powerful on that phone than the
howitzers,' '' Nolte recalls. ``We literally shot it with those
guns going off behind me. The percussion would go WHAM! and the
grass would move, and I could just feel the concussion come behind
me _ and, of course, I chose not to wear earplugs, so I couldn't
hear for several weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the amazing thing was, when we finished the take, I looked
over at the camera crew and everyone was jumping around and
brushing at their clothes like mad. All of these jungle bugs had
fled from the concussion and crawled up the people as they were
trying to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Tall may be the military's loudest mad dog, but his was a
comfortable craziness compared to ``Affliction's'' pitiful Wade
Whitehouse's. Indeed, Paul Schrader, who adapted and directed the
wintry, eminently depressing picture based on Russell (``The Sweet
Hereafter'') Banks' novel, lost financing for the project several
years ago when Nolte got cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, I was really reluctant to go to the place I had
to go in `Affliction','' Nolte admits. ``I told Paul I wasn't quite
ready to do that role yet, the money fell through, and of course
Paul was quite upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schrader, who has written such relentlessly bleak movies as
``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull,'' also understood that even an
actor of Nolte's dark sensitivities had to work up courage for so
hopeless a role.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply damaged son of a vicious, alcoholic farmer (James
Coburn), Wade fails at everything _ marriage, fatherhood, romance,
even his undemanding police chief job in a quiet New England town _
and compounds each mistake with misguided passions, intoxicated
foolishness and, inevitably, violent rage.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to intimidate Nolte. Which is mighty intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an examination of the violence that we all are,''
Nolte says. ``And the difficulty of doing it is that you have to
get to the archetypal violence; you can't just play off of your own
intellectual anger, or your dislike of this or that. And when you
go there, you have to discover that you, literally, are the killer.
You are also the compassionate man, that is the broad range of who
we are. But that means you have to take the responsibility for
violence yourself, just as we all love to take the responsibility
for doing good.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of which meant that I had to go to that place, and my
reluctance to go there was because I still wanted to think in terms
of justifiable rage, justifiable murder, as you rationalize daily
with your own emotions. And once there, I learned this valuable
lesson that I am the killer _ and this is what, desperately, Wade
Whitehouse is trying to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds unusually erudite for a college flunk-out, it
should come as no surprise to those who know Nolte as a voracious
researcher. His copious studying for every role, and for his own
pleasure, has made the hell-raising lug one of the most
authoritative _ and original _ thinkers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Well, make that one who lives near Hollywood. For the past
several years, Nolte has said no to all but the most outre studio
offers (``Red Line,'' Oliver Stone's ``U-Turn''), and concentrated
almost exclusively on low-paying but creatively satisfying
independent productions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of mental survival, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core issue is to get reconnected to your passion,'' he
explains. ``You know, when you do films for commercial success, or
to repeat a success, you lose your connection to why you act. If
you do one of those $100 million films, and you have to sit on it
for six months, it's a really draining and life-defeating
experience. No matter how you rationalize it, those films are meant
for a broad-based audience from 14 to 26. They're not going to
examine the truth of the issue; they're trying to get at an
appealing piece of entertainment so they can make money. Now, I
have no objections to any of that; it's just death for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, a while back, I became upset with myself a little bit and
I decided I would only do things that I truly love,'' he reveals.
``No other consideration. If I go broke, that's fine. If I have to
downscale living, that's fine. I haven't made a decent salary
since, and I'm loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently. Nolte has a number of small films coming up,
including an adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's ``Breakfast of
Champions,'' the Albert Brooks comedy ``Muse'' and ``Simpatico,''
co-starring Jeff Bridges and Sharon Stone and based on a Sam
Shepard play.
</P>
<P>
   He's also planning to produce and star in a movie version of
James Ellroy's ``White Jazz,'' a sequel of sorts to the noir
novelist's acclaimed ``L.A. Confidential.'' Unsurprisingly, ``Demon
Dog of American Literature'' Ellroy and Nolte are longtime friends.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder; Nolte's always loved writers who can illuminate his
own darker places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became an actor to chase the authors, because the authors
were speaking to me in a psychological way,'' he recalls. ``In
other words, I needed to be on the stage and play this role in
`Death of a Salesman' at this time because those were my issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because I was psychologically screwed-up,'' he says with
a thoroughly unconvincing, ``I'm-joking-here'' laugh. ``It's
because the world, to me, is violent and brutal and hard. When
you're acting, you can participate in that and explore and express.
The minute I hit the stage, I knew I was home. I had no choice; it
was about survival.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; At its most essential, radio is a timekeeper _ it
offers entertainment, a way into the world for many, but it also
can be a device for marking time.
</P>
<P>
   That fact often is overlooked in the current blizzard of
multimillion-dollar takeover deals, high-priced syndication efforts
and ever-expanding personalities.
</P>
<P>
   That's the genesis of our annual Eggtimer Awards, given for the
most inflated egos of the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Eggtimers go to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Art Bell, the overnight nudnik who resigned from his
syndicated ``Coast to Coast'' program Oct. 13 under ``mysterious''
circumstances, only to return two weeks later after the nation's
press went into hyperdrive over the still-unexplained
disappearance. Bell's ``terrible, life-threatening event'' probably
had something to do with contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   _ KLSX-FM (97.1) programmers, because one Howard Stern is never
enough. For years, the famous New York morning man was the
station's only ratings winner until it was decided to fill air time
with his biggest fans. The station's ID should be: ``Howard Stern
all morning, Howard Stern imitators all day.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don Imus, for blaming the antenna. Locally low-rated
syndicated morning host Imus spent his time at KLAC-AM (570)
sniping at the station's signal strength and promotional budget.
Now firmly ensconced at KRLA-AM (1110), it remains to be seen if
anything will change for the grizzled radio vet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Ballance, former loveline host and mentor to syndicated
KFI-AM (640) moralist Laura Schlessinger, posted nude pictures of
his former lover on the Internet. Who said chivalry is dead?
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD AGAIN: What's the hot topic with Los Angeles
drivers?
</P>
<P>
   Road rage, say Kenny Morse and Reed Berry, co-hosts of ``Traffic
Jam,'' the Saturday show on KRLA that looks behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are testy,'' Morse said. ``They're honking and flipping
each other off. Drivers don't use turn signals because it's
considered signaling the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   The call-in show, which airs this week at 10 a.m. and moves to 1
p.m. on Jan. 9, features interviews with well-known local residents
such as Jay Yustation devoted to traffic reports.
</P>
<P>
   LEAPING LUNA: After nearly 20 years at KTNQ-AM (1020), popular
Spanish-language morning host Humberto Luna jumps to KLAX-AM
(97.9). ... Ira Fistell surfaces Monday on KRLA for a new nightly
show airing at 11 p.m. Fistell joins fellow KABC-AM (790) alums
Michael Jackson and Ken Minyard, both of whom also start Monday,
and Dr. Toni Grant. ... Urban r&AMP;b station the Beat (92.3) hires
Detroit radio exec Michael Saunders as program director. &QL;

PUTTING DUCTS AT MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY 
</HEADLINE>

(JT) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ducts are essentially channels designed to direct air from one
place to another. They are made of sheet metal and are usually
rectangular and in sections. Homes with forced air heating systems
have a network of ducts that convey heated air from the furnace to
all the rooms in the house. Since ducts have only a few moving
parts _ dampers to control the flow of air _ it might seem that
they would require no maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   This is true enough, provided that the duct work was properly
installed and that the seals between sections have remained intact
over the years. If not, much of the heated air from the furnace
will escape before it can get to the living quarters of the house.
By locating and sealing up these leaks, the homeowner can make the
heating system more efficient and lower heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to evaluate the efficiency of a heating duct system
is to have a heating specialist run a flow hood or blower door test
on the ductwork. Both tests are effective in determining the amount
of leakage in the system and in pinpointing where the leaks are.
</P>
<P>
   The costs for the tests vary, from $250 to $500, depending upon
the size of the heating system in a house. The biggest problem that
the homeowner may encounter, however, is finding a qualified
technician to perform these tests. The tests were only developed
and standardized within the last few years, so only a few heating
specialists are even aware of them, much less trained to perform
them.
</P>
<P>
   Still the homeowner should inspect as much of the duct system as
possible. Pay particular attention to the seams around the return
air plenum, all joints where branch ducts connect to the main line
and the junction point where a duct is attached to a room outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Sealing leaking air ducts is also important because they can
suck up unwanted materials like insulation fiber (if the broken
duct runs through the attic) or insecticide (if the duct runs
through a crawlspace) and spew it into the house air.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a loose duct connection, first clean it with a rag
dipped in nonflammable cleaning fluid, then close the gap by
installing sheet metal screws through the duct flanges. (Do not use
sheet metal screws on clothes dryer ducts because they capture the
airborne lint. Eventually, the lint accumulations will clog the
duct opening). Finally, seal the joint with aluminum-faced duct
tape. Do not use the familiar cloth-backed duct tape for sealing
seams and joints. It deteriorates quickly when exposed to heat; for
this reason, many local codes prohibit its use on heating ducts.
Another way to seal duct seams is with three-inch-wide fiberglass
scrim tape. Wrap the seam with the tape, then paint over it with
water base duct sealant (these products are available at
air-conditioning supply outlets).
</P>
<P>
   There may be times when you will want to add or modify an air
duct. Even if you don't have a forced air heating system, you may
need to install an exhaust fan that requires a duct to carry
exhaust air to the outside. Or if you purchase a clothes dryer, you
will have to install a duct to carry the hot air through an
exterior wall.
</P>
<P>
   Working with metal ductwork requires a few specialized tools.
You will need tin snips to cut the ducts to length and to cut holes
for a connecting branch. You can get by with almost any kind of tin
snip, but aviation shears will make the cutting job easier,
especially if you have to work in cramped quarters (between
joists). Unlike standard tin snips, aviation shears have compound
lever-action handles that provide extra power for metal cutting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they are available with three different jaw
configurations for making straight cuts, cutting circles to the
left and for cutting circles to the right. The handles are color
coded so you can tell at a glance which tool is which. Straight
cutting snips have yellow handles, right-cutting snips have green
handles and red-handled snips are left-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   The shears are good for cutting through a single layer of sheet
metal, but use a hack saw with a fine-tooth blade (32 teeth per
inch) to cut through the seams. Cutting across these thick seams
can quickly dull even the best shears. If you have to install sheet
metal screws, you need to drill pilot holes first. For this you
will need a machinist's hammer, a prick punch and a drill with
suitable bits.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy-duty work gloves are essential when handling metal ducts.
The sharp edges produced after the metal has been sheared can
easily make nasty cuts in your hands. Also, to be on the safe side,
wear safety goggles to protect your eyes when working in cramped
quarters.

   &UR; Blooming Pips &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have heard that it is possible to force lily of the valley
to bloom indoors in the winter. I have them in my garden, and I
wonder _ can I just dig them up and bring them inside or is there
more to it than that?
</P>
<P>
   A. More, but not a great deal. Dig and lift the
lily-of-the-valley rhizome and cut pieces about as large as a thick
finger, making sure that each piece contains a distinct bud, or
eye. Those pieces are called pips.
</P>
<P>
   To grow and bloom, these pips, unlike the Pips that backed up
Gladys Knight, need to go through a cooling period of eight weeks
at soil temperatures no warmer than 45 degrees. They should be
wrapped in barely moist peat moss, put in a plastic bag and placed
in the coldest part of your refrigerator _ low and in back, near
those forgotten leftovers. Some bulbs and rhizomes can have their
flowering inhibited by ethylene gas, so you may want to first eat
all your apples, pears, cantaloupes and tomatoes, which produce
this gas. Maybe blend them into a peculiar but very healthy drink.
</P>
<P>
   Since lily of the valley does well in low light, the pips can be
potted up just below the surface in a rich, well-drained medium and
put near any window in the house, once they have been through the
cooling period. They'll bloom in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to save your refrigerator for food, you can try to
guess when the ground is going to freeze. Since the pips don't care
where they get their cooling, you can wait until the last minute to
dig them. As long as the soil temperature stays below 45 degrees,
the time counts toward the eight weeks. If you miss your guess and
the ground freezes solid, you can still enjoy the flowers next
spring, right there in your garden.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1999 Award Winners &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The spotlights were dim and the movie stars stayed home, but the
awards were given out nonetheless. The 1999 horticultural awards,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society has given gold medals
since 1988 to underappreciated trees, shrubs, and woody vines that
are hardy from Washington to New York City. And since 1997, several
horticultural societies and professional groups in New England have
presented the Cary Awards for outstanding woody plants that are
hardy in New England. This year, each group picked three
outstanding garden performers. One of them might be perfect in your
garden.
</P>
<P>
   And the Pennsylvania winners are ...
</P>
<P>
   _Acer palmatum Waterfall, a small, green-leaved Japanese maple
with a cascading habit, which slowly reaches 12 feet by 18 feet.
Brilliant gold-red, deeply cut leaves make it a center of interest
every fall.
</P>
<P>
   _Enkianthus perulatus J.L. Pennock, a graceful shrub, grows six
feet high and wide. White flowers are out before the leaves emerge,
but its real glory comes in fall. Beginning with a purple tinge, it
gradually turns a spectacular red.
</P>
<P>
   _Metasequoia glyptostroboides, dawn redwood, is a fast-growing
tree that can eventually reach 100 feet. It has very fine-textured
bright green foliage that turns a lovely burnt-orange before it
drops in autumn. It has a neat, conical form and has a presence
about it that makes it the focal point of any larger property.
</P>
<P>
   The Cary Award winners are ...
</P>
<P>
   _Cornus mas, cornelian cherry dogwood, a 20-foot tree that is
covered with tiny yellow flowers before the leaves emerge in
spring. It ends the fall with ripening red fruit and it has peeling
bark when mature.
</P>
<P>
   _Ilex x meserveae Blue Prince and Blue Princess share an award.
Both of these hollies have glossy foliage and grow to about 15
feet, but can be pruned. Blue Princess sets a lot of fruit, but she
needs a Blue Prince nearby.
</P>
<P>
   _Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, bearberry or kinnikinick, is a native
New England evergreen ground cover. Slow growing, it has glossy
green leaves that turn bronzy in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Complete descriptions and sources for all these winners are
available by sending self-addressed envelopes bearing 55 cents in
stamps to Gold Medal Plant Awards, Pennsylvania Horticultural
Society, 100 North 20th Street, Fifth Floor, Philadelphia 19103; or

RESOLUTIONS FOR HAPPY PC YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the scene in ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' when the apes
confront their first computer? The computer just sits there, a
silent monolith, unblinking, not even deigning to offer a cryptic
error message. The apes have no access to technical support and,
driven mad by frustration, they grab clubs and go on a rampage,
smiting any chimp who is wearing a pocket protector.
</P>
<P>
   We can empathize with the apes, who probably did not have a firm
grasp of the basic concepts of computer maintenance, including
making regular backups, using a surge suppressor, installing a
virus protection program and familiarizing themselves with utility
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Boring, yes, but so are seat belts, antilock brakes, life
insurance and dental floss.
</P>
<P>
   Computers need not make monkeys of us as long as we take some
basic steps to minimize potential glitches in the coming year.
Following are basic tips for new users, and suggested New Year's
resolutions for veterans, to keep their computers humming along.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of our list is a good software utility package, and
the Symantec Corporation comes to the rescue just in time with
Norton System Works 1.1 (for Windows 95 and 98), which was
introduced earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   System Works comprises five major programs, each excellent on
its own, that in various ways are intended to identify and fix
computer problems before they become serious. The programs are the
venerable Norton Utilities, Norton Antivirus, Norton Clean-sweep
and Norton Crashguard plus a six-month subscription to Norton Web
Services.
</P>
<P>
   System Works is a suite of utilities, and it is a sweet deal. At
a list price of $69.95, the System Works package costs much less
than purchasing each program separately. In a case of ``monkey see,
monkey do,'' Symantec obviously saw how lucrative Microsoft Office
was for Microsoft and decided to try the same approach with
utilities. Regardless of its motive, the result is a happy one for
consumers, who need click the installation button only once. Also,
all the programs can be updated at once via the Internet using
Norton's Web Services (a service that normally costs $29.95 a
year).
</P>
<P>
   The flagship utility is Norton Utilities, which has the best
diagnostic, tuneup and disaster-recovery tools I've seen in one
program. Norton Antivirus is a strong line of defense against
software viruses. Norton Crashguard minimizes the chances of
Windows system crashes. And, new to Version 1.1, is Norton
Cleansweep, a dandy utility that scours the computer for unneeded,
redundant or temporary files, including Internet caches and cookie
crumbs. Anyone who has tried to ``uninstall'' a Windows program
that is no longer needed will appreciate Clean-sweep.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more, as they say on television. System Works
1.1 also comes with a bonus pack of software including Norton 2000
(a utility that checks to make sure the computer can cope with the
infamous Year 2000 problem), Norton Mobile Essentials for laptop
users who travel a lot, PC Anywhere Express for remote access,
Norton Secret Stuff (a simple encryption program for keeping e-mail
messages private) and Visual Page, a Web-page design program.
</P>
<P>
   These are second-banana programs, but since they are free and
installation is optional, their addition to the package is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec has no plans for a Mac version of System Works. On the
bright side, Norton Utilities for Macintosh is very good. Mac users
will pound their chests and proclaim that because Macs misbehave
less often than Windows machines, there is less need for an arsenal
of System Works utilities.
</P>
<P>
   As noted earlier, System Works includes a very good antivirus
program. But a common mistake among computer users is thinking that
once an antivirus utility is installed, their worries are over.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who invites files into the computer from the outside
world _ and that includes anyone who uses e-mail, ``borrows''
programs from friends or downloads files from the Internet _ is at
risk for computer viruses. Viruses are nasty little pieces of code
that can cause problems once they are inside the computer. The
problems range from annoying mischief (causing messages to appear
on the screen) to malicious destruction of data, including the
complete loss of data on the hard disk. Viruses do not cause
hardware damage, no matter what your friend said about a friend of
a friend whose monitor burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, computer users are far less likely to get a virus
than they are to get an urgent warning about a virus threat passed
along via e-mail from friend to friend, alerting everyone they know
to something that was exposed as a hoax long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But new viruses are being written all the time, and if an
antivirus program has not been updated recently, it cannot defend
against the new threat. That is why it is important to refresh the
program periodically via the Internet. Most of the major antivirus
packages allow online updates for a specified time after purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The real risk to hardware comes not from viruses but from power
surges, spikes and brownouts and ``line noise,'' which occur on
electric lines all the time. Some of these transient electrical
events are nasty enough to knock out delicate circuitry inside the
computer. The insidious thing about them is that the damage is done
before the user is aware that there was a risk.
</P>
<P>
   So buy a good surge suppressor. A surge protector, in the form
of either a power strip or a control base, can detect and clamp
down on all but the worst voltage fluctuations in just nanoseconds,
protecting the computer and its peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   While today's computers are fairly robust when it comes to
handling power anomalies, spending $50 to $100 or so on a decent
surge suppressor is excellent insurance. I recently paid $80 for a
Kensington Masterpiece Plus, which is about the size of a pizza box
and includes enough sockets for all my computer components. It has
a rating of 1,400 joules. In general, the higher the joule rating,
the better job the device will do in protecting the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of low-cost power strips that portray themselves as surge
protectors but do not list the joule rating. A $10 power strip is
no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   What is the worst thing that can happen to a computer, short of
being stolen? Most veterans will say they don't fear the loss of
their computers as much as they fear the loss of their data.
</P>
<P>
   Make a New Year's resolution to back up important data
regularly. Steel yourself to the fact that your computer will fail
someday and that the repair technician will simply throw away your
old hard disk and replace it with a new one. All your files will go
to data heaven. There are many different philosophies and
strategies about backing up data, and we will discuss them at
length in a future column.
</P>
<P>
   Make another resolution to use a screen saver. Any computer
monitor, whether it is a conventional type with a cathode-ray tube
or a liquid crystal display on a laptop, is subject to a long-term
problem of burned-out pixels, resulting in ghost images on screen.
There are screen savers built into both the Windows and Mac
operating systems, but not everyone uses them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember in ``2001'' when a mainframe computer named
Hal gradually begins misbehaving and eventually becomes a paranoid
homicidal maniac? Although the film does not specifically mention
it, we now understand that Hal was merely suffering from the ``year
2000 bug,'' a programming glitch that will affect millions of
computers and embedded controller chips just one orbit around the
sun from now, on 01-01-00.

   &UR; Why Screens Seem to `Roll' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whenever a computer monitor is shown on television, why is
there a line or streak that appears to roll down the monitor?
</P>
<P>
   A. The National Television System Committee standard for
recording is about 30 frames per second, so videotape is recorded
at that speed. Ordinary computer monitors, which contain internal
electron guns that illuminate the phosphor-coated glass to create
the image, refresh their screens at a different rate. Monitor
refresh rates are measured in hertz, or cycles per second, and
rates of 60, 67 and 75 hertz are most common. If you have a
60-hertz computer monitor, that means it is redrawing the picture
you see on the screen 60 times each second.
</P>
<P>
   When you see a computer monitor on television and you notice
that rolling line or flickering, you are seeing the refresh rate
for the monitor, which is out of synch by a fraction of a second
with the frame rate for the video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Computer monitors refreshing at a rate of 75 hertz have the most
noticeable streaking on the television screen. Displays running at
60 hertz (refreshing roughly twice for each video frame) look the
best on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 67-hertz machine, you can see the variation,'' said Amy
Morang, a support technician at Radius, a maker of computer
monitors and digital video products. ``The gun position will be at
a different place at each frame, so it `rolls.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jews may be the People of the Book, but they have come to
cherish the CD-ROM, particularly the CD-ROM's ability to store a
lot of religious text and teach children about the traditions of
Judaism in an entertaining fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The two major distributors of Judaic software are the Davka
Corp. (www.davka.com), based in Chicago, and Torah Educational
Software (www.torahscholar.com), in Jerusalem. Davka, which has
been around since 1982, grew out of the Institute for Computers in
Jewish Life. CD's with Judaic graphics and Hebrew-language software
are the most popular categories in Davka's catalog of more than 100
titles, said Rabbi Irving Rosenbaum, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Torah Educational Software was started in 1991 by a newly
Orthodox Jew who became fascinated with Bible codes. He emigrated
from the United States to Israel and runs TES with another American
businessman who moved to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, Hebrew word-processing software has
been a big part of TES' business. The company distributes what may
be the most comprehensive _ and expensive _ CD-ROM in the Jewish
market: Bar-Ilan University's Judaic Library version 6.0. It sells
for $698 and contains the Torah, the Talmud and about 200 other
religious texts. The CD is the fruit of Bar-Ilan's Responsa
Project, which has been transcribing religious texts for computer
use for 30 years. The first version of Judaic Library sold for
$1,200, but each subsequent version has come with more text, an
improved search engine and a lower price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there were rumblings of criticism among Orthodox Jews
of the use of CD-ROM technology, Rabbi Rosenbaum said, but the
disks are now stocked by religious-supply stores, like those in the
Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. Sales of religious CD's in
Orthodox neighborhoods tend to be of the Hebrew-only variety. The
study of holy texts is the ultimate priority in the Orthodox world,
and many publishers of Judaic software say they expect something of
a buzz when DVD disks arrive with the layout of the Talmud page on
the screen mimicking the way the pages appear in bound copies.
</P>
<P>
   The devotion to Torah study has led some Jews to justify the
counterfeiting of software. But last week, a rabbinical court in
Jerusalem ruled that it was a sin to make unauthorized copies of
CD-ROM's. The rabbis said that while counterfeiting was not the
equivalent of stealing, it was like trespassing and that Jews who
bought bootleg CD's were ``helping the sinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious Jews, in pairs of study partners, have been reading
and discussing their holy books in study halls for millenniums. It
is most unlikely that the advent of digital technology will change
that. But in this technological age, CD-ROM's are likely to become
an increasingly important tool in that learning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Nightmare Told in Words and Pictures &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVORS: TESTIMONIES OF THE HOLOCAUST
</P>
<P>
   (Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation; two-disk set
for $29.95, or $69.95 for two sets with a study guide; Macintosh
7.1 and up and Windows 95 and up.)
</P>
<P>
   This set of CD-ROM's features accounts from the huge digital
archive of the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation.
Something of a technological marvel, the 150-terabyte archive (a
terabyte is a trillion bytes or 1,000 gigabytes) contains
videotaped oral histories from close to 50,000 Holocaust survivors.
The foundation was started by the director Steven Spielberg after
he made the film ``Schindler's List.'' The recording of survivors'
accounts began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This CD-ROM compilation uses the stories of four survivors _
Bert, Sol, Sylvia and Paula _ to teach the history and geography of
the Holocaust to students in grades seven and above. (A 32-page
study guide created by Facing History and Ourselves, a Holocaust
education group, comes with the purchase of a two-set teacher's
pack.)
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM is narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio and Winona Ryder,
two Hollywood heartthrobs the foundation no doubt hopes will draw
in young people.
</P>
<P>
   The graphic design of the CD-ROM is muted, which is appropriate
given the horrific nature of the information conveyed. Over a
charred parchment background, sepia photographs and occasional
snippets of black-and-white newsreels appear and dissolve as in a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   One very effective aspect of the CD's interface is revealed by
placing a pointer on a photograph. The contrast darkens and a
couple of lines explaining the context of the picture appear in a
window below it.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 80 minutes of survivors' accounts is divided into
nine time periods: before the war, after the war and year by year,
starting in 1939 and ending in 1945. Students can follow the
progress of a particular survivor throughout the course of the
Holocaust or track all four of them in any given period.
</P>
<P>
   A map of Europe is available for each time period. A valuable
index of terms, locations, historical figures and events benefits
from the Shoah Foundation's extensive cataloguing of the oral
histories. You highlight a selection in a frame on the left of the
screen and definitions appear in a frame on the right; the
definitions range from a sentence to several paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   A two-sentence entry on Birkenau, for example, explains that it
was a death camp added to the Auschwitz complex in 1941 and that
more than a million Jews were murdered there ``with horrible
efficiency.'' The index devotes three paragraphs to war criminals
and war crimes, mentioning the Nuremberg trials and the Cold War's
impact on prosecutions and listing prominent Nazis who were never
brought to justice and a couple who were.
</P>
<P>
   The shortcomings of Testimonies of the Holocaust are minor. You
have to sit through the same two-and-a-half-minute introduction
every time you start up the CD-ROM. Some screens scroll down in a
jerky fashion, leaving users wondering whether they have gone too
far down in the text. And then there is the background music,
somber strings that play while no one is speaking. It just isn't
necessary and gets to be slightly grating after a while.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But this is an excellent educational resource, thoughtfully
designed and thorough in its presentation. The foundation gets high
marks for approaching this task by telling the stories of four
individuals, putting faces and voices to the horrors of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From the Torah to the Zohar &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SONCINO CLASSICS COLLECTION
</P>
<P>
   (Davka; $589; Macintosh 6.5 and up, and Windows 3.1 and 95.)
</P>
<P>
   The Soncino Classics Collection is a high-end title from the
Davka Corp. It contains the complete English, Hebrew and Aramaic
texts of the Torah; the Talmud; a collection of teachings and
interpretations of Biblical verse known as the Midrash Rabbah, and
the Zohar, the principal text of Jewish mysticism. The disk also
includes Hebrew-only versions of a number of Talmudic commentaries.
And the Hebrew version of the Bible has vowels and cantillation
marks, which will be useful for those who are learning to read or
chant the Torah. Hebrew and English text can also be displayed in
windows that scroll by simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of the enormous amount of text on this disk, I
called up one of the five books of Moses in English and put my
scroll bar on automatic pilot. (``In the beginning'' seemed like a
good place to start.) It took nearly five minutes to scroll through
the 50 chapters of Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is that users are unable to search for a particular
weekly Torah portion, or parsha, as it is known in Hebrew, by name.
The parshas have Hebrew names and are read each week. The coming
parsha is Vayechi, and after consulting a hard copy of the Old
Testament, I found that it begins with Chapter 48 of Genesis. Only
then was I able to track it on the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   The English translation of the Talmud on the Soncino Classics
CD-ROM seems to have more footnotes than actual text. In a
six-paragraph chapter, I found 34 footnotes. And the text is
diligently indexed: in the English Talmud, there are 23 citations
for the word ``goat'' and 37 for ``poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's nothing compared with Moses, who had 1,432
citations in the Talmud. When you search for Moses, a results
window appears, listing all the lines in which Moses is mentioned.
Double click on Moses in any one of those lines, and a new window
comes up immediately with the portion of the Talmud where that
particular citation is found. The search word is highlighted, and
you can scroll up or down to read enough of the Talmud to get the
context of the citation.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM allows you to pick from eight colors, including
magenta, for the background and text. You may use any font
available on your computer for the English text.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has English as well as Hebrew and Aramaic versions of
the texts, this disk can be used by beginners and advanced
students. For all but the most advanced scholars, it will be more
than adequate.
</P>
<P>
   My rabbi assures me that if you drop this CD-ROM, it isn't
necessary to kiss it, even though the disk contains the Almighty's
name in a digital form.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Not Too Triumphant Effort &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRIUMPH OF SURVIVAL:THE STORY OF THE JEWS IN THE MODERN ERA,
1650-1990
</P>
<P>
   (Davka; $59.95; Macintosh 6.5 and up, and Windows 3.1 and
later.)
</P>
<P>
   This two-disk CD-ROM set is based on the book of the same name
by Berel Wein, a rabbi and prolific historian. Rabbi Wein clearly
has an impressive command of Jewish history and these disks cover a
lot of ground, but they are also a classic example of why using a
multimedia format for its own sake is a waste of megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The short videos of showing Rabbi Wein sitting at a desk in his
study lecturing on particular periods are unnecessary. The
information would be more efficiently presented as text. And the
video clips of brief television-reporter-like stand-ups by the
rabbi (at Theodor Herzl's grave in Jerusalem or the original Carmel
Wine factory) are frustrating. We don't want to see the historian.
We want to see these places of historical significance. The
producers went through the expense of shooting on location. Better
to have panned the scenes and left the historian at home.
</P>
<P>
   There are some compelling clips. We get to watch a
black-and-white film of David Ben Gurion declaring the Jewish state
on May 14, 1948. There is color news footage of Palestinian youths
throwing stones at Israeli troops during the intifada, Israeli
civilians wearing gas masks during the Persian Gulf war and
mourners reciting Kaddish at Yitzhak Rabin's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Triumph of Survival uses audio, too, and the problems there are
more evident. I clicked on a couple of ``hear audio'' links in a
section on the Orthodox resurgence in America, and there was no
sound. A picture came up instead. What the producers call ``audio
stories'' on Jewish personalities are really cursory off-camera
segments, 30 to 40 seconds long, by Rabbi Wein. Better to have a
fiery sound bite of Meir Kahane or an excerpt of a classroom
discourse of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, one of the latter-day
giants of Orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Wein's succinct sketches of a wide range of Jewish
historical figures _ from the Chofetz Chaim to Abraham Joshua
Heschel _ will be valuable for students who hanker for a greater
understanding of Jewish history. A number of photographs, maps and
other graphics load instantly and help illuminate that history.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Telling the Story for Children &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WHO STOLE HANUKKAH? and THE INTERACTIVE HAGGADAH
</P>
<P>
   (Jerusalem Multimedia Productions; $24.95 and $29.95,
respectively; Macintosh 7.0 and up and Windows 3.X and 95.)
</P>
<P>
   These two CD-ROM'S, both with a holiday focus, are multilingual
_ they can be viewed in English, Hebrew, Russian, French or
Spanish. Both feature Gumby-like characters in colorful settings
that are a collage of drawings and photographs. And the English
version provides transliterated prayers for children who can't read
Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Who Stole Hanukkah? requires the installation of Intel's Indeo
video software, which comes on the disk. The game revolves around a
missing jar of oil from the Holy Temple. Kids have to solve a
series of puzzles to track down the jar.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM's were produced in Israel with support from the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group.
</P>
<P>
   The voices of many characters are a little too cute, and the
Hanukkah CD-ROM suffers from a programming glitch: when a
hot-linked object or character is clicked on, a white box replaces
it for a couple of seconds before whatever replaces it appears,
giving users cause for alarm. You wonder if the software is faulty.
</P>
<P>
   The content ranges from serious to silly. The CD provides
sources in the Book of Maccabees and the Talmud for Hanukkah
traditions. And for children weaned on MTV, three talking candles
do a Motown version of ``Rock of Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interactive Haggadah begins with a family seated at a
Passover table. Click on the wine goblet, and you hear the blessing
recited over the wine. Click on the matzah, and the matzah blessing
is chanted, followed by instructions for making shmura matzah. When
users enter the kitchen, they find recipes for matzah balls, potato
kugel and other Passover delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging ritual items like bitter herbs or the shank bone onto
the Passover plate triggers clever clay animations that explain the
significance of the items.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite portion of the program is a multiple-choice exam
given by the father figure leading the Seder. ``What was the area
of Egypt where the Jews lived?'' he asks. The answer is Goshen, but
Seward Park and Brooklyn are the other choices. ``Who were the two
midwives who refused to obey Pharaoh and saved Hebrew babies?'' If
you guess Thelma and Louise, a buzzer informs you that the answer
is incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   I assumed that the karaoke version of ``Dayenu'' on my ``Reggae
Passover'' CD was the last attempt at mixing karaoke and the exodus
from Egypt. I was mistaken. The Interactive Haggadah comes with an
instrumental version of the Four Questions for your karaoke Seder.
It's enough to keep Elijah from coming in.

CARRY-ON SKIRMISHES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been combat in the air during this holiday season and
heightened tension at airport security check-ins. I refer not to
the sorties against Iraq but to new airline carry-on baggage
policies. United Airlines and Delta, especially, have been strictly
limiting carry-ons to two _ and on busy flights, just one _ each
item no larger than 22 by 14 by 9 inches, or ``45 linear inches''
in airline lingo.
</P>
<P>
   The linear inch _ as opposed to the circular inch? _ is a
measure unfamiliar to most travelers. Translated into three
dimensions, the numbers represent a box of less than two cubic feet
_ but with plenty of room for dogfights among airlines and luggage
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the attack on Baghdad began, for instance,
``templates,'' or ``sizers'' went into place in front of X-ray
machines at Denver International Airport, as at others across the
country. Waiting lines quickly grew long _ up to 50 linear feet, I
estimated at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards require luggage designers to think inside the
box _ and an oblong and somewhat awkward box it is. In any
business, new standards can change designs radically. Consider the
car companies, faced with safety and energy regulations, or camera
makers, reinventing point-and-shoots to fit advanced photo system
film cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   For baggage, the goal of the standards is admirable enough. By
cutting down on carry-ons, especially bulky garment bags, the
airlines aim to speed loading, so planes take off on schedule. The
rules are also intended to reduce injuries caused by bags dropped
from bins.
</P>
<P>
   These rules, however, are set not by the Federal Aviation
Administration but by individual airlines. For years, there has
been a rough correspondence among them, at least on paper. The
difference was in the degree of enforcement. For years, laxity
prevailed. Then last spring, United and Delta, both airlines
working to improve on-time ratings, decided to get tough. In a
local test, United found that stricter enforcement of carry-on
limits increased on-time performance. But Continental, which had
just added a new clutch of larger-bin 777 airliners to its fleet,
wanted no part of efforts to curb ``bin hogs.'' It protested when
United added templates at the airport in San Diego _ and benefited
from the resulting publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The Flight Attendants Association, its members tired of dealing
with passengers whose anger at carry-on policies is one element of
the wider phenomenon known as ``air rage,'' has appealed to the
government for an industrywide standard. Luggage designers agree.
``It's tough when one or two powerful airlines make a unilateral
decision,'' said Chad Mellen, vice president for marketing at the
luggage maker Tumi, based in Middlesex, N.J. ``It's like G.M.
telling the tire companies all of a sudden that its tires will now
be 10 feet tall.'' But Mellen said: ``The new standards have become
our bible. Our three commandments are 22, 14 and 9.''
</P>
<P>
   Myron Glaser of Glaser Designs, a custom designer and
manufacturer of luggage in San Francisco, was able to respond more
quickly than larger manufacturers. ``Beat the two-bag limit,'' his
ads trumpet. His Litigation bag, at 22 inches, will hold a laptop,
files, two shirts and a suit, Glaser says. It will also lighten
your wallet by more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the summer, Tumi began a rush program to adapt its most
popular styles. The first result, Tumi's model 22-65, went on sale
in late October. It has been especially successful in Chicago, a
United hub, and Atlanta, Delta's home. Four or five other models
will be introduced in February.
</P>
<P>
   So far, as in Tumi's case, much of the adjustment has had to do
with simply shrinking bags, but more radical changes in design lie
ahead. The design firm Frogdesign is at work on luggage
incorporating new shapes and features for high-tech travelers.
Today's high-tech road warriors may travel with 20 or 30 pounds
worth of laptop, cell phone, digital assistant and other equipment.
The new policies also seem likely to strengthen the tendency to
combine briefcase and overnight bag into one unit. Mellen also sees
more casual luggage designs coming _ possibly even backpacks for
executives on the road.
</P>
<P>
   And the effects may not be limited to luggage itself. Fashion
could be changed: Glaser sees a need for clothing manufacturers to
adapt microfibers for lighter, thinner packing. Eventually, road
warriors are likely to be as carefully prepacked into their cube
and two-thirds as members of the 82d Airborne, alert for rapid
deployment.

   BIBLE-TOWN (Brooksville, Ala.) _ If the Rev. James Henderson has
his way, the division of church and state in this tiny hamlet will
be so narrow, a single Bible verse, ``Love thy neighbor,'' would
cover it. Henderson and some 140 other residents of Brooksville, an
unincorporated community in northern Alabama, want to form a town,
but not one in which mortal elected officials would have the power
to hand out liquor licenses, levy taxes and rezone land for strip
malls and industrial parks. Instead, Henderson said, they want a

Christmas-and-Easter Christians,'' said Saurwein, 36, helping
himself to a cup of coffee in the parish hall of St. James
Episcopal Church here. ``I had a relationship with God that was
outside the church.'' That was until this fall, when Saurwein's

HOW TO DEFINE `PLUS'? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Friday, Jan. 1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan consensus is emerging that if
President Clinton is not convicted in a Senate trial he should be
censured with the addition of some specific punishment that goes
beyond mere verbal chastisement.
</P>
<P>
   It's called censure plus. The concept has considerable appeal
because simply issuing a strong statement condemning the
president's behavior would be a humiliating black mark in the eyes
of history but would carry no immediate concrete penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that finding an appropriate and politically
acceptable way to give Clinton an extra kick when he's down is
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious punishment, levying a fine against the
president, is clearly unconstitutional. One co-equal branch of
government has no authority to pick the pocket of the leader of
another branch. The Constitution carefully separates the powers of
the legislative, judicial and executive branches.
</P>
<P>
   And the suggested dodges, such as defining a fine as a fee or
calling it reimbursement of legal expenses, are too transparent to
pass constitutional muster. Clinton has been ridiculed for
legalistic tap-dancing _ ``it depends on what the definition of
`is' is'' _ and an imitative Congress would be laughed at too.
</P>
<P>
   An often-mentioned alternative is to take away a future
presidential benefit rather than try to ruin him financially.
Congress could pass a law to deny him a pension after he leaves the
White House. Or Congress could forbid the use of federal funds to
maintain any future presidential library. (Presidential libraries
are built with private funds but run with taxpayer assistance.)
</P>
<P>
   This might get around the constitutional bar, but it would be
petty and mean-spirited in the extreme. Every other American who is
not a convicted felon gets the pension that he or she is entitled
to. Voters would see depriving Clinton of his rightfully earned
retirement pay as unnecessarily spiteful and vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing Clinton a taxpayer subsidy for a presidential library
would be similar punitive overkill. Every other past president
enjoys federal support to preserve the history of his
administration for future generations. The libraries are
repositories of our recorded heritage, not just a glorification of
any specific presidency. Even Richard Nixon, who resigned to avoid
certain impeachment, was not denied support for his California
library.
</P>
<P>
   So what else can Congress legitimately do to make the president
feel real pain?
</P>
<P>
   He can't be held up to additional humiliation by being put in
the public stocks, an ancient device that immobilized offenders by
locking them into a wooden frame, where they were often stoned to
death by local citizens. That particular torture is mercifully out
of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He can't be consigned to a period of public service, as some
ordinary miscreants are. He already puts in endless hours on
community outreach, visiting schools, paying tribute to charitable
organizations and generally showing up wherever there are voters.
He has the photographs to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   As a form of censure plus, some senators want to include in
their condemning document a confession in the president's own
words. They are demanding that Clinton come right out and say,`` I
lied under oath,'' to prove that he feels properly remorseful over
trying to conceal his illicit sexual dalliance.
</P>
<P>
   These demands are both frivolous and politically disingenuous.
They are designed to get the president to incriminate himself and
increase his vulnerability to a perjury conviction in a criminal
court after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has denied outright lying, he has admitted to
wrongdoing, having sinned, having misled the public and having
given uncooperative answers to investigators. He is not going to go
any further because once he vacates the White House he is no longer
protected from a criminal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   What difference would it make to the world if he did throw
caution to the winds and confess to perjury? We already know he is
a lying lecher. We've been bombarded with Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's accusations, the semen-stained dress, the witness
accounts. We've seen his awkward televised grand jury testimony. We
got the message.
</P>
<P>
   In light of all its problems, censure plus may not be
realistically possible. It may not even be politically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even though censure plain does not seem punitive enough to many,
it hits the president in a profoundly devastating way. It is
history's condemnation. It is the blackening of his presidential
legacy. It is the shame that he must always live with.

 THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Vision in Animation.
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Solomon.

   192 pp. New York: Harry N. Abrams. $45.

 &UR; GO HOLLYWOOD, MOSES
</P>
<P>
   BY MARTHA BAYLES
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Prince of Egypt'' will doubtless be remembered as
the film that lifted feature-length animation to the high ground of
biblical epic, this in-house history of the same name is less
memorable -- except in one curious way. By showing how Dreamworks
lavished $75 million on the movie, the book reveals not only the
state of the animator's craft but also the drastically unequal
status of the arts in Hollywood. On every page, ``The Prince of
Egypt'' (the book) reminds us that the focus of feature-length
animation remains so visual that music gets treated as an
afterthought and language as a mere device to carry plot.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Solomon, a respected authority on animation and the
author of five other books on the subject, does a good job of
explaining how ``The Prince of Egypt'' integrates the handmade
images of traditional animation with the highly flexible and mobile
images generated by computer. Especially helpful is his history of
how animators have struggled to achieve the illusion of depth,
going back to the multiplane camera used by Walt Disney in ``Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs'' (1937) (it stood two stories high and
shot downward through six suspended panels of painted glass).
</P>
<P>
   The book's fine illustrations represent every stage in the
process, from initial scribbles to finished frames, while only
hinting at the beauty of the film itself, in, for instance, the
dream sequence, in which the figures in an Egyptian wall painting
come to life and re-enact the slaughter of the Hebrew innocents;
the burning bush scene; the Angel of Death smiting Egypt; and the
parting of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Although these episodes achieve an almost visionary intensity,
``The Prince of Egypt'' rarely soars as high as it should. This may
be because, as some of the animators suggest, their drawings cannot
convey as much emotion as live actors. A more obvious answer,
though, can be found on the soundtrack. While ``The Prince of
Egypt'' is glorious to the eye, it gluts the ear with kitschy music
and cliche-laden dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   A single example will suffice. When interviewed by Solomon, the
composer Hans Zimmer predicted that his score would have ``a
special sound, one that will incorporate the musical styles of the
Near East and North Africa.'' Zimmer is good at this sort of thing,
as evidenced by his score for ``The Lion King.'' As for the script,
let us remember that the protagonists here are the people of the
Book. But in the film, the climactic Exodus scene is accompanied
not by mystical desert strains or the majesty of biblical poetry
but by a power ballad straight off the pop charts. ``When You
Believe'' is not just melodically and lyrically trite, it is also
painfully anachronistic. It's nice to know that the ancient Hebrews
had self-esteem: ``We were moving mountains long /
</P>
<P>
   Before we knew we could.'' But I seem to recall the Bible giving
credit to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   How can such artistry and banality coexist? As Solomon reports,
``Many artists object to the idea of one or two people being
credited as screenwriters on an animated feature, arguing that the
entire story crew actually 'writes' the film.'' Those quotation
marks around the word ``writes'' say it all.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful animated features, like ``The Lion King,''
have sophisticated scripts as well as scores. But it would seem
that sophistication got scrubbed from ``The Prince of Egypt'' on
the same day that the producers scrubbed Disney-style talking
animals. The trouble is, Disney minus comic relief equals kitsch.
And as this book illustrates, despite the prodigious talent that
went into it, ``The Prince of Egypt'' does not alter the equation.

 &UR; THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT
</P>
<P>
   BY PETER BISKIND
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton sent Tomahawk cruise missiles against a
Sudanese pharmaceutical plant and Osama bin Laden's redoubt in
Afghanistan last August, after the bombings of the United States
Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, many of those who had seen
the movie ``Wag the Dog'' exchanged knowing looks. They couldn't
help recognizing that the attack followed by only three days the
President's now legendary grand jury appearance. Reality, in other
words, seemed to be imitating fiction. (By December, when the
President attempted to ``degrade'' Saddam Hussein's ability to
produce weapons of mass destruction, there seemed to be no doubt
about this, at least in the minds of many of his Republican
opponents, for whom ``Wag the Dog'' had now become a ``syndrome.'')
</P>
<P>
   While most political commentators were flummoxed by the rise in
Clinton's ratings after the airing of the grand jury video, Frank
Rich, a columnist for The New York Times and a former movie and
theater critic, wrote, ``The best explanation I've heard comes not
from a journalist but a filmmaker in Los Angeles.'' The explanation
need not concern us, but suffice to say it turned on a comparison
between Clinton's televised ordeal and tragic drama, albeit of the
trashy variety. More recently, The New Yorker let novelists
pontificate about Monicagate in its Talk of the Town pages,
presumably on the theory that they were as sure-footed on this
soapy terrain as its pundit-turned-novelist-(re)turned-pundit, Joe
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Such phenomena have attracted the attention of Neal Gabler,
whose two previous books -- one a study of Hollywood's Jewish
moguls, the other a biography of Walter Winchell -- more than
qualify him as a credible commentator on the vagaries of American
popular culture. Gabler thinks he knows why cultural critics have
become the Walter Lippmanns of the millennium, and he lays out his
provocative reflections in a new work whose title and subtitle do a
pretty good job of summing up his thesis, ``Life the Movie: How
Entertainment Conquered Reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing upon the shoulders of scholars who have examined the
impact of movies and television on traditional values --
particularly Neil Postman but also the likes of Marshall McLuhan,
Daniel Boorstin, Leo Braudy and Richard Sennett -- Gabler argues
that everyday life at the end of the 20th century has become our
very own ``Truman Show,'' perhaps aptly retitled ``The Human
Show.'' We are all Trumans, with the difference that we are witting
accomplices to the fictionalization of our lives because we prefer
our life movies, or ``lifies,'' as he calls them, to reality, which
barely exists anyway. ``Life itself,'' Gabler says, is ``gradually
becoming a medium all its own.'' We are all ``becoming at once
performance artists in and audiences for a grand, ongoing show. . .
. Life has become art, so that the two are now indistinguishable
from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabler maintains that ``there is obviously no such thing as a
unified field theory of American culture,'' but this is precisely
what he offers when he goes on to say that ``if there were, one
could do worse than to lay much of what has happened in
late-20th-century America to the corrosive effects of entertainment
rather than to the effects of politics or economics.'' This is a
large claim. Does Gabler back it up?
</P>
<P>
   Partly. Following Postman, he has a fine old time showing how
entertainment values have come to permeate every nook and cranny of
American life. Gabler traces the rise of entertainment, which he
characterizes as ``fun, effortless, sensational, mindless,
formulaic, predictable and subversive,'' from its humble beginnings
in 19th-century low or popular cultural forms like band music,
penny dreadfuls, melodramas, variety acts, the yellow press and, of
course, the early nickelodeons to its eventual triumph over high
culture, transforming America into what he calls ``the Republic of
Entertainment.'' How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   First, Gabler says, came the ``graphic revolution'' at the turn
of the century, when photographs made inroads into print media and
``image-thinking'' replaced reasoning, nurtured by the old culture
of typography. Eventually, moving images replaced static ones, and
entertainment swept everything before it -- not only logic but also
character, which became personality, and the work ethic, which gave
way to celebrity. The boundaries between real and unreal became
increasingly permeable until they broke down altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Citing everyone from Baudrillard to Warhol, Gabler aims to show
that nothing has remained safe from the virus of entertainment.
Indeed, it is impossible to put down this book unconvinced of the
cataclysmic effect of celebrity on every area of American life.
</P>
<P>
   Gabler makes particularly short work of American politics, for
example, effortlessly showing how, beginning with John F. Kennedy
and reaching an apotheosis with Ronald Reagan, entertainment has
replaced substance. It is his great insight to see that Reagan's
habit of confusing the plots of old movies with reality was not a
manifestation of senility but rather the ineluctable working out of
a seismic cultural change. He concludes that political candidates
have become stars, primaries casting calls, campaigns auditions,
the electorate no more than an audience. Gabler even refers to
issues as ``MacGuffins,'' Alfred Hitchcock's term for irrelevant
plot devices, and borrowing from the New Yorker writer Kurt
Andersen, he calls President Clinton the ``Entertainer-in-Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   But an idea can be a dangerous thing, as someone once said, and
as Gabler gallops through the pages of American history in search
of evidence to fit his thesis, he rides his horse into the ground.
``The real political revolution of the 1980's,'' he argues, was not
``the much-bruited-about demise of postwar liberalism and the rise
of conservatism but the triumph of entertainment over political
ideology of any sort.'' This is absurd, and points to one of the
problems with Gabler's argument. He seems to feel that
entertainment trumps ideology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MOVIE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: trumps ideology.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment does have powerful imperatives, but they have not
(yet) overwhelmed traditional ideologies. To be simplistic, it
helps to think of entertainment as a delivery system that can carry
ideologies of all political stripes, left, right and center. The
left, for example, has its own music, say, Bruce Springsteen, and
its movies (Oliver Stone), while the right has its Christian rock
and Rambo. The biggest blockbuster (read: most entertaining) of all
time, ``Titanic,'' was so loaded with working-class sentimentality,
Beverly Hills style, that if the ship hadn't hit an iceberg, its
ideological baggage would have sunk it anyway. Often the medium's
message, to use McLuhan's famous formulation of Gabler's thesis,
reinforces the ideology it conveys. Sometimes it contradicts it,
creating art or entertainment divided against itself, fun of a
different kind -- for campus deconstructionists.
</P>
<P>
   As for reality being swallowed up by entertainment, surely
Clinton's favorable ratings in the face of Monicagate suggest not
that Americans have confused his tribulations with a soap opera
but, on the contrary, that they are well able to distinguish
between entertainment and reality and that they do not want the
President cashiered. When Mike Nichols's film adaptation of
``Primary Colors,'' Klein's best-selling novelization of his
experiences reporting on the 1992 primaries, flopped in the wake of
the Lewinsky revelations, it was because reality had eclipsed
fiction, not because it had become fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In the traditional formulation, life precedes and inspires art,
but in moments of high historical drama the spectacle of reality
has often surpassed art. This is why, in the 60's, documentaries
flourished and theatrical films like those of John Cassavetes and
Martin Scorsese tried to incorporate news footage or otherwise
approximate the look of documentary. This is one of the reasons
that features did not succeed in dealing fictively with the Vietnam
War until well after it was over. This is also why dog-wagging
incidents like John Hinckley's attempt on Reagan's life, inspired
by ``Taxi Driver,'' still seem so transgressive.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, ``Life the Movie'' doesn't tell the
whole story. Still, it tells a big part of it. It's a thoughtful,
in places chilling, account of the way entertainment values have
hollowed out American life and if not supplanted reality, at least
threatened it.

 &UR; UNSTRUNG HEROES
</P>
<P>
   BY EDWARD HOWER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The ghost of a young woman named Lydia Dent appears in the
opening pages of ``The Travelling Hornplayer.'' And one of the
pleasures of this witty, often moving novel is watching her
reappear again and again -- not as a ghost but as a memory, pulling
the other characters toward their destinies.
</P>
<P>
   The book's South African-born author, Barbara Trapido (a
longtime resident of England), makes Lydia and her sister, Ellen,
an appealing pair of teen-age siblings. In flashbacks, they cheer
each other up when their mother deserts the family. They also enjoy
listening to the sounds of lovemaking when visiting their grown-up
gay half brother and his companion -- ``POW! BASH! BAM! noises''
like those made by comic-book heroes ``in uppercase balloons.'' The
two girls raise the morale of their lonely father, the headmaster
of a public school, by cooking him fudge and teasing him with tales
of their racy (and imaginary) adventures, about which he obligingly
pretends to be shocked. Later, Ellen's fondness for her father will
deepen as they struggle to recover from the loss of her sister.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Lydia is killed in a traffic accident, she is on her
way to visit a high-profile novelist, Jonathan Goldman, hoping to
show him a school paper about the poet Wilhelm Muller entitled
``Love and Death at the Mill: Twenty Poems From the Posthumous
Papers of a Travelling Hornplayer.'' Jonathan -- who, like Lydia,
enjoys German Romantic poetry -- doesn't care for the quaint
Cotswold village he and his family have moved to following his
literary success. He finds the Neighborhood Watch committee ``a
bourgeois vigilante organization: a smuggies' club for people with
too much stuff.'' What's worse, he can't seem to work in his very
own home: ``The house is so pleasing to the eye that I spend the
whole time staring at the walls while eating too many biscuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan is bright, perceptive, funny. He's also flagrantly
unfaithful to his long-suffering wife. But he's redeemed by his
patient love for his extremely difficult daughter, Stella. As a
child, Stella is sickly and inept, tormented at school for her
inability to read. She can also be ungrateful to her mother,
Katherine, who has given up her personal life to help Stella become
``her one, onerous, unlikely work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella, reaching adolescence, finally blossoms. When her
grandmother gives her a cello, the girl's life changes radically.
She now has a purpose: music. She makes friends and is a lot nicer
to her adoring parents. Despite her dyslexia, she's accepted as a
student at Edinburgh University, where she meets Ellen and also a
gentle, damaged aristocrat named Pen, who wants to marry her. The
author charts Stella's dramatic development with great sensitivity.
In fact, all three of Trapido's major characters -- Ellen, Jonathan
and Stella, each of whom takes a turn at the narration -- are
skillfully drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Trapido creates some wickedly amusing minor characters as well.
Stella's sweet, dotty mother-in-law does charity work at a prison,
where she finds the drug dealers ``charming. . . . Terribly nice,
you know. Especially the Caribbeans. Lovely smiles.'' Jonathan's
girlfriend, Sonia, a tireless self-promoter, wears a kinky
hard-rubber outfit to an assignation, which for him makes the
experience ``like trying to commit sex with an armadillo.''
Jonathan's older brother, Roger, is an eccentric professor who
wanders about the house naked, urinates into jars in the bedroom
and scorches frying pans while scrambling eggs with bloody liver.
Stella's artist boyfriend, Izzy, is a study in solipsistic
hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
   A problem develops when some of the over-the-top minor players
meet up with the more realistically drawn major ones. Our credulity
is strained when libidinous Sonia somehow becomes a trusted friend
of the reconciled Jonathan and Katherine. It's also difficult to
believe that Roger, the demented don, can suddenly seem like a
``dreamboat'' to Ellen. And it's hard to watch Stella, who has come
so far, risk her life with the reckless Izzy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these unlikely meetings occur because the plot becomes
increasingly contrived toward the end of the book. For most of the
novel, however, Barbara Trapido keeps us happily engaged in the
lives of her clever, warmhearted characters.

   A Candid Biography of Robert F. Kennedy.

 &UR; POLITICAL AFFAIRS
</P>
<P>
   BY JOHN JUDIS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When I was an editor of a Marxist theoretical journal in the
early 1970's, we often joked that we should add the words ``and
sex'' to the titles of our weighty essays to make them more
attractive to the general reader. It would be ``The Fiscal Crisis
of the State and Sex'' and ``The Triumph of Bourgeois Hegemony and
Sex.'' On that principle, though without a hint of humor, C. David
Heymann's biography of Robert F. Kennedy could have been called
``RFK and Sex.'' ``RFK'' amply covers Robert Kennedy's rumored
affairs, but there is also an orgy of details about the alleged
dalliances of John F. Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy, Edward M. Kennedy,
Peter Lawford, Steven Smith, Ethel Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann, the author of an ``intimate biography'' of Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis and another of Elizabeth Taylor, writes
competently. But here his political account is entirely
conventional: Robert Kennedy, after his brother's death, emerges as
the tribune of a new ``humane 'liberalism.' '' This probably didn't
need reiteration. What is novel about this ``candid biography'' may
increase book sales but not the understanding of its subject. A
politician's sex life and love affairs can certainly be important
to understanding his character and his conduct in office. Garry
Wills in ``The Kennedy Imprisonment'' and Seymour M. Hersh in ``The
Dark Side of Camelot'' attempt to demonstrate that John Kennedy's
manner of dealing with women was symptomatic of a flaw in his
character and affected his Presidency. Heymann, too, occasionally
makes such connections, but they are overshadowed by a pageant of
unanalyzed naughty anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of two pages of a chapter called ``Sex,'' for instance, are
devoted to extended quotations from Doris Lilly, whom Heymann
describes as a ``society columnist'' (``One of Steve Smith's most
passionate affairs'' was with a woman ``who happened to be the best
girlfriend'' of one of the Kennedy brothers' lovers). We also hear
Truman Capote's musings about the size of the Kennedy brothers'
penises. ``I've seen an awful lot of them,'' he says, ``and if you
put all the Kennedys together, you wouldn't have a good one.''
Later we are treated to a former ballerina's claim that she saw
Robert Kennedy and Rudolf Nureyev ``kissing passionately'' in a
telephone booth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sheer wealth of Heymann's anecdotal material
demonstrates that Robert Kennedy did indeed fool around, but
Heymann often relies on single sources who turn out not to have
personally witnessed what they describe, or to have had an animus.
He recounts that Kennedy in the mid-1950's, when he worked for the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, would accompany
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics on raids in New York. Citing a New
York lawyer, Howard Diller, Heymann suggests that Kennedy took
drugs and raped women during these raids. But Diller's actual
statement involves third-hand information -- what he had heard that
agents ``purportedly'' said. Nor does Diller seem particularly
dispassionate. Kennedy, he says, ``struck me as basically
schizophrenic. . . . Caligula seemed mild by comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Heymann casually endorses the theory that President John
Kennedy's assassination involved a ``second gunman and a
mob-controlled hit.'' And he speculates that Robert Kennedy's
killer might not have acted alone. If that weren't enough, he
introduces a new conspiracy involving Marilyn Monroe, with whom he
says Robert as well as John Kennedy had a love affair. Robert
Kennedy, he writes, ``very likely had conspired in the murder of
his former lover, the nation's premier cinema star.'' Heymann
relies on Peter Lawford's account of a conversation between Robert
Kennedy and Monroe's psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson: '' 'Marilyn
has got to be silenced,' Bobby told Greenson -- or words to that
effect.'' Heymann doesn't say how Lawford was apprised of this
private exchange, or remark on the telling qualification, ``or
words to that effect.'' He further claims that Greenson, at
Kennedy's prompting, gave Monroe an injection that, mixed with the
sleeping pills that she was taking, killed her. The police never
discovered evidence of the injection; Heymann explains this away,
of course, but I'll leave the details to readers interested in
tabloid speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann often makes the worst out of Robert Kennedy's pre-60's
political career, calling it ``characterized by one savage vendetta
after another.'' But Kennedy's work for Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
was fairly tame -- he was mainly concerned with foreign vessels
trading with China during the Korean War -- and his crusade against
labor racketeering benefited the nation and the labor movement.
(Heymann sheds no light on the obvious question about Robert
Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General -- why he so energetically
prosecuted organized crime figures on whom he and his brother
relied in trying to get rid of Castro.)
</P>
<P>
   Heymann equally exaggerates the political virtue of the later
Robert Kennedy. He contends that John Kennedy's death transformed
Robert Kennedy into a kinder, gentler being. He contrasts Robert
Kennedy's humane liberalism with the ``reactive'' and ``supremely
pragmatic'' politics of his brother. But Heymann does not
appreciate the limits under which President Kennedy -- and by
extension his Attorney General -- had to operate. Kennedy barely
defeated Richard Nixon in 1960 and had to contend with a Congress
in which conservative Southern Democrats held the balance of power.
With John Kennedy's murder, Bobby Kennedy was not freed from his
brother's political shadow, but from executive responsibility. He
could say what he wanted, and could do so in a country and a
Congress that was, briefly, moving to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann embraces the myth that if Robert Kennedy had lived we
would not have seen the Nixon and Reagan Presidencies. I don't
think that's likely. If anything, the Republicans were able to
exploit white reaction to the liberal passions for black
advancement that Bobby Kennedy so exactly embodied. While Senator
Edward Kennedy was, of course, crippled by Chappaquiddick, it is
worth recalling the similar false hopes that initially surrounded
his Presidential candidacy in 1980. But such historical judgments
are certainly debatable, and Heymann's interpretation of Robert
Kennedy's political career and legacy is defensible. What is not
defensible is the way he deals with the rest of Kennedy's life.

<P>
   A True Story of Race in America.
</P>

   By Paul M. Barrett.

 &UR; THE PRACTICE
</P>
<P>
   BY RICHARD D. KAHLENBERG
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Mungin had done everything right to succeed in
corporate America. Raised by a single African-American mother in a
housing project in Queens, he'd worked hard in high school and,
against the odds, attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School.
Though he faced instances of racism, he didn't dwell on them. He
shunned the all-black groups in college and law school and
befriended large numbers of whites. His mother had taught him,
``You are a human being first, an American second, a black third.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a practicing lawyer, he found things starting to go awry,
as the Wall Street Journal reporter Paul M. Barrett explains in
this riveting and heart-rending book. Barrett, who roomed with his
subject in law school, skillfully and dispassionately tells
Mungin's story in ``The Good Black,'' with chapters alternating
among present, recent past and distant past.
</P>
<P>
   After he had served as an associate at two prestigious law
firms, Mungin's life took a turn for the worse when he joined the
Washington office of a second-tier Chicago firm, Katten Muchin &AMP;
Zavis. He was left out of important meetings. He was given
insulting assignments, more appropriate for a paralegal than a
senior associate. He was denied regular contact with clients. He
was not formally evaluated as promised and was told by one partner,
``You fell between the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But was Mungin singled out because of his race? This was the key
issue when he decided to sue Katten Muchin. Our civil rights laws
do not protect against mere mistreatment. During debate over the
1964 Civil Rights Act, one leading sponsor in the Senate, Hubert
Humphrey, noted that the act ``does not limit the employer's
freedom to hire, fire, promote or demote for any reasons -- or for
no reasons -- so long as his action is not based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Katten Muchin's primary defense was not that it treated Mungin
well but that it mistreated everyone. The defense, Barrett notes,
``decided to make a virtue of Katten Muchin's tendency to handle
its associates shabbily,'' arguing: ``White attorneys, white
support staff, all had the same complaints. . . . They, too, had to
suffer the nonsense of those partners.''
</P>
<P>
   MUNGIN could point to no racial epithets, no memos indicating
discrimination. On the contrary, he and his lawyers cited a number
of memos and conversations in which his race was mentioned as a
positive attribute. Typical was a hiring partner discussing Mungin
with another lawyer: ``Harvard-Harvard. . . . He's perfect! And
he's black.''
</P>
<P>
   A predominantly black jury awarded $2.5 million in damages. Was
this a jury that couldn't tell the difference between affirmative
action and racism? Or did it feel that a poorly conceived
affirmative action program could coexist with -- indeed, perpetuate
-- discrimination by justifying unchallenging assignments and a
reluctance to evaluate? Mungin believed that he was seen as ``a
racial token'' rather than as ``a real lawyer,'' but white appeals
court judges nullified the jury verdict, finding it not
``reasonable.'' One of Mungin's own lawyers told Barrett it was
``questionable'' whether Mungin's mistreatment was related to race.
Barrett concludes that the case ``presented a close question.''
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniable, however, that the firm's mishandling of Larry
Mungin left him broken and disillusioned, off the corporate
partnership track and instead practicing law as a temp-lawyer for
$14 an hour. His case, and this book, raise a larger, serious
question seldom asked in this country: Even apart from racial bias,
shouldn't employees who are wronged have some sort of legal
recourse? Should employers really be able to fire people or abuse
them for ``no reason''?
</P>
<P>
   The pure free-market response says that employers who mistreat
employees will lose good talent and eventually be driven out of
business. But in the racial context, that logic was rejected when
we passed antidiscrimination legislation. In a nation where a
dwindling number of employees are protected by unions, perhaps
Larry Mungin and his white counterparts should be protected from
gross mistreatment by employers as well. Isn't it time we expand
our cramped notion of civil rights to include a fuller array of
human rights?

 &UR; LOST MAN OF THE LOST GENERATION
</P>
<P>
   BY ROBERT KIELY
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part we were not interested in social problems,
in economics or in any particular political complex. . . . We were
the Romantics of the 20th century.'' So wrote Eugene Jolas of the
cosmopolitan literary and artistic world he inhabited, observed and
contributed to in the Paris of the 1920's.
</P>
<P>
   Given the legacy of World War I and the tensions building in
Europe at the time, the comment sounds arrogant and insular. Jolas
seems nostalgic, not apologetic, about a period of willful
blindness. Yet while it is true that nostalgia informs many moments
in this memoir of an extraordinary life in an extraordinary time,
Jolas was anything but a blind participant in events of the first
half of the 20th century. The statement is a typically honest
recollection by a person who did not forget the past or
sentimentalize the future, but who by disposition, personal history
and profession was an acute recorder of moods and events in rapidly
shifting times.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Jolas was born in Union City, N.J., in 1894 of a German
mother and a French father from Alsace-Lorraine. His parents
returned to their native town of Forbach when Jolas was still an
infant. He was raised in a bilingual family, educated in German at
Roman Catholic schools and surrounded by French-speaking neighbors.
Nothing in his eventful life seems to have marked him more than
this early experience of a cultural and political border tense with
instability and burdened by a history of conflicting allegiances
and ideals. Even after he immigrated to America (he was a citizen
by birth), he continued to associate the word ``frontier'' with a
complex and fateful inheritance from the past rather than with
opportunity and hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Jolas returned to the United States at 15, lived with relatives
and took odd jobs as a messenger in New York City. Despite low pay
and hard living, he loved the variety and bustle of the city.
Instead of two languages, he heard dozens. He relished the accents
and atmosphere of Hell's Kitchen, Chinatown, Flatbush and Prospect
Park. When he heard the story of another immigrant boy, Joseph
Pulitzer, he decided to be a newspaperman. He wandered from city to
city taking any tasks a paper would offer, and between jobs he
slept on park benches, sharing hunger and stories with others out
of work. There is something Dreiseresque in the cold chaotic whirl
of Jolas's American city at the turn of the century, but there is
nothing of Dreiser in Jolas's outlook. He sounds more like the
Artful Dodger. Where others might fall into despair, he inevitably
finds reason for hope and even a kind of irrepressible
cheerfulness.
</P>
<P>
   His first serious job was with a German-language newspaper in
Pittsburgh. The teen-ager arrived hungry and alone in what at the
time must have been one of America's least appealing cities: ``I
arrived in Pittsburgh on a cold, snowy February evening. The tall
chimneys of the steel mills and glass factories pierced the sky.
Blast furnaces belched soot and smoke. I felt exhilarated by the
lurid cosmos, the cloudy world of industry, grandiose and
Dantesque.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jolas began writing his memoirs in the 30's and continued
through World War II, it is possible that the older man casts a
golden haze over the hardships of his youth. Still, his capacity
not only for survival but also for taking genuine pleasure in the
unexpected shifts of fate that might have defeated a more fragile
psyche seems to have remained with him throughout his life. It is a
trait that helped make him one of the outstanding journalists of
his day and may have prevented his brooding American-French-German
philosophical poetry from possessing the originality and
authenticity of his English prose.
</P>
<P>
   The writing, even in this unfinished memoir, will strike any
reader. Jolas began dictating chapters to his wife, Maria, in the
late 30's or early 40's and continued intermittently until his
death in 1952. It was in the 1980's that Maria brought these papers
to the attention of the editors of ``Man From Babel,'' Andreas
Kramer and Rainer Rumold.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else he was doing, Jolas also found time to write
verse. His memoir is punctuated by samples of it. Strongly
influenced by the German Romantics and the French avant-garde, as
well as by Whitman and Hart Crane, he longed to universalize his
incurable homesickness -- for Europe when he was in America, for
America when he was in Europe -- and consequently his restless need
to keep moving, which he considered ``an immigrant neurosis.'' He
was obsessed by language, and, like many of his generation, he
borrowed Freudian terminology to label if not explain his inner
conflicts, including the linguistic ones between the literary and
the idiomatic, French and German, American slang and standard
English. ``Language became a neurosis,'' he writes at the outset as
if to alert us to the pathology that will provide consistency to a
life divided between continents and interrupted by two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   If language was his neurosis, he turns it -- much as he did the
sidewalks of New York, the smokestacks of Pittsburgh, the bordellos
of Savannah -- to his advantage as a reporter. In the 20's he found
himself writing for the Paris edition of The Chicago Tribune. He
seemed to be everywhere in Paris at once -- in the right hotel
lobby for the entrance of Gloria Swanson, in the right bar to
overhear drunken conversations of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, in
the right park to see Ernest Hemingway take his son for a walk:
``He usually wore workman's clothes and was always most careful to
avoid being taken for a literary man. . . . He seemed to have a
preference for intermingling his vocabulary with strong four-letter
words. Frequently, however, these gave the impression of being
carefully calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BABEL-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: carefully calculated.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Jolas was more than a literary gossip columnist. He was
deeply interested in the esthetic avant-garde of the 20's; he was a
defender of Dadaism and Surrealism and of any effort to break
language and the arts away from the cliches of conventional light
entertainment. Not long after his arrival in Paris, he was asked to
take over from Ford Madox Ford the writing of The Tribune's
literary column, ``Rambles Through Literary Paris.'' During
interviews and by attending readings, he met everyone -- James
Joyce, Francois Mauriac, Andre Breton, Gertrude Stein, Sinclair
Lewis, Andre Gide -- and quickly became not only an observer but an
actor in the Paris scene.
</P>
<P>
   His most important and influential contribution to the literary
life of the times was his founding and editing of Transition, a
journal dedicated to the publication of avant-garde works and, of
equal importance to the trilingual Jolas, the exposure between the
same covers of Continental, American and British experiments in
language. In a manifesto published in the third issue in 1927,
Jolas expressed himself with characteristic expansiveness: ``We
need new words, new abstractions, new hieroglyphics, new symbols,
new myths.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the closest and most important of his many literary
friends was Joyce, with whom Jolas shared a nostalgia for an
impossible homeland and a fascination with the meeting and mingling
of alien languages. Jolas became a defender of Joyce's radical
linguistic experiments and published excerpts of ``Work in
Progress'' (early fragments of ``Finnegans Wake'') in Transition.
But he also came to know a side of Joyce few outside his closest
circle of friends would ever see. He saw the lover of Italian
opera; the introverted celebrity who refused to be interviewed but
who could talk and sing into the night with those he trusted; the
aloof literary giant who wished readers would be more appreciative
of his humor (and said, ``in riso veritas''); the grieving father
tormented by his daughter's mental illness. Like all good
reporters, Jolas could capture a personality in a moment and a
phrase. Recalling an evening with Joyce in a Parisian restaurant,
he noticed at a nearby table Picasso, Breton and Jacques Prevert.
``Informed of their presence, Joyce did not look up.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jolas's English was supple and fluent, some of his most
pointed vignettes depend on what he considered untranslatable
expressions. Whenever the French printer of ``Work in Progress''
heard that Joyce was about to send in yet another addition or
correction, he threw up his hands and shouted, ``Joyce, alors!'' --
so often that it became for him all one name. When the Paris police
booked several writers for an unruly clash between the Romantics
and the Surrealists, Jolas loved the fact that the official charge
was bagarre entre intellectuels. At the end of World War II, when
Jolas was in Germany working for the Office of War Information, he
encountered two Jewish brothers who had lost their father in
Dachau; he quotes but deliberately does not translate their words
to him: ``Wir mochten nach Israel auswandern.''
</P>
<P>
   A gain and again, Jolas reveals not only his sharp eye and ready
ear for a good story but also his sensitivity to human suffering
and injustice. Having cheerfully rejected politics in the
avant-garde carnival of literary Paris in the 20's, he, unlike many
others of the time, did not lurch toward Fascism or Communism in
the 30's. His experience of America had imprinted on him democratic
longings and a tolerance for difference that he eventually saw to
be in conflict with the idealized nationalism and racism of the
German Romantic poets he had once so admired. When he returned to
the frontier land of his parents to help establish a free press in
postwar Germany, he faced not only the devastation of people,
landscape and language but also a past poetic self that had been
deaf to what the mature journalist took to be chillingly clear. ``I
found a definite predilection among the Romantics for the
totalitarian state, for anti-Semitism and for . . . Pan-Germanic
dementia.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be too simple to say that in Jolas's conflicted life
the American journalist triumphed over the German poet, the
modernist over the Romantic, the practical good-humored survivor
over the melancholy dreamer. Outwardly this all seems to be true.
Yet the poetry of abstract angst continued to be written. And there
was a private, inner life -- marriage, children, his complex
relationship to Roman Catholicism -- that is barely touched on in
this action-packed memoir. Like so many modern expatriates, Jolas
took on many attributes of a new world without ever letting go of
the old. Finding Forbach, his ancestral home, in ruins in 1945, he
wrote: ``I realized that throughout my wandering life I had been in
constant flight from this land of restless frontier-shifting. . . .
And yet in the American world something had continued to live in me
that was part of this medieval night.''

 A WEREWOLF PROBLEM IN CENTRAL RUSSIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Other Stories.
</P>
<P>
   By Victor Pelevin. Translated by Andrew Bromfield.

 &UR; HOWL
</P>
<P>
   BY RICHARD LOURIE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Although I have been tracking Russia and its literature for
something like 40 years, it was my son, a year younger than
37-year-old Victor Pelevin, who gave me the key to this collection
of antic and enigmatic stories. When I questioned him about his
generation, which seems bafflingly at ease with both seat belts and
heroin, he replied that in a world of bits and pieces everyone was
assembling those fragments into individual mosaics in a search for
meaning. That remark also lit up the post-Soviet, post-modern world
of Victor Pelevin.
</P>
<P>
   The author of four other books available in English (``The Blue
Lantern,'' ``Omon Ra,'' ``The Yellow Arrow'' and ``The Life of
Insects''), Pelevin is the freshest voice to emerge from the rubble
of Soviet Russia. The verbal mosaics he makes from its bits and
pieces sometimes constellate into patterns of pain, hilarity and
beauty; at other times they seem as pointless as the piles of
detritus exhibited in hip galleries. One could easily imagine
Pelevin being read avidly in a cyber-cafe in Alexanderplatz or Los
Feliz, but the German would probably understand him better than the
Angeleno. However, the danger with Pelevin is to overglobalize him
-- his roots are deeply Russian, and though much of his manner and
message will resonate with rootless international youth, nuances,
like politics, ultimately prove local.
</P>
<P>
   Pelevin, in fact, belongs to one strand of the great Russian
tradition that goes back as far as Gogol and Dostoyevsky, in which
metaphysical intuitions about the mystery of existence clash with
the grotesque banalities of life as it is actually lived. He has
borrowed a bit from Tolstoy's doctrine of ostranenie, ``making it
strange,'' in an effort to illuminate and redeem the mess of daily
life -- which is nowhere messier than in today's Russia. And he has
certainly imbibed the ``fantastic realism'' of Andrei Sinyavsky,
who wrote under the pseudonym Abram Tertz and who in stories like
``Pkhentz'' described the adventures of an extraterrestrial whose
spaceship has crashed in the Soviet Union and who must live in
disguise as an ordinary citizen, his multiple eye-covered limbs
arranged as a hunch on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Pelevin is also affiliated with the feverish metaphysics of the
writers of Russia's silver age, the last desperate flare of
creative culture in the years preceding the Revolution. He is well
aware of the occultists who were the rage at the time, like Madame
Blavatsky and G. I. Gurdjieff, and even makes reference to them in
the story ``Vera Pavlovna's Ninth Dream,'' in which an aging female
lavatory attendant struggles to understand both perestroika and the
nature of solipsism. In yet another story, Gurdjieff's idea that
all humanity is essentially asleep serves as the conceit for a
satire on the mass hypnosis of Communist society and on life in
general, sleep being a ``kind of universal joint on which people's
entire lives turned.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pelevin can be classified as an esoteric satirist,
someone searching for the meaning of existence while lashing out
with a merry ferocity at the more absurd forms that life has
adopted in his native land. ``Bulldozer Driver's Day,'' for
example, takes place in a closed Soviet city where nuclear weapons
are assembled so sloppily that children are born with three legs
from the leakage of radiation. The hero of the story, Ivan, has
been knocked silly by a bomb that fell on him at work on the
assembly line, ``referred to as the 'medium-soft plush toy shop.'
'' (The actual Soviet nuclear weapons program was part of the
Ministry of Medium Machine Building.) Some of these ``in'' jokes
travel better than others. In the same story, we are introduced to
'' 'Partai-chi' . . . an entire complex of movements allowing even
an individual of the very sharpest mental acuity to tune his mind
for the faultless exposition of the party line.'' This story is
probably best suited for domestic consumption, or for those
initiated into the arcana of what used to be called ``Soviet
reality'' and must now logically be ``the former Soviet reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The title story of this collection is the most perfectly
realized of the eight narratives. Here a youth named Sasha stumbles
upon a group of people with the ability to turn themselves into
wolves -- a plot device that is used not to make the obvious point
about man's beastliness but rather to reconnect with the elemental
vitality of life. Having himself become a wolf, Sasha realizes that
people ``couldn't feel the meaning of life in the same way as they
felt the wind or the cold. But now Sasha was able to feel it, he
felt the meaning of life continuously and clearly as an eternal
quality of the world itself, and that was the greatest charm of his
present condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasha's sensual awareness also becomes exquisitely heightened.
And this transformation is so beautifully and authoritatively
rendered that the reader feels similarly transported into the world
of wolf consciousness: ``Two hares swept by like a jet plane,
leaving a thick trail of scent which made it clear that they were
frightened to death and that one of them was also a total idiot.''
When Sasha asks the leader of the pack, ``What are werewolves,
really?'' the leader looks him in the eye and, baring his teeth,
replies, ``What are people, really?'' After all the questioning and
ideas, for man and for wolves nothing remains but to howl ``about
the incomprehensible beauty of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelevin writes very well, and his prose has been sparklingly
rendered into English by Andrew Bromfield. Even when Pelevin's
youthful qualities lapse into the merely juvenile, as in ``Tai Shou
Chuan USSR (A Chinese Folk Tale),'' which begins with a sort of
stoned-in-the-dorm premise (``As everyone knows, our universe is
located in the teapot of a certain Lui Dunbin who sells trinkets at
the bazaar in Chanyan''), there are instances of marvelous
invention -- black swans that are actually enchanted K.G.B. agents,
a crack paratroop division called the Brothers Karamazov.
</P>
<P>
   But Pelevin at his best can open a story with a sentence that is
both startling and convincing, immediately creating a world. ``The
Tarzan Swing'' begins: ``The wide boulevard and the houses standing
along both its sides were like the lower jaw of an old Bolshevik
who, late in life, has arrived at democratic views.'' The hero of
the story, Pyotr Petrovich, opines on the nature of belief: ``It's
like having something to hold on to in the bus. It doesn't matter
what it is as long as you don't fall.'' Still, he says, there are
limits: ``It's too late for believing in God. If I suddenly start
believing now it'll be dishonest somehow. . . . So instead of that
I believe in Herbalife or the separation of powers.'' In the end,
he comes to a typically Pelevinian realization: ``Sometimes it
seems to me there is a part of the soul which sleeps all the time
and only wakes for a few seconds on summer nights, in order to peep
out and remember something as it used to be long ago, in a
different place -- dark blue skies . . . stars . . . mystery. . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Churchill, post-Soviet Russia is a riddle wrapped
in a mystery inside a Pelevin.

   The Unmaking of Elvis Presley.

 &UR; HEARTBREAK HOTEL
</P>
<P>
   BY GERALD MARZORATI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LET'S get a little loud. Peter Guralnick's two-volume life of
Elvis Aron Presley, of which ``Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis
Presley'' is the second installment, is not simply the finest
rock-and-roll biography ever written. It must be ranked among the
most ambitious and crucial biographical undertakings yet devoted to
a major American figure of the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear the chorus. Ambitious? Ambitious like Robert Caro's
exhaustively researched biography of Lyndon Baines Johnson, the
first two volumes of which have yet to bring the 36th President of
the United States to the door of the White House? Crucial? Crucial
like Taylor Branch's two-thirds completed and already majestic
chronicle of Martin Luther King Jr., probably the man of his time
most essential to the nation's unfolding history?
</P>
<P>
   Let's drive it home. This is what a serious literary biographer
of Elvis Presley has to confront: a subject who did his greatest
work before his 23d birthday, who never wrote a deep-reaching word
about himself and remained largely aloof from his times, even as he
informed them. He is also a figure who, 21 years after his
drug-steeped death in a bathroom at Graceland, remains a staple of
both the supermarket tabloids and of recondite academic papers that
smother him with more radical socio-cultural significance -- Elvis
the Transgressive -- than he can possibly carry. There was so
little for Guralnick to work with, it would seem, and so much to
rescue Elvis from.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick has long been one of the country's more thoughtful
writers about its various musics, and what he set out to do, I
think, was to find a place for Presley in the mainstream story of
America -- to portray not a wiggling, unwitting deconstructionist
or someone who wound up a freak with a massive following, but a
figure of deep American colorations, effervescent and then so
quickly and utterly sad, who got the life he desired and willed,
both on the way up and for much of the long slide down. And what
dramatizes Presley's life for Guralnick, what lends it emotional
complexity and resonance, is the essential American drama -- the
tug between home and flight, acquiescence and rebellion,
conventions and their transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   An artist is engaged not so much with resolving emotional
conflicts as with expressing them, and in the 1950's that is
exactly what Presley did. As Guralnick introduced him in his
exhilarating first volume, ``Last Train to Memphis'' (1994), Elvis
was a mama's boy and something of a tough, was God-inspired but
hated commandments, couldn't wait to break out of Memphis and
couldn't go anywhere else without a phalanx of boyhood friends. He
also swung wildly between agonizing self-doubt and Emersonian
ecstasies -- and it's all there, in the work. In his early
recordings, in movies like ``Jailhouse Rock'' and especially in his
live performances of the 50's, Presley stirred up as audacious and
incendiary a mixture of the pious and profane, the communal and the
libertine, the constricted (a few chords and a backbeat) and the
boundless (think of ``Mystery Train'') as the culture had ever
encountered. But he hadn't thought he was making art. He had
thought he was becoming Elvis. Herein lay the seed of the
``unmaking'' in Guralnick's subtitle.
</P>
<P>
   The book picks up his story in the fall of 1958, with Private
Presley completing his Army hitch in Germany. This period has
commonly been understood as the King's quiet interregnum, but, as
Guralnick carefully details, it was during Presley's 17 months
overseas that all the pieces were put in place for his awful end.
The plan Presley and his hucksterish business manager, Thomas
Parker (a k a the Colonel), had agreed to -- and then sold to the
Army -- went like this: In the interests of military esprit de
corps and public morale back home, Presley would go about things
like any draftee. No performances, no recording sessions, no
rock-and-roll. Meanwhile, Elvis's record label, RCA, would package,
release and (went the reasoning) use up recordings already in the
can (thereby putting Presley in a prime negotiating position when
he mustered out), while the Colonel worked his Barnumesque magic in
Hollywood, playing the studios against one another for his client's
services. The plan worked. The singles continued to top the charts,
album sales held steady, earnings for good-soldier Elvis approached
$2 million a year, and there were deals for three pictures awaiting
him when he returned to Memphis to the wails of crazed fans in the
spring of 1960. He was golden, and doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Being Elvis no longer meant singing, stomping and venting at the
delirious edge of a stage or in intensely inspired recording
sessions with first-rate sidemen. It meant showing up -- a couple
of weeks on the set to make a lousy movie (``Girls! Girls!
Girls!,'' ``Kissin' Cousins''), then a couple of days in the studio
to complete a lackluster soundtrack, which is what an Elvis album
became in the 60's. ``Nothing could be simpler or more logical: the
soundtrack album promoted the movie release, the movie release
guaranteed a certain level of sales and publicity for the album,''
Guralnick writes. Touring? Live audiences? He was still making the
charts and the big bucks -- who needed them? Only Elvis, his
roiling inner self, but he had no way of knowing. All the acuity
had been spent getting him to precisely where he was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-PRESLEY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: where he was.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Presley had more time on his hands through the 60's than anyone
should have, and an undiminished store of soul-tangled
restlessness. He played a lot with the buddies and hangers-on, the
so-called Memphis Mafia, whom he paid to keep around him, whether
at Graceland or out in Los Angeles at this or that mansion he
called home while he was shooting his movies. There was karate,
touch football, party after party and, when things got stale,
making out with the other guys' girlfriends (this is a man in his
30's, understand).
</P>
<P>
   There were always young women around, and they tended to fall
into two categories: the ones Presley went to bed with and the ones
Presley went to bed with and just talked to, at least in the
beginning. The latter tended to be on the young side, barely
teen-agers in a couple of cases, and Presley would nuzzle them and
explain to them what he had been reading -- cosmology texts,
``Autobiography of a Yogi,'' the Physicians' Desk Reference. He
would also sometimes talk about how lonely he was -- he missed his
mother, whose death just before he was shipped off to Germany he
had never really got over -- and how strangely unsatisfied he felt
with his life. But he would not talk like this for long or too
deeply. He was Elvis, after all. What was there to complain about?
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla Beaulieu had been one of the young ones -- just a
14-year-old Air Force brat when Elvis met her during his tour of
duty in Germany. Not long after, she joined him at Graceland (the
Colonel worked hard to keep that quiet), and after enduring several
years of his ``saving'' her until she got older, to say nothing of
his mood swings and endless affairs, she married him in the spring
of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Presley was also seriously attached to amphetamines,
which he had also discovered in Germany. He tended to ingest them
late in the afternoon, which is when he liked to rise, and then on
through the night, when, with dawn approaching, he would switch to
sleeping pills and crash, frequently in the mothering arms of
someone not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, his habit, or habits, did not prevent him from
railing against drugs and seeking a sanctioned role in the
government's war against them. Some of Guralnick's most meticulous
research is devoted to reconstructing Presley's surreal December
1970 trip to Washington -- one of his few forays outside the
Memphis-Hollywood-Las Vegas axis -- during which he managed to
arrange an Oval Office visit with President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief exchange, they agreed that the Beatles were largely
to blame for the scourge of dissent and drug use in the United
States. Presley -- not so far removed from events to miss that the
group had usurped and then surpassed him in the rock-and-roll
culture he had more or less created -- declared he would lead an
anti-Beatles campaign, and, with Nixon's O.K., left the capital
with an honorary Drug Enforcement Administration agent's badge. The
Beatles had broken up seven months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Presley did have a second act. In the summer of 1968, urged on
by a young television director named Steve Binder, he turned what
was expected to be a lachrymose network special into a reawakening
of sorts -- his first performance before a live audience of any
kind in seven years, and a triumphant one.
</P>
<P>
   He followed the Christmastime broadcast of the show with a
monthlong engagement in Las Vegas -- another triumph -- but it
proved, in retrospect, a final reprise, not a fresh start. He was
still Elvis. It was just that he no longer knew what for.
</P>
<P>
   Too many pills, and too many purposeless days, were killing his
heart. As he performed regularly through the mid-'70s -- it was his
main source of income now, the movies having dried up -- the shows
grew stale, then worse. He might have funneled his unresolvable
emotions into songwriting, but that never appeared to have occurred
to him. Instead, between the tired oldies he sang before aging,
adoring fans who approached him more as a sort of tent revivalist
than a rock star, he ranted about his divorce from Priscilla and
his falling-out with the entertainment press, his paranoias and his
bitternesses, believing himself more sinned against than sinning --
Lear in a wing-collared jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick writes too much of these last five or six years.
``Careless Love'' bloats along with its subject, and the author's
lyrically spare sentences begin to sag as they struggle to find any
glimmer of the old Elvis amid the wreckage. Guralnick wisely
chooses not to end with a reckoning of the wages of fame but to
return to a consideration of the beginning, to those first electric
years when Presley was able to convey to so many Americans ``the
proclamation of emotions long suppressed, the embrace of a
vulnerability culturally denied, the unabashed striving for
freedom.'' Guralnick wants us to understand that that song will
never be over, and after reading him, we do.

 &UR; HELLO, HAL
</P>
<P>
   BY COLIN McGinn
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Has the invasion already begun? Are the aliens already right
under our noses? Are machines, the products of human engineering
intelligence, poised to take over the world -- or is this an
irrational fear, the latest spasm of the Luddite spirit? Finally,
is the whole idea just a clever marketing ploy for the
investment-hungry artificial intelligence industry? Here we have
three books, all written by experts in computer intelligence, aimed
to persuade us that the Age of Machines is nigh. We are to be
eclipsed by our own technology, ceding our outdated flesh, blood
and neural tissue to integrated circuits and their mechanistic
progeny. The future belongs to the robots.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of this dystopian vision (or utopian, depending on
your view) go back to a prediction made in the mid-1960's by a
former chairman of Intel, Gordon Moore, that the size of each
transistor on an integrated circuit will be reduced by 50 percent
every 24 months. This prediction, now grandly known as Moore's law,
implies the exponentially expanding power of circuit-based
computation over time. A rough corollary is that you will get
double the computational power for the same price at two-year
intervals. Thus computers today can perform millions more
computations per second than equivalently priced computers of only
a few decades ago. It is further predicted that new computer
technologies will take over where integrated circuits leave off and
continue the inexorable march toward exponentially increasing
computational power. The computational capacity of the human brain
is only a few decades away from being duplicated on an affordable
computing machine. Brains are about to be outpaced by one of their
products. They are already being outdone in certain areas: speed of
calculation, data storage, theorem-proving, chess.
</P>
<P>
   All three of these books provide a vivid window on the state of
the art in artificial intelligence research, and offer provocative
speculations on where we might be heading as the information age
advances. Of the three, ``The Age of Spiritual Machines,'' by Ray
Kurzweil, is the best: it is more detailed, thoughtful, clearly
explained and attractively written than ``Robot: Mere Machine to
Transcendent Mind,'' by Hans Moravec, and ``When Things Start to
Think,'' by Neil Gershenfeld -- though all three are creditable
efforts at popularization.
</P>
<P>
   Since the books cover much the same ground, with some difference
of emphasis, Kurzweil's gives you the most bits for your buck.
Gershenfeld's breezily chatty book sometimes reads too much like an
advertisement for the Media Lab at M.I.T., of which he is director.
There is much discussion (and not a little hype) of his many
achievements in harnessing computer technology to more physical
concerns: electronic books, smart shoes, wearable computers,
technologically enhanced cellos.
</P>
<P>
   Moravec's book is more intellectually adventurous and free with
confident futuristic speculation. He envisages autonomous robot-run
industries that we tax to siphon off their wealth, and the gradual
replacement of organic humans with mechanical descendants -- our
``mind children.'' His vision is of a world in which machines are
the next evolutionary step, with organic tissue but a blink in the
eye of cosmic history. Once intelligence is created by natural
selection it will be only a matter of time (a very short one by
cosmic standards) before the products of intelligence outshine
their creators, finally displacing them altogether. This is good
knockabout stuff, a heady and unnerving glimpse into a possible
future. Where Moravec is weak is in attempts at philosophical
discussion of machine consciousness and the nature of mind. He
writes bizarre, confused, incomprehensible things about
consciousness as an abstraction, like number, and as a mere
``interpretation'' of brain activity. He also loses his grip on the
distinction between virtual and real reality as his speculations
spiral majestically into incoherence.
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil is more philosophically sensitive, and hence cautious,
in his claims for computer consciousness; he develops the same
kinds of speculations as Moravec, but with more of an emphasis on
the meaning of such innovations for human life. He has an engaging
discussion of the future of virtual sex once the technology
includes realistic haptic simulations (what other bodies feel like
to touch); here he envisages the eventual triumph of the virtual
over the real. His book ranges widely over such juicy topics as
entropy, chaos, the big bang, quantum theory, DNA computers,
quantum computers, Godel's theorem, neural nets, genetic
algorithms, nanoengineering, the Turing test, brain scanning, the
slowness of neurons, chess playing programs, the Internet -- the
whole world of information technology past, present and future.
This is a book for computer enthusiasts, science fiction writers in
search of cutting-edge themes and anyone who wonders where human
technology is going next.
</P>
<P>
   But the question must be asked: How seriously are we to take all
this breathless compuhype? Will the 21st century really see
machines acquire mentality?
</P>
<P>
   There is naturally a lot of talk in these books about the
possibility of machines duplicating the operations of the human
mind. But it is vital to distinguish two questions, which are often
run together by our authors: Can machines duplicate the external
intelligent behavior of humans? And can machines duplicate the
inner subjective experience of people? Call these the questions of
outside and inside duplication. What is known as the Turing test
says in effect that if a machine can mimic the outside of a human
then it has thereby replicated the inside: if it behaves like a
human with a mind, it has a mind. All three authors are partial to
the Turing test, thus equating the simulation of external
manifestations of mind with the reality of mind itself. However,
the Turing test is seriously flawed as a criterion of mentality.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-INTELLIGENCE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: criterion of mentality.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, it is just an application of the doctrine of behaviorism,
the view that minds reduce to bodily motions; and behaviorism has
long since been abandoned, even by psychologists. Behavior is just
the evidence for mind in others, not its very nature. This is why
you can act as if you are in pain and not really be in pain -- you
are just pretending.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is the kind of problem highlighted by the
philosopher John Searle in his ``Chinese Room'' argument: computer
programs work merely by the manipulation of symbols without any
reference to what these symbols might mean, so that it would be
possible for a human to follow such a program for a language he has
no understanding of. The computer is like my manipulating sentences
of Chinese according to formal rules and yet having no
understanding of the Chinese language. It follows that mimicking
the externals of human understanding by means of a symbol-crunching
computer program is not devising a machine that itself understands.
None of our authors even so much as consider this well-known and
actually quite devastating argument.
</P>
<P>
   Third, to know whether we can construct a machine that is
conscious we need to know what makes us conscious, for only then
can we determine whether the actual basis of consciousness can
occur in an inorganic system. But we simply don't know what makes
organic brains conscious; we don't know what properties of neurons
are responsible for the emergence of subjectivity. We would need to
solve the age-old mind-body problem before we could sensibly raise
the question of minds in machines. My hunch is that it is something
about specifically organic tissue that is responsible for
consciousness, since this seems to be the way nature has chosen to
engineer consciousness; but that can only be a guess in view of our
deep ignorance of the roots of consciousness in the brain. In any
case, lacking insight into the basis of consciousness, it is futile
to ask whether a machine could have what it takes to generate
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the Turing test is therefore no proof of machine
consciousness: outside duplication does not guarantee inside
duplication. This bears strongly on a practical suggestion of
Kurzweil -- that during the course of the 21st century we might
decide to ``upload'' ourselves into a suitable computing machine as
a way of extending our lives and acquiring a more robust physical
constitution. Let us suppose that the machine you choose to upload
into passes the Turing test; it had better or else you would not
wish to inhabit it. The problem is that it might do so without
containing the potential for any form of consciousness, so that
uploading your mind into it amounts to letting your mind evaporate
into thin air.You will pass from sentient being to insentient
robot.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot to risk on the veracity of the Turing test! And it
is no good hoping that the robots themselves will tell you whether
they are conscious, since they will say they are -- whether or not
they are. If people become convinced of the validity of the Turing
test on mistaken philosophical grounds, then we might find
ourselves in the position of unknowingly extinguishing our
consciousness by uploading into machines that are inherently
incapable of feeling anything. If Kurzweil is right when he says
that machines that mimic the externals of human performance will
become available sometime during the next century, then I suggest
that the human race ponder the merits of the Turing test very
carefully before taking any drastic steps. I for one would prefer
sentient mortality to insentient immortality, or, more accurately,
to the end of my self and the creation of an unconscious machine
that merely behaves like me.
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil, Moravec and Gershenfeld take it as a given that the
mind is essentially a computer. The question then is just how
powerful a computer the mind is and whether a machine could
duplicate this power. But the authors do not think hard enough
about their basic assumption. It is true that human minds
manipulate symbols and engage in mental computations, as when doing
arithmetic. But it does not follow from this that computing is the
essence of mind; maybe computing is just one aspect of the nature
of mind. And isn't this already obvious from the fact that many
nonmental systems engage in computations? Silicon chips are not
conscious, nor are the components of any future molecular or
quantum computer. The fact is that minds are just one kind of
computational system among many, not all of which have any trace of
mentality in them. So computation cannot be definitive of mind.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of mind wholly omitted by the computational
conception is the phenomenological features of experience -- the
specific way a rose smells, for instance. This is something over
and above any rose-related computations a machine might perform. A
DNA computer has biochemical as well as computational properties; a
conscious mind has phenomenological as well as computational
properties. These phenomenological properties have a stronger claim
to being distinctive of the mind than mere computational ones.
There is thus no reductive explanation of the mental in terms of
the computational; we cannot regard consciousness as nothing but a
volley of physically implemented symbol manipulations. And this
means that there is no reason at all to believe that building ever
larger and faster computers will take us one jot closer to building
a genuinely mental machine. The fallacy here is analogous to
reasoning that if a human body is a device for taking you from A to
B, and a car also does this, then a human body is the same thing as
a car. Minds compute and so do silicon chips, but that is no reason
to suppose that minds are nothing more than what they have in
common with silicon chips (any more than silicon chips are nothing
more than what they have in common with minds).
</P>
<P>
   If our three authors are wobbly on the philosophy of mind and
artificial intelligence, they are strong on computer technology
itself; and here is where their books are particularly interesting.
The reader can simply detach all the dubious speculations about
machine consciousness and focus on the authors' predictions about
the future of computer and robot technology, its potential benefits
and hazards. Consider two examples of the kind of technology that
might well be just over the horizon: the foglets and the nanobots.
Foglets are tiny, cell-sized robots, each more computationally
powerful than the human brain, that are equipped with minute
gripping arms that enable them to join together into diverse
physical structures. At ease the foglets are just a loose swarm of
suspended particles in the air, but when you press a button they
execute a program for forming themselves into an object of your
choosing. We may come to live in foglet houses whose rooms are
formed from the same foggy swarm. We may come to have foglet
friends and take foglet vacations. Our entire physical environment
may come to consist of a
</P>
<P>
   3-D mosaic of cooperating microscopic computers. This would be
virtual reality made concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Nanobots are devices for nanoengineering, the manipulation of
matter on the atomic scale. They are also high-power
microcomputers, equipped with manipulative skills and an urge to
perpetuate their kind. They can make copies of themselves by
following a program for nano-scale operations on chunks of
surrounding matter. Imagine you start with 10 of them and that they
can each make a copy of themselves in five seconds (they can do
many millions of computations a second and their little mechanical
limbs move, insectlike, with great rapidity). That means they
double their numbers every five seconds, and an exponential nanobot
population explosion is set to break out. These little blighters
could consume the entire planet in a matter of weeks, including all
the organic material on it! Nor would they be picked off by natural
predators, being quite indigestible. In a very short time the
nanobots will have razed everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Self-replication is perhaps the biggest hazard presented by
advanced computer technology. Even today computers are routinely
used to design other computers; in the next century they may be
making computers that challenge humans in all sorts of ways. Victor
Frankenstein refused to give his monstrous creation a bride for
fear of their reproductive potential. Maybe we should be thinking
hard now about the replicative powers of intelligent machines. If
the 20th century was the century of nuclear weapons, then the 21st
might be the century of self-breeding aliens of our own devising.

   Soviet Espionage in America -- the Stalin Era.

 &UR; THE KREMLIN CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   BY JOSEPH E. PERSICO
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In December 1948, the legendary broadcast journalist Edward R.
Murrow went on the air to deplore the death of Laurence Duggan, a
former State Department official seemingly hounded to suicide by
the Communist-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee, whose
members included Representative Richard M. Nixon. Murrow's outrage
might have been tempered if he had possessed the information about
Duggan that is revealed in ``The Haunted Wood,'' by Allen
Weinstein, the founder of the Center for Democracy in Washington
and Moscow, and Aleksandr Vassiliev, a journalist and a K.G.B.
alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   While once-unimaginable collaborations among writers from
opposing trenches in the cold war are not all that uncommon today,
this work has a special power. During a two-year window of
opportunity (or of lowered guard), Russia's Foreign Intelligence
Service, the successor to the Soviet Union's K.G.B., allowed the
authors access to thousands of secret documents from the Stalin
era. Much of what they found is not new -- and yet it is.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of reading ``The Haunted Wood'' is rather like
looking into the new edition of a book from which half the pages
had previously been torn out. What emerges most sharply is proof of
the guilt of certain Americans whose spying for the Soviet Union
has been the subject of debate for over half a century. Laurence
Duggan, for example, may have been driven to suicide by the HUAC
Red hunters; but one document the authors unearthed in Moscow
reveals how a Soviet defector was murdered to protect the identity
of Duggan, whose espionage ``take'' in the 1930's occasionally went
directly to Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly with Alger Hiss. For decades, the truth about the
Hiss-Whittaker Chambers case had been obscured by its symbolism. To
both liberals and conservatives, as Weinstein and Vassiliev put it,
``the protagonists assumed the status of icons in the demonologies
and hagiographies of their opposing camps.'' In an earlier work,
``Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case'' (1978), Weinstein, possessing
far less evidence than is now available, traced his odyssey from
believing in Hiss's innocence to accepting his guilt as a Soviet
agent. Now the most die-hard Hiss apologist will find it daunting
to explain away a document the authors discovered in the K.G.B.
files revealing that Hiss and his ring were awarded Soviet
decorations for providing military information going back to 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the book consists in great part of swatches of actual
quotation from the files of the K.G.B. and its predecessors during
what the authors call the ``golden age'' of Soviet espionage
(1933-45). The files document Soviet spying by Representative
Samuel Dickstein of New York, so greedy that his handlers gave him
the code name ``Crook.'' The material from the file on Martha Dodd,
the daughter of the American Ambassador to Germany in the 1930's,
reads better than most spy thrillers: the beautiful and reckless
Dodd, known socially to President and Mrs. Roosevelt, gave her all,
sleeping with Nazis or whoever could provide useful intelligence to
her Soviet spymasters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Straight, a wealthy American blue blood recruited for
Soviet espionage at Cambridge University along with Donald Maclean,
Guy Burgess, Harold (Kim) Philby and Anthony Blunt, went directly
to an unwitting Roosevelt for help in wrangling a job that would
position him conveniently for Soviet spying. Serving in America's
own World War II intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic
Services, and close to its chief, William J. (Wild Bill) Donovan,
was Duncan Lee, a descendant of Gen. Robert E. Lee, and another
Soviet recruit. Lee always denied the charge, yet a K.G.B. file
reveals a Soviet agent boasting of Lee's value as a source, noting
that all O.S.S. intelligence ``from Europe and the rest of the
world . . . comes through his hands.'' Still another file documents
the Soviets' strategy to tap Lauchlin Currie, a top Roosevelt White
House aide who became a source of intelligence to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   None of the foregoing names are new to accusations of espionage.
But in the past many escaped opprobrium, shielded by the notion
that they were victims of anti-Communist hysteria. The
Weinstein-Vassiliev discoveries in the archives of the opposition
camp tear away that shield.
</P>
<P>
   All the above penetrations, however, pale before the all-time
Soviet espionage triumph, the piercing of America's most zealously
guarded secret of the war, the development of the atomic bomb --
fittingly code-named ``Enormoz'' by the Soviets. The activities of
Klaus Fuchs, Harry Gold, David Greenglass, the Rosenbergs and many
others have long been chronicled. What is new here is the view of
their manipulation from the Soviet side and evidence of even deeper
penetration of the Manhattan Project than previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The authors found in the archives of the K.G.B. a virtual
hemorrhage of Allied atomic secrets. An anonymous donor left a
bundle of top secrets practically on the doorstep of the Soviet
Consulate in New York. A still-unidentified ``Tina,'' a Communist
working for a British firm, revealed to the Soviets the metals used
to make the bomb. ``Fogel,'' the code name for an American who was
never caught or identified, delivered to his controller plans for
plants and equipment employed to construct the bomb. Another
document reveals Soviet paranoia, with Moscow prodding its agents
in the United States to work harder because the Americans intended
``to maintain a complete monopoly on 'Enormoz' and to use the
(atomic bomb) for aggressive purposes against us.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HAUNTED-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: against us.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The K.G.B. archives further detail Moscow's nearly total control
and orchestration of the failed worldwide public relations campaign
to save Julius and Ethel Rosenberg from the electric chair for
passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. And the authors'
probing in Moscow finally lays to rest long-bruited suspicions
about the loyalty of the scientific chief of the Manhattan Project,
J. Robert Oppenheimer. Files they found suggest that he was a
``secret member'' of the American Communist Party, and make clear
that he was indeed a target of Soviet operatives -- Oppenheimer
``represents a very large interest for us.'' Yet Weinstein and
Vassiliev uncovered no shred of evidence that he ever spied for the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of these revelations to accept, at least for
those of us who deplored the overzealous Red-hunting of the late
40's and early 50's, is that the hunt rested on more substance than
we cared to admit, the phony posturing of Senator Joseph R.
McCarthy aside. Still, one question lingers. What prompted so many
privileged American intellectuals -- a Hiss, a Duggan, a Straight
-- to become seemingly mesmerized servants of an authoritarian spy
service? ``Soviet intelligence files,'' the authors conclude,
``document the mixture of accidental encounters, underlying
ideological beliefs, romantic antifascist views and Soviet
persistence.'' One finishes ``The Haunted Wood'' with a sense that
the romantic antifascism, coupled with a romanticized Communism,
produced a potent political narcotic. To be an economist for the
Farm Security Administration might lack glamour, but to toil for
the F.S.A. and also to be a spy! Now there was excitement,
heightened by membership in ``an elite . . . secretive club
fighting for a noble ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, critics may charge that it is all a fraud. Could not
the Russians have fabricated incriminating documents and then fed
them to eager researchers? But to what end Why would Russian
intelligence operatives have concocted and buried these files until
only the impossible-to-predict collapse of the Soviet Union brought
them to light? Further supporting the validity of the documents is
the fact that many of the messages in the K.G.B. archive were
matched by the authors against outgoing messages that the Soviets
radioed from the United States to Moscow during the war,
transmissions intercepted and broken through an American
code-cracking triumph called Venona.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that all World War II histories written before
the revelation of Ultra, the British success in breaking German
codes, are incomplete. The work of Weinstein, Vassiliev and their
colleagues mining the Soviet lode begins to approach the
significance of an Ultra. Histories of Soviet-American relations
written without benefit of Soviet secret files now available are,
to some degree, books with missing pages.

   The Making of the New York School of Poets.

 &UR; LAST ONE OFF THE BARRICADE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID YEZZI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH time has passed since the poets of the New York School
resembled anything like an avant-garde that to refer to them as
such now invites nostalgia. As with so many artists who begin as
defiant Prince Hals and end as conquering King Henrys, the term
suggests a time prior to widespread acclaim. For John Ashbery,
Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch and James Schuyler -- the subjects of
``The Last Avant-Garde,'' David Lehman's jaunty and readable
account of artistic friendship and collaboration in Manhattan in
the 1950's and early 60's -- the battle to establish their
distinctive brand of poetry has long been waged and won.
</P>
<P>
   Of Ashbery, Lehman writes that ``he is America's best-known
poet, with a strong readership in Britain and a larger
international following than any of his American contemporaries.''
That his willfully opaque poems remain a ``litmus test'' for some
only suggests to Lehman that there are those who have not yet
caught up with the judgments of our most prominent literary
critics. All four poets may be read in swank collected editions
befitting their prizewinning oeuvres. Lehman's label of
``avant-garde,'' however, reminds us that these darlings of the
academy were once its adversaries, and that their work was not
always the colossus it has become but a dynamic fringe experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the author of ``Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and
the Fall of Paul de Man,'' has a spirited story to tell, and he
tells it with spirit. A strong proponent of the New York School
esthetic, he is fortunate in his material, which lends itself so
neatly to bohemian mythologizing. With more than a hint of Romantic
ecstasy, Lehman describes the fervor of the San Remo bar and Cedar
Tavern in Greenwich Village. Such midcentury hangouts teemed not
only with painters and writers, we read, but also with ``the bliss
of being alive and young at a moment of maximum creative ferment.''
As Koch has it, the scene was ``fizzy with collaboration.'' (And
one suspects, with so much hard drinking going on, fizzy with
Alka-Seltzer as well.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara provided the group with its center and, after his death
in 1966 in a freak accident on a Fire Island beach, with its
martyr. Through his myriad friendships and his curatorial position
at the Museum of Modern Art, O'Hara worked painters like Jane
Freilicher, Fairfield Porter and Larry Rivers into the mix. Joint
works abounded. Rivers inspired a play by Koch, Koch wrote the poem
``A Postcard to Popeye'' with Ashbery, Ashbery wrote the novel ``A
Nest of Ninnies'' with Schuyler, Schuyler collaborated on an ode
with O'Hara, O'Hara sat for a portrait painted by Rivers (his
lover) and so on in a daisy chain of ``literary lovemaking''
straight out of ``La Ronde.''
</P>
<P>
   While mutual admiration cemented them as a school, the four
remained very different as poets, with the ``quietly Whitmanic''
Schuyler most markedly apart. Personally, they had much in common.
All (save Schuyler) overlapped at Harvard, all (save Koch) were
homosexual, all (save Ashbery) did military service, all (save
Koch) reviewed art and all (save Ashbery, who soon moved to Paris)
lived in New York during their formative years as poets. The sound
of Ashbery's voice so resembled O'Hara's that people mistook them
for each other, yet readers of their work would hardly make that
mistake. Lehman, nevertheless, finds some common denominators. The
quartet aligned themselves with French Surrealists like Raymond
Roussel, Pierre Reverdy and Guillaume Apollinaire: ``They favored
wit, humor and the advanced irony of the blague (that is, the
insolent prank or jest) in ways more suggestive of Jasper Johns and
Robert Rauschenberg than of the New York School painters after whom
they were named.''
</P>
<P>
   An assiduous researcher and critic as well as a companionable
gossip, Lehman occasionally falls prey to his poets' playful
spirit. Do we need to know Ashbery's astrological sign (``Leo . . .
with Virgo rising'') to appreciate a poem referring to
constellations? Lehman sometimes overstates his case, particularly
where he assumes the reader's complete sympathy. Ashbery's
associative ramble ``The Skaters'' becomes in Lehman's estimation
``a latter-day equivalent of T. S. Eliot's 'Waste Land.' '' The
comparison misfires. Ashbery's lines pale next to the best of
modernism, America's only truly great literary avant-garde of the
century and the movement that the New York School poets labored so
wildly to extend.

</P>
<P>
   Childhood these days is often a land of diagnoses. Detours from
the developmental path can easily get a kid tagged with one new
syndrome or another. And as far as many parents are concerned, this
is an unmitigated good. These parents -- and we tend to hear a lot
from them because they speak up at school board meetings and
testify before Congress -- are grateful to have an explanation
like, say, attention deficit disorder for behavior that puzzles or
frightens them and are relieved to know that they are not alone. We
don't hear quite as much from parents who react to such labels with
tortured ambivalence, who wonder whether their child's
individuality has been reduced to pathology, and what might be lost
if it has.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Kephart is such a parent, and fortunately for us she is
also a gifted, even poetic writer. In 1991, when Kephart's son,
Jeremy, was 2, doctors concluded he had something called pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified, a catchall
condition that might best be described as a milder and more
malleable form of autism. That Jeremy was different from other
children his age came as no surprise to Kephart or her husband, an
artist and architect. Jeremy spoke early, but his speech seemed to
stall at the naming stage -- ``Dino!'' ``Juice cup!'' ``Bathtub!''
-- and later deteriorated into echolalia, the tendency to repeat
what he had just heard. He was, more even than most toddlers, a
creature of habit, a fiend for order and patterns. He liked to
arrange his matchbox cars in color-coded pinwheels as intricate as
church-floor mosaics and could not abide having any of them moved a
fraction of an inch. For months he would not leave the house or
take a bath or go to sleep without donning a chartreuse fedora
several sizes too big that he had picked out for himself at the
local department store. Playgrounds were not easy places for him,
and new children -- new people in general -- often put him deeply
out of sorts. He preferred textbooks on medieval chivalry to
``Goodnight Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Kephart, a freelance writer, have any real doubt that
Jeremy would need extra help, redoubled devotion, if he were to
keep one foot in the world as most of the rest of us know it. She
writes eloquently in ``A Slant of Sun,'' her first book and a
finalist for a National Book Award last year, of her panic before
his diagnosis and his first rounds of speech therapy, of the
moments when her sweet black-eyed boy seems to be sliding away from
her into some shadow land: ``There is an absence of things. Small
lights burning out. The creep of an indecipherable dimness. Jeremy
does not wave hello. Jeremy does not eat his food. Jeremy does not
look for us beneath the hood of his eyes; language is
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kephart also knows that naming a child's syndrome is not the
same as helping him, and not the same as understanding him.
Pervasive developmental disorder, as she quickly comes to realize,
is another way for doctors to say that something is wrong but they
don't know what or why. It's not a diagnosis that entails an
obvious course of treatment, nor does it take into account the
aspects of Jeremy that those who love him wouldn't want treated.
``What, in the end, are you fighting for: Normal? Is normal
possible? Can it be defined? Is it best achieved by holing up in
the offices of therapists, in special classrooms, in isolated
exercises, in simulating living, while everyday 'normal' happens
casually on the other side of the wall? And is normal superior to
what the child inherently is, to what he aspires to, fights to
become, every second of his day?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Slant of Sun'' is a memoir -- a personal and not a
prescriptive book -- but one of its strengths is that it makes us
think about these questions not just for Jeremy but for other
idiosyncratic children too. In her introduction Kephart writes that
Jeremy is now ``a successful second grader at a country Quaker
school,'' a boy with friends and hobbies and a philosophical bent
that prompts him to ponder aloud, ``Mommy, how are we supposed to
see God?'' And it is striking that while Kephart gives ample credit
to the various professionals -- speech therapists, play therapists
-- who helped Jeremy adopt a less solipsistic way of being in the
world, she is most moved by the ordinary people who saw and
appreciated him for what he was already.
</P>
<P>
   Kephart and her husband decided against special schools for
Jeremy, which they thought would only isolate him further. They
were willing to create a miniature mainstream for their son that
would be like the real mainstream, but kinder -- a milieu in which
he would always be listened to as he groped for more conversational
language, in which he would be given time to decompress when he had
been deep in one of his interior visions. In this enterprise,
though, they needed at least some confederates outside their own
tenderly solicitous household -- friends who would not regard
Jeremy's passions for trucks or knights or green hats merely as
symptoms, who would see something joyful in the whorls and ridges
of his distinctive sensibility. They did find some of these people,
not many, but enough -- a teacher or two, a baby sitter, the
handyman at school who just plain liked him. What these friends
offered might seem like the simplest of gifts. Kephart makes it
clear that it was anything but.

   ``The appearance of struggle,'' Nicholas Fox Weber writes in
CLEVE GRAY (Abrams, $39.95), has often been identified with being
``'the real thing.''' This is a key argument in his attempt to
dispel the aura of privilege that the painter Cleve Gray believes
has interfered with the art world's perception of him. Written as a
continuing encounter among artist, author and several barnloads of
paintings, this monograph is unusual both in its frankly informal
tone and its subordination of the work to the worries of the maker.
``I've often been mistaken for a rich boy who could buy his way
in,'' Gray laments, in a manner that reveals his private fear more
than it elucidates his artistic ambitions. What does emerge from
Gray's hand wringing, however, is an oddly affecting and
sympathetic portrait of the struggle to create in the face of
indifference. The book also traces the delicate path required to
achieve success and shows how sincere efforts can turn into
self-sabotage -- like Gray's diatribe against the Abstract
Expressionists written in 1959 for The American Scholar, in which
he excoriated the art world's poor taste. Curiously, as his ideas
evolved Gray's own paintings came to resemble that very work he
dismissed as lacking content. But his conversion came too late, and
despite prestigious commissions, including the ``Threnody'' series
-- 14 enormous murals commissioned for the Neuberger Museum of Art
at Purchase College of the State University of New York -- poor
critical reviews have dogged his career, rendering elusive the
recognition that every artist hopes for. Though Gray emerges from
this fragile paean to his perseverance as a worthy martyr to art,
Weber fails to make a convincing argument for a reconsideration of
Gray's work as commensurate with the struggle that made it. _

   Coming from someone who is so adept at cutting through
corniness, it is a shame that Cher's memoir, ``The First Time,'' is
so banal. Instead of her smart-mouth humor, most of the book is
filled with exclamations, italics, parentheses and exaggerations.
Instead of making it light and breezy, the book's structure --
short chapters on subjects like ``My First Bra,'' ``My First
Out-of-Body Experience,'' ``The First Time I Learned My Daughter
Was Gay'' -- kills continuity and buries the biography. Background
details are almost nonexistent; for example, we learn few facts
about Cher's parents except that they ``were young, jealous and
immature; kind of like Sean and Madonna.'' Nicknames are given
before full names appear; divorces are announced when the reader is
not sure if there has been a marriage. There is probably just
enough material here for an illustrated calendar on Cher's career.

   Adapted from Ruby Dee's one-woman show, ``My One Good Nerve,''
is a compilation of musings, short essays, stories and poems
written and performed over several years. The whole, however, is a
good deal more than its parts. With its wry humor, longing,
occasional anger and impatience with the world's idiocies, the book
provides a sharing of Dee's deepest concerns, those of an
intelligent, informed and sophisticated sensibility. ``Ode to
O.D.,'' for example, is an encomium to Dee's husband, Ossie Davis,
that every wife will appreciate and identify with: ``Wait! Ossie
wait! After half a century, I have something to tell you!'' That
``something'' is expressed in a poem that barely mentions love, yet
is profoundly loving (the last lines are ``Don't forget to -- to --

   Put out the trash''). Funny, touching and sensitive, Dee's voice
is always unpretentious and it is one to be returned to again and

</P>
<P>
   Waris Dirie, a model who has appeared in Elle, Glamour and
French Vogue, has written a memoir that describes her amazing
journey from childhood in the deserts of Somalia to the runways of
New York, Paris and Milan. ``Desert Flower,'' written with Cathleen
Miller, gives a powerful inside view into the hardships of the
nomadic Somali culture, where life is centered around the daily
search for food and water, and young girls undergo genital cutting
for arranged marriages. Dirie herself escaped such a marriage -- by
running away to an aunt in Mogadishu -- but not the cutting, which
she describes in horrific detail. Moving to London after finding
work as a domestic servant, Dirie was discovered by a photographer,
thus beginning a career filled with difficulties. There were
cultural differences (she left her first casting when asked to
remove her dress), language barriers (Dirie was only just learning
to read and write English) and, most important, her lack of a valid
passport, which necessitated two disastrous marriages of
convenience and years of deceiving British immigration officials.
After long and painful health problems, Dirie reached a turning
point following the birth of her son. Realizing that millions of
women were still suffering from the practice of genital mutilation,
Dirie decided to ``speak out for the little girl with no voice'' in
a magazine interview. This resulted in an appearance on ``20/20,''
and ultimately Dirie was given a post as a special ambassador for
the United Nations. Written with innocence and warmth, this book
shows how one woman's tragedy can help others. _ RAYE SNOVER

<P>
   Rachel Carson, best known for her book ``Silent Spring,'' died
of breast cancer in 1964. It is no great surprise that her writing
still sparkles after all this time; she was as much a perfectionist
in her writing as in her science. Linda Lear's collection of her
essays does a superb job of pulling from Carson's works a
collection that is lyric, descriptive, informative and moving. The
surprise is that Carson's scientific brilliance still shines. The
engaging pieces in ``Lost Woods'' include a discussion of how
evolution continues today, a warning on the hazards to island
ecosystems and an analysis of cloud formations that accompanied a
1957 television program. The most scientific and politically
powerful piece in this collection is Carson's speech attacking the
detractors of ``Silent Spring,'' delivered shortly before her
death, giving example after example of the damage being done
through bioconcentration of contaminants moving through food chains
and transportation of contaminants across distances in animals; it
ends with her declaration that humans should be viewed as animals
whose well-being is tightly tied to the condition of their
environment. This book should be required reading both for
corporate managers in environmentally sensitive industries and for
environmentalists and environmental scientists, who deserve the
inspiration of Carson's finely wrought, passionate prose. _ BILL

</P>

   The rags-to-riches story of how Jules Stein and Lew Wasserman,
two sons of Jewish immigrants, became the ultimate
behind-the-scenes Hollywood power brokers is told in Dennis
McDougal's thoroughly reported and engrossing book, ``The Last
Mogul.'' Begun by Stein, the Music Corporation of America started
as an agency representing bands. It quickly gained leverage over
the live music business through its talent lineup. Under Stein's
successor, Wasserman, the company later applied its hardball
tactics to movies and television, with even more success. MCA began
to dominate the entertainment industry, and its nickname said it
all: ``The Octopus.'' In 1962, after a 20-year antitrust
investigation, the Justice Department forced MCA out of the talent
agent business. In return it was allowed to continue with its
biggest acquisition, Universal Studios. Wasserman went on reigning
in Hollywood until the 1990s, when the company was bought first by
Matsushita, then by Seagram. McDougal, who covered Hollywood for
The Los Angeles Times for some 10 years, has marshaled reams of
documents and hundreds of interviews to show exactly how MCA used
its muscle -- from making friends with presidents to strong-arming
network executives and devising intricate tax shelters for star
clients. He writes that the most noteworthy trait of MCA was how it
hid its power. ``One of Lew's great strengths,'' McDougal says,
``was that he never felt compelled to take the credit -- all he
demanded was the money.'' _ TED LOOS

 &UR; MAKE WAY FOR CIVILIZATION
</P>
<P>
   BY JAY PARINI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THE picaresque novel trembles to life again in the hands of
Tatiana Lobo, a Chilean-born writer who has lived in Costa Rica
since 1966. ``Assault on Paradise,'' which won the Sor Juana Ines
de la Cruz Prize (given annually at the Guadalajara International
Book Fair) in 1995, tracks the fortunes and misfortunes of a wily
18th-century Spaniard by the name of Pedro Albaran -- a classic
rogue, or picaro. True to form, he is a disaffected fellow tumbling
headlong through life, repelled by all forms of authority, his
adventures an implicit challenge to the hypocritical norms of his
time.
</P>
<P>
   Lobo attends lovingly to the petty details of life in Spain and
Central America in the early 1700's; indeed, her novel bursts with
vivid minutiae, from the fleas and lice that keep Pedro awake at
night to the damp cacao beans he must accept as payment for his
work. Everything is here, from ``cows, sacks of wheat, corn, beans
and cacao'' to ``tapers, wineskins, flasks of honey.''
</P>
<P>
   As the novel opens, Pedro is in flight from the forces of the
Inquisition, which he has run afoul of after a drunken episode in a
tavern in Seville -- one of many hilarious scenes in a book filled
with bawdy humor and wryly comic moments. To escape imprisonment,
Pedro sails to the New World and winds up in Costa Rica, mostly
because it ``had been described to him as a tranquil,
underpopulated region with a pleasant climate.'' As he soon
discovers, Costa Rica, while underpopulated, is hardly tranquil;
indeed, the Spanish rulers of the province are constantly warring,
both among themselves and with the native population.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, Pedro hides himself in a monastery, the last place the
Inquisition might look for him. This also allows Lobo to have
delicious fun portraying the ill-mannered pack of friars who become
Pedro's companions, devoted as they are to ``cardplaying and dice
and making advances to women in the confessional.'' To earn a
meager living, Pedro finds employment as secretary to an important
government official, applying himself assiduously to his work. He
also makes friends with a jolly shoemaker called Smiles (a sometime
narrator in this otherwise third-person novel), who becomes his
mentor and smooths his passage through the tumultuous local scene.
Thanks to the shoemaker's efforts, it even looks as if Pedro might
slip into the peaceful anonymity he so furiously desires.
</P>
<P>
   With laudable energy, Lobo brings into radiant (often redolent)
being the teeming life of the colonial city of Cartago, which
provides a typical assortment of corrupt politicians, vain
aristocrats, greedy entrepreneurs, unholy clerics and motley
unfortunates of the lower orders, whose fates are dealt with
crudely and thoughtlessly by those in control. Translated in a
workmanlike if occasionally awkward fashion by Asa Zatz, ``Assault
on Paradise'' offers a withering portrait of both the Inquisition
and the Spanish conquest of the New World, which was famously
ruthless in its suppression of native populations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pedro, our picaro, cannot even suppress his own roguish
self, and before long he gets into huge difficulties. One of the
most satisfying strains in the narrative concerns his bizarre
alliances with various women, including La Chamberga, an innkeeper
from Seville who pursues him to the New World; Agueda, the
seductive wife of a powerful army officer who (for a while) is the
object of Pedro's unrequited love; a popular local whore called The
Mother of Travelers; and -- most important -- a speechless Indian
girl whose culture Pedro unwittingly embraces as he draws close to
her. It is with her that he fathers his only child, a daughter, and
with whom he finds at least a temporary shelter of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's plot pivots on the central conflict of colonialism:
the clash of the dominant culture over the local, which it attempts
(with varying degrees of success) to squash. In this case, the
native culture is Mayan, and its great defender is an Indian
warrior called Presbere, ``a mature man and sedate as a fig tree,
his face grave in expression, under the skin the muscles weaving
nerves like the cords of a hammock.'' Lobo speaks with unwavering
reverence for the Indians and their vibrant mythology, celebrating
their profound sense of a sacred world. If anything, she is a bit
too reverent about them. Presbere, who is sacrificed in the end,
defying the Spaniards to his last courageous breath, seems unreal,
excessively noble. Some flaws in his character would have made him
more believable and more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is Pedro who most enchants us -- this hapless,
canny, unfortunate and desperately human figure who moves from
tempest to tempest, losing much along the way but gaining, at long
last, a complex sense of himself. In a poignant scene near the
close of the book, we encounter him lying sleepless in bed, his
daughter in his arms, recollecting his life as ``a sequence of
images that was orderly and coherent and, for that reason, vivid
and painful.'' It is Tatiana Lobo's impressive accomplishment that
she manages to make such memories shimmer with a sense of actual
physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Assault on Paradise'' can be considered a critique of
colonialism and its cruelties, it is not only that. For in her
portrayal of its feckless hero, Lobo moves her novel well beyond
polemic and into the realm of art.

 THE ORCHID THIEF
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Susan Orlean.

 &UR; FLOWER POWER
</P>
<P>
   BY TED CONOVER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Given a stack of 30 long features from the nation's magazines, a
reader could quickly find the one written by Susan Orlean. It would
have a narrow focus: the routine of a 10-year-old boy in New
Jersey; Saturday night with a lounge band in Portland, Ore.; a
grocery store in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   It would be stylishly written, whimsical yet sophisticated,
quirkily detailed and full of empathy for a person you might not
have thought about empathetically before -- might not have thought
about at all. It would be lightly first person, with the few things
Orlean revealed about herself things you were probably glad to
know, and yet the whole would feel somehow suffused with her
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orchid Thief'' grew out of an article like those, for The
New Yorker. It is Orlean's first book-length narrative (after two
collections, the first one short pieces about New England, the
second portraits of Americans celebrating Saturday night). It shows
her gifts in full bloom, as well as the challenges, even for such a
talented journalist, of writing at this length.
</P>
<P>
   The thief of the title is John Laroche, ``skinny as a stick,
pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and sharply handsome, in spite of the
fact that he is missing all his front teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlean had noticed a short article about him in a local paper.
Laroche, along with three Seminole assistants, had been caught as
they emerged from southern Florida's Fakahatchee Strand State
Preserve, a vast swamp, carrying four pillowcases containing more
than 200 rare orchids and bromeliads. He planned to clone them by
the millions, he explained to the arresting officers, and then sell
them to collectors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   As he awaited trial, Orlean decided to hang out with Laroche and
learn about him and his world. With her picaresque hero as guide,
she is led into the strange society-in-miniature of orchid
collectors and propagators. This sort of place is exactly where
Orlean likes to be, and soon her terrarium is filled with orchid
maniacs like Laroche's pal Dewey Fisk, whose business, the
Philodendron Phreaque, is run out of his house on ``one of those
old Florida roads with rain ruts and grassy edges, and rows of
one-floor bungalows with screened porches and dead cars and dead
bicycles and dead appliances lying out in the open to molder, the
way the Seminoles lay out their dead.'' And then there is the
orchid breeder Martin Motes, a former English professor who
misquotes Shakespeare to his customers. And the swells at Miami's
American Orchid Society gala, where Orlean leans against the wall
with the black-tied, orchid-loving Earl of Mansfield (``His wife
had impressed me in the receiving line because she was so pretty
and her hands felt like baby powder'').
</P>
<P>
   Laroche is not a gala benefit type of guy, and he vanishes
during this and other long stretches of the book. This is not all
bad, because though Orlean is marvelous at describing her wing nut
and his esthetic and moral world, there is not nearly enough of him
to fill a book. Orlean appears to know this and digresses in long
passages into several areas suggested by Laroche and his passion.
We learn about the birth of orchid collecting in Victorian England
and the exploits of agents sent by aristocrats to acquire specimens
in faraway lands; about the Seminole Indians (Laroche was starting
a nursery business for them at the time he was caught); about the
sometimes fierce rivalries among Miami-area orchid dealers; and
about orchid crimes, the largest of which was perhaps a classic
Florida land scam that drained large pieces of the Fakahatchee for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No narrative really unites these passages, and several, like the
Fakahatchee itself, through which Orlean slogs on three occasions
(once with two convicts on work release), are slow going. What
emerges finally as the book's true subject is the monomania of
collectors. As Orlean meets and sizes up a cast of characters that
is downright English in its eccentricity, she comments: ``It seemed
as if there were hundreds and hundreds of people who were wrapped
up in their special passion for the natural world. I still
considered Laroche and his schemes exceptional -- actually,
something beyond exceptional -- but he had started to seem more
like the end point in a continuum. He was the oddball ultimate of
those people who are enthralled by nonhuman living things and who
pursue them like lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlean envies them this passion, this organizing principle for
life, without sharing it -- early on she professes to own not a
single plant. Still, she comes to appreciate orchids as you feel a
fancier must (and describes one as only she could): ``He reached
for a pot that held the cutest plant in the world. . . . I thought
I might die if I couldn't have this one. The background of the
petal was the beigey yellow of a legal pad, and over the yellow
background was a spray of hot pink pinpoint dots, and the flower
was attached to the plant by a stem that was twisted like a stick
of licorice. The petals were plump and supple and pleasant to
touch. The center of the flower looked like the face of a piglet. I
felt as if the plant was looking at me as much as I was looking at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She even appreciates her roguish hero as only a mother might,
appearing to forgive him when he returns to her story at the end
only to let the air out of it: slapped on the hand by the judge and
dropped by the Seminoles, Laroche renounces not only orchids but
indeed plants of any kind. His new love: Web-page design and
pornography publishing. Orlean puzzles over ``how someone could end
such intense desire without leaving a trace.'' But she concludes
that it's all in character -- Laroche's earlier infatuations with
ice age fossils, turtles and antique mirrors also ended abruptly.
He does not even know the phone number of his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate for the book that Laroche ends up looking like
a flake, because the collecting mania that Orlean has so
painstakingly described is, like the orchid, a small thing of
grandeur, a passion with a pedigree. Serious collectors wait seven
years just to see a new plant bloom, and Laroche, lacking
constancy, is not in their league. It is despite her thief, and not
because of him, that Orlean succeeds in revealing the grandeur of a
miniature.

NEW &AMP; NOTEWORTHY PAPERBACKS 
 BY SCOTT VEALE
</HEADLINE>
  (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 CIRCUMNAVIGATION
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Steve Lattimore.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, $12 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The author's first collection of short stories is populated by
disaffected Californians stuck with menial jobs, empty lives and
dead-end relationships. In 1997 our reviewer, Scott Bradfield,
called this a ``funny, moving book'' that in its best moments is
``about the various jangled ways in which broken families manage to
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SLAVES IN THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   By Edward Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine, $15.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Searching for the descendants of slaves owned by his ancestors
in South Carolina, the author confronts his heritage and the moral
consequences of slavery. His account, which won a National Book
Award last year, took him across America and to Africa, and
involved extensive interviews and research. ``There is much to
admire in Ball's very willingness to challenge the generations of
silence in his white family and to search out black kin whose
reactions he had every reason to fear,'' Drew Gilpin Faust wrote
here in 1998. In To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives
and Labors After the Civil War, by Tera W. Hunter (Harvard
University, $15.95), a history professor explores the valuable
political and social role played by black women after Emancipation.
In 1997 the same reviewer called this a ``celebration of struggle
and resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COCKROACH BASKETBALL LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   By Charley Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Stories, $13.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This hymn to minor-league basketball follows a team of misfits
and whining wannabes as they ply their trade in the shadow of the
big time. The result is ``a racily entertaining novel'' that
``skillfully induces the reader to join 'the Brotherhood of the
Sacred Hoop,' '' Michael Anderson wrote here in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE ELIOT: A LIFE
</P>
<P>
   By Rosemary Ashton.
</P>
<P>
   Penguin, $15.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This revisionist biography combines the social context of
Eliot's fiction and a detailed analysis of her novels. ``Ashton is
a serious, persistent scholar, and the picture she gives of Eliot's
intellectual and emotional life is convincing,'' William S.
Peterson wrote in these pages in 1997. Jane Austen: A Life, by
David Nokes (University of California, $19.95), reveals how the
novelist wielded irony and razor-sharp observation as weapons to
skewer the constraining society in which she lived. In 1997 in the
Book Review, Claude Rawson praised the author for leaning heavily
on Austen's letters, which ``are wonderfully revealing, especially
strong on the texture of relationships and the tang of social
encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRINCE OF PEACE
</P>
<P>
   By James Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This densely plotted novel tells the parallel tales of an
American priest who gets caught up in the anti-Vietnam War movement
and what is portrayed as the metamorphosis of the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States into a cynically run corporation. ``The
stories are nearly irresistible,'' Webster Schott wrote here in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASPHALT NATION
</P>
<P>
   How the Automobile Took Over America, and How We Can Take It
Back
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Holtz Kay.
</P>
<P>
   University of California, $16.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In this cranky polemic, an architecture critic describes how
unchecked motorized sprawl is threatening the nation's cities and
towns, its economy and its health. She ``largely succeeds in
proving that it is possible to get where we are going without
destroying where we live,'' Kenneth T. Jackson said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EATING CHINESE FOOD NAKED
</P>
<P>
   By Mei Ng
</P>
<P>
   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Lee is a restless college graduate whose protective love
for her mother draws her back to her father's laundry in Queens.
Last year our reviewer, Lynn Karpen, called this an ``affecting
first novel'' that ``conveys the complexities of family life with
vibrant color and luminosity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOBBY REX'S GREATEST HIT
</P>
<P>
   By Marianne Gingher.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State University, $14.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It's 1961 in Greensboro, N.C., and Pally Thompson is about to
marry a man who wants to know how far she went with a local
country-music crooner whose hit song is all about his romance with
her. This ``richly detailed, often charming first novel . . .
lovingly evokes Pally's journey from innocence to maturity in a
town where gossip flourishes and ambitions fade,'' Ellen Pall wrote
here in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITIZEN SOLDIERS
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army From the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the
Surrender of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   June 7, 1944-May 7, 1945
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen E. Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In this sequel to ``D-Day,'' the author's 1994 best seller about
the Normandy landing, he once again uses the experiences of
ordinary soldiers to re-create the bloody, often nameless battles
that led to the Nazi defeat. '' 'Citizen Soldiers' is an
unforgettable testament to the World War II generation,'' Carlo
D'Este wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOD'S SNAKE
</P>
<P>
   By Irini Spanidou
</P>
<P>
   Vintage International, $13 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A young girl chronicles her anguished coming-of-age in Greece in
the 1950s as the daughter of an inflexible military officer who
treats her as if she were one of his recruits. This first novel
``freshly evokes the beauties and terrors of childhood,'' Nicholas
Bromell wrote here in 1986.

NEW YORK POLICE GRAB COUNTRY CLUB CRIMINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRENDAN LYONS  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Matthew Phelan's business plan was simple and
successful: buy merchandise cheap and resell it at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan had a snag. It was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan would board an airplane in Albany and fly to various
country clubs and fitness centers across the country. Posing as a
member, he would sneak into the locker rooms, steal credit cards
and before the owner realized the card was missing, charge
thousands of dollars in merchandise, including computers, stereo
equipment and Rolex watches.
</P>
<P>
   Then, authorities said, Phelan, 39, would ship the stuff back to
his home in Slingerlands or Albany International Airport, where he
would pick it up and resell it to ``customers'' who placed orders
with him.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, the list of ``clients'' includes a
several police officers in New York. But police officials added
that most of Phelan's customers were unaware the merchandise was
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan's alleged scheme unraveled after someone tipped
authorities to the unusual number of freight packages Phelan picked
up at the airport, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his livelihood,'' Albany County Sheriff James L.
Campbell said. ``He called himself a self-employed retailer. But
this was his business.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Phelan has been charged with a single count of
fourth-degree grand larceny, a felony, but additional charges are
pending, Campbell said. He added that his office is talking with
the U.S. Attorney's office about whether Phelan should face
possible federal charges in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan's enterprise started small and grew, according to court
documents filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure how it started,'' Phelan is quoted as
saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I guess it just grew, I got one computer for someone
with a credit card I stole, shipped it back to my house and sold
it. You would be surprised how easy it was. Then someone else asked
me for one and so on and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelan's operation become so efficient that some customers would
fax merchandise orders to him. ``I would get the lists of stuff
people wanted and plan a trip,'' he told police.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Investigator Captain Craig Apple said Phelan used his
own cash or credit cards to purchase airline tickets. Phelan flew
to at least 15 states in order to allegedly steal credit cards and
use them to buy merchandise, Apple said.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan would allegedly sell the merchandise at 30 to 40 percent
below retail cost, according to his statement. He also purchased
computer software that would give him locations of gyms and country
clubs in various cities and even print out maps for how to get to
them once he arrived at that city's airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sign in at the gym or club as a visitor, which is what
a lot of business men would do,'' Phelan told police. ``I would go
into the locker room and `pop' open the locks and steal credit
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   His most recent trip was to Arizona on Dec. 7, where he hit four
health clubs and a country club, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Sgt. Douglas Buzzard, whose unit patrols the airport,
said investigators began watching Phelan after noticing a high
number of computers and other merchandise arriving in his name via
air freight at Albany International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan has a criminal record including nearly a dozen arrests
and convictions for charges ranging from grand larceny to
possession of burglary tools, according to the state Division of
Criminal Justice Services.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-month investigation, authorities asked Phelan to
come in for an interview earlier this month, Campbell said.
Investigators confronted Phelan with evidence about the alleged
scheme. On Dec. 16, he was arrested and charged with a single count
of grand larceny, a felony, stemming from the alleged theft of a
credit card from a Wolf Road fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Phelan is free on $5,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investigators have recovered about $100,000 worth of
merchandise Phelan allegedly sold to people in this area, Apple
said.

<P>
   When champagne flows New Year's Eve, those sparkling, heady
bubbles may owe their origin as much to computer chips as to yeast
and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry _ winemakers will still taste at strategic points as
grapes turn themselves into champagne or chardonnay or sauvignon
blanc. There are still some things even the most talented circuit
can't do. But microprocessors have definitely invaded the vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Digital images taken from 15,000 feet above the vineyards of the
Napa Valley in California help spot properly ripening grapes.
Computer-controlled cages can rotate hundreds of bottles of
sparkling wine far more efficiently than any human, neatly
collecting sediment for removal while preserving all those tiny
bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are now in the sky above California's vines and in the
earth below, in the fermentation tanks and even on the presses that
gently squeeze the grapes. Throughout California, computer
technology is being adopted by wineries like Beringer Vineyards, a
large winery in St. Helena, where Ed Sbragia, the winemaker, uses a
laptop to check the temperature of the fermentation tanks, and
Cakebread Cellars, a small family-owned winery in Rutherford, which
is developing an online library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winemakers like to preserve the image of handcrafted wine,
where people hop into the barrels and crush the grapes with their
feet,' said James Laube, the author of ``California Wine'' (Wine
Spectator Press, 1995) and a senior editor at Wine Spectator
magazine. ``In fact, computers are absolutely involved in the
producing of excellent wines, whether they are on the presses or
monitoring the fermentation tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Larger companies like Beringer and Mondavi rely on technology in
part because they are dealing with so many grapes. ``A mom-and-pop
operation where the owners walk through their 10 acres of grapes
has less need of computers,'' Laube said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, technology has helped eliminate flawed wines with
less desirable characteristics. ``The computer has helped people
become better grape growers and better winemakers, and the result
is better wine,'' Laube said. ``Ten to 15 years ago, a much more
variable quality of wine was being made. Today there are very few
defective wines, a huge upside for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cakebread and his sons Dennis and Bruce are using an online
library so their growers, scattered up and down the valley, can
check and compare moisture, pruning and tasting records, even if
some of them have to borrow their children's computers to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine is about taste,'' Bruce Cake-bread said. ``Computer
technology, particularly in irrigation management, can help make
the wine taste better.'' Cakebread looks after the flavor of his
wine in part with the help of a neutron probe, a hand-size device
with a built-in radioactive source that measures soil moisture
during the growing season. If a lot of water is percolating through
the soil, neutrons will be slowed by collisions with the hydrogen
atoms in the water. The device measures the number of slowed
neutrons, a reliable indication of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every winemaker has a laptop in the tasting room.
At Ridge Vineyards in the Santa Cruz Mountains above Cupertino,
Calif., for instance, no computer is permitted to monitor the
temperature of the winery's complex, highly regarded reds as they
ferment in their stainless-steel tanks. ``We measure the
temperature by hand,'' said Paul Draper, who has been the winemaker
at Ridge for 29 years.

   Indeed, Draper, who laughs at the thought of entrusting the
temperature of his wines to sensors immersed in the liquid,
oversees the making of wines so natural that no yeast is added to
speed fermentation. ``We allow the natural yeast on the grapes to
carry out the fermentation,'' he said. ``And no probes, of course.
We prefer to smell the fermentation and determine how it's going _
to be in direct human contact with each tank.''
</P>
<P>
   But at wineries like Cakebread Cellars, highly sophisticated
technology is used to check beneath the vines to improve the taste
of ripening grapes as well as to check the vines from above, using
flyovers with digital sensors and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, Calif., has
collaborated with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
on two projects designed to adapt NASA's remote-sensing technology
to the wine-grape industry.

   Although the French, after centuries of grape growing, may know
every inch of their vineyards, Daniel Bosch, the technical manager
of the vineyard at Mondavi, said: ``Technology can help us play
catch-up. Aerial images give us the data to see the differences
that Europeans have learned by taste over hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The images are taken by aircraft flying 13,000 to 15,000 feet
above the vineyards. The planes are equipped with special digital
sensors that collect multispectral images _ images taken not only
in the visible but also in the near-infrared parts of the spectrum.
The images yield a sensitive measure of the chlorophyll content of
the vines, which says a lot about the taste of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The images were sensitive enough to show us that some of the
grapes were high-vigor, others medium-vigor, others low-vigor,''
Bosch said. ``Each level of vigor is unique in its taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Using multispectral images of a special demonstration vineyard,
Mondavi could identify reserve or high-quality grapes. ``The block
had never before yielded reserve-quality grapes,'' Bosch said. ``We
could locate them because of the differences in their images.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee F. Johnson, a scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif., was responsible for the pilot projects at
Mondavi. ``The French have had many years to adapt their management
practices perfectly to the countryside,'' he said. ``They don't
need us as much as Napa does.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson became interested in wine grapes in the early '90s, when
vineyards, particularly those in the Napa Valley and to the west,
in Sonoma County, were severely afflicted by phylloxera, or root
lice, and forced to replant up to 80 percent of their vines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we collaborated to transfer our technology to help
detect phylloxera and improve vineyard management in the face of
it,'' he said. ``It turned out that the aerial images were one way
to customize and get the best grapes possible out of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson expects that satellites will start carrying this kind of
digital sensing equipment next year. ``At present, no satellite
systems can give the spatial resolution you can get from
aircraft,'' he said. ``But several companies will be launching
systems that will work for precision farming so that vineyards can
do vegetation analyses from multispectral data.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Skinner, a consultant in Napa, Calif., who collaborated
with NASA on one of its earlier vineyard projects, agrees. ``Planes
get buffeted and tilted,'' he said. ``It's going to be a lot easier
to get precision images once satellites are up that can use the
resolution now available on airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner coordinates the collection and analysis of multispectral
data taken from airplanes for about 30 California vineyards. He
combines the data with the information gathered by his soil and
moisture programs to create profiles of the vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't just walk out and see what's ripe with a 40-acre
vineyard,'' he explained. ``Even if they pick clusters off at
random to decide, they may miss very significant areas within the
vineyard. Now we have the data from above and can put it together
with the data on the ground and below to make a powerful connection
between the grapes and their vigor or strength.''
</P>
<P>
   What will this mean to anyone who is toasting the New Year? Will
all this specialized information produce a tastier wine? Bosch, of
Mondavi, said that even the French thought so: ``When I was
speaking in Burgundy this summer to wine growers about our project,
they said the new technology had brought the United States forward
1,000 years. From the French, that's a compliment _ it means we
have only about 500 years to go.''

   &UR; These days many wines owe their savor to a circuit. Here are
some examples, should you wish to raise your glass in a high-tech
salute. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SPARKLING WINE
</P>
<P>
   ``You can clarify sparkling wine by hand or by machine,'' said
Teresa Bernards, associate winemaker at Domaine Carneros in Napa,
Calif., ``but the computer is more efficient. It not only rotates
the bottles, but it delivers a jolt to dislodge the sediment. You
can get a better jolt from a large machine than from a person's
hand.'' Domaine Carneros Brut 1993, about $15; Domaine Carneros Le
Reve 1992, about $29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is intrinsic to the production of quality wine,''
said David Stevens, associate winemaker at Domaine Chandon in
Yountville, Calif. ``Basically our computers are everywhere _ on
our presses and tanks, for example. Even the complexity of blending
requires a pretty serious computer and software.'' Chandon Napa
Valley Brut, about $15; Chandon Brut Reserve, $20; Chandon Etoile,
$25.
</P>
<P>
   CHARDONNAY
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, Calif., planted special
blocks of grapes, then monitored their progress from the sky using
digital imaging techniques developed by NASA. ``We were able to see
the degree of ripeness with great precision, picking the same
section four or five times as the vines ripened,'' said Mitchell
Klug, the director of wine-growing operations. The results can be
tasted in Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Chardonnay 1997, about
$20.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE ZINFANDEL
</P>
<P>
   Computer-monitored temperature control is crucial at every stage
in the production of white zinfandel to insure its characteristic
taste and color, said Laurie Hook, associate winemaker at Beringer
Vineyards in St. Helena, Calif. Beringer White Zinfandel, about $6.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hotel world, where the interior designer's stylish
solution is usually a sterile, Prozac look, Barbara Hulanicki at
least seems to be having fun. For the past seven years she has been
dazzling the locals in the South Beach area of Miami and in the
Bahamas with her exuberant hotel work. For the remodeling of the
Pink Sands Hotel, a hideaway on Harbour Island in the Bahamas, she
whisked together 17 colors for the hotel's main house. She painted
a billiard table shocking pink and stained the patio at a guest
bungalow hyacinth blue. No wonder she wears sunglasses indoors and
out.
</P>
<P>
   Some see her work as desecration. ``The colors she uses might be
legal but they are egregiously ugly,'' Steven Brooke, a Miami
photographer, said.
</P>
<P>
   To other critics, like Michael D. Kinerk, the chairman of the
Miami Design Preservation League, she is a threat. ``Barbara was at
the forefront of changing the local colors from pastel to bright,''
he said. ``It is the position of the league that the Art Deco
district's colors should now swing back to more historically
appropriate ones.'' The league's idea of perfection: white with a
tasteful pastel trim.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of a huge lilac fireplace in her airy South
Beach apartment, Ms. Hulanicki, 62, chortled at the accusations.
``I love it,'' she said. ``When I start doing white, they will be
begging me for color.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Hulanicki (pronounced Hula-NI-ki), the joke is on the
Miami Design Preservation League, which approved the exterior
colors for her three Miami hotels and even presented her with an
award for the lilac, peach and pale blue facade of the Marlin
hotel. ``It was such a step forward at the time,'' Kinerk
explained, with a squeeze of lemon in his voice. ``But now we have
different standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But fiercely bright color is about to crash back to the
fore. Ian Schrager's first hotel in London, which opens in June,
will be ``incredibly colorful _ quite a surprise,'' said Anda
Andrei, Schrager's design director. And at the spring 1999 fashion
shows, which are often a barometer of what's next, the look was
positively psychedelic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hulanicki is currently redecorating the rooms at the Leslie
Hotel in South Beach _ a hotel whose lemon-fudge and canary-yellow
facade must grate on the nerves of the authenticity league. The
first cell-size room she has completed (it will be $160 a night
when it becomes available next summer) has the punchy charm of a
13-year-old's fever dream. The bed is two-tone orange and purple _
and doubles as a giant couch. And the CD player looks like a yellow
army-issue field radio.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his designer's Sesame Street colors, Chris Blackwell,
the president of the Island Outpost hotel group, which owns the
Leslie, said, ``It's absolutely fun and childlike, qualities that
exist in everybody, or should.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hulanicki squired a visitor around the grounds of the Pink
Sands hotel in the Bahamas, a project she is beginning to drench
with color. ``It's about energy,'' she said. ``It has the same
effect on babies and adults, it makes our minds tick.'' The
souklike Moroccan-Indian interiors for the Pink Sands _ meant to
look as if they were accumulated haphazardly _ attract clients like
Calvin Klein, Harrison Ford, Tina Brown and Jill Sanders. Prices
for bungalows range from $600 to $1,750 a night.
</P>
<P>
   A warning here for civilians: You have to have an artist's eye
to pull off the Barbara Hulanicki look. When Blackwell had a
falling out with her and hired someone else to repaint one of his
hotels, Compass Point in the Bahamas, the result was ``horrific,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   She explained, ``You have to have a lot of colors so that people
can move their eyes from one color to another.'' The wild
combinations of colors do not have to be glaring and nerve-racking.
``It's restful when they all work together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this intense color, however, may not travel. ``When
people come and see it and say, `I'm going to do my home like
this,' I think, `Oh jeez, don't do it.' '' While bold colors work
best in bright sunlight, Ms. Hulanicki said: ``The colors would be
a little scary in New York. You need big walls and lots of light. A
pale gray blue works best in the city light.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the exotic undergrowth of multicolored bougainvillea, blue
plumbago and red lilies, the famed pink sand and azure sea, Ms.
Hulankicki is eccentrically dressed in her signature black. ``I
work a lot with color,'' she said. ``So I can't wear color.''
</P>
<P>
   She is used to being in the spotlight. In the early 1960s in
London, when most respectable young ladies were wearing navy blue
dresses and mother's pearls, she opened a business selling flirty
pink gingham dresses and matching head scarves via mail order. Her
clothing proved so successful she introduced a string of boutiques.
By 1969, with her husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon, she was running a
six-floor department store called Biba, full of her designs.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers still recall Biba's roof garden stocked with live
pink flamingos where Mick Jagger, Julie Christie and Twiggy hung
out. Biba had a 500-seat Art Deco restaurant called the Rainbow
Room, a housewares section stocked with fringed lampshades,
chocolate-and-silver wallpaper and plenty of ostrich plumes. ``I
hated all the '60s blow-up furniture,'' Ms. Hulanicki said. ``We
thought it was flash. Only sleazy advertising executives had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Biba was more of a club than a store. ``There was no place for
rebellious people to go then,'' she said, ``except pubs with smelly
old men.'' Those who couldn't afford the satin frocks with droopy
collars and pouf sleeves stopped by to use the blue, green, purple
and black Biba lipsticks before heading off to work. ``We learned a
lot from watching the customers,'' Ms. Hulanicki said.
</P>
<P>
   She still learns a lot from her clientele, only now it's about
how people use their temporary homes in hotels. ``You need lots of
shelves,'' she said. ``People put stuff everywhere.'' And mirrors,
like the giant ones at the Marlin hotel in South Beach. ``People
don't mind waiting for hours for an elevator if there is a
mirror,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson she discovered is that too much perfection makes
people look, well, rather ordinary. At the immaculate Delano, a
rival Miami hotel designed by Philippe Starck, she said: ``People
come down in the elevator in their horrible shorts, and they look
twice as bad as they really are. It's oppressive because you always
feel that you have the wrong clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, she prefers old objects to new. ``Most
modern wooden furniture is so perfect it looks like plastic,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pink Sands, barge loads of Indonesian, Balinese and Indian
furniture supply the 24 bungalows still undergoing renovation (only
two are finished). Most of the furniture comes from New York and
Miami stores like Soussan and World Resources _ here a swing, there
an opium bed, sometimes a pair of pink flamingos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hulanicki's background is as multicultural as her taste. She
was born in Poland, the oldest of three girls. (Her London venture
was named for her younger sister, Biba). After her father was shot
to death in Jerusalem in 1939, while negotiating Arab-Israeli
disputes, her family fled to England, where she studied
illustration at art school and sketched couture collections for
Women's Wear Daily. In her autobiography, ``From A to Biba,'' she
said she developed Biba for the girl she wanted to be. She has
always been nervous about her looks despite the bold statement she
makes: her signature platinum helmut hairdo, she said mockingly,
``comes back into fashion every 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   After she quit Biba in 1975, she and her husband and son,
Witold, moved to Brazil and then Miami. When she arrived in 1987,
the decaying beach resort was thronged with dilapidated homes. She
fell in love with it anyhow, and began designing nightclubs.
Blackwell commissioned her to renovate the Marlin and seven other
projects. ``What's so fantastic about her is she is so adaptive _
most designers have one thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She moved into a ballroom-size apartment in the lobby of a
former Deco hotel in South Beach after her husband died two years
ago. Now that it is so easy to pay a fortune for a stylish look,
she remains committed to cheap chic. The bright orange vases on the
mantel are, she says, '50s promotional pieces from Sears. On her
fingers, she wears two orange plastic rings, which she found on a
factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her humorous ideas are a challenge to the past decade of
minimalist design, which preaches an aura of endless calm. Her
South Beach apartment is temporarily decked out with boxes and, in
case of a hurricane, sandbags. How will she decorate the rest? She
replied: ``I think I'll try minimalism. I should be able to stand
that for about a week or two.''

WHAT IF GRAY DAVIS GAVE A PARTY ...  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If I were inaugurated as governor, I'd throw a
party the way Jerry Brown did in 1975. I'd go out for Chinese food
with about 30 of my closest acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe I'd have an inauguration party like Brown's in 1979:
order food in.
</P>
<P>
   I definitely wouldn't have inauguration parties like Gray Davis
will have Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Human beings aren't supposed to stand and shout with politicians
and lobbyists for three days in two cities, with three balls and a
gala starring Kenny G, Lionel Richie and Coolio _ all paid for by
82 special interest sponsors ponying up from $10,000 to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's what incoming governor Gray Davis faces, and he isn't
exactly a party guy.
</P>
<P>
   One of Davis' events is ``The Rock 'n' Roll Ball.'' Davis said
during the campaign that he attended only one rock concert in his
life, and the crowd thought he was a narcotics officer.
</P>
<P>
   Davis doesn't even look like a narc. He looks like a ``narcotics
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here's the thing. None of the inaugural events for this
Democratic administration is open to the public _ unlike previous
Republican administrations, which always had events citizens could
walk into.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thing. You don't want to go anyway.
</P>
<P>
   No one really wants to spend $125 to get into the Arco Arena and
see Gray Davis dance. Kids are not sleeping outside Tower Records
to buy $25 to $125 tickets to the gala to hear Kenny G or even
Coolio, who would be a lot less coolio in a room full of lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter. The events are by invitation only, cost money
and are sold out, even the ``Family Unity Celebration'' at the
California State Railroad Museum on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   You definitely don't want to go to that because the Niners are
playing the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Which party is more democratic? In 1991, incoming Republican
Gov. Pete Wilson spent four hours answering questions from the
public at the Railroad Museum for free.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you wanted to go to that either.
</P>
<P>
   Going to these kinds of inaugural events isn't interesting,
unless you're an insider, or maybe betting on whether San
Francisco's irrepressible mayor tries to upstage the new governor
he seems to think he owns.
</P>
<P>
   The main interest is for students of political semantics. Davis'
inaugural events are by invitation only, yet Davis' new
communications director, Phil Trounstine, said, ``This is the most
inclusive inaugural in memory in California history.''
</P>
<P>
   How can invitation-only events be inclusive?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. You have to be talking Demospeak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inclusive'' to Democrats means that events will be attended by
representatives of diverse ethnic, trade and moneyed groups _ labor
unions as well as big corporations, and Indian tribes as well as
Disney, which made a movie about Pocahontas.
</P>
<P>
   The blocks of tickets purchased by these groups will trickle
down to little people in the groups who may want to go to the
events _ well, just to say they did and it wasn't worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inclusive'' is basically a joke word in Republicanese. If
Republicans were forced to use it, it would mean any individual who
can pay the freight.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Walsh, spokesman for Gov. Wilson, said that in 1991 they
had an ``inaugural fiesta'' at the California Exposition. ``It was
by invitation, but anyone who called and asked for one got one, and
anyone who showed up and paid 30 bucks got in.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to come down to individual rights vs. group rights _ in
this case, the right to attend parties no individual or group wants
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Given the heat they'll likely get, the Democrats probably will
have to put some tickets up for sale on the Internet, something
they should have done in the first place for PR reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is going to click on their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, an inauguration is a big pain in the neck. When I
attended Bill Clinton's inauguration as president in 1992, it was
also a big pain in the feet.
</P>
<P>
   I had to wear boots with my tuxedo so I could trudge in the cold
from event to event in hopes of hearing Bill play the saxophone,
instead hearing his brother Roger sing. It was impossible to get a
cab.
</P>
<P>
   How many cabs does Sacramento have? They must be driving
reinforcements from Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Merksamer, a Republican political consultant, said he
hates going to any inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said inauguration events must be worthy of
California, and he thinks Davis' events will be. It's the
inauguration speech that counts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Merksamer, ``The parties are, first of all, for the
governor-elect, his close advisors and his strong supporters to
enjoy what is probably the happiest day of any governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's all downhill from there. So why rain on Davis' parade
just because you can't attend it and I have to?
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Jerry Brown isn't doing the Chinese food routine
anymore. After he takes the oath of office as mayor of Oakland on
Monday, he'll be serving up foods of all ethnic groups to the
people of Oakland and entertaining them with readings by his city's
many fine poets.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be watching Gray Davis dance, and thinking of it as
performance art.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, I'd rather stay home and eat takeout.

REVIEWER'S 10 BEST CDS RUN WIDE GAMUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never try to sum up or wrap up anything with my top-10 CD
year-ender; I simply name the 10 records I listened to the most
that year. And in 1998 those were:
</P>
<P>
   1. Fastball, ``All the Pain Money Can Buy,'' Hollywood: Bought
by many _ about a million, thanks to the hit, ``The Way'' _ but
understood by few _ like maybe me and the girl I've shared it with
_ this Austin trio's second disc spans pop music's history books,
from '60s fuzz-pop to '90s punk-pop.
</P>
<P>
   Even better are singers Miles Zuniga and Tony Scalzo's
intelligent, often dark, lyrics about drug addiction, the music
industry and relationships built on or burned by fame. The title of
the disc says it all.
</P>
<P>
   2. Spoon, ``A Series of Sneaks,'' Elektra: Another Austin trio,
Spoon crafts short, insanely addicting rock tunes, brief bursts of
melody, noise, humor and drama. Sadly, this was the threesome's
first and last major label disc; they were recently dropped.
</P>
<P>
   3. Liz Phair, ``whitechocolatespaceegg,'' Matador/Capitol:
Phair's third disc is a smart, captivating collection of uneasily
classifiable _ just call it ``rock'' _ songs about the pitfalls and
rewards of getting married, having your first child and dealing
with change. No two songs cover the same topic, and no two sound
alike.
</P>
<P>
   4. 764-HERO, ``Get Here and Stay,'' Up: Effort No. 3 from this
indie-rock Seattle trio is made up of modest, guitar-driven love
songs. Simple but genuine.
</P>
<P>
   5. ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead, self-titled,
Trance: One of the best live bands you'll never see _ they seldom
perform _ this Austin quartet mixes the bloody-razorblade intensity
of the Jesus Lizard with the beautiful noise of Sonic Youth. Their
debut is both pretty and grisly.
</P>
<P>
   6. Dwight Yoakam, ``A Long Way Home,'' Reprise: On his latest
disc, country stalwart Yoakam sounds like his heart's been busted
so many times, there's just no repairing it. The wet-kleenex
ballads like ``Yet To Succeed'' and ``These Arms'' are especially
affecting, but even the dancehall stompers (''Same Fool, I Wouldn't
Put it Past Me'') are laced with an underlying sense of
hopelessness. His pain is our pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   7. Hole, ``Celebrity Skin,'' Geffen: Courtney Love's love/hate
letter to Hollywood and fame is surprisingly polished _ most of
this moves along with all the gentle swiftness of Tom Petty or
Fleetwood Mac _ but disturbingly unforgettable. ``Boys on the
Radio'' is especially mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Local H, ``Pack Up the Cats,'' Island: Illinois' Local H is
only comprised of two guys _ guitarist/singer Scott Lucas and
drummer Joe Daniels _ but on their third effort they continue to
make ambitious hard rock. The songs, full of both hummable melodies
and odd sonic twists and turns, are just as sharp as Lucas'
tongue-in-cheek-so-hard-his-mouth's-bleeding lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   9. Slowpoke, ``Virgin Stripes,'' Geffen: The major label debut
by this Arlington foursome is one of the best discs to come out of
the North Texas area in some time. It's dreamy, melodic pop, glazed
with ethereal guitar work and layers of choral harmonies. With its
label on the skids, Slowpoke faces an uncertain future. But this
much is known: ``Stripes'' is a great sign of what's to come.
</P>
<P>
   10. Melt Banana, ``Charlie,'' A-Zap: Melt Banana is a quartet of
Japanese noise terrorists whose U.S. debut is a wonderful mess of
jackhammer grooves and undecipherable yelps. A difficult but
ultimately rewarding listen.

FEELIN' LUCKY? BETTER BE, IF YOU SKIP THESE MUST-EATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of days, we'll usher in a new year, and whether or
not that year is prosperous depends, in large measure, on what we
eat. That's right, the whole year can go south if we don't sample
our lucky food on the very first day.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to bet Bill Clinton didn't eat his black-eyed peas a
year ago. If he did, he didn't inhale.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm finding out that a lot of people don't eat their
black-eyed peas. Some people don't even know that the former cow
fodder is supposed to bring good luck.
</P>
<P>
   We've been over this ground before, but it won't hurt to review.
Jerry Flemmons, former travel writer and essayist-at-large at the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram, once wrote about a man he knew who
scoffed at the notion of lucky peas on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``By February his wife had run off with a long-haul trucker, and
his son had been outfitted with a navel ring. It just doesn't pay
to defy science,'' Flemmons wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Black-eyed peas probably picked up their ``lucky'' tag during
the Civil War battle of Vicksburg. It is said the townspeople
started eating their cattle feed to avoid starvation. Their cattle
feed was black-eyed peas.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are recipes for black-eyed peas that go back to
the 1830s. That's 30 years before Vicksburg. Black-eyed peas are
not indigenous to the Southern United States, though that is where
they are consumed in mass quantities. Probably because that's where
you can get a good slice of corn bread to go with them.
</P>
<P>
   But black-eyed peas are not the only lucky food we can consume
on the first day of the year. In many places, boiled cabbage is a
must, particularly if you toss a few coins into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the boiled cabbage is supposed to bring you riches,
but I'd consider that lucky. Also, it is said that pickled herring
is a lucky New Year's Day food, which makes me wonder if luck is
all it's cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Texas, we have the advantage of several cultures from
which to take our lucky menus. From the Hispanic cultures we get
posole, and when it comes to taste, the thick hominy stew may be
the best of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   At Joe T. Garcia's Mexican Restaurant on Fort Worth's north
side, Jody Lancarte says posole is a popular holiday dish known to
bring good fortune. ``We sell a lot of posole during the holidays,
but our biggest seller is tamales,'' she said. ``Dozens after
dozens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering the family at the table for steaming bowls of posole
and freshly made tamales would be good fortune all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Like black-eyed peas, posole's attachment to luck is unclear.
The dish is popular in New Mexico, where some people believe it was
handed off by the Pueblo Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But while corn was central in the Native American culture, so
too was it in Mexico's, where the dish is written as ``pozole.''
Diana Kennedy, noted Mexican culinary authority, writes in her book
``My Mexico'' that ``the most popular supper dish by far in the
Western states of Mexico from Nayarit down through Guerrero,
especially in the hot country and coastal areas _ with a few
exceptions of course _ is pozole.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bayless, in ``Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen,'' writes that
at a typical fiesta in Mexico, you'll almost always find ``a huge
pot of pozole (pork and hominy soup/stew with lots of fresh
garnishes) and often big chunks of golden pork carnitas to pull
apart for making small tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   The corn used for posole is specially prepared. It is cooked
with lime, which strips away the hard outer shell and allows the
corn to ``flower'' or open up after long periods of cooking. Many
grocery stores, thankfully, carry the corn already prepared and
sold in bags.
</P>
<P>
   If need be, you can use canned hominy, though there is no
guarantee the luck thing works on the canned variety.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a recipe for a posole that uses chicken instead of pork.
It is a trimmed-down version from ``Mexican Light'' by Martha Rose
Shulman. This way, you can get lucky and skinny at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN HOMINY STEW (POZOLE) WITH CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   For the chicken and stock:
</P>
<P>
   1 medium chicken, plus 2 legs and thighs, cut up and skinned
</P>
<P>
   3 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   For the pozole:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound (about 21/4 cups) pozole
</P>
<P>
   4 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1 pound (about 8 large) fresh tomatillos, husked and rinsed, or
two 13-ounce cans, drained
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces (1 small bunch or 2 cups) sorrel leaves, stems removed
and leaves washed and torn
</P>
<P>
   5 fresh cilantro sprigs
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 serrano or 3 to 4 jalapeno chiles to taste, stemmed and
coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 large garlic cloves, minced or pressed
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 large fresh epazote sprigs, chopped, optional
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   For garnish:
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, finely chopped and rinsed
</P>
<P>
   Dried oregano, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 small avocado, peeled, pitted, and minced, optional
</P>
<P>
   6 tortillas, toasted and crumbled
</P>
<P>
   8 leaves romaine lettuce, cut crosswise into thin slivers
</P>
<P>
   The day before you wish to make the pozole, cook the chicken.
Combine all the ingredients for the chicken and stock and bring to
a simmer. Skim off any foam that rises. Continue to skim for a few
minutes, until there is no more foam, then cover and simmer for 1
hour. Remove the chicken pieces and the bay leaf from the broth and
transfer the chicken to a bowl. Strain the broth through a
cheesecloth-lined strainer, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Allow
the chicken to cool until you can handle the meat, then remove the
meat from the bones and shred, discarding any fat. Transfer to a
bowl, cover tightly and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, skim off and discard the fat from the top of the
stock. Measure out 2 quarts of stock and set aside. Freeze whatever
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the pozole and combine with the water. Bring to a boil,
reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until tender and
the kernels have begun to splay. Drain over a bowl and measure out
1 quart of cooking liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare the tomatillo mixture. Simmer fresh
tomatillos in water to cover for 10 to 15 minutes, until tender.
Drain and place in a blender (just transfer the canned tomatillos
to the blender). Add the sorrel, cilantro and chiles, and blend
until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large, heavy casserole or Dutch oven over
medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until tender, about
5 minutes. Add half the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds or
so, just until the garlic begins to color. Add the tomatillo
mixture and stir together. Cook, stirring constantly with a
long-handled spoon, for 5 minutes, until the mixture is thick and
bright green. Stir in the remaining garlic, the pozole, the chicken
broth, and the pozole broth and bring back to a simmer. Cover and
simmer for 2 hours or until the pozole is tender and opened out
like a flower. Add salt to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes before serving, stir the shredded chicken into
the broth along with the epazote. Simmer 15 minutes. Stir in the
cilantro. Taste and adjust seasonings and serve with the garnishes
sprinkled over each bowl.

 &HT;    INS OFFERS ``TEMPORARY'' STATUS TO HONDURANS AND NICARAGUANS
 &HT;    EDs: At bottom of story you will find estimated populations of
undocumented Central Americans living in selected states.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Because of flooding and other devastation caused by
Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua and Honduras, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service announced Wednesday it will offer
undocumented U.S. residents from the two countries temporary relief
from the threat of being deported.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said government officials in
Nicaragua and Honduras have emphasized that wages earned in the
United States and sent home by undocumented workers are critically
important in attempting to deal with economic dislocation caused by
the hurricane, which struck central America in late October and
early November.
</P>
<P>
   Hondurans and Nicaraguans who can show they were already living
in the United States on Dec. 30 (Tuesday) can gain ``temporary
protected status,'' which for the next 18 months will allow them to
live and work legally in this country, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say what might happen to the otherwise
undocumented workers after the expiration of their temporary status
permits, which will cost $175 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall policy is one of rebuilding in the region,'' she
said. ``Obviously, we will be assessing the situation on a regular
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the temporary status was not extended to undocumented
residents from Guatemala and El Salvador, which also suffered
damage because of Hurricane Mitch, because over 90 percent of
persons displaced by the storm lived in either Honduras or
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to switch status from illegal resident aliens to
temporarily legal residents is being offered to an estimated 90,000
Hondurans and about 60,000 Nicaraguans living in the United States
without immigration papers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fee will cover the extra cost incurred by INS to process
applications, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the decision to offer them temporary status,
Nicaraguans could apply for permanent legal status under a
different law, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American
Relief Act, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   That law allows undocumented U.S. residents from Nicaragua, as
well as El Salvador and Guatemala, to apply for _ and usually
receive _ permanent resident status, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary protected status traditionally has been extended to
persons displaced because of war. However, resident aliens from the
Caribbean island of Montserrat were given temporary protected
status following the December, 1996 eruption of a volcano there.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 165,000 Guatemalans and 335,000
Salvadorans living in the United States without immigration papers,
an INS spokesman said.

SENATORS WITH SENIORITY CAN EXTRICATE US FROM IMPEACHMENT MORASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 3)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate machinations over the fate of Bill Clinton
demonstrate how wise Congress was to reject the imposition of term
limits on members of the two houses.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans gained control of Congress after the 1994
election, they were able to pass through the House most of the
items on their well-publicized ``Contract with America,'' an agenda
of popular proposals devised by Newt Gingrich and his lieutenants
during the campaign. Many of the measures later cleared the Senate
and were signed into law by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in the House, which Gingrich presided over as speaker, term
limits found a powerful and eloquent opponent in the person of
Illinois' Henry Hyde, who late last year presided over the House
Judiciary Committee, which recommended impeachment of Clinton for
perjury under oath and obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans and most Democrats joined Hyde to scuttle the
drive for term limits, an abomination that would prevent voters
from deriving long-term service from their chosen representatives
in Congress. No sensible business executive would force the
retirement of an able subordinate simply because he or she had
served a certain number of years in a key post.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should not be subjected to such an arbitrary rule.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers use their seniority simply to spread pork around
their states and districts and vote the party line on key issues.
Others use their seniority to rise above petty politics and employ
their influence for the good of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate is to find a peaceful and sensible solution to the
Clinton dilemma, it could very well be because of the efforts of
such senior Democratic senators as New York's Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, West Virginia's Robert Byrd and Vermont's Patrick Leahy
and such Republicans as Utah's Orrin Hatch, Pennsylvania's Arlen
Specter, Arizona's John McCain and Virginia's John Warner.
</P>
<P>
   All are devoted to the Constitution and to the Senate. All are
party loyalists who refuse to be bound by myopic partisanship when
the national interest is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Newer members of the Senate will make an important contribution
to the Senate battle over Clinton's future. But it will in all
likelihood be the senior members, with their prestige and
experience, who lead the Senate to a final determination of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   To the erudite Moynihan, one of the most serious concerns about
the impeachment of Clinton is the possible ``destabilization of the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who has been critical of Clinton's conduct and of his
position on some major issues such as welfare reform, has been
working with Byrd on a censure proposal to be voted on once the
Senate has fulfilled its constitutional obligation to sit in
judgment on the articles of impeachment approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Few congressional observers believe that the Senate, with 55
Republicans and 45 Democrats, can muster the 67 votes needed to
find Clinton guilty and oust him from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Moynihan is worried that the possible removal of
Clinton could lead to Congress anointing ``a president a month'' in
which ``a congressional majority began routinely removing
presidents, speakers become president, no one knows who is
commander-in-chief ... and the whole stability of this nation, upon
which the stability of the world rests, could be seriously and
grievously undermined.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Moynihan occasionally is given to exaggeration, he
probably is overstating his fears about the future stability of the
presidency. But his views always are worth listening to because
they are the product of one of the most fertile minds on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Like former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and former
Senate Majority Leader and 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole,
Moynihan believes it is better to reprimand Clinton severely than
to cast him out of the White House or to let him off without
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But as a constitutional scholar he recognizes, as he said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' last week, that Clinton first must face a
Senate trial. Then, at some point, a bipartisan resolution could be
voted on to suspend the trial and censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent and thoughtful Democrat, Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, concurs in that scenario. On the same
television program with Moynihan, he predicted that the Senate is
going to set a ``very high standard'' for civility and
bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also said he did not anticipate that a fine would be
part of the final solution, although other members of Congress have
suggested that the president should be forced to pay what it cost
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to investigate the relationship
between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky _ about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Possible instability of the presidency was not a major concern
130 years ago when Andrew Johnson was impeached and found not
guilty by a single vote in the Senate. The responsibilities of the
United States were largely domestic rather than international.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Johnson's congressional accusers were irate because the
president, following the policies of his predecessor, Abraham
Lincoln, was too lenient on the defeated South in those post-Civil
War years.
</P>
<P>
   But the stability of the presidency was vital 24 years ago when
Richard Nixon faced impeachment. The Cold War was raging, and
America was still fighting in far-off Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had reached an agreement of detente with the Soviet Union
and had opened the long-locked door to China.
</P>
<P>
   But when he resigned rather than face a lengthy and bitter trial
in the Senate that his congressional leaders said he would lose,
Gerald Ford stepped into the presidency to stabilize the office and
heal the wounds of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He still is involved in that crusade, with the help now of two
other senior statesmen, Carter and Dole. We should listen carefully
to their proposals to extricate us from the current morass.

WHEEL OF LIFE SPINS ON FOR CAST OF SEATTLE `REAL WORLD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TERESA TALERICO  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the magnificent seven invaded Seattle, local
hipsters gave them a welcome typically reserved for transplanted
Californians. Boos. Hisses. An occasional middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   But cast members of ``The Real World Seattle'' survived. After
the brush with MTV fame, most returned to their lives of college
and significant others.
</P>
<P>
   'Fess up. You secretly watched the MTV docu-soap about seven
young strangers picked to live together, but only for the
picturesque scenes of the city, right?
</P>
<P>
   You weren't alone. MTV says the Seattle episodes were the
most-watched of any ``Real World'' show; ratings were up 73 percent
from the 1992 series debut (New York) and 24 percent from the last
season (Boston). So popular was the Seattle show, MTV is currently
running ``Real World Live Wire Chat'' on Tuesday nights. It
features reruns of Seattle episodes and allows viewers to chat
online with cast members and see their comments scrolled on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: Hawaii. Taping of the eighth ``Real World'' season
starts in January. Episodes will air next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here's what the former Pier 70 residents are up to
now:
</P>
<P>
   Janet Choi, 21
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' fame: Dated a Pike Place Market fish thrower.
Jumped out of a plane. Gave her skeptical family a tour of Seattle.
Explained what the cast used when they ran out of toilet paper
(calendar pages).
</P>
<P>
   Today: Senior majoring in journalism at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Brien, 22
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' fame: Bonded with Janet. Grieved as callous crew
members kept cameras rolling while she learned of her best friend's
suicide (easily the show's most moving scene). Kicked butt on the
cast's KNDD radio show ``Dead Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Today: Film and Video Studies major at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lord, 20
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' fame: Recorded a song with Sir Mix-a-lot.
Remained sweet despite the soap opera-level tensions at Pier 70.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Senior at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Mcgee, 22
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' fame: Admitted her love for Neil Diamond on
national television. Quit show after a relapse of Lyme disease and
conflicts with cast and crew. Emerged as a poster child for the
misunderstood illness.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Working in Boston, according to her mother (also named
Irene McGee), of Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Plans to return to Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   Irene's mother objected to the tension she says producers
encouraged on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen hits (Irene) and that's the climax?'' she said in a
recent phone interview. ``And he gets therapy? Please.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Williams, 20
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' fame: Slapped Irene in the face after she
challenged his heterosexuality. Sent to anger-management classes.
Met his father's brothers for the first time in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Student at the University of California-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   David Burns, 22
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' fame: Fisticuffs outside a Seattle bar. Showed
his privates to female cast members. Romanced Kira, a ``Real
World'' casting specialist (who lost her job for love). Heaved fish
at Pike Place Market.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Studied in Morocco. Returning to the Virginia Military
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Blackburn, 22
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' fame: Marathon phone conversations with
girlfriend Stephanie. Brief flirtation with Irene. Stayed faithful
to Stephanie.
</P>
<P>
   Today: According to his grandmother, of Chesterfield, Va.,
Nathan now lives with Stephanie, a student at Virginia Tech
University.
</P>
<P>
   He left Virginia Military Institute after returning briefly to
the school post-``Real World.'' Both granny and a VMI spokesman
claim Nathan was offered a modeling contract with Ford Models
(executives at Ford offices in California and New York say they
have never heard of him).
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Military Institute
</P>
<P>
   Applications to David and Nathan's military college were up 10
percent this year. But VMI spokesman Mike Strickler doesn't
attribute that to ``The Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show, and its two hunky VMI men, did spark interest
in the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls here and some e-mail messages from girls who saw
(Nathan and David) and thought they were the neatest guys around,''
Strickler said. ``People saw the kids that come here are just
normal college kids. They saw that our guys don't walk around with
rifles all day long.''

A BIBLICAL RESPONSE TO THE Y2K THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary -- First of a three-part series)
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The New York Times recently wrote about a woman working as a
programmer in the basement of a New Jersey power company,
''painstakingly sifting through a program consisting of seven
million lines of code'' to fix one program.
 &HT;    The article noted that the utility had 727 other programs with a
total of 46 million lines, written in 27 programming languages.
 &HT;    ''How well they get fixed or replaced could determine whether
the lights and heat stay on in New Jersey come Jan. 1, 2000,'' said
the Times.
 &HT;    This is the Year 2000 problem or ''Y2K.''
 &HT;    At the heart of the Y2K issue is the fact that computer programs
use two digits to represent years. Thus, 98 refers to 1998. So when
1999 ends, computers might not understand that 00 refers to the
next year, 2000. It might believe it is 1900. Affected programs in
utilities, manufacturing plants, one's automobile or personal
computer might crash, or equally ominously, spew out erroneous
data.
 &HT;    Since computers run everything from ATM bank machines to
telephones and hospitals to airplanes, they are all vulnerable to
embedded computer programs that may be inadvertently affected by
the ''millennium bug.'' An estimated 25 to 70 billion
microprocessors (computer ''chips'') make our lives more efficient,
but also put us at very substantial risk of disruption.
 &HT;    ''With such an immense volume, even a tiny percentage of chip
malfunctions could have grave consequences. The task of resolving
the Year 2000 problem is enormous, involving millions of man-hours,
billions of lines of code and trillions of dollars worldwide,''
writes Shaunti Christine Feldhahn, in her landmark book, ''Y2K: The
Millennium Bug.''
 &HT;    She quotes Sen. Robert Bennett, chairman of a Senate committee
on the Year 2000 problem, as saying the problem can not be fully
solved in 1999: ''The public faces a high risk that critical
services provided by the government and the private sector could be
severely disrupted by the Year 2000 computing crisis.''
 &HT;    There are fringe Christian prophets of doom who are forecasting
the end of the world, the rise of dictatorships and the return of
Jesus Christ in 2000. The Rev. Jack Van Impe, a TV evangelist, is
marketing a videotape saying a panic a year from now could easily
lead to the rise of the Antichrist, one-world government and ''the
mark of the beast.'' And a new poll reveals that 15 percent of
Americans think the new millennium means ''that the world will come
to an end.''
 &HT;    But Ms. Feldhahn, an active Christian, takes a more pragmatic,
and I believe a more Biblical position on the threat. Jesus said,
''No one knows about that day or hour,'' when the world will end
(Matt. 24:36). God tells us that ''a man of knowledge increases
strength ... Every prudent man acts out of knowledge (Prov. 24:5,
13:16).
 &HT;    Therefore, a prudent person is one who foresees danger and takes
obvious precautions. Also both Christians and Jews believe it is
important to ''love your neighbor as yourself'' (Lev. 19:19).
 &HT;    She writes, ''What is distinctive in the Christian community is
our charge to emulate the sacrificial love and servant leadership
of Jesus. Thus, my threefold purpose is to call Christians to:
 &HT;    --(1) personal preparation;
 &HT;    --(2) immediate and dynamic Year 2000 leadership and service in
our communities, ministries and businesses;
 &HT;    --(3) Personal reflection on God's message to us through this
unique event in history.''
 &HT;    This column outlines practical steps Ms. Feldhahn suggests, on
the assumption that there will be disruptions of power, food
supply, and an inability to gain access to one's funds in a bank.
 &HT;    1. Every time you go shopping, buy extra cans of food and
bottled water, thinking about how much you might need for your
family and for several other families in your area. If nothing
happens, you can eat the food or give it away to shelters and food
banks.
 &HT;    2. Begin serious saving, and have perhaps several thousand
dollars in cash Jan. 1, 2000.
 &HT;    3. If a computer is important to you, backup your hard drive and
be sure to have it tested for millennium bugs. ''I have not tested
my own computer,'' Ms. Feldhahn confessed to me. If your computer
was bought in 1997-98, only 11 percent are infected, but 97 percent
of older ones are.
 &HT;    4. Read such books as ''Y2K.'' The book's last page also offers
a $20 discount for a timely, practical, $59 monthly newsletter,
''Countdown Y2K.'' Or call 800 500-0867.
 &HT;    Next week's column will explore what you can do to help your
congregation and neighborhood.

 HAMPTONS PROPERTY RIDES WILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Manhattan's real estate market burbles merrily
along _ stock market turmoil or no _ the real estate market in the
Hamptons has been more like a roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   After the heart-stopping 512-point drop in the Dow on Aug. 31,
would-be buyers of Manhattan apartments hesitated, and prices took
a slight dip _ many brokers estimated between 5 percent and 10
percent. But since then, they report, Manhattan properties have
recovered everything they lost _ and may even have gained some.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hamptons, it's been a wilder ride.
</P>
<P>
   In early and even late September _ while Manhattan apartment
hunters stepped back and counted their fingers and toes and some
talked to their lawyers about getting out of deals _ people kept
buying and selling on the East End of Long Island, especially in
towns with ``Hampton'' at the end of their names. And then, in
October, just as agents were breathing a sigh of relief, kerplunk!
</P>
<P>
   ``The market just dried up _ nothing,'' said Diane Saatchi, the
president of Dayton-Halstead in East Hampton. ``Usually, October is
a good month, and people at least start thinking about rentals.
Even that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newbold, a Sotheby's vice president who manages the East
Hampton office, agrees. ``Things were going great guns,'' he said.
``By September, we had three times the contracts we had at the same
time the year before.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the same thing happened at his office. ``Dead doggo in
October,'' he said. His clients blamed the stock market's
uncertainty, the impeachment, the problems in Russia and Asia. And
there wasn't a lot to buy _ if you wanted an estate, that is. ``No
new estate houses were listed because the owners told us the stock
market was too shaky,'' Newbold said. ``They said, `We don't want
to try our house in this tentative market.' They were afraid they
would give a party and nobody would come.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late November, he said, the real estate market started
to raise its head. ``On Nov. 23, somebody announced that the market
had finally gained back those 500 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at this impossible time of year (for buying real estate,
anyway), customers are again rushing to buy in the Hamptons. ``The
pace is almost like early summer,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ``Good
properties have multiple bids, and sellers are double-dealing like
nuts.'' Part of the double-dealing, she explained, is a practice
known as ``gazumping,'' in which a seller agrees to a price and
then, while the contracts are being drawn up, agrees to sell to a
second buyer for more money. First buyers, who thought they had a
deal, have been _ alas _ gazumped.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't only sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, all of the good rentals are gone,'' Ms.
Saatchi said. One four-bedroom house with a pool and tennis court
in Sagaponack _ south of the highway, not on the water _ just
rented for $130,000 for the season. The market is about the same as
last year, she said, but some people are asking a little more _ and
getting it. One tiny two-bedroom cottage in East Hampton Village,
asking $12,000 for the season, was gone by the time the call was
made to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson Baker, office manager for Amaden Realty, said, ``Let's
face it _ what happens on Wall Street has a lot to do with real
estate out here, and that seems to have settled down.'' But now, he
said: ``It's crazy out here. People are buying Christmas and New
Year's presents for each other. And mortgage money's really cheap
right now. If the stock market takes another little tumble, they're
figuring real estate might be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In a break with tradition, appointments were scheduled for the
two days before Christmas and the weekend after it. ``And it's not
just us,'' Baker said. ``None of the agents want to say no _ we
want to make hay while the sun shines.'' And making hay they are.
Last week, Baker's office put two large houses under contract,
worth a total of $5 million. There are even bidding wars for
so-called midrange houses, though less often.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a $650,000 two-story farmhouse in Bridgehampton,''
said Doreen Niggles, an agent at Allan M. Schneider. ``My customer
saw it. The same day, she said to me, `I want to make an offer _
should I make it full price?' The woman came in with $645,000.
Within 10 minutes, somebody else offered $650,000. The owner came
back and asked who could do all cash. They both could. Then the
seller asked for full financials. They both produced them, and they
were both good. Then it went to sealed bids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Niggles, a veteran of 14 years, was astonished. ``A bidding
war over a $650,000 house!'' she said. Her customer lost, she
added. ``And the other one took it at a price I can't reveal, but
it was $10,000 to $15,000 above the asking price.''
</P>
<P>
   That is rare. While prices for the creme de la creme are
reported to be at or, in rare cases, above the asking prices, most
houses in the Hamptons are more negotiable than they were in the
frenetic spring. The highest-priced houses are generally in East
Hampton. But even there, the brokers say, some prices are
negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeding frenzy, and frankly, that has passed,''
Newbold said. ``Now, people are looking at more houses. They're
asking to see what comparable properties sold for. They're taking
their time.''
</P>
<P>
   And often they're offering less. For the less expensive
properties _ and there are hundreds of them for sale, like a
five-room cedar bungalow on Meadowgrass Lane in Southampton, which
just closed for $190,000 _ bargainers are making a lot of deals for
about 10 percent off, the Sotheby's executive said.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe more. ``If it's cash and fast, some sellers are taking
more off,'' he said. ``A 30-day closing is very tempting to a
seller. After all, who knows what the stock market will do in the
spring?''

 &HT;    ''How well they get fixed or replaced could determine whether
the lights and heat stay on in New Jersey come Jan. 1, 2000,'' said
the Times.
 &HT;    This is the Year 2000 problem or ''Y2K.''
 &HT;    At the heart of the Y2K issue is the fact that computer programs
use two digits to represent years. Thus, 98 refers to 1998. So when
1999 ends, computers might not understand that 00 refers to the
next year, 2000. It might believe it is 1900. Affected programs in
utilities, manufacturing plants, one's automobile or personal
computer might crash, or equally ominously, spew out erroneous
data.
 &HT;    Since computers run everything from ATM bank machines to
telephones and hospitals to airplanes, they are all vulnerable to
embedded computer programs that may be inadvertently affected by
the ''millennium bug.'' An estimated 25 to 70 billion
microprocessors (computer ''chips'') make our lives more efficient,
but also put us at very substantial risk of disruption.
 &HT;    ''With such an immense volume, even a tiny percentage of chip
malfunctions could have grave consequences. The task of resolving
the Year 2000 problem is enormous, involving millions of man-hours,
billions of lines of code and trillions of dollars worldwide,''
writes Shaunti Christine Feldhahn, in her landmark book, ''Y2K: The
Millennium Bug.''
 &HT;    She quotes Sen. Robert Bennett, chairman of a Senate committee
on the Year 2000 problem, as saying the problem can not be fully
solved in 1999: ''The public faces a high risk that critical
services provided by the government and the private sector could be
severely disrupted by the Year 2000 computing crisis.''
 &HT;    There are fringe Christian prophets of doom who are forecasting
the end of the world, the rise of dictatorships and the return of
Jesus Christ in 2000. The Rev. Jack Van Impe, a TV evangelist, is
marketing a videotape saying a panic a year from now could easily
lead to the rise of the Antichrist, one-world government and ''the
mark of the beast.'' And a new poll reveals that 15 percent of
Americans think the new millennium means ''that the world will come
to an end.''
 &HT;    But Ms. Feldhahn, an active Christian, takes a more pragmatic,
and I believe a more Biblical position on the threat. Jesus said,
''No one knows about that day or hour,'' when the world will end
(Matt. 24:36). God tells us that ''a man of knowledge increases
strength ... Every prudent man acts out of knowledge (Prov. 24:5,
13:16).
 &HT;    Therefore, a prudent person is one who foresees danger and takes
obvious precautions. Also both Christians and Jews believe it is
important to ''love your neighbor as yourself'' (Lev. 19:19).
 &HT;    She writes, ''What is distinctive in the Christian community is
our charge to emulate the sacrificial love and servant leadership
of Jesus. Thus, my threefold purpose is to call Christians to:
 &HT;    --(1) personal preparation;
 &HT;    --(2) immediate and dynamic Year 2000 leadership and service in
our communities, ministries and businesses;
 &HT;    --(3) Personal reflection on God's message to us through this
unique event in history.''
 &HT;    This column outlines practical steps Ms. Feldhahn suggests, on
the assumption that there will be disruptions of power, food
supply, and an inability to gain access to one's funds in a bank.
 &HT;    1. Every time you go shopping, buy extra cans of food and
bottled water, thinking about how much you might need for your
family and for several other families in your area. If nothing
happens, you can eat the food or give it away to shelters and food
banks.
 &HT;    2. Begin serious saving, and have perhaps several thousand
dollars in cash Jan. 1, 2000.
 &HT;    3. If a computer is important to you, backup your hard drive and
be sure to have it tested for millennium bugs. ''I have not tested
my own computer,'' Ms. Feldhahn confessed to me. If your computer
was bought in 1997-98, only 11 percent are infected, but 97 percent
of older ones are.
 &HT;    4. Read such books as ''Y2K.'' The book's last page also offers
a $20 discount for a timely, practical, $59 monthly newsletter,
''Countdown Y2K.'' Or call 800 500-0867.
 &HT;    Next week's column will explore what you can do to help your
congregation and neighborhood.

HELPFUL PROGRAM FOR A STUBBORN GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: in list beginning after 3rd graf, replace (three
asterisks), (plus sign) and (equal sign) with the symbols, no
parentheses)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I already know that on Feb. 18 my daughter Ella will wear her
black flowered skirt and matching sweater to school. She will eat
at least two slices of cake frosted with whipped cream and sliced
strawberries. And she will be expecting phone calls from all six of
her uncles.
</P>
<P>
   I know this because Feb. 18 is Ella's birthday, and Ella leaves
no important detail to chance. It is fair to say she likes things
done a certain way _ her way.
</P>
<P>
   With only seven weeks left until the eighth anniversary of the
day that she surprised us all by emerging feet first in the
delivery room, my opinionated middle daughter assures me daily that
the following facts are publicly known:
</P>
<P>
   1. Green is the best color for a new bike.
</P>
<P>
   2. Friday the 19th would be an acceptable alternative date for a
birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   3. The heavily annotated guest list (``(three asterisks)B (plus
sign) J (equal sign) my BEST friends, sit next to me'') cannot
possibly be shortened to fewer than 13 names.
</P>
<P>
   4. It is unfair to make someone wait until her ninth birthday to
have a slumber party.
</P>
<P>
   ``No slumber party,'' I insist. I know my rights, too. ``Not
until you're 9.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she says. This cheerful response immediately raises my
suspicions. Too cunning to wage a crude, direct assault, she must
be plotting a sneak attack. Am I paranoid? No, just a
long-suffering subject of the Ella regime.
</P>
<P>
   My only hope is to distract her with the aid of my computer from
the forbidden world of slumber parties. I know that not just any
software program will suffice. No, I will need a weapon that
combines a simple, easy-to-use interface _ that the stubbiest of
little fingers can navigate _ with a wide range of choices so Ella
will be able to feel in control of her destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Sneakily, I have already conducted preliminary fieldwork on
Knowledge Adventure's Print Artist Craft Factory, described by its
creators as ``a whimsical craft factory'' that enables children to
design items like party invitations and favors.
</P>
<P>
   Having installed it, read the instruction manual and clicked
furtively for a while, I am hopeful that the program's gazillions
of graphic images, type faces, background colors, borders and
shapes will grab Ella's imagination. It takes only a few intuitive
mouse clicks to superimpose text and images onto the templates.
</P>
<P>
   Another good feature: when a user logs out, the software
automatically saves work in a file called My Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As if the idea just occurred to me, I ask Ella in my best
hey-kids-let's-put-on-a-show voice if she wants to play with the
program, maybe use it to choose a party theme. I explain that she
can pick and choose dinosaurs, flags of different nations, insects,
reptiles _ or animals, weather, angels, bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days before your birthday, we'll print it all out,'' I
say. ``So your party favors won't get wrinkled, or torn, or lost,
or scribbled on or accidentally tossed into the laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.'' She seems interested.
</P>
<P>
   I congratulate myself for being wilier than a 7-year-old. When
the opening screen appears, I show Ella how to enter her name to
create a personalized My Stuff file. Without having to ask, she
knows to click on OK, pulling up the Main Page, on which are 22
icons for different categories of items to design.
</P>
<P>
   That will enable her to design things like personalized note
paper, postcards, stickers, posters, frames and banners.
</P>
<P>
   She clicks on the Party Set icon, and a Workspace window fills
the screen. It has a palette of party-related icons at the bottom.
``See, Ella, you can design place cards, gift bags, party hats _ ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, I'll call you if I need you,'' she says, firmly
peeling the mouse from my hand.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, she comes downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it fun?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really fun,'' she says cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you design?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Business cards.'' She then gathers up her dog-eared copy of
``Shoeshine Girl'' (the novel's stubborn 10-year-old heroine is
determined to thwart her aunt by earning her own money and spending
it however she wants!) and heads off in the direction of her lair,
er, bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she is out of sight, I run upstairs and turn on the
computer. Am I spying? I prefer to consider my reconnaissance a
necessary survival tactic. I open the program, log on as Ella and
click on the Business Cards icons.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that she has designed three _ two with her name
and, shamelessly, one for her teacher. The main element on her own
business cards is her name, written in extremely large type that
fades out at the margin. No job description, curiously. Her
teacher's card reads ``Mrs. Bauge, second grade,'' adorned by a
tasteful image of a bookworm.
</P>
<P>
   I click on a few other categories, learning that Ella has also
managed to design personalized note paper (with her trademark, a
rainbow-colored garland of flowers, running down the left side of
the paper), an Ella's Homework Schedule and an Ella's School
Schedule (``today's activities: try to find library book I borrowed
from school in October''), and a set of cocktail coasters
emblazoned with images of angels in various poses (1. blowing a
trumpet; 2. flying; 3. flying with a billowy skirt, 4. flying under
rainbows).
</P>
<P>
   I am pleased that the software helped me accomplish my real
goal: giving Ella the illusion of power.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulating myself for holding firm on the sticky birthday
party situation, I call up Ella's party designs. The screen fills
with an invitation she designed for her forthcoming party.
</P>
<P>
   It shows a dozen sleepy bears, all wearing nightcaps and
pajamas. Under each bear is typed the same phrase: ``Come to Ella's
Slumber Party on Feb. 19 (not her real birthday).'' It is adorable.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if 13 sleeping bags will fit in the den.

NEW YORK PRISON OFFICIALS BAN GANG NEWSPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY _ With articles on gangsters, sex and Black Power, the
Five Percenter is uneasy reading, but a move by the state to ban
the monthly newspaper in New York's prisons has civil rights groups
defending the publication as a First Amendment cause.
</P>
<P>
   New York state officials call the group a ``hate-mongering''
prison gang whose leaders may be looking to recreate the bloody
Attica State Correctional Facility riot of 1971.
</P>
<P>
   State officials were so worried about possible violence
involving the Five Percenters that they banned state inmates from
possessing the group's literature or displaying its symbols.
</P>
<P>
   But that ban was challenged by an inmate _ Lord Natural
Self-Allah _ who claims the ban violates his First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Allah's attorney, Glenn E. Murray, said the group is not
dangerous, but ``is thought to be sinister by many who resort to
stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Self-Allah, whose prison record includes various
disciplinary problems, is seeking more than $200,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, state officials said the purpose of the ban is
to protect inmates and prison officials from gang violence. Prison
officials believe there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Five
Percenters members in prisons throughout the state system.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Corrections Commissioner George J. Bartlett said the gang
is responsible for dozens of recent beatings, stabbings and
extortions in prison yards.

SWEEPING THE HOLIDAYS OUT OF THE RUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a scene in a snow globe, the holiday season
upends the typical household in a flurry of trash, drips and
spills. Just as the house starts to settle from Hanukkah and
Christmas, New Year's Eve hits.
</P>
<P>
   Like all hangovers, holiday cleaning headaches can be dealt
with. Professional strategies, home remedies and common sense
tackle most of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   There's a right way and a wrong way to get the Christmas tree
back out of the house, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong way: dragging it out backwards by the boughs like a
cat on its way to the vet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to get a fresh tree out of the house is to make a
sling for it with a sheet or a bedspread,'' said Mary Ellen
Pinkham, the author, with Dale Berg, of ``Mary Ellen's Complete
Home Reference Book (Crown, 1994). ``Don't carry it out late at
night,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Pine needles left behind should be vacuumed ``very, very slowly,
to allow the machine to accommodate them without clogging the
beater head,'' advised Jeff Campbell, the president of the Clean
Team, a cleaning service in San Francisco. Pine sap should be
softened _ not frozen _ with gum and tar removers available at
auto-supply shops. Cooking oil will get it off your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Check with the local garbage-removal authority about the tree _
it may be recyclable. Rockefeller Center sends its tree, which
comes down on Jan. 4, to a New Jersey nursery, where the trunk is
cut into six sections, to be used as jumps for the United States
Olympic equestrian team trials nearby. The branches are mulched
into chips for trails at a neighboring Boy Scout camp.
</P>
<P>
   Stains in the carpet aren't going to be as easy to remove as the
tree. Wine stains should be treated as fresh spills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blot it up well,'' advised Dale Berg, Ms. Pinkham's
collaborator. ``The carpet sucks the stain down.'' Ms. Berg
recommended disposable diapers, salt or cat litter, ``for wicking
the stain out,'' before deploying any cleaning agents.
</P>
<P>
   Heloise, the household-hints columnist, agreed. ``You'll get 90
percent of the stain out. Then, mix a mild dish-washing liquid
solution _ a quarter teaspoon to a cup of warm water _ to dab on
the stain, rubbing from the outside of the stain into the center.
Then rinse it with fresh water.'' Before soaping any carpet or rug,
test a hidden corner first for colorfastness _ a white cloth will
pick up dye from the sudsed area if it isn't colorfast.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine on table linens is best attacked with a
fight-fire-with-fire approach, Ms. Pinkham said. ``Pour white wine
on it,'' she said. ``It changes the color. Now, you're not dealing
with a dye problem _ you're dealing with a blotting problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Grease stains like those from gravy should be sprinkled with
salt, flour or artificial sweetener, patted lightly and left until
nearly dry. Then, pour a liquid laundry detergent with enzyme
agents in it _ they digest the food _ or a dish detergent for pots
and pans, which has strong degreasing agents in it, onto the stain
and ``let it sit for 10 minutes,'' Heloise advised. ``Then, wash it
in the hottest water safe for the fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pinkham advised prevention over cure. ``If they're valuable
linens, spray them with fabric protector or spray starch before you
set the table,'' she said, ``as a stain barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   For clothing, like a necktie, try spit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enzyme in spittle that breaks down food breaks down food
stains,'' Ms. Berg explained, recommending that you first excuse
yourself from the table.
</P>
<P>
   Experts ran hot and cold on candle wax. The consensus: the ice
treatment for linens and clothing that can be conveniently frozen
for a good length of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several days in the freezer will pull the moisture out of the
wax, in addition to hardening it, so that it flicks right off,''
Heloise said.
</P>
<P>
   For tables and other wood furniture, Ms. Berg suggested
softening candle wax with a hair dryer on a low setting, then
scraping it up with a plastic spatula.
</P>
<P>
   White furniture rings caused by wet drinking glasses can be
rubbed out with the oil of a broken walnut or almond, she added, or
cigarette ash mixed in mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   For wax on fabrics or carpeting, Jim Ireland of White Glove
Elite, a New York residential cleaning service, recommended lightly
ironing a plain brown grocery bag over the candle drippings, which
will warm the wax. The absorbent paper will pull it up. Don't use a
printed bag.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who hates children and dogs, to paraphrase W.C. Fields,
may have had to clean up after them. In fairness, adults get
excitable at parties, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People getting sick on the carpet? Get new friends,'' said Ms.
Pinkham, half-joking. ``Vomit's really tough.'' She advised
treating it like a food stain, with a thick paste of an
enzyme-active laundry detergent and water. ``Clean up as much as
you can _ trash bags used as gloves are good for this _ then spread
the solution on the stain, start blotting and rinse, and blot that.
Then vinegar and water for the odor.''
</P>
<P>
   The smell of the holiday season, from sweet to stale, is often
the last guest to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to the supermarket and buy cheap coffee,'' said Barbara
Roche Fierman, the owner of New York's Little Elves, a cleaning
service that keeps the Kips Bay decorator show house clean through
its annual run. ``Fresh, dry coffee, sprinkled on carpets or
fabrics, then vacuumed up, absorbs smells better than anything on
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pinkham soaks a towel in a basin of water with a cup of
vinegar, then spins it dry in the washing machine and runs through
her house, looping it above her head like a helicopter blade to
ring in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   There's little, she explained, that doesn't exorcise.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With more than 6 million students, it's only natural that the
world's busiest typing teacher would have to turn down speaking
engagements or a personal appearance now and then due to time
constraints. But Mavis Beacon, the star of the popular software
program ``Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing,'' has an especially good
excuse for missing the social scene: She's fictional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mavis is the Betty Crocker of software,'' said Adrienne
Hankin, the public relations director for Mindscape Inc., the
company that makes the program.
</P>
<P>
   The program, first released eleven years ago, has sold 6 million
copies, and many students _ even some in the software industry _
have believed that this keyboard educator to the masses was made of
flesh and blood, despite published reports that the typing maven
was fictional. For many, finding out that Mavis is a purely digital
creation still comes as something of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction is shock,'' said Ms. Hankin. ``People seem to
think she's a real teacher. And she is. She's just real on a
computer screen.''
</P>
<P>
   With her calm, authoritative voice urging you along as you work
your way through the drills and lessons, combined with a notably
responsive overall program, it is pretty easy to forget that you're
using educational software and just sit for a spell with Mavis.
</P>
<P>
   Corporeal or not, Mavis is still one busy lady. She has her own
Web site (www.mavisbeacon.com)cq, as well as a philanthropic
program called ``Mavis Cares'' that donates software to nonprofit
organizations specializing in job-skills training. She also gets a
lot of mail and requests for speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a couple of calls a week, I would say, and that's not
even including consumers who want to get more information about
Mavis,'' said Ms. Hankin, who has been Ms. Beacon's public
relations representative for the past three-and-a-half years.``A
lot of reporters will call and ask for interviews. Teachers call in
and want to know more about Mavis and where she's teaching these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be just an educational program, but Mavis can certainly
act a little more lively than some flesh-and-blood teachers out
there. She keeps her students tapping away at the keyboard with a
variety of games and music, and by sheer force of humor and
personality (she'll even tell you to ``call it a day'' sometimes if
the program senses that you are skipping around or goofing off
during a typing drill).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people use `Mavis,' they think they see her name in other
places around the country,'' Ms. Hankin said. ``They envision that
maybe they saw her on a show.'' Even once the truth is revealed,
some people are not convinced. ``There was one man who kept calling
back,'' Ms. Hankin recalled. ``He could not believe it. He kept
asking questions, and saying `Are you sure?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mavis was brought to life, if initially rudimentary form, 12
years ago by Les Crane, Walt Bilofsky and Joe Abrams for their
software company, Software Toolworks, then located in Sherman Oaks,
Calif. The first version of ``Mavis,'' which used just four colors
on-screen and came on 5\-inch floppy disks, was shipped in the fall
of 1987. In the early years, Mavis, herself, was little more than a
photo on the box, only gradually making her way into the program
itself. But on the programming end, the first version offered what
were then some fairly advanced features, like pop-up windows and
flexible navigation, so that the user didn't have to always return
to the main menu to select another area of the program. The release
of the product came only about half a year after planners had
approved its concept in the spring of 1987. The complex code was
written quickly, not by a huge development team, but by just a few
programmers working nonstop through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three guys, three computers, three beds, in four months,'' is
how Bilofsky, the main programmer recalls it. ``That was a really
intense experience.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed between then and the release of the latest
``Mavis Beacon.'' Version 9 was coded by dozens of people, with a
full year to work between upgrades. The program, itself, has also
grown. It is now a fully interactive CD-ROM that features snazzy
full-color graphics, music-to-type-by _ selections from classical
to Motown _ Internet support, a typing-game arcade and a digitized
Mavis presiding over the classroom. The CD-ROM is available for
both Macintosh and Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the allure of Mavis, another feature that helps make
the program such an understanding and sympathetic tutor is its
proprietary Adaptive Response Technology. The software can analyze
a user's keystrokes and adjust the drills and lessons to the
appropriate level.
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen years on the market, Mavis, herself, has gone
through a few makeovers, usually with each new version of the
software. ``She tends to change as much as people change their
looks, really,'' said Ms. Hankin. ``We change her clothes according
to the new styles. We change her hairstyle. We change her overall
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to look much more conservative, because teachers used
to be viewed as much more conservative. Now she's more of a modern
professorial type of teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of Mavis that makes her unusual is her race. In a
techie world traditionally dominated by white males, an
African-American woman on the front of a software box tends to get
one's attention. ``The whole concept was this idea of trying to
anthropomorphize computer software and to put a person on the
cover,'' Abrams said, ``so people would think it was a person
trying to teach them how to type, as opposed to a computer.''

<P>
   So the ``Mavis'' creators decided they needed a strong character
to present the lessons, and Crane was put in charge of finding the
model to photograph for the box cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day he walked into Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills to
buy some cologne, and there behind the cosmetics counter was a
beautiful black woman named Renee L'Esperance,'' said Bilofsky,
reading from a file that was put together to celebrate the 15th
anniversary of Software Toolworks. ``Born into a well-to-do Haitian
family, she fled the Duvalier regime and wound up at Saks. She had
never modeled, and her extremely long fingernails made her an
unlikely typist, but when Les looked at her, he saw Mavis.''
</P>
<P>
   It just so happened that Mavis was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't intentional that the role model would be
African-American,'' said Ms. Hankin. ``Les was just looking for who
the right person would be to play Mavis.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane was a former disc jockey and host of television's ``The
Les Crane Show'' (known as ``ABC's Nightlife'' during the last few
months of its one-year run opposite NBC's ``The Tonight Show'' in
1964-65).He was also a huge fan of the rhythm and blues sound. So
he named his creation after the singer Mavis Staples. The
character's last name refers to a ``beacon'' of light in the
keyboard hunt-and-peck darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much an instant success,'' said Abrams. ``But
believe it or not, even though it was 1987, we had some initial
reluctance to carry the product, because there was a black woman on
the box. People did not believe it would sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who concentrated on marketing the software, said that
some stores in the Southeast and Southwest showed reluctance to
display the product at first because there was a black woman on the
package. The hesitancy was not confined to those regions of the
country, however. Abrams said he was also turned down by 47th
Street Photo in Manhattan, a large electronics store (which has
since filed for bankruptcy) in Manhattan _ at the time a valuable
outlet for software developers. (A lawyer for 47th Street Photo's
former owners declined to comment.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem began to disappear after a rave write-up about the
program appeared in The New York Times. ``I remember walking into
our offices in Sherman Oaks about 8:00 a.m. on the morning the
review had run, and the phones were ringing off the hooks,'' said
Abrams. When callers asked where they could buy the product in the
New York City area, Abrams made sure they were directed to 47th
Street Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they'd gotten about 150 phone calls one morning,'' said
Abrams, ``the buyer called me up and said `Okay, you win. We'll
carry the product.' And they started carrying the product, and from
then on, it took off.''
</P>
<P>
   He really knew the company was on to something when he attended
a computer trade show that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember, at Comdex in 1987, walking around and having some
of the competitors from two of the original typing products come up
to me and say, ``What a coup! How did you get Mavis Beacon to
endorse your product? We've been after her endorsement for years.'
'' Abrams chuckled. ``And when they did that, I knew we had a
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   When the company first added a voice to the program, they used a
woman working as an assistant at Software Toolworks. ``There was a
year a couple years back where we took the voice of Mavis out of
the product,'' said Ms. Hankin. ``People were actually very
disappointed, because they've come to rely on Mavis as a friend and
they expect her to be able to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice now firmly restored, Mavis has led Software Toolworks
to a position where it now has 50 percent of the typing software
market (including the educational, home and corporate segments).
</P>
<P>
   The program is revised each year, as the Adaptive Response
Technology is tweaked and enhanced. Mindscape programmers are also
keeping an eye on possible real-time Web features, although the
current levels of network congestion on the Internet still prevent
the immediate interactivity Mavis' students are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what form the lessons take, it is sure to retain
its trump card _ the unique personality of the teacher. After all,
``Mavis'' will always be Mavis.

BUT IS IT GOING TO RAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (bl)  
 By RODES FISHBURNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few natural events are as vexing as the unpredictability of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers cry when there is too little rain or too much, brides
swear at ill-timed tornadoes, and nothing can quite match the
disappointment of schoolchildren when the predicted snow doesn't
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But prediction springs eternal. The latest effort, a service
called Weatherplanner, says it has a solution for people who want a
glimpse into the future of their weather (www.weatherplanner.com).
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated computer formulas, atmospheric physics and
more than 100 years of historical weather data, the company, which
is in Wayne, Pa., asserts that it can reliably predict what the
weather in North America will be on a given day up to 12 months in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Weatherplanner's potential market is in the
millions, including anyone who is planning an event outdoors. And
that includes weddings. Every year, according to a survey by
Bride's Magazine, about 2.4 million weddings are held in the United
States, many of them outdoors (the magazine did not have an exact
figure).
</P>
<P>
   But Allan Eustis, a National Weather Service meteorologist, is
not convinced that predicting weather for specific days on a
long-range basis is reliable. ``Most meteorologists believe that
this is very difficult if not impossible to do,'' he said. ``If
you're having a wedding in June, I'd say there is a 70 percent
chance of rain. But I wouldn't risk the day-to-day forecast. I'd be
as likely to be wrong as I would to be right. But, hey, they're
still in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but each Weatherplanner forecast comes with an
unconditional money-back guarantee. Frederic Fox, the service's
president, said, ``We've had a grand total of 10 people (out of
2,000) ask for their money back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site offers personalized weather prediction for more
than 85,000 areas in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.
Nearly 74 percent of its customers are planning weddings, Fox said,
and the rest are planning reunions, family vacations and sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   Before creating the Weatherplanner site, the parent company,
Strategic Weather Services, built its reputation by providing
weather forecasting for businesses. For example, Terminex, the bug
exterminator, uses Strategic Weather Services to predict when
termites will swarm into individual geographic markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Fox said, ``with the advent of the Internet, we decided
that we already had this complex database for predicting the
weather _ why not allow consumers to use it?''
</P>
<P>
   The Weatherplanner Web site was introduced in late 1997 with
little advertising or marketing. So far, Fox said, one out of 20
visitors to the site buys some sort of weather prediction, which
costs $14.95 for a 10-day forecast anytime in the next 12 months.
Or for $19.95, a visitor can pick three geographic locations or
three specific dates, and the service will select the most
auspicious. As soon as a query (and credit-card number) are
submitted, the forecast appears on the screen. For $2.50 more, a
color printout is mailed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half of the people buying a weather plan are asking us
to send them the forecast,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Once customers have registered, they can pick the date and
location of their trip or event. Of special interest to those
interested in outdoor activities are the predictions for 20
national parks and 30 ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox recalled the first time he used the service, to plan his own
wedding five years ago in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife wanted a summer wedding outdoors, and we put in a
weather request,'' he said. The report came back predicting good
weather, but like many a nervous bridegroom, Fox decided to hedge
his bets: ``I asked my mother-in-law to rent tents and space
heaters, just in case.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The words ``fresh start'' may be among the most
delightful in the English language. And where furnishing a new home
is concerned, it is a delight for which age is no barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Logan Square East, a luxury retirement
high-rise in Philadelphia, have exploded the myth that all older
people who move into smaller quarters try to cram in as many old
pieces of oversize furniture as possible.
</P>
<P>
   These people, all 75 or older and with the desire and budget to
rethink their lives, approached the move with a pioneering spirit.
Their new homes become opportunities to express new attitudes about
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look back,'' said Barbara Rex Darsey, a 75-year-old
silk-screen artist who moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Logan
Square East from a large house in suburban Philadelphia six months
ago. ``I got rid of most of my furnishings when I moved here,
because I wanted to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   She uses her second bedroom as a studio and the second bathroom
as an inner sanctum _ where she meditates a half-hour a day in a
specially padded bathtub. Standing in her school-bus-yellow living
room, Ms. Darsey said, ``Now my walls throb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my apartment, I can assert my aggressiveness,'' she
continued. ``I can go against conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   She was inspired by colors she saw on a trip to Rome just before
she moved in. ``The green on my studio walls is singing _ it's an
exciting color,'' she said. She brought with her only an Eames side
chair, her cat and a family of doll puppets made from her own
silk-screened fabric. ``The garden became a pain in the neck and I
was too isolated,'' she said. ``I decided to make an `early' move
at 75.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rose Dobrof, a professor at the Brookdale Center on Aging at
Hunter College in Newe York, sees redecorating as an affirmation of
the future. ``It's sort of like moving to Florida to stay active
and involved,'' she said. ``It's a second chance. The kids are
grown and now there's some money available. For some, it's a need
to get away from the loss of a partner. And don't forget, the
widows are often looking for some visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Butler, the director of the International Longevity
Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, is fond of quoting John
Glenn's reminder that old people dream and have ambitions, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Florence Fink moved from a 17th-century house in Sag
Harbor, N.Y., to a one-bedroom apartment at Logan Square East. ``I
moved with four Le Corbusier chairs and 12 white T-shirts,'' she
said. ``I felt I was going on an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Widowed many years ago, Mrs. Fink, 80, said she wanted to be rid
of the responsibility of a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you can't take when you move are your friends,''
she said. ``But then again, moving to a place where you don't know
anyone gives you a tremendous amount of freedom, since friends are
a big responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   When she sold her house, most of her books and even some
paintings went, too. She headed to Ikea for small-scale, reasonably
priced furniture. ``Maybe the things were meant for young people
living in small places,'' she said. ``But so what? I figured the
furniture would be fine since my apartment is small, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She ended up with two small red chaises for the living room to
replace the built-in banquettes she was used to in her old house.
She then had her red chaises slipcovered in beige linen to suit her
sophisticated, minimalist taste. She also found two $15 floor lamps
for the bedroom and an inexpensive bookcase for the 50 books she
had kept.
</P>
<P>
   She admits now to suddenly feeling youthful. ``In Sag Harbor I
felt old,'' she said. ``My old things didn't mean much to me. I
left the house, I left the fixtures, but I took my memories. Those
you can put in your pocket.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Murray Schane, a psychiatrist in New York, said he was not
surprised that, as a group, these older redecorators seemed so
positive about the future. ``Decorating is not only accumulating
new things,'' he said. ``It's an active process that you engage in
with other people, often younger people. It gives you a sense of
renewal and makes the present feel more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The decorator Mario Buatta said, ``Eighty-year-olds are
different than they used to be _ they just don't seem old
nowadays.'' One older client in Atlanta has just moved into a
smaller home. ``She's one of those women _ definitely over 80 _ who
has totally redecorated,'' he said. ``The living room is bright
yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, most older people prefer to stick with their old
furniture. ``People like to keep their pleasant memories around,''
Buatta said. ``The most important thing is to make a new place look
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Pildes, who referred all questions about her age to
Sherlock Holmes, wanted something light and airy at Logan Square
East. She moved there six years ago from a nine-room Victorian
house in Brooklyn. She happily gave her collection of antique
furniture to her granddaughter and bought herself contemporary
upholstered chairs and kidney-bean-shaped sofas, all covered in
smooth black fabric.
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Ms. Pildes said she chose white walls and black
furniture as background for her hard-edge geometric paintings.
``For me, the main thing was not to take too many of my old things
when I moved,'' she said. ``I only brought one tiny chair for my
bedroom and two folding tables for my studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, it's not just the residents who find that a move in later
years can give a new lease on life: Norman and Sylvia Gordin
managed to lure their decorator, Donald Stanley, out of retirement
when they sold their large house on the Main Line.
</P>
<P>
   Gordin, 84, a self-described eternal optimist, appealed to his
wife's shopping instincts in proposing the move. ``I knew that if I
promised she could buy all new furniture, it would be a done
deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gordin, 75, recalled, ``The one thing I hated to give up
was my bedroom set.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband jumped in: ``I said, `Unload it, Sylvia _ we're
starting on a new adventure.' ''

HOT TIMES IN THE AULD COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carousing chilled and inebriated in Times Square is a popular
option for many people who usher in the New Year on this side of
the Atlantic Ocean. In Scotland, an equally enthusiastic
celebration called Hogmanay is observed.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites are devoted to an explanation of the holiday's
customs, and a page on the Essential Scotland site
(www.caithness-mm.co.uk/discover/essential/esshogm.html) features
personal observations about the celebration. The Hogmanay Web sites
are just part of a growing number of sites devoted to Scotland and
all things Scottish.
</P>
<P>
   Hogmanay is a traditional New Year's Eve celebration filled with
dances, parties and plenty of alcohol. On the surface, it sounds
like any other Dec. 31 party. But the history of the holiday, as
explained on the Hogmanay page on the Helpful Brother's site
(wkweb1.cableinet.co.uk/sbooth/index2.htm) is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Because Scots often had to work on Christmas and right up to
Jan. 1, New Year's Eve naturally became the big event of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the curious name is also discussed by the Helpful
Brothers site. ``It could be from the Anglo-Saxon `haleg monath,'
which means `holy month,''' the site says. ``It could be from the
Gaelic `oge maidne,' which means `new morning.' Some people also
think that it could be from an Old French word meaning `gift,' as
it was customary to give gifts at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes Hogmanay different from an average
American New Year's party is the practice of ``first footing.''
After midnight, it is customary to leave one's house and visit
friends and neighbors, carrying gifts of food and drink (like a
bottle of whisky and a plate of shortbread) to insure a prosperous
new year. It is also the convention to offer a small lump of coal
along with the food to symbolize the hope that your hosts' house
will have fuel throughout the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers in Edinburgh around the time of the holiday will
discover that the city uses the occasion to throw a grand party. It
also provides all the details at its Hogmanay site
(www.edinburghshogmanay.org).
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve wouldn't be complete without a few heartfelt
renditions of ``Auld Lang Syne,'' and in Scotland it is no
different. The country also holds the bragging rights to the song
lyrics, as it was Robert Burns who wrote them. The birth of Burns,
in January 1759, is also celebrated less than a month later, on
Jan. 25, in an observance known as Burns Night.
</P>
<P>
   The Bard of Scotland is also on the Web; two particularly good
sites are devoted to him: the Robert Burns Tribute
(www.rabbie-burns.com) and the Official Robert Burns Site
(www.robertburns.org). The Tribute page has an attractive
explanation of a Burns Night dinner, including the proper
traditional graces recited and the arrival of the haggis _ a
Scottish national dish of sheep's stomach stuffed with oatmeal and
spices.

<P>
   If the thought of haggis does not upset your stomach and you
want to know more about Scottish culture, odds are you can get your
fill at the Scotweb site (www.scotweb.co.uk), a thorough collection
of links for things like bagpipes, tartans, crafts and literature.

   The Internet is an orchard of unintended consequences. The
network itself, with all its content and clamor and chaos, is an
unintended consequence of Pentagon research. And like some kind of
magic-realist garden plot, it is a place where every seed, whether
carefully planted or heedlessly strewn, sprouts into a different
species, blossoms into yet another species and bears unexpected
mutant fruits. People bend it into shapes you wouldn't expect.
</P>
<P>
   And particularly gamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget one day, about three months after we
launched the service, I went into this room and suddenly Van Halen
started coming out of my speakers,'' said Brian Moriarty,
co-founder and chief visionary of Mpath (www.mplayer.com), a
digital playpen for 2 million online gamers. ``It turned out that
one guy had decided that he wanted to play music while people were
text-chatting, and so he turned on the CD and jammed his mike up
against the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did I know what this was going to turn into.''
</P>
<P>
   From its inception, Mpath had built voice capability into its
service so people could hurl epithets across the Internet as they
decimated each other on Quake. But most game manufacturers weren't
interested in using their limited available bandwidth for carrying
voice data. It was more important to pump up the graphics or
deliver more accurate positional information about bullets. Audio
capacity was all but ignored in the game space.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't long before someone figured out how to use it in
the chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point,'' Moriarty said, ``when suddenly some kind
of critical mass was achieved. You began to see a kind of chat
regime. Maybe two talkers instead of one, or maybe three, and then
the talkers started to outnumber the typers. Then social pressure
began to be felt by these people because everyone was in on this
conversation and the typers felt left out. So it snowballed very
quickly, in a matter of a few months. And now, when you go in
there, most of the users have got to have that microphone. If you
go into the public chat areas, it's rare to find someone that
doesn't have a microphone. In fact, a lot of users, when they
create a chat room, it says, `Mikes only.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Internet telephony, which has yet to find its feet,
Mpath's voice chat spread in weedy profusion because the technology
is cheap (the company's downloadable software is free, the service
is free, and headset microphones sell for less than $40) and easy
to set up, and because everyone was doing it. And because there is
a richness in the human voice and its capacity for nuance: age,
sex, social class, regional origin, cadences, rhythm, volume,
tension, laughter.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of human presence.
</P>
<P>
   All of these subtleties, even the intake of breath, are
amplified at a distance when you can't see, when all you can do is
listen. That's why radio theater was so compelling. That's why the
telephone is so compelling _ perhaps more compelling than a
face-to-face conversation _ and why videophones are invariably
disappointing. As Orson Welles said, the ear is more imaginative
than the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people do some of the things one might expect. There
are plenty of private chat rooms on Mpath with only two people in
them. But there are also channels where far-flung relatives convene
conference calls. And there is a sizable religious contingent of
armchair preachers. ``They sit around and create their own
Christian theme chat rooms and talk Christian and sing Christian
and preach,'' Moriarty noted. ``On a good evening, you'll see three
or four Christian rooms in chat.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fascinating thing that really caught us by
surprise,'' Moriarty said. ``We have average Middle American kind
of folks in the Southeast and into Texas who have discovered that
Mplayer.com is a great way to get on line and sing. Hillbilly John
is one of the ringleaders of the country singing group. He goes in
there and organizes these live jamborees. Then there's this guy
named Conway, and he runs a karaoke radio station on the service,
pretty much every day as far as I can tell, and he sings a lot of
Elvis in his own radio format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of fell on us. All we did was give people the
connection, and they discovered it. And now they're going crazy
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lot of the singing is horrible. But it is
compelling in its horribleness. It is considerably more compelling
than a personal home page, several times more compelling than any
customized portal interface, and orders of magnitude more
compelling than the whistles and bells of the media behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible singing is compelling because it is human. Because
when someone gets up to sing, even in the dark, it involves a
degree of risk, and it implies trust. ``Even when you hear people
singing badly,'' said Brian Apgar, Mpath's co-founder and chief
evangelist for chat, ``you can hear in their voice that they're
trying. You can hear the feelings and emotions they're trying to
communicate. And it makes you feel connected to them. It makes you
feel for them. Because they're getting up there and expressing
themselves. It's not phony, canned stuff from some major Hollywood
conglomerate. It's coming out of somebody's trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how fast the modems get, nothing in the overdesigned
corporate infoglut can evoke the raw empathy of a butchered karaoke
tune _ or ``Auld Lang Syne,'' for that matter. Because of all the
fantastic things the Internet has on demand, the best thing it can
deliver to us is one another.
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year.

<P>
   MITCH _ WASHINGTON _ Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner and senior representatives from the
Department of State hold a news conference to make a ``significant
announcement'' regarding the latest policy decisions affecting
Central American countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch. (Nesmith,
Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEWT _ Newt Gingrich has officially notified the governor's
office that he is vacating his 6th congressional seat. This move
kicks off the timetable for the governor to order the secy of state
to set an election date. Date can be no sooner than 30 days from
notice to set election. (Mantius, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   NYENGLAND _ BROAD CAMPDEN, England _ Our big New Year's fantasy
of a few months back was to find some fabulous old inn or
Elizabethan mansion _ one with soft beds, modern plumbing and a
roaring fireplace _ and just take the place over. It would have
been a nice way to close the book on our months in Britain. It
would have been an orgy of Englishness, quaintness, quietness and
beauty before flying home to greet the brash weirdness of America
again. Stupidly, I failed to realize that Brits like to holiday in
beautiful old inns even more than we do. So we began thinking about
staying home for New Year's in our bare one-bathtub rented
Victorian house. And we began eying the growing stocks of wild game
at the covered market in downtown Oxford. (Campbell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   MOONPIE-SUIT _ ATLANTA _ Patrons at an upscale Atlanta
restaurant can no longer order a latte and a Moon Pie. Kudzu Cafe,
which sold a glutinous desert called the Kudzu Ice Cream Moon Pie,
has settled a federal lawsuit filed by Chattanooga Bakery and
agreed to no longer use the trademark name for the convenience
store snack cakes. Chattanooga Bakery, which sells Moon Pies, sued
Kudzu for using its name on its $6.95 dessert item. Bakery
executives say the settlement, while confidential, was favorable to
them. Kudzu now sells the Kudzu Ice Cream Pie _ same ingredients,
yet no Moon Pie. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GA-MIDYEAR-CENSUS _ The Census Bureau has its midyear population
estimates out, and once again Georgia, at 2.0 percent, is the
fastest growing Southern state. The biggest growers overall are
Nevada and Arizona. This trend is about 2 years old. (Soto, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-COUNCIL _ ATLANTA _ The state Department of Human
Resources assembled the Welfare Advisory Council to appease
advocates and charged the council with pointing out systemic
problems, inconsistencies and glitches in the state's new welfare
policy. The group, which never had any power, spent 10 months
training, never examined anything, or heard a case or investigated
unfair treatment. It disbands Thursday. A post-mortem. (Oglesby,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT98 _ ATLANTA _ Impact98, a convention of 2,500
African-American college students, will comb the city on Wednesday
to distribute food to the needy. The convention lasts until New
Year's and is being attended by students from all over the country.
(Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   AUS-TEXAS-OATHS _ AUSTIN. Texas _ Now comes the hard part. After
months of high-hyperbole campaigns backed by high-dollar ad
campaigns, the politicians elected in November are about to become
state employees who have to actually show up for work and
accomplish something. The oath-taking begins Saturday and ends Jan.
19 when Gov. GWBush begins a second term and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry
begins a first. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   GA-VISION _ ATLANTA _ The state has awarded another
controversial contract, $1 million to Vision Research, for vision
screening of all kindergarteners and a select group of first-
through third-graders. The company was selected even though the
contract never went out for bid and a potential competitor is
sending letters to state legislators today asking that renewal of
the contract in the supplemental budget not be written with the
specs that state school superintendent Linda Schrenko used, which
were written so that only this company could get the contract.
(Cumming, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOZE-BURGLAR _ ATLANTA _ The phantom booze burglar has
apparently resurfaced. Last year APD arrested a burglar who had hit
eight upscale Atlanta establishments, stealing only the finest
wines, champagne and hard liquors. The burglaries resumed Dec.1,
and so far the suspect has hit three places, including a popular
barbecue restaurant on Dec. 26. The barbecue restaurant's camera's
caught him and cops believe it's the same man. (Longa, Atlanta

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Sinclair began writing and drawing his comic strip,
``Alex's Restaurant'' in 1990. The strip details the life of a
restaurant run by Alex, a rat-race dropout, and peopled by a crew
of holistically minded, slightly batty regulars. These include
Cranbrook, a soup-dropping, wild-haired waiter who explains the
more obscure items on the menu (like the three-day fast), and Dr.
Andy Vial _ a respectful lampoon of Dr. Andrew Weil, the nationally
known dispenser of medical advice _ who stops by the restaurant to
promote books like ``Hooked on Colonics.''
</P>
<P>
   Syndication once brought Sinclair's strip to about 50 papers in
1990. But the syndicate lost interest, and the strip was dropped.
``Many editors were nervous about its radical content,'' Sinclair
wrote in a self-published collection of his strips that appeared in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   After stints as a nurse and a paramedic, Sinclair began drawing
the strip again in 1995, after a friend convinced him that the
Internet offered a good way to reach readers. He first launched the
site that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole message that the Internet is giving people,''
Sinclair said, `is: `Here's the audience. It's there to be had. But
you have to make it happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering media Web site Nando Times
(www.nando.net/nt/comics/alex/today) picked up Alex's Restaurant
for publication over a year ago, and features a link to the strip
on its home page. Sinclair's daily strip also runs on its own site
(www.alexsrestaurant.com), which gets a few thousand visitors every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair has garnered praise from sources as varied as Yahoo
Internet Life magazine, and the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'Aretz, which
proclaimed him (in Hebrew) one of the top five Internet
cartoonists.
</P>
<P>
   While that might not have quite the same ring to it as the
Pulitzer Prize, the praise is evidence both of Sinclair's talent
and of the growing phenomenon of cartoons on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now some veteran cartoonists, with millions or even hundreds of
millions of daily newspaper readers, also are turning to the
Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like other Web-based cartoonists, however, Sinclair wants to use
his Internet popularity to gain a stronger foothold in newspapers.
Web site revenue sharing is negligible for most cartoonists, but
each additional newspaper that a cartoonist picks up can generate
anything from an additional few hundred dollars a year to several
thousand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the comic strip has been providing Sinclair with only a
modest income, which he supplements with illustration and Web
design work. ``I'd like to say that tons of money are coming in,
that I'm being inundated with awards and offers, but it's more
intimate than that,'' Sinclair said. ``I'm gaining readers one by
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Web-based strip that has achieved some prominence is
``Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet,'' by Peter Zale. ``Helen''
(www.peterzale.com) features a story line that follows Helen, a
Greek-American geek with a greater love for computers than concern
for her social life or her drop-dead gorgeous looks.
</P>
<P>
   Zale posts about six new strips every two weeks; the everyday
grind didn't mesh well with his day job as an art director and
computer system administrator at a Midwest ad agency. But he felt
that a Web site was critical for the credibility of the strip _ and
not just to boost it into newspaper synidcation. ``It was the topic
of the strip, Helen being involved with the Internet, that made it
necessary for the strip to have a Web site,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   he first cartoonist to have put an e-mail address in a comic
strip appears to have been Scott Adams, creator of the wildly
successful ``Dilbert.'' An extensive ``Dilbert'' Web site was built
a few years after that (www.dilbert.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of decisions early on that seem trivial now,
but were really kind of epic,'' said Adams, who credits ``Dilbert''
's rapid spread in newspapers to the Web tie-in. Adams started with
about 50 papers in 1989, and had grown to about 150 when he added
the e-mail address in 1993. By the time Adams launched the Dilbert
Web site in 1995, Dilbert was reaching about 400 papers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' reach now has extended to 1,900 papers. With a Dilbert
television show in the works, books consistently on the bestseller
list and the envy of his peers and aspiring new cartoonists, he
finds himself at the center of a small industry. ``Somebody's going
to be Walt Disney,'' Adams said, ``and it would be nice if it were
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams gets help from the syndicate to keep on top of his e-mail.
But the demands of the peculiarly interactive environment that is
the Internet, especially e-mail, have overwhelmed some cartoonists.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Thaves has been drawing ``Frank and Ernest'' for more than
25 years. The strip, which appears in more than 1,200 newspapers,
was one of the first widely distributed strips to include an e-mail
address (www.comiczone.com/comics/franknernest/ab.html).
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, he began receiving thousands of e-mail
messages. ``We were totally unprepared for that,'' said Thaves,
whose son and daughter help handle the strip's correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Delainey, who writes the daily strip ``Betty,'' distributed
to over 600 newspapers, said, ``Cartooning, like writing, is very
lonely. You sit isolated doing your stuff in a vacuum.'' Delainey
sounds almost wistful about life before he was on the Net. ``I was
free to do whatever the hell I wanted,'' he said. ``I had the
feeling that nobody was reading it, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of e-mail messages that regularly come in to
Delainey and the strip's illustrator, Gerry Rasmussen
(www.comiczone.com/comics/betty/ &QC; ab.html), have put the lie to
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some interesting relationships develop with certain
readers,'' he said. ``It opens up a sort of dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cartoonists, like Bill Amend, creator of the popular
``Foxtrot,'' resist that kind of exchange. ``The problem with
interacting in a daily way via e-mail with readers is the sheer
imbalance in scale,'' he said. ``I've got a strip that may have 20
million readers, but there's one of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Amend has made use of the lobbying power of his Net readers,
which numbered 30,000 one recent month, to influence comic-page
editors to run his strip.
</P>
<P>
   Still cartoonists are wondering whether they will be able to
make a living from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few realistic opportunities for the aspiring
cartoonist,'' Amend said. The Internet, he said, has ``broken that
model, given everybody their own printing press. Now, whether
they're attracting audiences is a different question.''

HONDURANS, NICARAGUANS GRANTED TEMPORARY LEGAL STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acknowledging the devastation in Central America by
Hurricane Mitch, the Clinton administration announced Wednesday
that it will allow an estimated 60,000 Nicaraguans and 90,000
Hondurans living illegally in this country to apply for temporary
legal status.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, Immigration and Naturalization Service
commissioner, said the immigrants will not be subject to
deportation during an 18-month period beginning in January and will
be eligible for work permits.
</P>
<P>
   The action grants what federal officials call ``temporary
protective status'' to Hondurans and Nicaraguans residing in the
United States as of Wednesday. Those arriving afterward will not be
not eligible. Also, people convicted of a felony or two or more
misdemeanors while in the United States or those barred from asylum
are not eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The states with the largest populations from the two countries
are California (with 18,800 Nicaraguans and 13,700 Hondurans),
Florida (33,100 Nicaraguans, 19,800 Hondurans), New York (3,200
Nicaraguans, 16,600 Hondurans), New Jersey (2,200 Nicaraguans,
8,300 Hondurans), and Texas (2,600 Nicaraguans, 8,400 Hondurans),
according to INS officials.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner also announced that the administration was extending
until March a suspension of its policy to return undocumented
immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is creating some breathing room here, giving
people who are in the United States from those countries ... the
opportunity to remain so that rebuilding can take place in their
countries,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall policy here is one of rebuilding in the region so
that normal immigration processes can recur,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to apply for the temporary status is $175.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch struck Central America on Oct. 28 and lingered for several
days, devastating much of Honduras and parts of Nicaragua. It was
the fourth strongest Caribbean hurricane in this century. United
Nations officials estimate that it killed 11,000 people, displaced
a million more and caused nearly $5.3 billion in damage to housing,
utilities roads and other public works.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner stressed that Wednesday's measures were not taken in
response to any new wave of illegal immigration sparked by the
hurricane. Rather, she said, the decision was based in part on
requests from officials of the four nations who said that money
sent from immigrants to their home countries will help destitute
families.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, the executive director of the Washington,
D.C.-based National Immigration Forum, a nonpartisan immigration
advocacy group, said Wednesday that the measures ``are an important
step.'' But he added that the administration should extend the
``temporary protective status'' benefit to El Salvadorans and
Guatemalans for 18 months rather than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is recognizing that (halting deportations)
is a critical component to rebuild the region, in addition to
trade, debt relief and development,'' Sharry said.
</P>
<P>
   Central American immigrants send about $3 billion a year to
relatives in the region. Sharry said that with the opportunity to
temporarily work legally in the United States, immigrants likely
will send more money home to help the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Central America last month, First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton said the economies hurt by the hurricane ``would
collapse completely'' if it were not for the cash sent home by
immigrants in the United States.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very cold air will remain in place across much of the Upper
Midwest and Northeast on Thursday. Temperatures will continue to be
five to fifteen degrees below average, though the stiff winds of
Wednesday in New England will slacken Thursday, lessening the chill
a bit. Light snow and flurries will fall in the upper Ohio Valley
and central Appalachians a weakening disturbance moves toward the
area. Farther north, localized snow squalls will pound areas to the
east of the Great Lakes, especially Erie and Ontario. Lighter snow
showers will coat the mountains of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Deep South will be partly to mostly sunny and seasonal with
temperatures mainly in the 50s and 60s. The exception will be along
the Texas coast, where an onshore flow of moist winds will lead to
scattered showers, especially in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of snow will streak across eastern Montana and the
Dakotas as winds from the east ascend the sloping terrain.
Accumulations should be light, though some areas will pick up a few
inches where the snow persists.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will drench the Pacific Northwest and northern California
as the flow of subtropical moisture into the region continues. The
rainfall, which will amount to an inch in some areas, will only
aggravate the flooding on rivers in the area. Snow levels will fall
as a pool of cold air aloft moves onshore.
</P>
<P>
   Much of California and the desert Southwest will be mainly sunny
and dry with seasonal temperatures. However, some fog will shroud
communities in the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Feeling The Chill
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds and a cold December air mass drove wind chill
values below zero in much of the Northeast Wednesday. Wind chill
values were derived by Dr. Paul Siple in an Antarctic experiment in
1939. Measurements were made of the time required to freeze bags
filled with warm water under various wind and temperature
combinations. Wind chill is supposed to indicate how chilly the air
feels to exposed skin, but human physiology is not part of the
equation. How someone actually feels also depends upon factors such
as humidity, sunshine and that person's general physical condition.

   FBC-FIESTA _ Tennessee has won 62 games over the past six
seasons. Florida State has won 10 or more games for 12 consecutive
seasons. They are, quite simply, two of the best college football
programs in the '90s. No mystery about how they get it done:
Recruiting, recruiting, and more recruiting. Stability on the
coaching staffs. Stadiums that seat a combined 180,000 people.
Barring any changes at the top, there is no end to the winning in
sight. Tennessee already has a verbal commitment from Chris Simms,
the nation's No. 1 high school quarterback. Florida State has

running back Emmitt Smith was ready for retirement. He didn't get a
lot of yards, and his heart didn't appear to be in it. Welcome to
Smith's comeback 1998 season. He's among the leading rushers in the
league, and he's a big reason the Cowboys are favored to come to
Atlanta next week to play the Falcons. (Pasquarelli, Atlanta

   The Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover CD-ROMs have sold 270,000
copies to date, a splash big enough to lure others into the pond. A
recent entry is the Essence Virtual Makeover, a joint product of
Essence, the African-American woman's magazine, and Mindscape, a
subsidiary of Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Cosmo CD, the user of the Essence Makeover can scan
in a picture of herself, then see how she looks in 150 hairstyles
and dozens of various shades and styles of makeup, including
foundation and contact lens colors. Denise West, director of
corporate marketing for Essence, said the Essence version took into
account the various skin shades of black women and their particular
fashion-accessory tastes.
</P>
<P>
   But will sales soar to big-hair proportions or be flat as
pancake makeup?
</P>
<P>
   Ted Lannan, a software industry analyst with Fairfield Research
Inc. in Lincoln, Neb., said African-Americans owned only 7 percent
of the personal computers now in homes. He added that if there was
a niche for software aimed at African-Americans, ``it is a small
one and a tough one to market to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West countered that surveys of PC ownership undercounted
African-American women because more of them used computers at work,
in community groups and at churches. She added that her company
felt that the number of black women owning PCs would ``increase
dramatically in the next year or so.''

   Judge Rules for Student in a Free-Speech Case
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first rulings of its kind, a U.S. judge in the
Eastern District of Missouri said Monday that a school district had
violated a high school student's free-speech rights by suspending
him for remarks he made on his personal Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, the Woodland School District in Marble Hill, Mo.,
in rural southeastern Missouri, suspended the student, Brandon
Beussink, a senior, for 10 days for ``abusing'' his computer in
making satirical and obscene comments on his site. The district
later failed him for the semester because of absences related to
the suspension, and his graduation with his class was in doubt. The
American Civil Liberties Union then sued the district on the
student's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we got this first step accomplished so that I can get
on with my education,'' Beussink said after the decision this week.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rodney Sippel of U.S. District Court issued a preliminary
injunction barring the district from using the suspension in grade
and attendance calculations and from punishing the student or
restricting his ability to post his home page on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote in his opinion that ``disliking or being upset
by the content of a student's speech is not an acceptable
justification for limiting student speech.''
</P>
<P>
   A final determination in the case is expected in the spring.

   Brace Yourself: `South Park' Will Be Coming to the PC
</P>
<P>
   Crazed turkeys attack, aliens abduct cows and robots slaughter
the townspeople. No, it's not another year 2000 prediction; it's
the next chapter in a different pop culture phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   South Park, the politically incorrect, animated cable television
show that features a gaggle of foul-mouthed kids, will soon be a
shoot-'em-up computer game.
</P>
<P>
   The game is priced at $39.95 and is due out in January from
Acclaim Entertainment Inc. The story line is that a mysterious
comet is heading toward South Park, causing all manner of mayhem,
like inspiring the poultry to go postal.
</P>
<P>
   It falls on the townspeople. The characters are armed with a
variety of weapons and a whole lot of creative compound expletives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely for mature audiences,'' said Michelle Seebach,
a spokeswoman for Acclaim, based in New York. She said there would
be warning labels all over the package. ``It's very reflective of
the show,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Providers Feel the Holiday Crush, Too
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers urge shoppers to buy online to avoid big
crowds, slow traffic and long lines. But during the holiday
shopping season, it seems that the virtual shopping experience had
some analogous drawbacks: longer waits to log on and more
frequently dropped calls.
</P>
<P>
   New research data shows that call-failure rates for the 25 top
Internet service providers rose sharply in November and December.
In the summer, five out of every 100 calls to those ISPs were
dropped in mid-connection; that figure rose to 8.5 per 100 in
November and in preliminary December results, according to Inverse
Network Technology, an Internet research company in Sunnyvale,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Roeckl, research manager for Inverse, said the rise was
partly because of the colder weather, which keeps more people
indoors and logged on, but he attributed the bulk of the dropped
calls to growth in e-commerce. ``People are dialing in longer,
staying on longer and clogging up the Internet,'' Roeckl said.
</P>
<P>
   Call failure rates rise as more people log on and stay logged on
because they hog the limited number of modem ports ISPs have
available for their subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping keeps at least one advantage, though: There is
little chance of facing sharp elbows and fisticuffs to get that
last Furby on a virtual shelf.

   Of Mice and Microsoft: A Company Claims Foul
</P>
<P>
   A new lawsuit is nibbling at Microsoft Corp. This one is by a
small computer hardware company that says Microsoft stole the
design for its mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit filed Dec. 14 in U.S. District Court in Austin, Texas,
the company, Goldtouch Technologies, charges that Microsoft
co-opted the Goldtouch design for the Microsoft Intellimouse Pro.
Both mice slope down in front and to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Goldtouch (www.goldtouch.com), which is based in Irvine, Calif.,
but has offices in Austin, says there are computer mice and then
there are computer mice. ``It may seem simple, but it is elegant,''
said Brandon Janes, a lawyer in Austin representing Goldtouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift of the hand from a flat position to a more vertical
position is ergonomically more correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As these things go, Goldtouch is seeking $1 billion in punitive
damages and unspecified compensatory damages. Janes said the
company did not want to stop Microsoft from selling its mouse but
said Microsoft should pay royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pilla, a Microsoft spokesman, said his company was reviewing
the suit and had no comment. But then he said Microsoft was
``confident the facts will show there is no basis'' for the claim.
</P>
<P>
   A Virtual Pilgrimage Is Complete With Souvenirs
</P>
<P>
   Let the word go forth: The little town of Bethlehem is open for
e-commerce. A new Web site, Jesus2000.com: Virtual Pilgrimage to
the Holy Land, sells religious trinkets, artifacts and mementos via
modem (www.Jesus2000.com). It touts itself as ``The Holy Land's
Largest Shopping Mall on the Internet,'' which may seem audacious
given that it opened just last month. The company behind the Web
site, Vector Holdings, is already in discussions to find an
underwriter for a public offering, said Alexander Barak, a Vector
board member.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Israel, Barak said the Luxembourg company was made
up of international investors and was nondenominational. He said
the company planned to create similar Web sites offering
merchandise related to other religions, and had reserved the domain
name www.Haj2000.com to sell Muslim merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Yahoo is to search, we want to be to church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thom Calandra, editor in chief of CBS Market Watch, on online
site for investors, said it might sound ambitious for a young
company to announce plans to go public after starting a single Web
site. But given the demand for Internet stocks, he said, heaven
only knows what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   New Contest Is Melding Stock Frenzy and the Web
</P>
<P>
   Online marketing and the frenzy of interest in the stock market
combine in a new Internet-based contest that promises to pay out a
very real $20 million grand prize. The catch is that to win, you
must guess all six numbers in a given week's Friday close of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average and the last eight of 10 numbers in
the closing volume.
</P>
<P>
   This is a task that makes mastering the state lottery look easy,
winning in Vegas downright simple or figuring out what makes
Internet stocks rise and fall a piece of cake. The odds?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the billions,'' conceded Chuck Seidman, chief executive of
Real Time Media, a company in Haverford, Pa., that produces the
sweepstakes site, www.prizes.com, where the ``Beat the Street''
contest is scheduled to go live in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Ball Online
</P>
<P>
   New Year's revelers no longer need to tune to the television to
watch the ball drop at Times Square. This year, a modem connection
and a monitor will do just fine. The festivities will be carried by
a host of major Web sites, including www.Broadcast.com,
www.msnbc.com and www.timessquare.org.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the millennium-bug doomsayers are to be believed,
next year's cybercast of Times Square may end with the ball in
middrop as computers crash the world over, leaving people to scurry
back to their televisions.

A HIGH POINT FOR ZOLAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The headline possibilities are endless.
Broadway Zo. Joltin' Zo. Zo Better Blues. Zo Meets the Volcano. Zo
Zo Nanette. Zo Knows. Not Your Average Zo. Say It Ain't So, Zo.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Zolak is going to be New England's starting quarterback
when the Patriots meet Jacksonville for their wild-card playoff
date in Florida Sunday. This became official Wednesday when New
England coach Pete Carroll put Drew 
``I-set-off-the-metal-detector-at-the-airport-because-of-all-the-jun
k-in-my-finger'' Bledsoe on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was predictably down about the formal announcement and
who can blame him? He demonstrated his competitive spirit by
playing three games with a broken finger, but now he has to sit on
the sideline in a dumb stocking cap while somebody else gets to
play quarterback in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, (itals)Somebody Else(unitals) is Scott Zolak, a
31-year-old lifetime backup who until this month went almost six
full seasons without playing a meaningful down.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong is the only Patriot with more continuous service
than Zolak. Zo was here for Victor Kiam, Sam Jankovich, and Dick
MacPherson. Zo was in New England before Bob Kraft reinvented
football. Zo played when Dante Scarnecchia was acting coach. In
1992, working in relief of Hugh Millen and the immortal Tommy
Hodson, Zo got four starts and won back-to-back games (no small
feat for a team that started 0-9). He was hot. He was AFC Offensive
Player of the Week. Zo was a regular on ``Sports Final.'' He was
the Patriots' answer to Morgan Magic, a big, popular kid with
infinite upside.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Patriots drafted this guy Bledsoe, and Zo became like
the backup shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles. He was a
clipboard-carrying Friend Of Drew, starting only one game in six
seasons, throwing more than 10 passes in a season only once (when
Bledsoe suffered a separated shoulder) in six years. Since Bledsoe
took over in 1993, Zo's best-remembered appearance was his
lawsuit-provoking, Paradise Club stage dive with pals Drew and Max
Lane during the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   But then Drew broke a couple of bones in the index finger of his
throwing hand and Zo started the final two games of this rocky 1998
Patriot ride. He led New England to victory against the vaunted
49ers, then stumbled with the rest of the gang in the Meadowlands
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Now this. His first playoff appearance. In his eighth year in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more excited about it because it's a playoff game,'' he
admitted. ``Of course there's more preparation as far as taking
care of yourself. It's another holiday week, but there's no
holidays for us. As the weeks progress, I feel more comfortable
with the team and the guys around me. I'm excited about playing in
the playoffs and let's get this thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak was hailed after the 49er victory, but ripped in the wake
of Sunday's debacle in Tunaville. He knows that's the way it goes
when you're the starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even going to talk about last week,'' he said. ``I'm
over it. Hopefully the rest of these guys are over it and the team
that played against San Francisco with a lot of fire will show up
to play on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no small event in Zolak's life. He's an unrestricted
free agent, which means he can help himself with a strong playoff
performance. His entire athletic life has prepared him for this
situation, but he has never had a chance to make his case in the
national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Zo played his high school ball under the expert tutelage of dad
Paul Zolak, who also coached a young Joe Montana. Then he went to
Maryland, where he played under Bobby Ross and followed Boomer
Esiason and Neil O'Donnell. Since 1991 he has been a backup
quarterback with the New England Patriots. But Sunday _ in a game
that could decide the fate of Carroll and will undoubtedly be used
to measure the success of this star-crossed season _ Zo is The Man.
</P>
<P>
   He would have done the professional thing and stood to the side
if Bledsoe had been cleared to play against the Jaguars. But that
did not happen. And now Zo will make a playoff start, and erase the
memory of the last regular-season game of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely don't want to go out on a note like that,''
Zolak said. ``I don't wish he was hurt this week. I wish the world
he could play. One of the reasons we're in the playoffs is the type
of year he had. But you want another chance to redeem youself and
prove some people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a chance. A big chance. And after eight years in the
league, that's all you want when you are No Ordinary Zo.

ARGENTINES LEARNING MORE ABOUT PRESIDENT'S ADVISER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENDOZA, Argentina _ Czarina Alexandra relied on Rasputin.
Hitler consulted with seers, as did Pope Innocent VII, Nancy Reagan
and much of the royal court at Versailles on the eve of the French
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   When Argentina's president, Carlos Saul Menem, needs
otherworldly advice, he turns to Azucena Aguero Blanch, a
48-year-old elementary school art teacher, muralist and
professional fortuneteller, she has told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As she tells it _ and she's the only one talking _ over the last
15 years she has advised Menem on Cabinet selections and on toning
down his hair style, dress and macho strut.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Ms. Aguero Blanch converted from Roman Catholicism to
Islam in 1988, she said, to better understand and advise Menem, who
as the son of Syrian immigrants was born a Muslim but is now
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cover article in Noticias, a leading Argentine weekly
magazine, publicized Ms. Aguero Blanch's importance for the first
time. Perhaps most revealingly, it described how the president, 68,
and the fortuneteller secretly met for an hour at the Alvear Palace
Hotel in Buenos Aires in November to discuss a possible last-minute
effort for a third consecutive term, despite a constitutional ban.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times, she said she argued
strongly against a run since ``the stars aren't with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't ask questions,'' Ms. Aguero Blanch said in the
interview in her tiny apartment in this leafy provincial capital
surrounded by vineyards and mountains. ``He's a Cancer. He just
listens, and I give him a thousand pieces of advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Ms. Aguero Blanch's relationship is to Menem, she is
original. She wears a miniature Koran around her neck and eye
makeup that makes it look as if she has two Stealth bombers flying
over her eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   She shuns artificial lighting as energy-sapping, and decorates
her dark apartment with a smiling Buddha statue, Turkish copper tea
sets and a colorful wall rug depicting peasants dancing a vigorous

reminding her to cut calories.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ms. Aguero Blanch said she has done many
services for Menem. Once he sent a close personal aide to her to
receive a talisman to ward off a corruption investigation, she
said, an act that rescued the aide from a possible indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent meeting at the Alvear Palace, she said, she told
him that Argentines would flock back to him in 2003, begging that
he make a comeback. She also predicted that the long divorced
president would remarry after leaving the Casa Rosada, the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response from Menem or the presidential palace to
the article in Noticias. When called by The New York Times for
comment on the Aguero Blanch report, Jose Luis Olivero, a
presidential spokesman, said: ``I don't think we've said anything
on this. I'll get back to you.'' Despite several calls for further
comment over the next several days, Olivero never called back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More curiously, the Noticias scoop made only a ripple in the
Argentine news media, aside from a couple of reports on local
television and in Uno, the Mendoza daily.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Ms. Aguero Blanch's reported role came as no surprise
to Argentines, who are accustomed to their leaders seeing
fortunetellers. Several respected biographies have confirmed that
Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, Menem's political hero, consulted with a
variety of mystics.
</P>
<P>
   Peron's third wife, Isabel, was dominated by a right-wing seer
during her presidency in the early 1970s, which fell to a military
coup. Jose Lopez Rega, a failed singer, got a hold on Mrs. Peron by
pretending to have the power to transfer the late Eva Peron's
mystical charisma on to her.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, mystical faith-healers called curanderos are still
commonplace in Menem's home province, La Rioja, and across much of
rural Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aguero Blanch said she did not know how Noticias found her.
But she said she would like to use any future publicity to
jump-start her career as a painter.
</P>
<P>
   She showed several photographs taken of her and the president
together over the years, as well as a thick batch of envelopes
addressed from the offices of the governor of La Rioja Province in
the 1980s when Menem was governor and more recently from the
presidential palace. (The contents, kept under lock and key, remain
private.)
</P>
<P>
   Then again, little about Menem raises Argentine eyebrows
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising,'' said Felipe Noguera, a prominent
political consultant. ``Menem has inaugurated a style of politics
close to show business. Movie stars and his kind of politician tend
to see witches.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Menem began softening his image in the last few years, he
enthusiastically cultivated a flamboyant, derring-do style of fast
sport cars, wildly extravagant sideburns and open dating with a
colorful variety of women. In the last year, scandals touching
several senior officials around him have overshadowed his early
victories, like slaying hyperinflation and slashing the military
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menem protects people that he likes too much, and that's where
he gets himself in trouble,'' Ms. Aguero Blanch said. ``He's just
such an excellent friend, so affectionate, so attentive. He
remembers everyone's birthday, even the flavors of foods that they
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aguero Blanch's account of her long relationship with Menem
is a richly embroidered tale of magic.
</P>
<P>
   One night in January 1984, she said, she dreamed of meeting an
Indian spiritualist who offered her a cup and news that a great man
was about to enter her life. She called her sister the next day,
and her sister told her that Gov. Carlos Saul Menem of La Rioja
Province was to come to Mendoza that day. Ms. Aguero Blanch wangled
her way into a luncheon given in the governor's honor at the
Confiteria Monaco cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The magic had only started.
</P>
<P>
   Menem tipped his cup in Ms. Aguero Blanch's direction, just like
the Indian in the dream. By the end of the luncheon, Menem had
invited her to have breakfast with him the next day. She demurred,
she said, uncertain of his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Then she rethought her decision when some friends warned her
that there could be repercussions for standing up a governor. She
turned to her fortune cards and amazingly, she said, they told her
that Menem would someday be president.
</P>
<P>
   For months the governor and Ms. Aguero Blanch wrote each other,
and she agreed to meet with him in La Rioja in July 1984. It was
over their first dinner, she said, that she assured him he would be
elected president five years later. She was supposed to stay one
day, but ended up staying 15, according to Ms. Aguero Blanch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went all over La Rioja, we talked,'' she said, ``and that's
all you need to know to put in the newspaper.''

BRENDA BLETHYN: MOMMIE WRETCHED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Brenda Blethyn got an Oscar nomination for her
performance as a rough-edged, foul-talking working-class mother who
had deserted her baby daughter in ``Secrets &AMP; Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother she plays in ``Little Voice'' makes her ``Secrets &AMP;
Lies'' character look like Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first read it, I said to Mark (Herman), the director,
this person is so big, so loud, so larger than life, that I don't
want that to be confused with the performance,'' Blethyn said on a
recent visit to Houston. ``I was worried that the perception of the
performance might be over the top rather than the character being
over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman told her not to worry about it, and that was all the
go-ahead Blethyn needed to cut loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't try to pull it back,'' she said, with an
aren't-I-naughty grin and a twinkle in her eyes. ``I took a deep
breath and went for it. She is horribly, embarrassingly over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   In style, Blethyn, 52, seems unlike her characters in either
movie. She has a strong English accent, but it's no match for the
sludge-thick inflection with which she coats her salty dialogue in
``Little Voice.'' Her real-life manner is subdued and dignified,
although quite capable of rattling off a good giggle now and then.
She's even a nonsmoker, something that will amaze those who have
seen her venting away in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn was little known internationally before ``Secrets &AMP;
Lies,'' but she was already popular in England, where she has
starred in a couple of TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been out of work, touch wood, and I've done a vast
amount of television and mainly theater, national theater, West
End,'' she said, adding, as though I might suspect she's
exaggerating, ``I got Best Television Comedy actress.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some folks in England would say she is a comedian,
rather than a dramatic actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any difference in playing comedy or drama, except
the story,'' Blethyn said. ``You still have to be honest in
whatever situation. The characters have always got to be rooted in
reality, whatever you are doing. Otherwise, it's not funny. It's
not one's responsibility to bother with (the story).''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Little Voice,'' one of the more unusual films of the year,
she is the mother of an introverted young woman who sits in her
room, never talking, but who is capable of singing in the style _
both voice and mannerisms _ of famous performers such as Judy
Garland, Shirley Bassey or even Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter, called Little Voice, is played uncannily by
British star Jane Horrocks, who actually does all the voices, as
she did when the film was a play.
</P>
<P>
   With a sleazy talent agent, played with oily perfection by
Michael Caine, the mother tries to force Little Voice to become a
cabaret star. Horrocks' stage performances in the movie are amazing
to watch _ even for such seasoned actors as Blethyn and Caine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she first did the nightclub scene, Michael and I sat
there. She finished one number _ it was Shirley Bassey _ and
Michael and I looked at each other, and our eyes were full of tears
because it was so wonderful. Good thing the camera wasn't on us,
because that's totally the wrong reaction (for our characters).''
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn says she doesn't ``want to turn my back on theater or
television'' but since ``Secrets &AMP; Lies,'' films have kept her
busy. She's made several movies not seen in the United States,
including one co-starring Kris Kristofferson. And she has finished
a few since ``Little Voice,'' including ``Daddy'' and ``Them,''
co-starring Ben Affleck, Laura Dern and Andy Griffith, and written
and directed by Billy Bob Thornton (``Sling Blade''). It's due out
in 1999.

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ When the man named Sor saw that he had
been recognized, he covered his face with a scarf and tried to
disappear into the crowd. But Vann Nath caught him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held him by the arm and I asked him: `Is it you? Is it you
named Sor?''' Vann Nath said, calling the man by his revolutionary
nickname. ``He said, `No, it's not me, you're confused,' but I
said: `Yes, it's you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vann Nath, by a stroke of fate that still torments him, is one
of only seven people who survived the Khmer Rouge torture house,
Tuol Sleng, where more than 14,000 people died. The man named Sor
was one of his guards.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of meeting that Cambodians continue to dread in
a country that has still not confronted its recent traumas, where
the bones of victims still lie unburied and where no one has yet
been brought to trial for the deaths of more than a million people
at the hands of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind was in chaos,'' Vann Nath said about his encounter,
and it is chaos that many people here fear: chaos of the mind, like
that of Vann Nath, and political chaos in a country where today's
feuds and hatreds have their roots in the brutalities of the Khmer
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Vann Nath's life was saved only because he was an artist and was
assigned to paint portraits, working from photographs, of an
anonymous man he later learned was Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like it or not, the time has come for Cambodia to decide
whether to face its past. This was the year of the collapse of the
Khmer Rouge as a fighting force, and for the first time, its top
leaders are available for capture and trial, unprotected by
soldiers and land mines.
</P>
<P>
   This week Phnom Penh is witnessing the unnerving spectacle of
two of the key Khmer Rouge figures _ Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea _
welcomed in from the cold by Prime Minister Hun Sen, enjoying the
comforts of a luxury hotel and planning a trip to a beach resort.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Hun Sen, say Cambodia should ``dig a hole and
bury the past'' in the interest of what he calls national
reconciliation. Others, led by human rights advocates around the
world, say Cambodia will continue to suffer until it cauterizes its
wounds through a judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Cambodians cannot escape the pain. They will
continue to be tormented by their past whether it remains hidden
and poisonous in their lives, or is reopened to bleed again.
</P>
<P>
   At a contentious news conference Tuesday, Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea waved away their country's suffering and urged the world to
``let bygones be bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the United Nations is moving forward with
plans for a possible internationally sponsored trial of Khmer Rouge
leaders for crimes against humanity. In January three international
jurists will submit an evaluation of the evidence that has been
gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge adopted a radical communism that tore Cambodia
apart in an attempt to remake it. They emptied the cities, divided
families, abolished religion, closed schools and sent tens of
thousands to security centers like Tuol Sleng. The Khmer Rouge
ruled for almost four years, until they were ousted by a Vietnamese
invasion at the beginning of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Pol Pot died in April 1998 in a shack in his jungle refuge, but
a dozen top figures are living free today among the people who were
their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obvious clash in these situations between
reconciliation and mercy on the one side, and creating justice on
the other,'' said Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. official monitoring
human rights in Cambodia. ``The experience is that if you sweep
under the carpet these kinds of very serious crimes, it is a very
negative message for the future. And the international standards
for human rights indicate that there should be trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the Cambodians have the moral and
political will to relive their traumas and proceed with a trial. If
not, the crimes of the Khmer Rouge may become one of the great
atrocities of history for which there was never an accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Vann Nath's confrontation with the man named Sor took place on
the grounds of Tuol Sleng itself, on the day a small museum was
being opened within its shabby yellow buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It is a museum where the very walls are terrifying. Years after
Vann Nath's ordeal, he returned to Tuol Sleng and covered the walls
with paintings that depict the tortures that he witnessed or could
hear from room to room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to forget but it is useless,'' he said. ``As long
as I live, it seems I will never be able to forget even a small
part of it'' _ the nighttime arrest that was never explained to
him, the shackles and blindfold, the prison cell where his
companions starved to death one by one, the screams of mothers as
their children were torn from them.
</P>
<P>
   And, years later, he remembered the man named Sor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled him into a room and I said to him, `If I were you and
you were me in the time of Pol Pot, I would kill you now,''' Vann
Nath said. ``But I didn't. I let him go. I just wanted him to know
that I was not like him, that I would not kill someone for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cambodia people often use the words ``justice'' and
``revenge'' interchangeably. And many say the time for revenge has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying all the time until 1985,'' said Reach Sambath, a
33-year-old Cambodian journalist who lost his father, his mother, a
grandmother and two brothers to the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever anybody asked me about my family, I cried,'' he said.
``Every year in school, on the Day of Hate, everybody cried,'' he
said, referring to a special day dedicated to keeping alive anger
at the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody remembered. People came out of the Khmer Rouge time
with empty hands. They were angry and they were lonely. But now we
have new families and new lives. It is difficult to find the
tears.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the presence here of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea sinks
in, some Cambodians are beginning to voice bewilderment and
resurgent anger. Khieu Samphan, 67, was the Khmer Rouge head of
state; Nuon Chea, 71, was a top ideologue.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence is an occasion for people, when asked, to recount
again their losses and consider their future.
</P>
<P>
   Moeun Chhean Nariddh, 29, a human rights educator, offered one
of the strongest arguments for a trial: the restoration of a sense
of justice and proportion to this skewed and battered society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that not only the top leaders but also the low-ranking
Khmer youth would be put on trial to show that there is justice,
even after 10 or 20 years,'' he said. ``That would be a lesson:
that you cannot escape justice. It would be fair to minor criminals
_ thieves and robbers who have been tried for stealing a bicycle or
stealing some money. I share the idea of releasing all  &UR; these &LR; 
criminals if you don't put the Khmer Rouge killers on trial.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One legacy of the Khmer Rouge _ along with poverty, violence,
broken lives and madness _ is what Hammarberg, the U.N. official,
calls a ``culture of impunity'' in which society follows a simple
animal logic: the strong dominate the weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major human rights problem in Cambodia, in my assessment,
is impunity,'' he said. ``People in positions of power, people with
money, people with weapons _ they can do whatever they want against
the small people. It's like a cancer in society. It makes people
feel vulnerable and powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the violence we see in Cambodia, with people settling
scores with weapons on a local level, is that they do not trust the
system of justice. They see these mass murderers going scot-free,
and even treated as VIPs, while people with minor crimes go to
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as August, Prime Minister Hun Sen seemed to agree
with this point of view, a characteristic flip-flop that suggests
the possible flimsiness of his current assurances to Khieu Samphan
and Nuon Chea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing those responsible for the genocide to justice is very
important,'' Hun Sen said. ``I think that as long as the Khmer
Rouge have not been judged, one will not be able to say that the
political and military organization of the Khmer Rouge is really
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the only question was whether a trial should be held
under Cambodian jurisdiction or in an international court
administered by the United Nations in a third country, like the
ones under way now involving crimes committed in the Balkans and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Either approach would need Hun Sen's cooperation, if only to
capture the suspects. At the moment, the more likely route is a
trial held in Cambodia, with international financing and assistance
to assure that it is fair.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. plan for an overseas trial would need approval in the
Security Council and faces the likelihood of a veto from China,
which has for decades been the chief international patron of the
Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the bizarre twists of this Khmer Rouge endgame, former
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali took a break Wednesday
in a visit here promoting the use of the French language to pay a
courtesy call on Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, asserting ``I am a professor of international law and
I know about these things,'' he said people should stop talking
about an international court because the Khmer Rouge atrocities
were an ``internal affair of a sovereign state.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat passionately disagreed. ``I profoundly
believe that this is in no way a purely Cambodian affair,'' he
said. ``So when people say we should ask what Cambodians want, yes.
But it concerns all of us. That's implicit in the concept of crimes
against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammarberg has been verbally wrestling with Hun Sen over human
rights for years, and he has mostly been losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid,'' he said of the question of a trial. ``I know
it's politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts are stumped by Hun Sen's possible motives in
giving a free pass to Khmer Rouge leaders. Some suggest that he has
been pressured by China as well as by Thailand, which for two
decades has given refuge to the Khmer Rouge across its border with
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heder, a scholar of the Khmer Rouge who is examining
records here for the War Crimes Research Office of the American
University Law School, said, ``There are at least 10 prime suspects
who could be rounded up quite easily and for whom there is
documentary as well as other evidence to suggest that there are
prima facie cases against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and the United States have made it clear that
they have no intention of going after a larger group, Heder said,
and that Hun Sen, a former middle-ranking Khmer Rouge soldier, has
nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Heder said, there is no solid basis to believe that
the Cambodian people do not want a trial, or that a trial would
threaten peace and order. Vague warnings of civil war by both Hun
Sen and Khieu Samphan are empty threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most dispirited Cambodians in recent months, as Hun
Sen has squeezed democracy out of the political system, has been
King Norodom Sihanouk, a largely powerless sovereign who
nevertheless wields the country's strongest moral force.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, he washed his hands of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking into account the very wide and undeniable discontent of
the majority of the Khmer people,'' the King said, ``I announce to
this majority that I respect them and will not renew my power of
amnesty for major Khmer Rouge criminals. From now on, I leave all
the responsibility to Hun Sen of handling this unfortunate and
dramatic affair of pardons accorded to the Khmer Rouge. I will sign
no more decrees concerning the Khmer Rouge.''
</P>
<P>
   People here say that with the changing of the seasons, the great
brown Tonle Sap, which flows through Phnom Penh, reverses its flow.
To Cambodians, the river is a symbol of their nation. The waters
are never fresh and the past does not remain in the past; it washes
back again and again, with all its accumulated debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural world explains the culture of its own nation,''
said Youk Chhang, the director of the Documentation Center of
Cambodia, an independent research bureau where the evidence against
the Khmer Rouge is being collated and computerized.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement this week, Youk Chhang warned that the Khmer
Rouge could return from their defeat in a new guise. Some key
figures have taken residence in their former stronghold at Pailin,
near the Thai border, where 2,000 of their soldiers are still
deployed, nominally as part of the government army.
</P>
<P>
   ``These monsters have sneaked back into town with Santa Claus,''
Youk Chhang said in his statement. ``After being in the jungle for
decades, it is impossible for the Khmer Rouge to have defected and
to be integrated with Cambodian society, either physically or
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do reassert themselves, most experts agree, it will be
at some future time, with a new generation of leaders, and not on
the battlefield but in the political arena, backed perhaps with the
muscle of their armed force.
</P>
<P>
   For Vann Nath, they have never disappeared. They are a part of
his art and a part of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was selected to work as a painter, he said, he shared
the torment of his fellow prisoners in Tuol Sleng, many of whose
officers remain free.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunger was beyond imagining,'' he said. ``When I looked
through the window I thought I could even eat the leaves on the
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day, two or three prisoners died in their sleep, of hunger
or torture, shackled together with 50 other men in a large bare
room. ``We slept in rows, head to head, and we knew they had died
because they stopped breathing,'' he said. ``We would turn to look
at each other in the morning, and some were just dead.''
</P>
<P>
   When the guards were not watching, some of the braver men broke
the rules and whispered to each other.
</P>
<P>
   They whispered, ``We have no hope. We'll finish here.''
</P>
<P>
   Or sometimes they asked each other, ``How many children do you
have?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Vann Nath is so battered by memories that he
no longer has the energy to wish for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about a trial anymore,'' he said. ``I used
to feel eager for a trial, but many years have passed. When Pol Pot
died, I just felt a little regret that I would never see him on
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he does have something he would like to tell the
Khmer Rouge leaders. ``If I had some kind of power to talk to
them,'' he said, ``I would try to explain to them: Those people who
died, they also wanted to live, like you.''

RISE IN MANAGED CARE COSTS IN 1999 LIKELY TO BE TEMPORARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most worrisome economic tiding for the new year is that
health care premiums for employer-based coverage will rise by 10
percent or more in 1999. The startling figure, based on preliminary
data from private employers and the program covering federal
employees, is out of line with scant rate increases over the last
four years. And it raises the question of whether managed care
plans have returned to the days of double-digit rate increases,
abandoning their promise to smother medical inflation.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons to believe the answer is no. The premium
increases earlier in the decade were chronic, the symptom of a
fee-for-service system lacking financial restraint. Next year's
premium increases appear likely to be temporary. Health costs are
rising, but not alarmingly so. It is too early to write off managed
care as a fleeting has-been.
</P>
<P>
   The first task in sorting through the data is to distinguish
premiums, which rise and fall in cycles like prices of other types
of insurance, from the underlying costs of treating patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the long-term trend in medical costs, not recent
movements in premiums, that ultimately rules the markets,'' says
Paul Ginsburg of the Center for Studying Health System Change. A
study by Ginsburg and Jon Gabel of KPMG Peat Marwick shows that
while premiums have risen only by 1 percent to 2 percent a year
over the last several years, medical costs have been rising by 2
percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg attributes the underpricing of insurance to a familiar
strategy by insurers to price low during economic good times to
expand their share of local markets. Insurers might also have
misjudged how quickly medical costs would start to rise after the
onslaught of managed care five years ago. But whatever the reason,
the practice of raising premiums by less than costs had to end and
will do so with a vengeance next year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal employees already know that their premiums will rise by
an average of 12 percent or more. Ginsburg expects premiums for
employer-based coverage to rise by more than 6 percent next year,
about double this year's rise.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the catch-up in premiums, medical costs are also
rising. Hospital costs have risen by only 2 percent a year over the
last few years but are expected to grow at twice that rate next
year. Drug costs are rising by more than 10 percent a year,
primarily because patients are taking advantage of a deluge of
powerful new treatments. These changes are not necessarily
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg, based on interviews with employers, attributes some of
the cost increases to a backlash against restrictive types of
managed care, like health maintenance organizations, that do the
best job controlling costs. ``Employers in tight labor markets are
reluctant to impose a narrow network of approved specialists
because of employee opposition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widely held belief that the managed care revolution
has run its course. According to this argument, the inflation of
medical costs has fallen only because employers are shifting
workers from high-cost fee-for-service coverage into lower-cost
managed care. But the savings will be one time, because managed
care costs are rising at the same rate as those of fee for service.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ginsburg-Gabel study says otherwise. The cost increases
of nearly every type of health plan have fallen drastically.
Shifting among plans explains only part of the cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Kenneth Thorpe of Tulane University, an architect of the
Clinton administration's proposed health care plan, points out that
where managed care plans have gained a substantial market presence
_ in California, for example _ health costs are rising slowly. But
where managed care remains nascent _ as in Louisiana _ health costs
continue to soar. Competition, he argues, imposes a useful
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Thorpe suggests, managed care might have done about as much
as possible to control costs through financial restrictions. He
suggests that to knock more digits off of medical inflation will
require other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care needs to better monitor physician care, feeding
back the results of studies that would tell doctors which
treatments work, which do not,'' he said. Beyond that, Thorpe
expects managed care to move into ``life-style issues _ helping
patients control smoking, drinking, obesity and cholesterol.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Thorpe's vision becomes reality, managed care learns to
do all the right things and medical costs creep up anyway. At that
point, it might be time to relax. No one knows how much Americans
should spend on health care. If well-informed consumers choose to
spend money out of their own pockets for expensive insurance plans
that provide easy access to a panoply of specialists, that should
cause little second-guessing. The problem with the double-digit
inflation of the early 1990s was that the fee-for-service system
drove doctors and patients to excessively expensive and risky
procedures, tests and drug regimes. It may turn out that even a
disciplined system will prove increasingly expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Medical cost inflation has not been as low over the last few
years as steady premiums seemed to indicate. Nor will medical costs
be nearly as bad as next year's high-rising premiums might suggest.
The mundane truth is that health care costs seemed destined to
outstrip inflation by a percentage point or two for at least the
next year or so. That news is not joyous. But neither is it
frightening.

 &HT;    Next chapter for Diet Coke: Book excerpts
 &HT;    By Don O' Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Readers of best sellers can get more fizz with their fiction
beginning Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Diet Coke begins packaging excerpts in booklet form
from a half-dozen new or soon-to-be-published books in 12-packs and
24-packs of the soft drink. The excerpted books include Elmore
Leonard's ``Be Cool,'' Maeve Binchy's ``Tara Road,'' Barbara Taylor
Bradford's ``A Sudden Change,'' Jack Canfield and Mark Hansen's
``Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul,'' Nora Roberts' ``River's
End'' and Lisa Scottoline's ``Mistaken Identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The target group is people older than 30 with busy lives, says
Coca-Cola spokeswoman Diana Garza. ``When asked what they liked to
do to relax, the first thing they said was to read best sellers and
books by best-selling authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Books were selected by subject matter rather than specific
title, Garza says. ``What we learned from market research was that
our consumers don't have a lot of free time. They are balancing
career and family, and they said they liked to relax by reading
books about contemporary subjects. We approached publishers and
asked them to help us provide our consumers with books that would
be appealing to both men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to including one of six excerpts in packages of Diet
Coke, the company is also launching an essay contest. ``We're
inviting consumers to send us their fictional or nonfictional
stories about living life to the fullest,'' Garza says. The authors
featured in the promotion will judge the 500-word essays and select
25 winners. Entries will be published in an online book at
http://www.dietcoke.com, which also debuts Feb. 1 with details
about the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 25, one winner will receive a free trip to New York
for a tour of the HarperCollins publishing house, a session with an
editor who will critique his or her work, and a meeting with the
featured authors. Says Garza: ``They'll have the opportunity to
live the life of a best-selling author at least for a day.''
</P>
<P>
   But they won't have to worry about bad reviews.
</P>
<P>
   WORDPLAY: This may have been a bad year for President Clinton,
but it's been a good year for new words. ``Zippergate'' and
``Monicagate'' became part of the national vocabulary. So did
``fusion cuisine,'' ``hat hair,'' ``analysisparalysis'' and
``Furby.'' Whether those words end up in future Oxford dictionaries
is up to the Oxford New Words Team, which every month monitors more
than 18,000 new terms from throughout the English-speaking world.
(By the way, fusion cuisine refers to the blending of ingredients
and culinary techniques from different regions; hat hair is the
embarrassing condition in which hair retains the shape of your hat,
due to static electricity; analysisparalysis is a symptom of
information fatigue syndrome; and Furby, of course, is the furry
must-have toy of 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   WORLD LIT: Not only has the economy gone global, but so has
literature. In the December issue of Publishing Trends newsletter,
a quick glance at best-selling novels around the world showed
American writers holding their own. Mary Higgins Clark's ``All
Through the Night'' was No. 1 in France, and John Grisham's ``The
Street Lawyer'' topped the charts in India and ranked third in
Brazil. Others in the Top 10 include Arthur Golden's ``Memoirs of a
Geisha'' (No. 6 in Germany, No. 5 in South Africa); William Diehl's
``Reign in Hell'' (No. 4, India); Stephen King's ``Bag of Bones''
(No. 8, Germany); and Charles Frazier's ``Cold Mountain'' (No. 6,
Australia). And Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' cracks the list at
No. 4 in South Africa.

METALLICA TO TEAM UP WITH SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The heavy-metal band Metallica and the San
Francisco Symphony are collaborating on a musical project with
composer-arranger Michael Kamen, to be performed next year.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the collaboration, including the performance dates,
will be announced Jan. 6, said Corey Humpage of Bill Graham
Presents.
</P>
<P>
   Kamen has been nominated for nine Grammys and two Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time the symphony has teamed with rock
bands. Under conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, the orchestra has
collaborated with former members of the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica is one of the world's premier metal bands. Originally
from Los Angeles, the group _ singer-guitarist James Hetfield,
guitarist Kirk Hammett, bassist Jason Newsted and drummer Lars
Ulrich _ has been based in the San Francisco Bay Area for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The band's 1986 album ``Master of Puppets'' is considered one of
the landmarks of the genre. A decade later Metallica released
``Load,'' which premiered at No. 1. The group's most recent album,
``Garage Inc.,'' is made up of cover versions of songs that have
inspired the group over the years; one of them, Bob Seger's ``Turn
the Page,'' is now a rock-radio hit.

 ANTI-AGING TECHNOLOGY GETS BOOST IN STUDY  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  New studies of a so-called immortality enzyme suggest that it
can be safely used to extend the life span of human cells without
making them cancerous.
<P>
   The findings, published in the latest issue of the journal
Nature Genetics, are based on a yearlong study of the enzyme
telomerase in human skin and retina cells that were transplanted
into laboratory mice.
</P>
<P>
   Results appear to resolve one of the key safety issues that had
kept researchers from testing the anti-aging technology in people.
If further tests succeed, telomerase genes might be used to
counteract the normal aging process, allowing possible treatments
for common aging-related conditions, such as failing eyesight and
wrinkled skin.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, telomerase was shown in test-tube studies to give
cells that normally wear out and die after a few reproductive
cycles a virtually limitless capacity to divide and multiply.
</P>
<P>
   The early findings generated considerable fanfare but also
raised concerns that the same enzyme, which is linked to many forms
of cancer, might trigger runaway growth in otherwise benign, albeit
tired, cells.
</P>
<P>
   The latest mouse experiments were designed to address these
concerns. The studies of human cells were done in mice with
bioengineered humanlike properties _ the closest thing to a human
trial as could be safely devised at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   The work was sponsored by Geron Corp., a Menlo Park,
Calif.-based biotech company seeking to commercialize the
telomerase technology. Along with Geron researchers led by Choy-Pik
Chiu, scientists involved in the work included Geoffrey Wahl at the
Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and Thea Tisty at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results, reported separately in the same science
journal, were obtained by a team of Geron collaborators at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Harley, chief scientific officer at Geron, said the
bioengineered ``immortal'' cells are still growing in the lab mice
and, by all indications, ``these cells are behaving like normal
cells.''
</P>
<P>
   All the usual mechanisms for arresting cancerous growth appear
to be working, he added, suggesting that the presence of the
telomerase, by itself, is not enough for tumors to form.
</P>
<P>
   The aging process occurs when cells exhaust their supply of
``telomeres'' _ bits of genetic material that give cells the
instructions needed to keep dividing into new copies.
</P>
<P>
   Like plastic tips on shoelaces, the telomeres are found at the
ends of the long stretches of DNA packed into each cell's nucleus.
In essence, the tips of telomeric DNA wear away each time the cell
reproduces, until none is left.
</P>
<P>
   Except during the fetal stage of development, most cells
typically lack the active gene needed to make new DNA tips. The
telomerase enzyme, a protein expressed by this gene, is what gives
cells that ability. It is also one of the factors in malignancies,
where cell growth runs amok.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the enzyme can be used as a potential therapy
without triggering unregulated growth still leaves some safety
questions unanswered. Chief among them is whether cancerous
properties might emerge after a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the latest studies pave the way for rigorous
preclinical experiments _ the final stage before the technology
might be tried in a few test subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Geron hopes the telomerase technology can play a role in a host
of drug development and gene therapy efforts, where it's often
useful to keep cells alive for extended periods of time. Two of the
most promising applications include telomerase in bioengineered
cells from bone marrow and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the gene that encodes telomerase might be inserted
into certain cells in humans to reverse the aging process. But the
first stage of human testing is two to three years away, if all
goes well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've shown in these papers is that imparting cellular
immortality to normal cells doesn't cause them to behave abnormally
in any other regard,'' Harley said. ``To get the gene into people
is going to require more work. A number of safety issues need to be
addressed.''

ANALYSIS: IRAQ BOMBING CREATES NEW UNCERTAINTIES
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-U.S.) 
(bl)  
By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than resolving anything, the bombing of Iraq this month
has raised new uncertainties not only about Iraq itself but also
about how the West will deal with it in the months and years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   By deciding to proceed with the bombing campaign despite the
lack of anything remotely resembling the broad coalition assembled
for the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the United States and Britain
sent a message of power that resounded across the Middle East to
the Balkans and beyond. But because the bombing left President
Saddam Hussein as defiant as ever, it left many questions
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is what the United States and Britain, its only
true ally in the operation, can do next. There is clearly no
appetite in either country for a major ground attack or sustained
bombing of Iraq, the only military campaigns that might actually
drive Saddam from power. And given his announced refusal to allow
United Nations weapons inspectors back into the country, there
seems no way to monitor closely his efforts to develop nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saddam has few friends in the world, there is growing
anger in Arab countries at the devastating effects of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq. This anger is beginning to spread to Europe and
elsewhere. Saddam may hope to use it to portray himself as a victim
rather than perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the United States bombs Iraq, it becomes easier for
Saddam to play that role. And with his new acts of defiance,
including firing missiles at U.S. planes patrolling his skies, he
seems to be taunting the United States to bomb again.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy may be paying off. Saddam recognizes that there
are limits to what the United States and Britain are willing to do
to keep him, as Prime Minister Tony Blair put it, ``in his cage.''
He is counting on international disapproval of air strikes, plus
growing distaste for the sanctions, to tilt the political balance
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, in short, seems to have taken control of this
confrontation, forcing the Americans and British to react to
situations he creates. They face the prospect of bombing Iraq every
few months for an indefinite period, never dealing a knockout blow
and never knowing when Saddam will use or threaten to use the
prohibited weapons that he is said to be secretly developing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than planning for a post-Saddam period, some diplomats in
Baghdad are now wondering if Saddam will be a thorn in the U.S.
side for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's military infrastructure has been damaged, but not his
command and control mechanism,'' said an envoy from a NATO country.
``Clinton had to attack because if he didn't, American credibility
would have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as the ultimate goal of this whole effort, which is
to force political change in Iraq, it's hard to see any progress at
all. Nothing has changed, and no one seems to know where we go from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Baghdad's power elite, especially leaders of the ruling
clans, are on the winning side of an odd political equation. They
are Sunni Muslims, part of the group that controls the country even
though they make up only about 30 percent of the population. They
know that any rebellion against Saddam might well propel the
majority Shiite Muslim population to power.
</P>
<P>
   That fact is one of two fundamental political realities there.
The other is that Iraq sits atop 10 percent of the world's oil _
more than any country in the world except Saudi Arabia _ more than
the United States, Mexico and Canada combined.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners who live in Baghdad say that given these two
realities, there is little prospect that sanctions and limited
bombing will cause Iraqi military commanders or clan leaders to
rebel against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in and around Baghdad, including the whole political
and military elite, sees the size of the oil resource and wants a
piece of it,'' said a European who has lived here for years and
closely monitors public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all know that overthrowing Saddam would trigger a chain
of events that might well lead to the Sunnis losing everything.
They would rather live for 2 or 5 or 10 or 20 years with sanctions
than do something that could marginalize them forever.''

GOVERNMENT ORDERED TO RECOGNIZE NON-ORTHODOX CONVERSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: ISRAEL-POLITICS) 
(JT) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a court decision that is expected to reawaken the
divisive issue of who is a Jew, a district judge here Wednesday
ordered the Israeli government to recognize conversions to Judaism
performed by non-Orthodox rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jewish politicians immediately denounced the ruling and
promised to circumvent it by bringing a bill to the Parliament next
week that confers the sole right to perform conversions on the
Orthodox rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the minority Reform and Conservative movements
here celebrated what they consider a landmark victory in the battle
to win equal status for their movements in the Jewish homeland,
where the Orthodox control religious life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rejoice, but it remains to be seen how long our rejoicing
lasts,'' said Rabbi Uri Regev, a lawyer who heads the Reform
movement here and represented the plaintiffs. ``It seems we already
have to gird up for battle once more.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief judge of the Jerusalem district court handed down a
16-page decision that compels the ministry of the interior to
register as Jews some 23 immigrants who converted either in Israel
or abroad under non-Orthodox instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The government is expected to try immediately to get a temporary
restraining order, and then appeal the decision to the Supreme
Court for a hearing in February.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has ramifications for scores of thousands of
naturalized Israeli citizens, particularly non-Jewish Russians and
Ethiopians who immigrated to Israel as part of a family with at
least one Jewish member and who want to convert without making a
commitment to the exacting life of the observant Orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Goldin, who married an Israeli and moved to Israel from
Germany in 1982, is one of the 23 naturalized Israelis who
petitioned the court years ago, for herself and her 14-year-old,
Israeli-born daughter. She and her daughter converted to Judaism in
a Reform Jewish program in Israel because her husband was not a
religious Jew. Orthodoxy was alien to them, and the Orthodox rabbi
they initially consulted would have forced her husband to attend
classes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Since her conversion, she has kept a kosher home and attended
Sabbath services every Friday night. But her national identity
card, which lists her citizenship as Israeli, declares her
nationality as German where it says Jewish for most Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have to show the I.D., at airports or security
checks, we have problems,'' she said. ``It's a terrible way to put
it to you, but they look upon me like an Arab because of that one
line on my card. They deny me who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Since every Jew is offered the right to Israeli citizenship, the
question of who is a Jew is central to Jewish identity, which has
been bound to the Israeli state since its birth 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion issue has set off years of battle between
non-Orthodox and Orthodox Jews since Orthodox rabbis do not
recognize the Reform and Conservative movements as Judaism, and
thus do not accept conversions performed by their rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   It has also strained relations between American Jews, most of
whom are not Orthodox, and the Israeli government, which has
traditionally backed exclusive Orthodox control over personal
issues like weddings, divorces and funerals.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of wrangling, the issue has lain dormant for
most of this year. Court cases and legislation were put off while a
government committee, headed by Yaakov Neeman, the former finance
minister, tried to work out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise would have left the Orthodox chief rabbinate with
final control over conversion, but allowed for the opening of a
joint Reform-Orthodox conversion institute. But it was rejected,
both by the Orthodox and by the Reform, who believe that nothing
would be changed if the chief rabbis retained the final say.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Orthodox rabbis have moved beyond not recognizing
non-Orthodox conversions to nullifying Orthodox conversions if they
see a convert is not living a religious life, according to lawyers
for the Reform movement. In one instance, a Russian woman and her
daughters were stripped of their Judaism because they chose to
reside on a secular kibbutz. The woman's husband was an Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's court decision propels the issue back into the
Parliament. Hanan Porat, a National Religious Party member who
heads the Judiciary Committee, said he was ``very upset'' with the
ruling, which, he said, ``constitutes a judicial hijacking'' of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would introduce a conversion bill granting exclusive
control to the Orthodox for its second and third readings next
week. The bill was passed in a first reading last year, and needs
three readings to become law.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult time for any sensitive piece of legislation,
since the budget bill is pending. Religious members of Parliament
could hold up approval of the budget if the conversion bill were
not approved.
</P>
<P>
   Regev said he hoped that the Parliament would not be swayed by
such pressure, remembering that most Israelis support religious
pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   But the German-born Ms. Goldin, who said she was pragmatic, was
not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the court case, which says we're Jewish like any other
person here in Israel,'' Ms. Goldin said. ``But from here to
registration it's long, long way. I don't think Israel is ready.''

U.S. JETS FIRE ON IRAQI DEFENSE TARGETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. jets fired on Iraqi defense installations
Wednesday after British warplanes were attacked by missiles in a
no-fly zone over southern Iraq, U.S. military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. planes, which included F-16 jets, returned safely to
base after completing their second retaliatory strike on Iraq this
week, the Pentagon reported. On Monday, U.S. jets responded to a
similar Iraqi surface-to-air missile attack in a no-fly zone over
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton discussed the Iraq situation with his national
security advisers but made no public statement before leaving
Wednesday afternoon for a holiday vacation at a South Carolina
resort. White House spokesman David Leavy said Wednesday's armed
exchange will not deter the United States and Britain from
enforcing the no-fly zones, which were put in place after the 1991
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to contain the threat that (Iraqi dictator
Saddam Hussein) poses to the international community,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The action in the skies near Talil in southern Iraq began at
9:30 a.m. Iraq time, 1:30 a.m. EST, when Iraqi soldiers fired a
surface-to-air missile at a British Tornado warplane on routine
patrol, said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Patrick Sivigny. U.S. jets
responded about 45 minutes later, firing two HARM heat-seeking
missiles and several laser-guided munitions at Iraqi defense sites,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. or British planes were damaged in the exchange, but U.S.
officials have not finished assessing the damage the attack might
have wrought on Iraqi forces, Sivigny said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's government-run news agency said U.S. missiles killed a
farmer and injured two other civilians. The agency also reported
that Iraq ``almost certainly shot down a Western plane,'' a claim
the Pentagon disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent incidents, the United States will continue a
withdrawal of forces from the Persian Gulf. The USS Enterprise
carrier group is set to leave the area by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces left will be adequate to do what we need to do,''
said Sivigny. He pointed out that there will still be a carrier,
200 aircraft, more than two dozen ships, and 20,000 troops in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for his traditional New Year's vacation in Hilton
Head, S.C., Clinton discussed the Iraq situation with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin by phone. Yeltsin had assailed as
unjustified a massive four-day bombing campaign U.S. and British
forces waged against Saddam's suspected weapons sites Dec. 16-20,
but agreed with Clinton that their differences on Iraq should not
interfere with U.S.-Russian relations, the White House reported.
</P>
<P>
   A British Defense Ministry spokesman told The Associated Press
that ``the firm response to the latest Iraqi provocation is ample
evidence of our commitment'' to patrol the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain launched the four-day assault,
code-named Operation Desert Fox, after United Nations weapons
inspectors reported that Saddam had denied them access to sites
where he was suspected of mixing chemical weapons and creating arms
of mass destruction. Saddam has refused to let the inspectors back
into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's skirmish, Clinton warned Saddam that U.S. pilots
will ``protect themselves if they're threatened or attacked.''
Iraq's military said U.S. missiles on Monday killed four Iraqi
soldiers and injured seven others
</P>
<P>
   The no-fly zones extend south from the 33rd parallel, just below
Iraq's capital city of Baghdad, and north from the 36th parallel.
The zones, which the U.S. and British military have enforced as a
condition of Iraq's surrender in the Persian Gulf War, are designed
to prevent Iraqi aircraft from attacking Kurds in the north and
Shi'ite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam refuses to recognize the no-fly zones, regarding them as
an illegal encroachment on Iraq's sovereignty.

TEXAS INVESTIGATORS SEEK TO TALK TO SUSPECT WHO CONFESSED TO

<P>
   Danny Paul Bible is a popular fellow these days, perhaps for the
first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Harris County Sheriff's Department
remained Wednesday in West Baton Rouge Parish, La., where Bible,
47, has confessed to four murders, including the 1979 ice pick
death of a young mother in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Palo Pinto and Parker counties in North
Texas, where Bible's other victims were found, also are preparing
to interview Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Jesse Mack is in Louisiana, working to chronicle
Bible's cross-country travels since his February 1992 parole, where
investigators fear he may have left other victims.
</P>
<P>
   Bible was charged Nov. 8 in rape of a Louisiana woman, said West
Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's detective Randall Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Once extradited to Louisiana from Florida, where he was picked
up Nov. 18, Walker said Bible confessed to the May 1979 stabbing
death of 21-year-old Inez Denton in north Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   Bible also confessed to the murders of his former sister-in-law,
Tracy Powers, Powers' 4-month-old son Justin, and her roommate,
Pamela Hudgins. All three disappeared in May 1983 from the
Weatherford apartment they shared. Bible lived about 20 miles away
in Mineral Wells at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherford, a North Texas community of nearly 18,000 people, is
about 25 miles west of downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Picked up in Florida in those cases and the aggravated
kidnapping of an ex-girlfriend and an 11-year-old girl in Montana,
Bible pleaded guilty to Hudgins' death and the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   He served eight years of a 25-year sentence and was paroled to
Montgomery County, where he reported regularly. Bible, a
construction worker, had permission to travel, parole officials
said. Walker said it appeared Bible had been in more than 20 states
since his parole in February 1992.
</P>
<P>
   West Columbia Police Chief Don Fairrel doesn't envy
investigators interviewing Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Fairrel was police chief of Mineral Wells when Powers, her son
and Hudgins disappeared. His investigators tracked Bible to
California, Hawaii, Montana, Oklahoma and Washington before finally
catching up to him in Florida and bringing him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very cold,'' Fairrel said of Bible. ``He's the only
person I've ever seen who could be talking to you and suddenly stop
and just stare at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could stare at you for a solid half-hour. It was like he
just turned everything off.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairrel also recalls the Mineral Wells police officer from whom
Hudgins was estranged when she moved in with Powers, whose marriage
also was troubled.
</P>
<P>
   The young officer took a leave of absence after his wife's body
was discovered, and committed suicide, Fairrel said.
</P>
<P>
   The young husband wasn't the only survivor devastated by the
killings. Melba Harrison, Tracy Powers' mother, had to be
hospitalized in June 1983, when her daughter and grandson had been
missing a month.
</P>
<P>
   There was little solace in the discovery of the bodies later in
June near a creek about halfway between Mineral Wells and
Weatherford. The decomposition of the bodies made determining their
causes of death impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison was pleased when Bible was arrested and brought back
the following year, but his plea bargain arrangement in Hudgins'
death dashed her hopes of an explanation at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   With Bible once again in custody, and admitting killing her
daughter 15 years ago, Harrison said, ``I pray that this time he'll
answer for Tracy's murder.'' &QL;

CHARACTER IS THE ISSUE AS ISRAEL GEARS UP FOR ELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis joke that theirs is a country of 6 million
people, 6 million cell phones and now, 6 million candidates for
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu turns around, he
faces a potential new rival, not from the left but from his own
conservative camp _ and, as of Wednesday, from his own Cabinet,
after Environment Minister Rafael Eitan became the fourth
right-wing candidate to throw his hat into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the campaign feels somewhat like a dysfunctional
family's very public feud, and political experts are wondering
whether it is wise to subject the country a five-month campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to justify the two big parties' intention of
postponing elections until May,'' Yosef Lapid wrote in the
newspaper Maariv. ``It is in the national interest to finish this
matter quickly, efficiently and elegantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law dictates that when a government fails, it must be
replaced within 60 days. But Netanyahu and the opposition Labor
Party struck a deal to dissolve rather than topple the government,
allowing them to negotiate an election date, now set for May 17,
with a probable runoff on June 1. The date is still subject to
approval by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, the national budget, secular-religious
relations, the war in Lebanon and the Israeli-Palestinian peace
effort will hang like punching bags in the election free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that this has started out as an
issues-oriented race. So far, the only lightning rod for debate has
been Netanyahu's character, and all gloves have been off. On
Wednesday he was assailed by a Labor representative for putting a
$230 bottle of wine on the state's tab while dining in New York
City, and he agreed to repay the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the major issues cannot be frozen in time, and so decisions
will be made by a government in the midst of a slow-motion
dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   For months, as Netanyahu's government was teetering, the threat
of being toppled hung over the prime minister's every move. Last
week, when he cast one of 81 votes to disperse the government, the
situation had reached farcical proportions: there were three
different bills on the floor, each with a separate no-confidence
motion attached by a different faction. It was legislation by
blackmail: Pass this bill or we bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the threat would seem to be moot, but the bartering
continues, in the context of the campaign. For instance, the head
of Parliament's Finance Committee, knowing that most candidates
want to woo religious Jews, is promising to hold budget legislation
hostage by tying it to an issue important to strict Orthodox
factions.
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Ravitz, the finance committee chairman and head of the
United Torah Judaism faction, said he would not bring the budget
legislation to its next reading until Parliament approves a bill
that in effect bans Reform and Conservative Jews from serving on
the country's all-powerful religious councils.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is an attempt to circumvent a high court order
to integrate the religious councils, passed by a thin margin, &UR;  &LR; on
its first reading on Monday night, drawing fierce criticism from
Reform and Conservative Jewish leaders here. One, Rabbi Ehud
Bandel, predicted a breakdown in relations with Jews abroad if the
bill became law, saying it would discourage their financial support
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition has sold the values of 90 percent of the country
in a close-out sale, and surrendered to ugly blackmail,'' a Labor
member of Parliament, Ophir Pines-Paz, said, referring to
Netanyahu's right-wing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   For Netanyahu, the race is between him and ``the left,'' a term
he uses as a slur and has so far attached to three fairly
middle-of-the-road establishment figures _ Ehud Barak, the Labor
Party leader and former army chief of staff; Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
another former chief of staff, who is expected to announce his
candidacy as a centrist next week, and Dan Meridor, of the Likud
Party, who defected last week to run as a center candidate, too.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the vicious internal combat that most threatens
Netanyahu at this point in the race. The question of the moment is
who will be faithful to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Shamir, a former Likud party prime minister, set the
tone at the beginning of the week by pronouncing Netanyahu an
``angel of destruction,'' presiding over the disintegration of the
Likud. But Ehud Olmert, the mayor of Jerusalem, saved him his first
major anxiety when he decided not to oppose the prime minister for
the leadership of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Mordechai, the defense minister, is still on the fence,
however, weighing a defection to Shahak's as yet unformed center
party, in what would be a blow to the prime minister's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   And David Levy, a former finance minister under Netanyahu, is
reportedly set to join Barak on the Labor Party list only weeks
after negotiations broke down with the prime minister about
rejoining his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ariel Sharon, the hawkish foreign minister, who has stood
fiercely by the prime minister's side as his most powerful ally,
wavered a bit when asked if he would ever seek to be the country's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   He would consider running for prime minister ``under certain
conditions,'' he said on an evening talk show, but did not
elaborate, telling journalists to figure it out for themselves.
Some speculated that he might be tempted to jump in and take over
the Likud if Mordechai bails out.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the three right-wing candidates who have declared their
candidacies do not present a significant threat to Netanyahu,
although they would leech support from him. They are Uzi Landau, a
member of parliament who is challenging Netanyahu from within the
splintering Likud; Benny Begin, a geologist and ultra-nationalist
who left the Likud in disgust, and Eitan, a former army chief of
staff and leader of the far-right Tsomet faction.
</P>
<P>
   But they reflect a key problem that lies ahead for Netanyahu,
even if he surmounts the divisions on the right to emerge as its
candidate. While he may have retained the support of the street _
time will tell _ he has lost the trust of most of the right-wing
leadership. And it is not chiefly ideological; it is not that he
signed the land-for-security peace plan with the Palestinians. It
is personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political disputes are not what muddied the relationship,''
Amnon Danker wrote in Maariv, citing the close relationship between
other politicians who strongly disagree. ``The problem is one of a
terrible character.''

   REDMOND, Wash. _ The cries of frustration and failure, of anger
and helplessness, pour in from across North America _ 125,000 on
the day after Christmas alone. Invariably, the pleas for help are
from adults and, mostly, their lament is the same: ``I just can't
get it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope this holiday season, because 16-year-old Aaron
Barton, a high school junior from Kirkland, Wash., is on the other
end of the line, armed with a technical-support manual as well as a
set of suggested ``empathy statements'' provided by his temporary
employer, Nintendo of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to how you're feeling,'' Aaron, reading from the
company chart, tells a mother in Colorado. ``I can see that you're
upset,'' he tells another caller. ``I would be feeling frustrated,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Aaron gets down to business, and most of the time he comes
up with an answer. ``Usually, it's got something to do with the
input button on the remote,'' he explains, matter-of-factly.
``Sometimes they've got the line-in, line-out jacks mixed up. So I
talk them through the setup.''
</P>
<P>
   For 150 high school students who live here in Redmond, a suburb
of Seattle and one of the capitals of the high-tech world,
Christmas break this year means working as a Nintendo ``play
counselor,'' manning the phone lines and helping customers to hook
up the company's popular video game systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel approach to what the company calls its ``crunch
week,'' the heaviest period of customer-service calls all year,
Nintendo recently hired the Seattle-area teen-agers. What the young
workers get is practical: $9 an hour and, provided they work the
full week between Christmas and New Year's, a Nintendo 64 game set,
complete with a hand-held controller (retail value, $129.99).
</P>
<P>
   But what they give is more profound: help that reaches across
the generational bridge, to the kind of people who could not
program a VCR to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the way society brought us up,'' Daniel Wells, 18,
a play counselor who is a senior at Interlake High School in
Bellevue, Wash., said when asked to explain why he and most of his
friends have never had difficulty hooking up either a VCR or a
Nintendo game set. ``Or maybe we're just more, you know,
advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nintendo set is described on its package as ``plug and
play.'' But, judging from the calls that come into the company's
main office here, a stone's throw from the world headquarters of
Microsoft, a lot of adults clearly have trouble plugging before
they ever start playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pressed every button on my TV set and my cable converter
trying to get this thing to work,'' one woman who called the
Nintendo help line told Katie Shaughnessy, 16, a junior at Redmond
High School. ``I set it to Channel 3, then I set it to Channel 4 _
nothing,'' the woman said as two young children wailed in the
background that they wanted to play the game _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, I'd like you to try setting it to Channel 2,'' said
Katie, speaking with the calm, impassive voice of an air traffic
controller. ``Now do you see where it says `input' on your remote
control? Press that. Anything? No? OK, press it again.''
</P>
<P>
   A pause on the other line. ``Wait! Hey, there it is!'' said the
woman. ``Wow, it's on. Hey, kids, it's working! Hey, thanks!''
</P>
<P>
   Disconnecting her headset, Katie reflected that this Christmas
job was vastly preferable to one she held earlier in the year,
bagging groceries for $6 an hour. ``It's fun when you can help
people,'' she said. ``It's like, `Cool! I can fix somebody's
problem!'''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary force is serving to double the size of the regular
play-counseling staff and is primarily charged with setup problems,
thus freeing the staff to deal with questions about the games
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The company is expecting about 500,000 ``customer contacts'' in
the week that began the day after Christmas, five times the usual
weekly volume, and the teen-agers are there to help insure that any
calls to Nintendo's toll-free help lines will be answered, and
quickly, by a real person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of this is Zelda-related,'' said Graham Crow, a company
spokesman, speaking of the company's new game, ``The Legend of
Zelda: Ocarina of Time.'' Introduced last month, Nintendo has
already sold 2.5 million copies, making it the fastest-selling
video game in history, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, good news for Nintendo, as is the continued
brisk sale of other favorites like ``Diddy Kong Racing,''
``Banjo-Kazooie,'' and ``Mario Kart 64.'' But it also means that
there are tens of thousands of parents out there who have bought
new sets for their young children, and many of these parents need
help.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In about 9 out of 10 cases, the setup problem can be quickly
diagnosed and fixed over the phone, said Patti Kelly, a training
supervisor. Alas, there are some cases where nothing seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, this is killing me,'' a caller who gave his name as Dan
confided to Daniel Wells, the play counselor from Bellevue. ``I've
tried it on every channel, 00 to 114, and nothing. Not even a
bleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The call stretched on for half an hour, but nothing seemed to
work; Daniel finally diagnosed a fault in the external device known
as an RF switch, which did not have an official Nintendo ``gold
seal'' stamped on it. The caller conceded he had bought it on the
cheap at a local appliance store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my son only one day every month,'' the elder Dan
confided to the younger Daniel. ``He's here right now and he can't
play the game. It's just killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Following company protocol, Daniel simply listened and said he
understood that Dan felt frustrated; it would have been a breach of
guidelines to suggest, say, that the man go outside and toss a ball
around with his son instead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for every failure, there were many cries of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, thank you! Thank you!'' the Colorado mother, whose name
was Karen, told Aaron Barton when he got the ``Twisted Edge''
virtual-snowboarding game to come to life on her new Nintendo set
as her two sons, 11 and 13, clapped in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' Aaron replied. ``Have a nice day and a happy New
Year!''
</P>
<P>
   After the call, Aaron pronounced his one-week assignment, the
only job he has ever held besides a newspaper route, to be
``totally awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I'm getting paid to do this,'' Aaron said.
``We get a free lunch, plus they have free arcade games whenever we
go on break.'' But what he really liked, he said, was the feeling
that all these people out there were turning to him for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I feel I'm really getting treated like an adult,'' Aaron
said. ``It's totally different from high school.''

FEW OF 1998'S BEST FILMS WERE BOX OFFICE SUCCESSES
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll remember 1998 as the year I spied a display box with rows
of what looked, from a distance, like identical videotapes with
black-and-flame-colored covers. But at close range it turned out to
hold two different titles packaged in suspiciously similar ways.
Each featured the oversize, noble heads of its actors against a
blazing backdrop. Each signaled a tale of something terribly
important at stake. Each beckoned with the portentous look of an
experience not to be missed, not even in 4-by-7-inch form.
</P>
<P>
   One was ``Gone With the Wind.'' The other was ``Armageddon,''
1998's most idiotic hit and biggest box office winner, and the
distance between such landmarks is shrinking all the time. For
audiences clobbered by indifferent star vehicles and formula films
(or both, in the case of ``Meet Joe Black''), this was a year with
almost no major movie events worth talking about _ though the
gratifying exception, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' tore up the studio
rule book and made viewers eager for an unfashionably wrenching
spectacle in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the mainstream came no closer than the overrated
``Truman Show'' to a thought-provoking popular success, though
``Shakespeare in Love'' looks like a high-end crowd-pleaser for the
winter season. But outside the realm of mall movies and out on the
margins, there was much to admire. Great films were few, but there
were more than enough good ones for anyone who knew where to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   If the bad news is that not many of the year's best films got
the attention they deserved on the first go-round, the good news is
that 4-by-7-inch second chance. Catch up with some of the titles to
follow and you'll find the other 1998, the darker, riskier film
year that outshone the dull high-profile one.
</P>
<P>
   The three D's of 1998 _ doppelgangers, dummies and death _ were
its most visible and bizarre trends. Do great minds merely think
alike, or is some subversive synergy leading to echolalia on the
creative front? Though each of these films had its own distinct
origins, we nonetheless saw double when it came to bugs (``Antz,''
``A Bug's Life''), battle (``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``The Thin Red
Line''), mortally ill mothers (``One True Thing'' ``Stepmom''),
meteors (``Deep Impact,'' ``Armageddon''), totalitarian
television-age fantasy (``The Truman Show,'' ``Pleasantville''),
deliciously sly gay gentlemen (John Hurt in ``Love and Death on
Long Island,'' Ian McKellen in ``Gods and Monsters'') and bleak,
wintry tales that cut to the bone (``Affliction'' ``A Simple
Plan'').
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Gleeson, one of the year's best actors along with Nick
Nolte, McKellen and Tom Hanks, even turned up twice as
larger-than-life Irish gangsters, in ``The General'' and ``I Went
Down.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the dummies, this year they got smart. ``There's
Something About Mary,'' the great guilty pleasure of 1998, was much
too amusingly contrived by the Farrelly brothers to qualify as mere
hair-gel humor, with Matt Dillon's dim detective cornering the
market on dopey wit. And after ``The Wedding Singer'' and ``The
Waterboy,'' Adam Sandler's single-digit-IQ bit will never look like
cinema verite again.
</P>
<P>
   Best and sneakiest of all was ``The Big Lebowski,'' the Coen
brothers' overlooked off-the-wall gem in which Jeff Bridges, in the
unlikeliest of the year's best acting performances, brought
hilarious panache to playing a blissfully out-to-lunch California
dude. Audiences who flocked to broad humor this year weren't
showing a strange taste for pie fights and bathroom gags. They were
simply going where the real fun was.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because 1998's most conspicuous Hollywood vogue
was for the sugarcoated demise, which cast its pall despite lunatic
efforts to give it a feel-good spin.
</P>
<P>
   Sentimental afterworld stories never go out of style, but what
this year offered wasn't the same old sexy-pottery scenario. Death
became a learning experience, a new phase of personal growth, a
post-human snowman, a black-tie fete, an occasion for special
crafts projects _ anything but a bummer, and when it was dealt with
painfully (``One True Thing'') it didn't fly. Buoyant denial
prevailed. It was it's-my-party-and-I'll-die-if-I-want-to time.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: 1998 was especially unhelpful to the makers of
10-best lists, since there were few towering works but an abundance
of very good ones. Beyond my particular Top 10 _ ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' ``Happiness,'' ``The Butcher Boy,'' ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' ``Henry Fool,'' ``The Celebration,'' ``A Simple Plan,''
``The Opposite of Sex,'' ``Bulworth'' and ``Western''_ there was
much more worthy of special notice.
</P>
<P>
   Among this season's films alone, I especially admired ``The
General,'' John Boorman's razor-sharp, beautifully shot portrait of
the wily Irish thief Martin Cahill, and Paul Schrader's bleak,
riveting ``Affliction,'' with Nick Nolte and James Coburn locked in
explosive father-son fury. The enrapturing beauty and peculiar
naivete of ``The Thin Red Line'' heightened the impression of
Terrence Malick as the Brian Wilson of the film world.
</P>
<P>
   Also outstanding: ``Central Station,'' with a great performance
from Fernanda Montenegro; and ``Hilary and Jackie,'' a deep,
psychologically rich portrait of the du Pre sisters as musical
prodigies and sibling rivals, with Emily Watson mesmerizing and raw
as the more flamboyant Jacqueline.
</P>
<P>
   Other actresses who did spellbinding work this year were Ally
Sheedy as a jaded recluse in ``High Art,'' Samantha Morton
immersing herself in the emotional turmoil of ``Under the Skin,''
Christina Ricci as the perfect foil in ``Buffalo 66'' and the teen
queen of comic malevolence in ``The Opposite of Sex,'' Joan Allen
shaking off 1950s propriety in ``Pleasantville,'' Thandie Newton
and Kimberly Elise in the intense sisterhood of ``Beloved,'' and
the ``One True Thing'' co-stars Meryl Streep and Renee Zellwegger
also doing fine work in other films (``Dancing at Lughnasa'' and
``A Price Above Rubies,'' respectively.) Dominique Swain hovered
startlingly between womanhood and childhood in Adrian Lyne's
impressive ``Lolita,'' which also offered a fine, harrowing
performance from Jeremy Irons. Tartly good Susan Sarandon shone
through the soap and baloney of ``Stepmom.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Benigni's Holocaust comedy, ``Life is Beautiful,''
remains the year's most stirring surprise. And the actors' festival
that is ``Hurlyburly'' was the high-water mark for movie
misanthropy, rampant this year in everything from the neo-Nazis of
``American History X'' (with Edward Norton electrifying despite the
film's deep flaws) to dark relationship dramas like ``Your Friends
and Neighbors.'' Sometimes misanthropic films, like ``Very Bad
Things'' were very bad indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Robert Towne's ``Without Limits,'' about the runner
Steve Prefontaine, was a haunting meditation on age and youth,
defeat and victory, with Donald Sutherland especially fine as a
thoughtful, seasoned coach. Spike Lee's ode to family ties and
basketball, ``He Got Game'' was pure, kinetic flash, with an
unexpectedly gritty Denzel Washington doing his best work as a
loser given a second chance. ``Gods and Monsters,'' conventionally
made but impressive in its ambitions, made a one-of-a-kind showcase
for McKellen as the veteran director of ``Frankenstein'' at the end
of his days, while Derek Jacobi scarily inhabited another
iconoclast, the painter Francis Bacon, in ``Love Is the Devil.''
When it came to spinning out of control, Ben Stiller's fine,
corrosive performance as a druggy Hollywood player in ``Permanent
Midnight'' took the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Soderbergh's ``Out of Sight,'' John Frankenheimer's
``Ronin'' and Robert Altman's ``Gingerbread Man'' were among the
year's most entertaining genre films. Vincent Gallo, Gary Oldman
and Darren Aronofsky made attention-getting debuts with ``Buffalo
66,'' ``Nil by Mouth'' and ``Pi,'' respectively. David Mamet's
``Spanish Prisoner'' matched ``The Truman Show'' in witty
gamesmanship and clever calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unreasonably overlooked were Jonathan Demme's
``Beloved,'' a richly enveloping film that fell victim to a
backfiring publicity blitz; ``Velvet Goldmine,'' underscoring Todd
Haynes' stature as one of the most daring of American filmmakers;
John Sayles' eloquent and profoundly decent ``Men With Guns,'' and
``The Real Blonde,'' another acid satire from Tom DiCillo, with his
``Living in Oblivion'' knives still sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Almodovar's ``Live Flesh'' was the brightest and steamiest
of foreign films, with ``Post Coitum,'' a French film of tortured
romance, another hot ticket. Two especially fine films from Iran
were ``Taste of Cherry,'' a small, perfect life-vs.-death parable
from Abbas Kiarostami, and ``The Mirror,'' a quiet little treasure
from the director of ``The White Balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Russian drama ``The Thief'' was a reminder of the
potboiler as universal genre. The genuinely shocking French
thriller ``See the Sea,'' by Francois Ozon, delivered the year's
most Hitchcockian chills, ``Psycho'' color clone notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Among documentaries, ``The Farm: Angola U.S.A.'' was the year's
most affecting by dint of its subject matter, as it observed black
prisoners hopelessly enmeshed in the prison system. And ``Arguing
the World'' offered a lively history of New York Jewish
intellectuals raised on socialism and debate.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no business like show business in the documentary
arena this year, with Barbara Kopple's ``Wild Man Blues,'' about
Woody Allen; ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' a vivid
biography; and best of all, D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus'
``Moon Over Broadway,'' a deft behind-the-scenes look at the
theater, with the fly-on-the-wall acuity Pennebaker once brought to
``Don't Look Back.'' Another documentary giant, Frederick Wiseman,
made the epic ``Public Housing,'' shown at the New York Film
Festival but not theatrically released.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ``Touch of Evil,'' there were two brilliant revivals that
outshone most of the year's new work. Krzysztof Kieslowski's
``Decalogue,'' 10 moral tales made for Polish television, remains a
little-seen classic deserving wider attention. And Fellini's
magnificent ``Nights of Cabiria'' remains as profound and thrilling
an experience as can be had from watching a movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   These are films that have already reached the 4-by-7-inch
format, but they are also the ones that fuel our faith in cinema's
power to endure. If you should mistake either of them for
``Armageddon,'' by all means get your money back.

`BLIND MAN'S BLUFF': SUBMARINERS AT THE HEIGHTS OF RISK, DEPTHS OF
COURAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.)  
 Jeff Stein is the author of ``A Murder in Wartime: The Untold Spy
Story that Changed the Course of the Vietnam War.''

 By JEFF STEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight months before the Watergate break-in in 1972, a Navy
submarine slipped inside Russian waters in the Far East and put a
wiretap on an undersea Soviet military telecommunications cable.
</P>
<P>
   Now this was a first-rate burglary. The podlike device enabled
the Navy to monitor Russian ballistic tests and track the
deployment of its Far Eastern fleet, not the least of which were
submarines carrying enough nuclear missiles to lay waste to the
United States. Even more important, perhaps, the taps gave
presidents from Richard Nixon to George Bush access to the minds of
Soviet war planners.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly needs saying that if Nixon had stuck to these kinds of
operations instead of trying to bug the Democrats, he might well
have retired with honors.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not. What if one of the submarines had been caught and
its crew and equipment captured, despite standing orders to blow
themselves up if cornered? The Pueblo, a surface spy ship, had been
taken by the North Koreans without a shot in 1968. What if, with
war still raging in Vietnam, a missile treaty with Moscow teetering
on failure, a secret opening to China still tender and Nixon on the
ropes with Watergate, Russian hardliners had decided to stage a
show trial of an American submarine crew?
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know what might have happened, of course, because
the spy mission was a brilliant tactical success, followed by a
second tap placed on an undersea Soviet cable in the Barents Sea
(as well as later taps on Libyan and one can only guess what other
cables to this day).
</P>
<P>
   No risk, no gain, as they say. Credit, or blame, can be laid at
the feet of a few imaginative Navy officers and Nixon
administration officials who approved the missions, but honors must
go to the steel-nerved captains and crews whose dangerous and
daring exploits are given an unparalleled and sometimes even
hair-raising rendition in ``Blind Man's Bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   After racing through 300 pages of close calls, nuclear reactor
disasters, torpedo-room fires and horrible deaths in the
bone-crunching depths of the unforgiving sea, one can only sit in
respectful awe of the men who went deep for months at a time, year
after year. This, really, is their story.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with the ill-fated voyage of the Cochino, an ``ugly
piece of junk,'' as described by Harris M. Austin, a communications
technician who boarded the World War II vintage sub in Londonderry,
Northern Ireland, for a maiden spy mission to the waters off the
Soviet port of Murmansk in July 1949. U.S. officials were anxious
to learn of Soviet rocket and especially nuclear developments. (The
Russians were only months away from exploding their first atomic
bomb.) Austin was the first of a long line of submarine-based
``spooks'' whose job was to lock on enemy communications and
analyze telemetry data from missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine skipper's job was to get him close enough to pick
up a clear signal, which required slipping into Soviet territorial
waters. Sometimes, in what can only be called a show of warrior
macho, captains went beyond the call of duty, in at least one case
sneaking within a stone's throw of a harbor dock. Imagine a Russian
periscope popping up off the Fulton Fish Market.
</P>
<P>
   Boys will be boys. In the Cochino's case the thrill of risk came
to a swift end when its batteries caught fire and exploded in the
storm-whipped Arctic off Norway. The boat had to be abandoned, but
not before several men died, including some from the Tusk, a
companion submarine that rushed to the rescue. The episode is told
in all its dramatic, horrid detail, including the death of some men
from ill-designed flotation boots that kept forcing their feet to
the surface and putting their heads underwater.
</P>
<P>
   The history of submarine espionage, in fact, is threaded with
mechanical failures, most disturbingly a propensity for torpedoes
to catch fire, which may have sunk the nuclear attack submarine
Scorpion with its crew in the Atlantic in May 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Some pity really should be reserved for Soviet crews, however,
who were presented with such slipshod nuclear engineering that
their assignments nearly amounted to sentences of death by
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a Russian military reporter, the authors _
Christopher Drew, who broke many of these stories as a Chicago
Tribune reporter before coming to The New York Times as a special
projects editor, and Sherry Sontag, a freelance writer _ give a
detailed account of the destruction of one Soviet submarine from a
nuclear disaster in the Pacific in 1968, a story told in bits and
pieces elsewhere before but never so movingly or completely as
here.
</P>
<P>
   The book's title, of course, is borrowed from the children's
game of group tag played with blindfolds. That is the bulk of the
story here, the drama of nuclear subs and crews shadowing each
other in a real-life ``Hunt for Red October.'' They sometimes
crashed into each other, with consequences far more lethal than
mere child's play.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the story will be old news to those who have followed
the periodic disclosures of submarine espionage since 1975, when
The Los Angeles Times uncovered Project Jennifer, the secret
operation to raise a sunken Soviet submarine from the floor of the
Pacific in 1968. Ivy Bells, code name for the Okhotsk wiretap, was
disclosed by The Washington Post in a highly self-censored story in
1985. By as it turns out, the Soviet Union was already wise to it,
having been tipped off by Ronald Pelton, its mole in the National
Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Barents Sea tap went undiscovered for years more, but the
infamous Walker family spy ring, which began its work in 1967 and
went undiscovered until 1985, may have given the Russians most of
what they needed to know about U.S. submarine movements and
capabilities at a fraction of the millions _ perhaps billions _
that the United States spent on high-tech undersea wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question: Was it worth it? Who knows? Espionage
histories have to be taken with a grain of salt, even one as
vividly told, impressively documented and persuasively argued as
this one. ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' one can be sure, is still being
played.

VOLVO STEPS UP TO LUXURY  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, JAN. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With its all-new S80, Volvo takes a step up in the
automotive class war, moving into the rich and competitive world of
high-end luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most car that Volvo has ever built: the biggest,
most luxurious, most refined and most stylish sedan that the
formerly staid Swede has yet to set forth. And being the longtime
leader in passenger protection, the S80 also is touted as the
safest.
</P>
<P>
   Competing heads up with the likes of Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and
BMW, the S80 brings to the table all the traditional virtues of a
prestige car, such as a quiet, compliant ride and a lush interior,
while retaining those things that serve to set Volvo apart, such as
advanced safety features and build quality.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the second time in recent memory that Volvo has
thrown us a curve. Just like the lovely C70 coupe or convertible,
the S80 is a beautiful car, not at all the boxy utility wagons that
we generally associate with Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a Volvo?'' was the most-often-heard remark when people
set eyes on the S80. Translation: Holy smokes, I didn't know Volvo
could make a car that looks so fine.
</P>
<P>
   Built on an all-new platform, the S80 replaces Volvo's midsize,
rear-wheel-drive 7-series cars, which evolved into the S90 sedan
and V90 wagon. The S80 joins its smaller stablemates as a
front-driver, completing Volvo's rapid transition from building
only rear-drive cars to building only front-drive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Although many reviewers are calling the S80 the best Volvo ever,
I believe the S80 has lost the character and road manners of the
Swede's other front-drive cars. It feels far too cushy and soft,
more like a large American family car than a taut European.
Compared with similar offerings from Mercedes, BMW, Saab and Audi,
the S80 is placid and flaccid.
</P>
<P>
   I love the feel of the smaller V70, sedan or wagon, with its
responsive steering and poised control. The S80 certainly seems
competent and road-worthy, but more along the lines of Lincoln or
Buick than what I've come to expect from Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Basically: comfortable, competent and dull.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless, the S80 is an excellent car that will run well and
last long, given Volvo's reputation. And its soft, quiet
performance should attract many luxury-car buyers who seek the
peace and comfort of a traditional up-market sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The S80s styling is distinctive, especially from the rear, where
aggressive compound curves on the upper edges blend into the
taillights. The overall look is faintly reminiscent of past Honda
Accords and Acura RLs, but bigger and better defined.
</P>
<P>
   The large interior also marks a departure for Volvo, with a
dashboard that's more smoothed out and up-to-date than previous
models. But it also comes across looking rather generic. If it
didn't say Volvo on the steering wheel, I just as well may have
been driving a Lexus or an Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   But the new dash is more organized and easy to use than past
Volvo dashboards. There are also a bunch of usable cubbyholes and
hideaways. The radio controls are kind of odd, especially how you
pick out preset stations with a single knob rather than push
buttons. And the climate-control system switches work well enough,
but the vent controls look really weird.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are wonderfully comfortable, even in terms of Volvo's
customarily excellent seats.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, you can be sure that Volvo went to great pains
to make sure its clientele stays well and alive in the event of a
crash. Safety features include a massive built-in safety cage
around the passenger compartment, seats with a whiplash protection
system, ``inflatable curtain'' air bags that protect the heads of
front-seat occupants in a side collision, upgraded side air bags
and seat-belt pre-tensioners.
</P>
<P>
   And to prevent a crash from happening, the S80 is equipped with
computerized traction control, an advanced anti-lock braking
system, stability control to fight skidding in curves, plus such
passive safety features as daytime running lights, optional
built-in child booster seats and optional reversing radar (so you
don't back over things, like kids).
</P>
<P>
   There's also a unique convenience feature, a remote-control
lighting system that turns on the car's headlights, taillights,
interior lights and a set of side lights that illuminate the ground
next to the car.
</P>
<P>
   There are two engine options with the S80, both
in-line-six-cylinder mills mounted transversely. I drove the
naturally aspirated 2.9 engine, which delivers a respectable 201
horsepower, but not until you reach a high 6,000 rpm. Though it
accelerates sedately from a stop, the S80 will pick up its skirts
and run once you get the engine up into its sweet zone.
</P>
<P>
   The other engine is a twin-turbocharged 2.8-liter in-line six,
which pumps out an impressive 268 horsepower, coupled with 280
pound-feet of torque commencing at a low 2,000 rpm. I think I might
have been more excited about the S80 if I had driven this turbo
version.
</P>
<P>
   A good-looking sedan with a cushy ride and a lush interior,
backed by Volvo's solid reputation for safety and reliability, is
nothing to scoff at. By all rights, Volvo should make a big dent in
this lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
   But I still prefer the tight handling and responsive behavior of
Volvo's smaller cars, which the S80 seems to have lost on its way
upmarket. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why do some dances wear their age better than others?
The program presented by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater on
Tuesday night at City Center did not answer that question, but two
pieces provided food for speculation.
</P>
<P>
   George Faison's ``Suite Otis,'' a 1971 tribute to the songwriter
Otis Redding, will probably look young as long as lovers squabble
and reconcile and as long as Redding's songs, so tantalizing in
their slow building and sudden rhythmic shifts, remain popular. Set
to six of the songs, ``Suite Otis'' is a series of sassily
flirtatious encounters for 11 men and women dressed predominantly
in hot pinks and reds and moving through a wash of warm pink light.
</P>
<P>
   The piece has grown more stylized and less earthy, particularly
in the women's dances. Bahiyah Sayyed best captures the lowdown,
sensual humor of Faison's choreography. Troy O'Neil Powell and Lisa
Johnson successfully merge the elegance and soaring flight of 1990s
dance with the funkiness of another era in fleeting, beautifully
performed duets. And have there ever been six such sexy men
(Powell, Bernard Gaddis, Jeffrey Gerodias, Glenn A. Sims, Kevin E.
Boseman and Vernard J. Gilmore) on a dance stage?
</P>
<P>
   What, for that matter, has happened to playful sexiness in
dance? The men's stage crosses, bodies taut but impelled by the
music's sinuous syncopations, got the audience cheering on Tuesday
as reliably as ever.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of flashy jazz dance for which the Ailey troupe
has sometimes been criticized. But what a joy it is to see
choreography and staging with Faison's shrewd sense of theatrical
timing and to see performing of such infectious delight. The cast
was completed by Renee Robinson, Krisha Marcano and Christina
Angela Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Time Before the Time After (After the Time Before),''
choreographed by Lar Lubovitch to music by Stravinsky, is only a
year older than the Faison piece. But for all its seriousness, this
duet for angry but clinging lovers looked like a dated exercise in
angst despite the clarity and emotional truth of the performance by
Linda-Denise Evans and Matthew Rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this piece, too, was greeted with cheers. Everything old is
new again.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included Geoffrey Holder's ``Prodigal Prince''
and Hans van Manen's ``Polish Pieces,'' a group work in which Ms.
Robinson stood out for the febrile physical intensity of her
dancing.

   &QL; 
PREZ-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - Arizona, the late Mo Udall used to say, is
the only state where mothers tell their children they can't grow up
to be president. Now two Arizonans, Sen. John McCain and Dan
Quayle, are about to test that maxim in a presidential race that
will put Arizona in that national spotlight and strain the
political loyalties of local Republican leaders. By PAT FLANNERY
and MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEWYEAR (Phoenix) - The week between Christmas and New Year's is,
for many office workers, the longest unofficial holiday. Not that
everyone stays home, mind you. It's just that office work slows
down and turns into extended lunches and staff parties: late to
work, early to leave _ long mysterious disappearances with hazy,
later explanations like: ``Hi.'' But while some have been savoring
the season and the business cease fire, the frenzied commercial
activity of 1998 has some pockets of resistance that have refused
to surrender. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A'' and
``F'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Well, what better way to end the year
than with a big bag full of hate? I guess a warm hug would be nice,
but I'll just buy my husband a six-pack of beer on New Year's Eve
and see what happens. In this Mail Bag, though, there's enough
poison for another Jonestown. We've got a seething mob _ an angry
pilot, a puppy-love activist and an encore appearance from the
Grammar Police. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WEIRD-FOOD (Phoenix) - As far as the food! section is concerned,
the frenzy in the food world proves that the end of the century is
already here. Millennium madness is only going to get worse in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   What possible reason could there be to explain the existence of
Turduckens, the Cajun stuffing of a duck inside a chicken inside a
turkey? The usual rationalization _ Cajuns are always over the top
in food inventiveness _ refuses to hold up here.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest trends at the end of the 20th century was
enriching foods with feel-good micronutrients. In October, Knight
Ridder Newspapers reported on the inventor of a new type of chips
that are supposed to help combat depression and improve memory.
They are made with herb and plant extracts such as St. John's wort,
gingko biloba and kava kava, along with essences of edible flowers
(violet, chamomile, peppermint and passionflower). By JUDY WALKER.
Story moved in the ``D'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - With its all-new S80, Volvo takes a step up
in the automotive class war, moving into the rich and competitive
world of high-end luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most car that Volvo has ever built: the biggest,
most luxurious, most refined and most stylish sedan that the
formerly staid Swede has yet to set forth. And being the longtime
leader in passenger protection, the S80 also is touted as the
safest. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early this year, Bonnie Black, a Hollywood talent
agent, got a call from a casting director who was working against a
deadline that even the toughest cinematic hero might have had
trouble beating. The casting director had less than 20 hours to
find an actor to play the role of an FBI agent on the television
series ``Players.''
</P>
<P>
   Such last-minute requests are common in Hollywood, where scripts
can change with a moment's notice and actors are sometimes
jettisoned just before filming begins. But technology helped solve
the problem handily: Ms. Black told the casting director to log on
to an online casting service, look up an actor's resume and
photograph, and download the actor's digital video clip to judge if
he was right for the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the video took the place of the audition,'' Ms.
Black said. ``The actor went straight to the producers and got
hired on the spot for a recurring role.'' (The series has since
been canceled.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that technology has transformed Hollywood's special effects,
it is beginning to have an effect on how actors are discovered.
These days, casting directors can go to electronic search services
to seek ``extremely attractive young ladies with good hair, good
teeth, good bodies,'' as one request put it, and to field
electronic resumes and photographs from talent agents who are
pushing their clients. They can also do keyword searches of
databases, looking, for example, for an Asian woman who is 5 foot 6
and 25 to 30 years old and can speak French.
</P>
<P>
   So far, these online services have had a modest impact on
Hollywood's traditional casting system. But many people in the
entertainment industry predict that electronic casting will become
dominant as younger, more computer-adept executives replace the
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The two major electronic casting services in Hollywood are
Castnet (www.castnet.com), owned by Entertainment Internet, and The
Link (www.submitlink.com), set up by the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences and Breakdown Services. Both online systems
provide similar services to clients but have subtle differences.
</P>
<P>
   They serve as a line of communication between casting directors
and talent agents, who for years have used messengers to send out
actors' portfolios and notices for acting jobs. With computers,
organizing an audition for an episode of ``Diagnosis Murder,'' for
instance, can be completed in minutes instead of hours or days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casting directors have never had a tool like this,'' said
Richard Horgan, the president of Castnet, which began in 1996.
``They can sit in an office with Oliver Stone and look up all of
the Caucasian males under 30 who have appeared in his movies. And
talent agents can submit hundreds of resumes and photos for a role
much faster and without wasting so much paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Link has access to about 38,000 actors. Their portfolios are
actually on The Link's sister service, the Academy Players
Directory On-Line. To get into the directory, actors must be a
member of a union and pay a $75 annual fee. Their photographs,
agents' names and phone numbers are also included in the hardcover
version of the directory, which, depending on whom you talk to in
the industry, is either the Hollywood bible or is used primarily as
a doorstop. The Link provides casting calls for nearly 500 acting
parts per week but does not transmit video or audio clips.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 actors have paid the $149.95 annual fee to get
their resumes and one photograph on Castnet (26,000 actors are
being listed by the service at no charge, on a trial basis).
Posting video clips, audio clips and additional photographs costs
extra. The actors also gain access to a chat room and audition
scripts. In addition, they can send casting directors electronic
postcards to tell them of their latest on-screen successes and can
solicit talent agents for representation without spending money on
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   One thing actors do not have access to is either service's list
of available roles, known in Hollywood as ``breakdowns.'' Only
talent agents can view those (Castnet generally posts a dozen or so
roles each day, and The Link six times that number). Most studios
limit access to such information because they do not want to be
besieged by aspiring actors.
</P>
<P>
   Security measures have been installed to keep out trespassers
and to protect child actors from pedophiles. For example, clients
usually get access to Castnet by dialing in to the service directly
and using a password, instead of going through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Taylor Jacobs, a talent agent in Burbank, Calif., was
scrolling through the breakdowns on Castnet, as he does several
times a day, when he came across a notice for a black actor, 40 to
50 years old, to play a ``smart, quick-witted'' political adviser
``with lots of energy'' on the PBS television series ``On Common
Ground'' at a pay rate of $200 to $375 per day. He went to the
bottom of his computer screen where his clients were listed and
clicked on one of the names. Within a few seconds, he had submitted
the name electronically, with a resume and photograph, to the
show's casting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors who are submitted have a two- to four-hour advantage
over those who are sent by hard copy,'' Jacobs said. ``That can be
incredibly advantageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting directors can log on to their computers to look at the
dozens and sometimes hundreds of files that are sent to them for
each open acting role. And they can arrange auditions by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've logged in while in Hawaii and Belize,'' said Billy Da
Mota, a casting director who specializes in commercials. ``The
point is that I don't miss a job. I can be on vacation and log in
on my computer from wherever I can plug in my laptop.''

MAILBAG: SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED _ WITH A KICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Well, what better way to end the year than with a big
bag full of hate? I guess a warm hug would be nice, but I'll just
buy my husband a six-pack of beer on New Year's Eve and see what
happens. In this Mail Bag, though, there's enough poison for
another Jonestown. We've got a seething mob _ an angry pilot, a
puppy-love activist and an encore appearance from the Grammar
Police.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the people who have taken the time this year to write
nice letters, I issue a hearty thank you, and wish everyone a happy
and safe new year. And, as always, thanks for reading.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Laurie:
</P>
<P>
   Your article (Nov. 19) was so untasteful and downright rude to
humans and animals alike. Puppies are wonderful, if you know how to
handle and raise them. Unfortunately, many people like you are too
passive to take control of the situation. Like children, puppies
must know who is in command! I have nurtured in my past four
puppies, two of them at the same time. It was a wonderful
experience for us! They are like human babies; they need a little
love, a little milk, and need to be comforted back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   I assume you never had children _ I hope! Babies and puppies are
alike. I pray you didn't just have a baby one day and throw a box
and blanket in the corner for them to fend for themselves. Our
puppies all were a joy to see frolic and play. They were a joy when
they showed ``puppy affection'' by their little nips on our feet.
Most of all, I fondly remember, is the amazement I saw as they
discovered life. That included rummaging through the hamper or the
smelling of a flower for the first time in our garden. My
suggestion is, Laurie, try living life a little more spontaneously.
Let nature run its course and leave all the poop in the box!
</P>
<P>
   - AZJem1
</P>
<P>
   Dear AZJem1: I have also raised four puppies, and I've never
seen one with _ shall we say _ so much ``spunk'' as our new little
baby. On your advice, my husband took the puppy all around our back
yard, showing her the flowers, letting her smell them. We got
SPONTANEOUS!! I wept as she expressed her ``puppy affection'' when,
15 minutes later, she arrived at my feet with a large chunk of my
healthiest tomato plant in her mouth, and then went on to destroy
every living thing in my garden! The dickens! My husband and I
laughed, gave her some milk, and then rocked her gently to sleep,
just like you said. We also let her rummage through the hamper,
where she discovered life and then peed and made a doody on my
favorite velvet skirt. We're still laughing about that! And yes,
I've completely given up placing cat turds in her food bowl and
have set those limitations, telling her, ``I am in COMMAND! If you
want some poop, get it yourself!'' Thanks so much for the wonderful
advice!
</P>
<P>
   Dear Laurie:
</P>
<P>
   I think it's kind of sad that you felt you had to ridicule me in
your column (Nov. 5). The first meaning of the word ``cute'' in MY
dictionary says CLEVER. Recently you wrote ``you have another thing
coming.'' It's ``you have another think coming.'' I was just trying
to point out that you might want someone to look over your writing
so you don't come across sounding like you have no education.
Instead of finding fault with me, maybe you should take some
well-meant advice. I give up. You win. I'm just some nut and you
should be proud of your ignorance and low standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unsigned, Scottsdale
</P>
<P>
   Dear Unsigned: Here's the good news: I know that, this time,
you're not Mrs. Gaio, my ninth-grade English teacher and past
president of the Arizona English Teachers Association. She wrote to
me after she saw the last Mail Bag and said, ``There's no such
thing as perfect grammar, except in a dead language like Latin.''
So thank you, Unsigned from Scottsdale, for our teacher-student
reunion. It was really wonderful. Can I say something else?
Honestly, it's not ``you have another think coming,'' unless you're
watching reruns of ``Hogan's Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Laurie:
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that I've bothered to read the ``Rep''
(Dec. 3), and having read Laurie ``Sour Grapes'' Notare (sic), I
doubt that I will ever look at it again.
</P>
<P>
   As an employee of the airlines for 34 years, my feeling is that
this writer has a fear of flying and takes it out on the airlines.
She takes a Peaunut (sic) flight and wants steak and lobster? She
should fly first class. If making a reservation is important, she
should have picked an airline that offers that service for more
money. She seems to have picked a discount airline and expect (sic)
first-class service. It don't (sic) work that way. It's like
picking a self-serve gas station and complain (sic) about the poor
attendant service. O poor me.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see it being the airlines (sic) fault that other
passengers use her space and talk to her. Hanging her head over
into the aisle and not looking out to get bumped makes as much
sense as taking a nap in the middle of the street. Hello?
</P>
<P>
   I could go on and chip at every word she wrote but will end with
one comment. Take the bus. It's even cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   _ JFM, retired pilot
</P>
<P>
   Dear JFM: Now, now, now, don't stop reading the ``Rep'' just
because you didn't like my column. That's throwing the baby out
with the bathwater. And really, even though I would fully admit I
took a ``peanut'' flight, I didn't expect lobster and steak and
first-class service. All I really wanted was some PEANUTS. I'm
poor, and I know I don't deserve to be treated with the same
respect and dignity as a wealthy person. Who do I think I am?! And
I suppose it really isn't the airlines' fault that the only people
who can fit comfortably in their seats are infants and Calvin Klein
models. I'll make sure next time to request a seat next to either
one of those when making my reservation, and this way I can eat
their peanuts, too.
</P>
<P>
   I could chip away at every word you wrote, but will end with one
comment: I'm not a retired airline pilot who can fly the cranky
skies for free. &QL;

 LOS ANGELES: my laptop.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often, talent agents encourage actors to post their portfolios
on one of the major online services to improve their chances of
being selected for an audition and to make it more convenient for
the agent. Joan Messinger, a talent agent in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
pointed to the hundreds of files on actors in her office and said
emphatically, ``If I can get away from not going to that shelf and
pulling a picture, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But online casting has yet to significantly reduce the amount of
paper changing hands. After submitting actors' portfolios online,
many talent agents also send out hard copy, too, just to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Castnet is free for the 130 talent agents and 240 casting
directors who have access. Some use the service as much as
possible, others only occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 39 percent of Hollywood's agents and casting directors
use online casting services to send or receive actors' photos,
according to a survey of 120 people published in November by Back
Stage West/Drama-logue, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   The movie industry has been especially resistant to online
casting. Filmmakers are generally less rushed than their television
counterparts and would probably have little chance of landing a
star like Bruce Willis from an electronic posting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rob Ash, an actor from Sherman Oaks, Calif., who is
a member of Castnet, has only modest expectations. He said
electronic casting still needed to gain acceptance in the film and
television industry before it would have much effect on his career,
which has been fairly limited partly because he is 6 foot 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said he had found an agent through Castnet after submitting
an electronic resume. He also landed an interview on the dating
show ``Change of Heart'' after seeing a talent search posted on
Castnet's actors' forum, where small productions often post casting
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not foolish enough to think that I can get lots of
auditions from this,'' Ash said. ``But it's great in an emergency
situation. If an actor slips and breaks a leg, it's easy for
casting directors to sign on and find a replacement fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For some actors, paying to get online may be more of a waste of
money than a smart career move, said Sheila Manning, a casting
director in Los Angeles. She said actors living outside the major
entertainment centers had little chance of success online,
especially for commercials, which are sometimes cast in a matter of
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, I'm not going to call someone from Norman, Okla.,
because I have to see them the next day for an audition,'' Ms.
Manning said. And online video clips are often not useful, she
said, because they take too long to download and are too small on a
computer screen to be of much use in judging whether an actor is
right for a role.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, online casting can help only up to a point. While
technology may help actors get auditions, they must, in the end, be
able to impress producers in person, at auditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When choosing actors for audition, they are just buying an
image: `I need a balding guy,' '' said Gary Bolen, an actor from
Valencia, Calif., a Castnet member who regularly works on
commercials and soap operas. ``Once you're there, you have to
deliver.''

   At 110, the Eiffel Tower drew 6 million visitors this year,
beating its previous record of 5.747 million, set in 1992, and
renewing its claim to being the world's most popular monument. The
company that manages the 1,052-foot tower, built by Gustave Eiffel
for the Universal Exhibition of 1889, says &UR;  &LR; it draws twice as many
visitors as the Louvre and outdraws the Empire State Building,
which attracted 3.6 million visitors in 1997.

 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For U.S. art museums, 1998 was a memorable year &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Along with their many standout exhibitions and acquisitions,
record-breaking crowds and ambitious expansion plans, museums also
had to contend with criticism about their collecting policies.
Institutions in Seattle, Chicago, New York and elsewhere faced
claims to holdings that had been looted from archeological sites,
stolen by the Nazis or taken from American Indians &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being guardians of civilization, museums were
suddenly accused of being as crassly acquisitive as instant
millionaires let loose on Rodeo Drive.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent example, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
was criticized for acquiring dozens of antiquities that,
circumstantially at least, appear to have been illegally excavated
in southern Italy and smuggled out of the country. Of 71 pieces
bought by or given to the museum between 1984 and '87 (after the
museum pledged to observe international codes to staunch the
illegal antiquities trade), 61 had no ownership history, according
to an investigation by The Boston Globe. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Experts consider the lack of provenance a telltale sign that
the works were probably plundered.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston museum, already under attack for owning Mayan
artifacts that may have been looted from Guatemala, issued a brief
response saying that it ``exercises appropriate diligence in the
acquisition of works of art for its collection.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  But Alan Shestack, the museum's director from 1987 to 1994,
conceded that the museum was ``not as rigorous'' as it might have
been in insuring that the objects had not been stolen.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; S &LR; everal experts agreed that most museums traditionally have
made few if any inquiries about provenance if they really wanted an
object.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions being raised about Boston could be raised about
many other museums,'' said Martin E. Sullivan, the chairman of the
President's Cultural Property Advisory Council and the director of
the Heard Museum in Phoenix. ``These are legitimate questions.''  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In its two-paragraph statement, the Boston museum tacitly
acknowledged as much, even as it indicated that it would keep the
works in question. ``Over the years, laws and standards regarding
the acquisition of works of art have changed,'' it stated. Its
practices, the statement added, ``have changed accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Change did not come without a push, however, largely from claims
made over the last few years by Guatemala, Turkey, Italy, American
Indian groups and families whose property was confiscated during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great deal of sensitizing about these issues,''
said Ned Rifkin, the director of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta,
``and all of us are exercising a great deal more thoroughness in
checking provenance now.''
</P>
<P>
   But if museum directors agree that the rules have changed for
future acquisitions, they are not in complete harmony about what to
do about the past. In June, members of the Association of Art
Museum Directors pledged to take a prompt, detailed look at the
provenance of all works their institutions have acquired since
Hitler came to power. That research is in full swing. And, though
only one claim has been resolved so far, if looted works are
identified, some sort of return or payment is expected to be made
on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Claims by American Indians got a boost in 1990 with passage of a
law requiring federally financed institutions to conduct
inventories of their holdings and return certain items. Some
objects have gone back, though some critics complain that lack of
money and bureaucracy have slowed repatriation. Others contend that
tribal disagreements are hampering the process, too.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the problems with classical and pre-Columbian
antiquities is proving to be stickier, partly because people fear
where it will end, provided it even does end. Greece's longstanding
demand for the return of the Elgin marbles from London and Turkey's
for the Pergamon Altar in Berlin get mixed in with Guatemala's and
Italy's desire to halt the theft of objects that easily make their
way onto the international market, no questions asked. But as long
as provenance is not an issue, trade in newly excavated objects
will continue, encouraging continued desecration of ancient sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are drawing a distinction between old disputes and
current ones. At a recent conference on art, antiquities and the
law at Rutgers University, participants pledged to adhere to an
international code of ethics requiring museums, dealers and
collectors to inquire about an object's origins and ownership
history to make sure a purchase would be legal. Nations rich in
antiquities were urged to stop lending to museums that continue to
acquire looted artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   While many skeptics think this is all talk, Sullivan, for one,
is convinced that the issue is not going to be dismissed so easily.
He cited the Denver Art Museum, which in October returned a carved
wooden lintel to Guatemala after being informed that it had been
stolen from a Mayan temple in the 1960s. The lintel had been given
to the museum in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this issue will snowball over the next few years,''
Sullivan said. ``Public attention has been called to this issue,
and a lot of foreign countries are aware of property in museums
that should not be there. The road through the courts is long, but
the road through the media and public opinion has created a lot of
sympathy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen K. Urice, an official at the Pew Charitable Trusts and a
lawyer steeped in these matters, said directors and curators
finally &UR;  &LR; had gotten the message about works lacking pristine
provenances. ``Where it really has to be driven home is in the
minds of trustees,'' he said, pointing out that they have fiduciary
responsibility for a museum's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees, he said, have to act as a check on directors and
curators who want to acquire a questionable object. They have to
decide whether a museum has the legal obligation to return a
claimed object and, if not, whether it is in the public's best
interest to return it. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Otherwise, it can be interpreted as taking charitable funds
and letting them revert to a private individual,'' as in the case
of a Holocaust-era claim, he said. With a foreign country as the
claimant, the decision would be much easier because an object would
presumably remain in the public domain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Urice nor Sullivan are downbeat about prospects for
losing artistic treasures in collections in the United States.
``Most of our museum collections are stable and will not be
disturbed, though in some areas museums will have to respond,''
Urice predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said: ``Not everyone would agree with me, but I think
it's a good time for museums. If we want to maintain our status, we
will be held to higher standards.''
</P>
<P>
   When people walk through museum galleries, their words imply,
they should be free to dwell on the objects, not on how they got
there.

 &HT;        NO PA OFFICERS DIED ON THE JOB IN 1998, LOCAL COPS CITE
BETTER EQUIPMENT, TRAINING   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30, -- No Pennsylvania law enforcement officers
died in the line of duty so far in 1998, which would be a first in
the 30 years since a national organization began tracking police
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   While some states reported as many as 20 officer deaths,
Pennsylvania was one of 11 states to report zero officer deaths,
reflecting a nationwide drop in police killings, according to data
recently released by the National Association of Chiefs of Police.
</P>
<P>
   But NACOP officials said the Keystone state's clean record this
year surprised and impressed them. Officials said other states
reporting zero deaths, including Hawaii, North Dakota and South
Dakota, have small populations and don't have as many urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a big state like Pennsylvania, which has major cities and
rural areas, to have no officers die in the line of duty is
something of an anomaly,'' said Paul Abbott, a spokesman for NACOP.
``It's terrific. Maybe it means the streets are safer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 148 officer deaths in the nation, down from
160 in 1997, according to NACOP, which looked at reports from
nearly 21,000 law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths all occurred in the line of duty, ranging from
shootings to car crashes during high-speed chases.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pennsylvania had two officers who died in the line of
duty, and seven in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials thanked everything from luck to better training
and equipment for the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstown Police Capt. Craig Foust said he even sees a shift in
attitude toward promoting self-preservation. He said the officers
are still heroes - just safe heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an officer decides to stop a high speed chase because he
feels he is in danger, he knows he will face no problem from the
department,'' Foust said. ``Not that he would have before, but I
think we do a better job now of getting that attitude across to
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Johnstown police department required its
officers to wear bullet-proof vests, Foust said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Dennis Hunsicker, of Philadelphia,
said officers still face violence on the streets, but there are
more internal policies to provide oversight.
</P>
<P>
   He said before a state trooper can start a car-chase, he must
get clearance from a supervisor, who monitors road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He also said newer bullet-proof vests are more comfortable, so
officers are more apt to wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been three generations of vests in the last 15
years,'' Hunsicker said. ``Safety equipment is evolving and so is
our attitude about safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Richland Township police Sgt. Richard Lefchick said he
thought the good news might be no more than good luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe God's on our side,'' Lefchick said. ``There's no easy
answer to why we had good luck. There are officers in this state in
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that face different problems than we
do. We all made it through.''

SENATE HOPES FOR CALMNESS DURING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The strangers met on a sidewalk in Montpelier, in
an encounter that said as much about public expectations for a
Senate impeachment trial as it did about the intimacy of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat,'' one man called to the other, as he emerged from his
car. ``I'm glad the grownups are finally taking over.''
</P>
<P>
   To Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat, the remark was a
welcome show of support for his efforts to end the Senate
proceedings swiftly. But it was also a formidable reminder, he
said, of what the public expects of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his swaggering colleagues in the House _ whose
outbursts over impeachment locked the chamber in a bitter partisan
dispute _ Leahy is a member of the ``grownup'' body of Congress
that will decide whether to convict President Clinton and remove
him from office. He has an awesome constitutional responsibility.
He is, in short, expected to behave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, I think the senators understand they have a
pretty strong assignment placed before them _ to be deliberative,
careful and cautious,'' said Richard A. Baker, the historian of the
Senate. ``It is built into the Constitution. They are supposed to
be above the fray.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether they will be, while managing the Senate's gravest
task of this century, is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their elevated status, senators have at times given way
to fractious argument over the last decade _ falling short of the
``temperate and respectable body of citizens'' called for by James
Madison in the Federalist Papers some 200 years ago. And debates
with a sexual strand seem to have provoked them the most.
</P>
<P>
   From the confirmation hearing of John Tower for defense
secretary in 1989, which crumbled when problems with alcohol and
sex were introduced, to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas amid allegations of sexual harassment, the Senate
harbors an undercurrent of partisan hostility that may yet surface
in the presidential impeachment trial _ despite promises on both
sides to keep manners at their best.
</P>
<P>
   Few have forgotten the vitriolic attacks of the Tower hearings,
in which Senator Sam Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia, deplored the
nominee's ``clear abuse of alcohol.'' In the Thomas hearings two
years later, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah made
insinuations about Anita Hill in an equally angry tone, accusing
her of lifting an incident straight from the book ``The Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly have been cases where the Senate has not acted
as we would have hoped,'' said Senator Susan M. Collins, a
Republican from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, she added: ``The Senate has a long tradition of
civility and bipartisanship. I think all of us were alarmed by the
excessive rhetoric that characterized the House debate. And all of
us are determined to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the course of normal legislating, the Senate does act
like the mature force it was designed to be, staffers and observers
said. At times, in fact, it acts so deliberately that work grinds
to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The pace and tone of the Senate reflect some built-in safety
nets: Senators are older, required by law to be at least 30 years
old, instead of 25 years old in the House. With terms of six years
instead of two, senators are more insulated from day-to-day
politicking. And because of the relatively close quarters of the
Senate, as well as a provision that allows a single senator to hold
up the entire chamber at will, members tend to respect the golden
rule _ treating each other as they want to be treated themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an entirely different tradition,'' said Christopher H.
Foreman, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ``It is a
far smaller body. The senators have more intimacy with each other
than House members do. ... The bottom line is, Clinton will be
treated better and the process will be a far more sedate process.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, that much has seemed true. Language has been tempered.
Talk show appearances have contained few barbs. Phone
conversations, according to both Democratic and Republican
senators, have been civil, partly in reaction to the acrimony
witnessed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see Democrats and Republicans reaching out to find
some sort of solution,'' Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle
of South Dakota said in a television interview this week. ``I think
you will see a totally different environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy agreed: ``If you want any credibility in impeachment, it
has to be bipartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, several staffers said, a number of senators have
spent the holidays contemplating the beginning stages of the trial,
discussing the possibility of censuring Clinton rather than
removing him from office, and dusting off their history books to
see whether a trial must begin at all. Leahy said he had spoken to
several other members over the last week; Collins said her
conversations have included at least one Democrat, as well as a
half-dozen Republican in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be a greater calm, and a sense of `Let's
try to resolve this as it should be resolved, not as historical
forces seem to be pushing us, as seemed to be the case over in the
House,' '' said Eric Federing, a spokesman for Senator Joseph
Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut. ``The holidays have also
helped produce a very firm two weeks of time out for everybody to
catch their breath, so nobody is rushing pell-mell into any
action.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, because the Senate has not convened, the spirit of
cooperation is still more a blueprint or fond hope than a fact.
Already, members can look forward to the arrival of one fierce
Clinton critic in their midst: Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, will play the role of prosecutor during a
trial, along with other Republican members of the committee that
brought the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   There has already been at least one intra-party skirmish. Soon
after the House voted for impeachment, the White House irritated
Senator Robert C. Byrd, a Democrat of West Virginia, with Vice
President Al Gore's comments that he might play a role in the
proceedings. The idea was quickly dropped, but according to
staffers on both sides, far worse conflict with the White House is
still a definite possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the White House response,'' said Collins.

MOTHER OF OCTUPLETS SAYS SHE HAS NO REGRETS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The 27-year-old woman who gave birth to octuplets this
month said Wednesday that she was not the least bit upset when
doctors told her she was to have so many babies. Quite the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so thankful to God because it is what I had prayed
for,'' the woman, Nkem Chukwu, said as she was about to be released
from St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. ``I was so excited. I wanted to
have as many babies as God would give me.''
</P>
<P>
   The giving began on Dec. 8, when Ms. Chukwu, a Nigerian-born
U.S. citizen, gave birth to her first daughter, Ebuku, and
continued Dec. 20 with the births of two sons and five more
daughters. The smallest of the babies, Odera, just 10.3 ounces at
birth, died of heart and lung failure on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before she returned to her home in Houston, Ms. Chukwu
had her first public appearance at the adjacent Texas Children's
Hospital, where the surviving seven babies remain listed in
critical, but stable, condition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same news conference, doctors said the babies continued
to do well and were now expected not only to survive but also to be
at home with their parents within three months, around the time of
Ms. Chukwu's original due date. There were still dangers, the
doctors warned, and reverses were possible.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the infants, Ebuku, Gorom and Ikem, remain on a
ventilator, doctors said, but the remaining four, Echerem, Chidi,
Chima and Jioke, are breathing on their own and two took their
first feedings of their mother's breast milk on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The most important issue over the coming weeks and months will
be getting all the babies off the ventilator and taking their
mother's milk, probably with the help of a breast pump, said Dr.
Patti Savrick, the babies' chief pediatrician. An important
milestone was reached on Tuesday, when pediatricians examined all
seven infants and found that none were suffering from cranial
bleeding, a common condition among premature infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling better and better about the babies as time goes
on,'' Savrick said. ``Right now, I think, we're going to discharge
seven pretty good babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a wheelchair between her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, a
respiratory therapist, and her mother, Janet Chukwu, a weary Ms.
Chukwu insisted that everyone in the room stand for a prayer before
the news conference could begin and repeatedly said that it was her
faith in the Bible and her trust in God that brought her through
the long, difficult pregnancy. ``It wasn't easy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the Chukwu octuplets, as well as other recent
multiple births, has revived ethical concerns among many doctors
over the proper use of the advanced fertility drugs used by Ms.
Chukwu and others, especially since so many of the offspring of
multiple-births do not survive or suffer lifelong health problems.
</P>
<P>
   One technique promoted by many doctors is called ``selective
reduction,'' in which some of the embryos in a mother's womb are
injected to stop them from growing, allowing the remaining embryos
a better chance of survival and good health.
</P>
<P>
   This option was offered to Ms. Chukwu, when doctors initially
thought she was carrying six or perhaps seven embryos, but she
rejected it and insisted on carrying all of her babies as long as
she could. Wednesday, she said she did not regret that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not find such words in my Bible, so I rejected it,''
she said. ``I told them I wasn't going to do it. I wasn't even
going to give it a thought, not a second thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Kirshon, her doctor, said that he had advised Ms.
Chukwu to take it easy when she returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have advised slow integration back into normal life,''
Kirshon said. ``She's going to have to slowly walk greater
distances, obviously no heavy lifting, limited activity. Each day
she will be able to do a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis said the family had been talking to several prospective
agents since the births, but had not yet decided which to hire.
Only then, though, will the family decide on whether the babies
will take part in television programs or commercial ventures, he
said. No photographs or videotapes of them have, as yet, been
released by the family.

<P>
   For altogether different reasons, Mike Peplinski would agree
with a weekly magazine that recently acclaimed 1998 as the greatest
sports year of the century. In terms of personal achievement, he
made it all the way from Eau Claire, Wis., to the Winter Olympics.
And in a show of transcendent sacrifice for the sake of the team,
his father-in-law furnished something worth more than any color
medal, or big-money contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brendel gave Mike Peplinski a kidney, and presented his
4-year-old grandson a healthy father for 1999, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a unique bond now,'' Peplinski said Wednesday on
the telephone. ``That kind of giving in a time of need creates a
connection that lasts forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a single year, we come across so many people
in sports who cast themselves among the needy that the games are
often footnotes to the cries for help that run like a newsreel,
across the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner said he needs New York to give him
Manhattan. Bernie Williams needed Steinbrenner to give him $88
million. The basketball owners need cost certainty, and the stars
need to make $100 million. Cablevision needs for Steinbrenner to
sell to further monopolize the New York television market. Rupert
Murdoch continued to need to own everything. Mark McGwire and who
knows how many others needed little chemical helpers. Mike Tyson
and too many other graduates of the criminal justice system needed
more chances.
</P>
<P>
   On and on marched the needy, across the zipper-like headlines,
right to the end of the year, with the none-too-startling
revelations that international Olympic bureaucrats needed
financial-aid packages from bidding cities in return for their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of purity, the Olympics became another sports money
grab a long time ago, but beyond the fat cats and the egocentric
stars are people like Mike Peplinski, a 25-year-old middle-school
geography teacher who didn't need endorsement riches to get him on
the plane with the U.S. men's curling team to Nagano, Japan. Just
the consent of his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last winter, Peplinski's kidneys were under attack,
and no one could tell him why. All the doctors could recommend was
a transplant, and soon. Knowing his mother was prepared to be the
donor, Peplinski asked that the surgery be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What for?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   When he said he wanted to compete in the Olympics, the doctor
replied, ``In what?''
</P>
<P>
   No one would mistake curling for cross-country skiing, but that
wasn't the point. Peplinski had grown up with curling, a
complicated version of shuffleboard on ice, which had finally
achieved medal-sport status. Now he had made the team, and he
wanted to march into the stadium, and come home to say he not only
competed at the Olympics but lived it, as well.
</P>
<P>
   We met one afternoon at a Japanese middle school, where he and a
few other United States athletes were treated by the kids in the
navy blue uniforms like the royalty of sport. We talked afterward
about the American hockey players who had trashed their village
rooms, and Peplinski said he had just had the time of his life and
that he felt sorry for those too spoiled to appreciate what they
had. Then he returned to Eau Claire, and I went off to cover more
famous people, from Chamique Holdsclaw to Michael Jordan, El Duque
Hernandez to Bill Parcells. But as I reread the year's clips in
preparing a highlights column, I stopped at the one about the
Japanese school, and found myself calling the U.S. Curling
Association for Peplinski's number in Eau Claire.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, it turned out, had discovered her own kidney problem
after undergoing the blood tests required of a donor, and so the
search for a new one began. Peplinski's wife, Michelle, volunteered
but the couple agreed it would be too great a strain on 4-year-old
Jaren. The months passed. Peplinski was growing weaker, losing
weight. His kidneys, operating at 14 percent efficiency, were near
the dialysis stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the weeks after the Olympics, the situation changed,'' said
Brendel, the father-in-law, from his home in La Crosse. ``It was
going downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old college teacher, healthy and compatible,
considered major surgery, and anesthesia, the things that could go
wrong, not to mention life with one kidney. Then he thought about
Peplinski, his daughter, his grandson. There was only one choice to
make.
</P>
<P>
   A connection was made. A kidney was given. The successful
surgery last June is not a big enough result for the
end-of-the-year newsreel, but a fine contextual footnote to the
definition of need. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ China said Wednesday that it achieved economic growth
of 7.8 percent for 1998, essentially meeting the 8 percent goal set
by political leaders at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of ``an extremely complicated international economic
situation,'' the growth in gross domestic product this year was
only 1 percent lower than the 1997 figure of 8.8 percent, a
spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said at a news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia were among the other Asian countries
that experienced negative growth over the year, cutting into
China's trade and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment already rising as it prunes inefficient state
industries, China was determined to prop up faltering economic
growth, and in the second half of the year it started a major
stimulus program of extra government spending and bank lending.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists have been skeptical of the growth target,
arguing that once top leaders set the 8 percent goal, local
officials around the country would make sure it was met on paper. A
Western diplomat said recently that, based on other indicators such
as the slow growth in electricity use and declining retail prices,
growth for the year was more likely to have been about 4 percent to
5 percent _ still an achievement compared with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the statistical bureau spokesman, Ye Zhen, insisted that the
figures were credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not rule out that in compiling data in certain regions,
some figures were padded,'' Ye said. ``But I can responsibly tell
everyone that the national figures were compiled after serious
checks.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hit by the economic woes of Asian trading partners, China's
formerly zooming exports leveled out this year, at about $182
billion, Ye said. But imports declined by 3.8 percent, to $137
billion, so the country had a larger trade surplus than ever of $45
billion.
</P>
<P>
   China's large and growing trade surplus with the United States
has become a major point of contention between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a worrisome indicator of low consumer spending power, the
retail price index for 1998 fell by 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, China's leaders pledged that they would not
devalue of their currency to stimulate exports and growth. China
has been praised by the United States and Asian countries for
maintaining the value of the yuan, preventing a competitive
devaluing among ailing neighbors, although some economists said
that China would have gained little from devaluation in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Ye repeated the pledge Wednesday, saying, ``China has no need to
devalue the yuan next year.''
</P>
<P>
   If the preliminary estimated growth rate for 1998 is valid, it
means that the economy climbed steeply during the final three
months of the year, probably reflecting the stimulus program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accelerated investment has been a major factor spurring
economic expansion,'' Ye said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the induced spending will exact a future toll
because much of it was probably wasteful _ including the buildup of
inventories that will never be sold, and investments in doomed,
money-losing state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Because banks were pressured to lend huge sums quickly, in most
cases to state-owned enterprises, the stimulus program also
undercut the goals of revamping and cutting back state industries
and improving the solvency of national banks. These banks already
had to cope with large nonpaying loans to failing state companies.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials argue that they had to act on an
emergency basis to prevent growth from collapsing. Without strong
growth to create new jobs, they say, the restructuring of state
enterprises _ which remains a prime goal _ could never proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists expect China's growth next year may be slightly
below this year's.
</P>
<P>
   Mao Yushi, an economist with the Unirule Institute of Economics,
a private research group in Beijing, said he estimated 1999 growth
at about 7 percent. But he warned against setting another national
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the central government sets a target,'' he said, ``then
local governments try their best to fulfill it, sometimes using
false figures, or spending that brings no real improvement in the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, Ye acknowledged the serious
problems facing state-owned industries, calling their finances
``not encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must make efforts next year to further economic reform,
expand domestic demand, and stabilize and strengthen agriculture,''
he said, as well as to ``expand exports and guard against financial
risk.''

CRIME FIGURE'S NEW IMAGE: AFFABLE, YOUNGER LOOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After talking to people who have seen James J.
``Whitey'' Bulger in the past few years, the FBI has released a
photograph of what appears to be an affable, younger-looking
Bulger, to replace the familiar mugshot of a scowling bespectacled
sexagenarian.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Ginieres, spokesman for the FBI's Boston office, agreed
that the picture appears to depict a man in his 30s, ``but that's
what people who've seem him lately tell us he looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginieres said authorities do not know when the photo of the
fugitive South Boston gangster was taken.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has made a new effort to find Bulger, who disappeared
the day before he was indicted on racketeering charges on Jan. 10,
1995. The bureau has had reports of sightings in Oklahoma, Wyoming,
New York, and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bulger's indictment and the subsequent arrest of associate
Stephen Flemmi, federal court proceedings have revealed that in
addition to being one of the most feared gangsters in Boston,
Bulger was an informant for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony in hearings in federal court, Bulger's
tips allowed the FBI to put away 46 mobsters, creating a power
vacuum that provided opportunities for Bulger and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has denied that it closed its eyes to crimes committed
by Bulger and company in return for his service as an inside source
of information. But the US attorney has yet to hear from Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, Bulger allegedly called a former FBI contact,
John Morris, shouted some obscenities, and hung up. The call was
traced to a public telephone in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   People who have seen Bulger in 1995 and 1996 have told the FBI
that Bulger paid cash for everything. His continued source of funds
is not known.
</P>
<P>
   While still a free man, he shared in a winning Megabucks ticket,
but that money has been attached.

TWO SENATORS SAY THEY WILL INVESTIGATE SWEEPSTAKES CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two U.S. senators said Wednesday that they would investigate the
sophisticated marketing practices of the largest sweepstakes
companies and other mass mailers, just as entries for such contests
are arriving in millions of Americans' mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry will focus on whether new federal laws are needed to
regulate the language and appearance of mass mailings designed to
persuade consumers to buy goods promoted by sweepstakes and similar
contests. It will be conducted jointly by two subcommittees of the
Senate governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some major sweepstakes firms use deceptive language, confusing
rules and repeated mailings targeting vulnerable people,'' said
Sen. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, chairman of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. ``We intend to investigate these
deceptive practices, hold hearings and introduce legislation to
better protect consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will also be conducted by the International
Security, Proliferation and Federal Services Subcommittee, which is
chaired by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. The panels held a joint
hearing on the issue in September, and investigators have been
interviewing witnesses in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that will be examined are two of the
industry leaders, American Family Publishers and Publishers
Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the companies have said that their direct-mail
packages, which are mailed to millions of American homes, comply
with all laws and are not misleading.
</P>
<P>
   But subcommittee staff members said concerns have been raised
about recent mailings from both companies, including sweepstakes
entries that appear to be government documents. The investigation
also will examine whether the elderly are targeted and exploited by
mass mailers.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for senior citizens say that they are often victims of
the sophisticated language used to sell everything from magazines
and videos to flower bulbs and jewelry. They say the elderly are
frequently confused by the language and sometimes become so
consumed with winning that they spend thousands of dollars entering
contests.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil suit last month, Florida's attorney general accused
American Family Publishers of preying on the elderly through
deceptive solicitations and by selling their names and addresses to
operators of other contests.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the suit was unfounded and that elderly
consumers were not targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Collins emphasized that no purchase is necessary to enter any
legitimate contest and that people should not send money in
response to any mailing that asks for payment to win a prize.

BLEDSOE ON THE MEND, BUT WON'T PLAY SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The beard is thick now, a product of Drew
Bledsoe nursing a broken right index finger that will keep him from
participating in the wild-card round of the playoffs Sunday at
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks good, huh?'' said Bledsoe, rubbing the whiskers with his
left hand, careful to protect the finger which still holds the
metal pin that won't be removed after doctors ruled Wednesday the
finger hasn't yet healed enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe didn't rule out playing beyond this round ... if there
is another round.
</P>
<P>
   What would look better to the Patriots is No. 11 dropping back
and finding his receivers Sunday in Alltel Stadium. Instead, No. 16
Scott Zolak will make his third start and his first playoff start.
He'll oppose Mark Brunell, the efficient and exciting Jaguar
quarterback, himself returning from an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe will be on the sidelines, his whiskers growing, his
finger healing, wearing a headset and offering advice to Zolak, not
vice versa as it has been for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely disappointing to have your team in the playoffs
and not be on the field with them,'' said Bledsoe. ``You go through
a year's worth of hard work with the goal of giving yourself a shot
in the playoffs and then you don't get to go on the field. It's
tough to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   He then carefully explained why he was not able to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is it's not healed enough to have the pin
taken out,'' he said. ``They have to leave the pin in for it to
heal correctly. The big danger then is the pin breaking off inside
of the joint, which is a high likelihood because of the impact of
taking snaps and with the stress from throwing that the metal would
continually flex and break off inside the joint and damage the
joint. It would be a major surgical procedure to remove the pieces
of pin. They have ruled me out for the game because of the risk of
long-term damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said the risk now would be far greater than it was a few
weeks ago when he attempted to play with the first set of pins,
which were poking and prodding him so badly they were sticking out
the sides of the finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things were before the pins were situated prior to
this, the risk was not as great for long-term damage,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, that solution didn't work, so we had to go another
route for it to heal properly with that type of pin in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe never got the chance this week to throw and practice as
he had hoped. The outlook prior to last Sunday's game against the
Jets had been hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we can win this week, we would then evaluate next
week,'' Bledsoe had said. ``Hopefully, with the added week it would
have healed enough to remove the pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the task is to get the players to rally around Zolak, an
already fiery player who appears to have the respect of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do the same things that I've done the past couple of
weeks,'' said Bledsoe. ``I'll be in there watching films, pointing
things out during the game. I'll watch certain things for him and
analyze his reads on the field. I'll give him any input I can to
help him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Scott real well. I know what he likes to throw and what
he doesn't like to throw. I'll give the staff input as to what kind
of calls might be the way to go in a certain situation. I will take
a much more active role with our receiving corps, pointing out
things I see and watch individual routes. And during the game I can
help with adjustments and talk to Shawn (Jefferson) and Ben
(Coates) about those.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe were playing, the Patriots would not be 8 1/2-point
underdogs. He is 3-0 against the Jaguars. He's scored a bunch of
points against their defense and he's outplayed Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sympathize with Drew,'' Brunell said Wednesday. ``He's a
tough competitor. There's nothing more he'd like right now than a
healthy finger, but Drew's got 10-plus more years ahead of him. He
needs to do what's best for him in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell said of his own plight, playing with an injured ankle,
``I'm not going to just sit in the pocket. I'm not going to change.
If I have to move around, I'll do it. I might have lost a step, but
I'm going to play like I always do. I have an ankle sprain and my
footwork has suffered, but I can't do things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   While the New England defense has handled Brunell well, Bledsoe
feels there are matchups the Patriots can exploit on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben has had a big game against these guys,'' Bledsoe said.
``And I think we match up fairly well outside with our speed. We
have a good chance of winning this game against the Jaguars. We're
going to have to make big plays, but we have a good chance of
beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Bledsoe, the bearded one, will become an extra coach. He
will offer words, not action. He will lead the cheers and not lead
and be cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will be on their own. Without their franchise
player.

CML GETS OK TO SELL GARDENING-PRODUCTS UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CML Group Inc., once known for its NordicTrack exercise
machines, has received permission from US Bankruptcy Court to sell
the final piece of its business, its Smith &AMP; Hawken
gardening-products unit.
</P>
<P>
   The sale could be one of the final acts in the rise and fall of
CML, the Acton, Mass. company honored in 1993 as The Boston Globe's
Massachusetts company of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the auction of Smith &AMP; Hawken is completed in a bankruptcy
court in Worcester, Mass. next month, CML said it ``intends to file
a liquidating plan of reorganization to distribute the proceeds of
the sale and any other CML assets, to the extent that there are
proceeds available, to CML stakeholders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the end of the CML story, unfortunately,'' said
CML chairman and chief executive John Pound.
</P>
<P>
   CML filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 17, a little more than
a month after it sought similar protection for its NordicTrack
division. Smith &AMP; Hawken was not included in CML's bankruptcy
filing.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible that no one would buy Smith &AMP; Hawken, that
seems unlikely, because Smith &AMP; Hawken is a fast-growing and
profitable business. Based in California, it sells garden tools and
accessories by mail order and through retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   When Pound took over CML after founder Charles M. Leighton was
ousted in February, there was hope that CML could sell its troubled
NordicTrack business and carry on with Smith &AMP; Hawken.
</P>
<P>
   But NordicTrack's problems were so great that it seems CML was
finally left with no options but to try to sell Smith &AMP; Hawken and
cease operations.
</P>
<P>
   For its last fiscal year, Smith &AMP; Hawken had revenues of $88
million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization of $2.8 million. The company is expected to report
$100 million in revenues this year.
</P>
<P>
   When it filed for bankruptcy, CML listed assets of $31.5 million
and liabilities of $78.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of CML, Smith &AMP; Hawken might have a chance to expand
beyond its store base of 34 stores. The Smith &AMP; Hawken concept
``could easily support 100 stores; there's a lot of growth
potential,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of NordicTrack's decline has been told before. In the
early 1990s, the home-exercise business was dominated by fads and,
at one point, the NordicTrack ski machine was king.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, consumers have tired of such fads, and the
$3 billion home-exercise business has been shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, CML attempted to sell NordicTrack as a
business entity. But that plan failed to attract buyers.
</P>
<P>
   This month, CML said it reached an agreement to sell some of
NordicTrack's assets, including the NordicTrack name. Under the
proposal, Icon Health &AMP; Fitness Inc. of Utah agreed to pay CML as
much as $12 million for the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bankruptcy court ruling announced Wednesday, CML can
accept bids for Smith &AMP; Hawken until Feb. 4. A court-sanctioned
auction has been scheduled for Feb. 11.

OUTLOOK FOR SWIFT CENSURE BY SENATE BECOMES MURKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES BENNET and LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ President Clinton just cannot seem to get
himself censured.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions after the midterm elections that Clinton would
escape impeachment with censure by the House foundered on his
refusal to say that he lied under oath, along with steely
legislative management by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic could take hold in the Senate. Clinton has
told his aides he will not concede that he lied, even though some
senators are urging that he do so to pave the way for censure. What
is not yet clear is whether enough senators _ 51 or 60, depending
on how censure is presented _ would be satisfied with such a
rebuke, without Clinton's acknowledgment of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Already the possibility of a pre-emptive censure has faded,
since Majority Leader Trent Lott has said he will insist on at
least opening the proceedings. As the House Judiciary Committee
demonstrated, such proceedings can have a certain inexorability.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have told Democratic senators that Clinton
hopes to be censured immediately after a Senate trial opens,
because he is anxious to see the accusations against him resolved
by Jan 19. On that day, he is to deliver his annual State of the
Union Message to a joint session of Congress, and he would prefer
that his audience not be mulling his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, his daughter,
Chelsea, and his dog, Buddy, Clinton arrived in Hilton Head on
Wednesday for his annual New Year's retreat to the
spirit-and-status-boosting conference called Renaissance Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While they say they have not yet seen any proposed censure
language, White House advisers insist a deal could nevertheless be
struck quickly. ``There's no Tom DeLay in the Senate,'' said one
senior White House aide, referring to the House whip who corralled
votes for Clinton's impeachment. Republicans in the Senate are less
likely to act as a bloc, this adviser argued, adding that Senate
Democrats, by contrast, are cohering.
</P>
<P>
   But even some moderate Republicans have their doubts about a
swift censure. ``The colleagues with whom I've talked have as many
different versions of censure and resolutions as there are
senators,'' said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in an interview
Wednesday. ``Some people are talking about the need for the
president to make an admission. Some are talking about a fine of
some sort. Others are talking about the need to insure that the
president could be subject to criminal penalties after his term is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In weighing the possibilities for censure, the White House
confronts a confounding array of variables, including what
procedure the Senate will adopt. Lott is considering whether to
hold a vote to open the trial after first hearing a presentation of
the evidence from the House. If that vote failed, Clinton's hand in
negotiating a mild censure would be immeasurably strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   The White House must also politely round up enough
independent-minded senators, who are scattering over the question
of censure. In the House, Republicans and Democrats may seem
obstreperous but dutifully follow their leaders. By contrast, the
Senate is genteelly fractious; Democrats are differing over whether
Clinton should insist on a trial, and even some conservative
Republicans say it would be silly to make him concede he lied.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Sen. Collins said that she would make no decisions
before hearing the evidence, but that an admission by Clinton of
perjury would ``help move the process along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are entering into the equivalent of a plea bargain,
which is what you are talking about with censure, there is an
admission and an acceptance of responsibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., a conservative, said of seeking
such an admission: ``It is trying to get some pound of flesh out of
the president here, to what end?'' Impeachment, he said in an
interview, was already a blacker mark than any censure.
</P>
<P>
   Like Santorum _ though for very different reasons _ Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, a liberal, argues that Clinton should go to trial
rather than be censured. ``I believe that more and more of my
colleagues are seeing the wisdom of having a trial,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``I think the Republican Party is reeling from
this.'' He said that, with impeachment now hanging over his head,
Clinton deserved a ``definitive vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans appear to agree that a trial should begin, but in
interviews they offered a range of views on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to the House to start on the trial,'' said Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., a moderate. ``It would be an insult to the House to
say, ``Well, let's just have a vote on dismissing the whole
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``That doesn't mean that at some stage later on there
wouldn't be a pause to consider another approach.'' He said he had
no view on what form censure should take.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who has been critical of Lott on
occasion, said that he was inclined against censure even after a
trial began, calling it dangerous. ``When you read the Federalist
papers, impeachment was never intended to be a punishment,'' he
said. ``It was never intended to force people to admit to something
or extract a fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Under one scenario, a relatively small group could block any
consideration of censure. If a censure proposal were offered like
any piece of Senate legislation, it would be subject to filibuster,
meaning that it would require at least 60 senators to pass.
</P>
<P>
   To circumvent that obstacle, senators might attach a censure
resolution to a motion to dismiss the accusations against Clinton.
Such a motion would require only a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said that Senate Democrats would
take that approach. ``The only question,'' he said, ``is when the
51 votes are cast to adjourn with censure.''

STATE SEEKS TO EXEMPT SOME VEHICLES FROM EMISSIONS TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Facing a tough new federally mandated automobile
inspection plan they fear will outrage motorists, Massachusetts
environmental officials said Wednesday they will use new technology
to exempt the cleanest-running 40 percent of cars from the new
emissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci also plans to ask legislators to change
state law so drivers will be required to get safety inspections of
brakes and headlights only every other year instead of annually.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state officials are scrambling to find ways _ which
could include subsidies from the state's budget _ to ensure the
cost of the new inspection sticker does not rise more than $5 to $7
annually from the current $15.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, state officials have been dragging their feet on
launching the new inspection plan for the state's 4.1 million
vehicles after similar programs sparked motorist rebellions in
Maine and Texas. The US Environmental Protection Agency has been
requiring states to toughen vehicle inspections to reduce smog.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, an increasingly exasperated EPA regional
administrator John P. DeVillars has been threatening to impose
severe restrictions on industrial growth and power-plant
construction unless state officials got moving on the new
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the state environmental protection commissioner,
David B. Struhs, wrote DeVillars that the state will ``shortly''
sign an estimated $215 million contract with an Arizona company,
Keating Technologies, to set up the new testing system.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the state's delay, Struhs said it has ``allowed us to
thoughtfully build what I believe is the most effective, flexible
and convenient (inspection) plan in the country.'' Struhs said it
will start sometime next summer, several months after a March
deadline the EPA has set.
</P>
<P>
   The key element of the plan will be to exempt about 40 percent
of cars from emissions tests based on studies determining which
``engine families'' are most likely to meet emissions standards on
an ongoing basis, said John Rodman, assistant secretary of
environmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, this could mean that some cars within the
same model family might be exempted while others are not, such as
those with 6-cylinder engines instead of 4-cylinder. People who buy
new cars will not have to get the emissions tested for at least two
years in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   State officials plan to deploy inspectors using high-tech
emissions-testing equipment along state highways, aiming laser
readers at tailpipes, to verify that classes of vehicles given
exemptions from emissions tests are in fact clean enough. These
tests might lead to some types of exempted cars being required to
get emissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars's chief aide, Mindy Lubber, said Struhs's decision is
``good news, a New Year's present for all of us who breathe the air
in Massachusetts'' and will likely lead EPA to back off threatened
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   However, when asked about the proposal to give 40 percent of
cars a free ride, Lubber said: ``It's something worth exploring,
but I don't have the details to be able to say whether it is
absolutely going to meet the needs of the Clean Air Act,'' which is
requiring Massachusetts to cut smog-causing emissions by 24 percent
from 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Lubber said she knows of no state that has gone as far as
Massachusetts in proposing to exempt vehicles from inspections.
``We will be anxious to get details,'' Lubber said.
</P>
<P>
   Struhs said that to minimize inconvenience for drivers, he will
take steps to ensure that at least 800 to 1,200 service stations
around the state _ about a third to half the number now performing
inspections _ will be able to afford the new testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   However, many service station owners have warned that without
considerable state aid, a $40 or $45 biennial fee might not cover
the cost of renting the high-tech dynamometer testing equipment.
Some predict the number of stations willing to sign up will fall
far short of state hopes.
</P>
<P>
   And just how far the 40 percent exemption will go to quell
controversy is unclear. Each year, owners of some 1.2 million
vehicles _ half of those denied the exemption _ will have to go in
for longer, more expensive tests that tens of thousands of vehicles
are expected to fail, requiring costly repairs or tuneups to be
deemed roadworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Greater Boston, Bay State car owners might also have to
drive much farther to find a service station equipped to handle the
new tests. And people whose cars are exempted at first would likely
have to get emissions tests after their cars have been on the road
for several years and their engines begin polluting more, Rodman
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci administration officials are bracing for a
backlash over the plan, Rodman said, ``It's important to remember
that it is EPA that is causing the change in the number of gas
stations'' that will be authorized to do inspections.

   ST. JOSEPH, Minn. _ It is the middle of the night, as Patty
Wetterling sits on the living room couch, staring out the window,
waiting for her boy, Jacob, to come home.
</P>
<P>
   She has been waiting for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still, deep in my heart, believe it is possible that he's
alive,'' said Ms. Wetterling, who hung Jacob's stocking from the
fireplace mantel again this year, as she does every Christmas
season. ``Sometimes I look out the window and expect to see him
come running up the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob was 11 years old when he was abducted by a man with a gun
in this small town on Oct. 22, 1989. His brother, Trevor, who was
10, and a friend, Aaron, 11, were with Jacob that night. The three
boys were riding their bicycles home from the Tom Thumb convenience
store, where they had rented a movie, ``Naked Gun,'' when a man
wearing a mask stepped out of a driveway. The man told Trevor and
Aaron to run, or he would shoot them. And then he took Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   No arrest has ever been made. No body has ever been found. All
that remains is uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wetterling family, the uncertainty has meant nearly a
decade of life lived in the half-step, not quite here, not quite
there, reluctant to lose themselves completely to the moment,
moving ahead with daily routines, because there is no choice,
learning to sing again, even to laugh, but never as freely, or
lightly, as before.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is the burden of doubt known to people who live with
mysterious holes in the family fabric, voids that go unexplained,
losses that are never properly mourned: people who can only wonder
at what became of a father, last known living in some faraway
place, or a sister, tormented by emotional demons until vanishing
into the streets, or a child, who went out to play one day and
somehow crossed paths with evil.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Erwin Wetterling was born on Feb. 17, 1978, a boy who
liked to celebrate his birthday with his grandpa, who loved to fish
with his dad, Jerry, who slept with one arm around his brother,
Trevor.
</P>
<P>
   A great fan of sports, he played soccer, hockey, baseball and
football, and so worshiped Marcus Allen, the star Los Angeles
running back, that he named his dog Marcus, and dressed the pup in
a Raider's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He could never eat enough peanut butter or guacamole. He was
famous around the house for playing tricks on his mother for April
Fool's, and for making her beautiful artwork for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of the sixth grader in this town 75 miles north of
Minneapolis, initially drew hundreds of law enforcement officials.
But the case no longer gets much attention. It has faded from the
headlines in the Minnesota newspapers. Agents for the FBI pulled
out years ago. Only the local sheriff's department keeps close tabs
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But Patty and Jerry Wetterling keep looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning, I lay in bed and couldn't go on anymore,'' said
Ms. Wetterling. ``It was too hard. I pulled the covers up over my
head and decided I was never going to get out of that bed again.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she envisioned Jacob. He was huddled in a corner,
saying he was going to give up.
</P>
<P>
   And she found herself speaking out loud: ``Hold on, Jacob. We're
going to find you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I pulled myself out of bed and took a shower, and went out
to find him,'' she said. ``And that's what I do every day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Searching faces on buses and trains, at construction sites and
shopping malls, Ms. Wetterling looks for a young man with brown
hair and blue eyes, probably about 6 feet tall now, with a 21st
birthday just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling started a foundation, Jacob's Hope, which focuses
on the plight of missing and exploited children, a forum that gives
her a chance to talk with law enforcement officers across the
nation and keep her son's case from being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Some leads still come, but none has panned out. There are people
who call, from all over the country, and say they think they have
seen Jacob, sometimes sending pictures. There are con artists who
call and ask about a reward. There are sadistic pranksters who call
to try to twist their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Wetterlings came home one night and switched on the
answering machine. The voice of a young man whispered into the
telephone. ``This is Jacob Wetterling,'' he said. ``And I want you
to know I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wetterlings felt certain it was not Jacob, but there
remained a shred of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long,'' Ms. Wetterling said. ``Would we recognize
his voice?''
</P>
<P>
   The police traced the call and determined it was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of psychics have called, some looking for self-promotion,
some apparently driven by a misguided hope to help bring an end to
their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob is cold and dead,'' said one caller, who identified
himself as a psychic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling responded with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you had some funny feeling sitting in New York,'' she
said, ``you decide to call and tell me to just quit and give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the horror of the abduction, the Wetterlings led a
seemingly charmed life, a popular and handsome family with a sense
of playfulness and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Wetterling, a chiropractor with a growing business in
town, was president of the local branch of the NAACP. His wife, a
former math teacher, stayed home with the children, was president
of the PTA and a soccer coach.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest child, Amy, was sailing through school like a yacht.
Jacob and Trevor were confident and happy-go-lucky. The youngest,
Carmen, raced at life like fire across the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the earthquake, in the words of an aunt in San
Francisco, that never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Amy started to carry the world on her shoulders, driven to excel
in everything she did, certain it was her role to make the world
right. Carmen began to withdraw socially, especially as she neared
age 11.
</P>
<P>
   The parents worried most about Trevor. They looked him in the
eyes and talked to him about the abduction, the night when his
parents and police officers asked him a thousand questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know that there was nothing different that you
could have done,'' his mother told him. But to this day, she does
not know if he believes that.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob had been an outstanding hockey player, a goalie on the
traveling team. When it came Trevor's turn to join the travel team,
he suited up, skated once around the rink, and walked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit,'' he told his father, and never went back.
</P>
<P>
   He is a student at St. Cloud State College, just 10 miles from
home. He has never much liked to be alone, a trait his mother calls
``a survival skill,'' and he has not wanted to go far from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pay you to go to that college you've talked about in
Colorado,'' his mother said she has told him. But Trevor is not
ready to go far from home yet.
</P>
<P>
   Amy recently graduated from the University of Minnesota with a
degree in psychology and a minor in criminal justice. Carmen is a
junior at St. Joseph High School.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no extra time for anything but comforting the
children, and searching for Jacob, the parents gave up their duties
at the NAACP. and the PTA. Ms. Wetterling abandoned her plans to
return to teaching part-time.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob's class of 1996 seemed to carry him with them. He was
given a page in the school yearbook. The hockey team listed his
name on the roster, since he should have been playing. The football
team dedicated its season to Jacob, and then surprised everyone by
winning the Central Lakes Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of Jacob robbed some of the innocence of his
classmates, a burden they seemed to carry all the way through
school. On the day of their graduation, the principal called the
Wetterlings and asked them to speak to the departing seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to set them free,'' the principal said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling reminded the students about Jacob, a boy who was
not afraid to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob believed in a world of possibility and potential,'' his
mother said. ``Let your spirits soar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Jacob's world has changed without his
knowing it. He lost his grandpa last year. Marcus, his dog, died a
few years ago. And the fields near home have become thick with new
houses, a subdivision called Pound Meadow Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who just turned 50, now has just a touch of gray in
his hair at the temples, and his mother, 49, wears eyeglasses most
of the time these days.
</P>
<P>
   But if he should ever find his way back to the driveway, he
would see a big display of white lights on the garage door. It
reads, ``Jacob's Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The family would never consider moving, since they need to be
there when Jacob comes home. And they would not change the
telephone number, despite some of the crank calls, because that's
the number that Jacob knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids do come home,'' Ms. Wetterling said. ``And they do
heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, the mother sat down to write a letter to
Jacob's abductor, an appeal she intended to touch ``that shred of
compassion'' his mother hopes exists in every human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the man who took Jacob,'' began the letter, which was
printed in some Minnesota newspapers. She reminded the abductor
that he, like Jacob, had once been an 11-year-old boy, and that
something very wrong must have happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my own survival, I have had to let go of a lot of anger or
I would be swallowed up in it,'' she wrote, asking that he call her
and tell her what happened to her son. ``You have held the answers
for so long. You also hold the pain. Please talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fireplace glowed with red embers, winds whipping across the
frozen prairie, as she gazed out the window into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world is about ready for a miracle,'' she said.
``Let it be here.'' &QL;

   ST. JOSEPH, Minn. _ It is the middle of the night, as Patty
Wetterling sits on the living room couch, staring out the window,
waiting for her boy, Jacob, to come home.
</P>
<P>
   She has been waiting for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still, deep in my heart, believe it is possible that he's
alive,'' said Ms. Wetterling, who hung Jacob's stocking from the
fireplace mantel again this year, as she does every Christmas
season. ``Sometimes I look out the window and expect to see him
come running up the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob was 11 years old when he was abducted by a man with a gun
in this small town on Oct. 22, 1989. His brother, Trevor, who was
10, and a friend, Aaron, 11, were with Jacob that night. The three
boys were riding their bicycles home from the Tom Thumb convenience
store, where they had rented a movie, ``Naked Gun,'' when a man
wearing a mask stepped out of a driveway. The man told Trevor and
Aaron to run, or he would shoot them. And then he took Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   No arrest has ever been made. No body has ever been found. All
that remains is uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wetterling family, the uncertainty has meant nearly a
decade of life lived in the half-step, not quite here, not quite
there, reluctant to lose themselves completely to the moment,
moving ahead with daily routines, because there is no choice,
learning to sing again, even to laugh, but never as freely, or
lightly, as before.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is the burden of doubt known to people who live with
mysterious holes in the family fabric, voids that go unexplained,
losses that are never properly mourned: people who can only wonder
at what became of a father, last known living in some faraway
place, or a sister, tormented by emotional demons until vanishing
into the streets, or a child, who went out to play one day and
somehow crossed paths with evil.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Erwin Wetterling was born on Feb. 17, 1978, a boy who
liked to celebrate his birthday with his grandpa, who loved to fish
with his dad, Jerry, who slept with one arm around his brother,
Trevor.
</P>
<P>
   A great fan of sports, he played soccer, hockey, baseball and
football, and so worshiped Marcus Allen, the star Los Angeles
running back, that he named his dog Marcus, and dressed the pup in
a Raider's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He could never eat enough peanut butter or guacamole. He was
famous around the house for playing tricks on his mother for April
Fool's, and for making her beautiful artwork for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of the sixth grader in this town 75 miles north of
Minneapolis, initially drew hundreds of law enforcement officials.
But the case no longer gets much attention. It has faded from the
headlines in the Minnesota newspapers. Agents for the FBI pulled
out years ago. Only the local sheriff's department keeps close tabs
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But Patty and Jerry Wetterling keep looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning, I lay in bed and couldn't go on anymore,'' said
Ms. Wetterling. ``It was too hard. I pulled the covers up over my
head and decided I was never going to get out of that bed again.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she envisioned Jacob. He was huddled in a corner,
saying he was going to give up.
</P>
<P>
   And she found herself speaking out loud: ``Hold on, Jacob. We're
going to find you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I pulled myself out of bed and took a shower, and went out
to find him,'' she said. ``And that's what I do every day.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Searching faces on buses and trains, at construction sites and
shopping malls, Ms. Wetterling looks for a young man with brown
hair and blue eyes, probably about 6 feet tall now, with a 21st
birthday just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling started a foundation, Jacob's Hope, which focuses
on the plight of missing and exploited children, a forum that gives
her a chance to talk with law enforcement officers across the
nation and keep her son's case from being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Some leads still come, but none has panned out. There are people
who call, from all over the country, and say they think they have
seen Jacob, sometimes sending pictures. There are con artists who
call and ask about a reward. There are sadistic pranksters who call
to try to twist their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Wetterlings came home one night and switched on the
answering machine. The voice of a young man whispered into the
telephone. ``This is Jacob Wetterling,'' he said. ``And I want you
to know I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wetterlings felt certain it was not Jacob, but there
remained a shred of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long,'' Ms. Wetterling said. ``Would we recognize
his voice?''
</P>
<P>
   The police traced the call and determined it was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of psychics have called, some looking for self-promotion,
some apparently driven by a misguided hope to help bring an end to
their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob is cold and dead,'' said one caller, who identified
himself as a psychic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling responded with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you had some funny feeling sitting in New York,'' she
said, ``you decide to call and tell me to just quit and give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the horror of the abduction, the Wetterlings led a
seemingly charmed life, a popular and handsome family with a sense
of playfulness and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Wetterling, a chiropractor with a growing business in
town, was president of the local branch of the NAACP. His wife, a
former math teacher, stayed home with the children, was president
of the PTA and a soccer coach.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest child, Amy, was sailing through school like a yacht.
Jacob and Trevor were confident and happy-go-lucky. The youngest,
Carmen, raced at life like fire across the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the earthquake, in the words of an aunt in San
Francisco, that never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Amy started to carry the world on her shoulders, driven to excel
in everything she did, certain it was her role to make the world
right. Carmen began to withdraw socially, especially as she neared
age 11.
</P>
<P>
   The parents worried most about Trevor. They looked him in the
eyes and talked to him about the abduction, the night when his
parents and police officers asked him a thousand questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know that there was nothing different that you
could have done,'' his mother told him. But to this day, she does
not know if he believes that.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob had been an outstanding hockey player, a goalie on the
traveling team. When it came Trevor's turn to join the travel team,
he suited up, skated once around the rink, and walked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit,'' he told his father, and never went back.
</P>
<P>
   He is a student at St. Cloud State College, just 10 miles from
home. He has never much liked to be alone, a trait his mother calls
``a survival skill,'' and he has not wanted to go far from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pay you to go to that college you've talked about in
Colorado,'' his mother said she has told him. But Trevor is not
ready to go far from home yet.
</P>
<P>
   Amy recently graduated from the University of Minnesota with a
degree in psychology and a minor in criminal justice. Carmen is a
junior at St. Joseph High School.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no extra time for anything but comforting the
children, and searching for Jacob, the parents gave up their duties
at the NAACP. and the PTA. Ms. Wetterling abandoned her plans to
return to teaching part-time.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob's class of 1996 seemed to carry him with them. He was
given a page in the school yearbook. The hockey team listed his
name on the roster, since he should have been playing. The football
team dedicated its season to Jacob, and then surprised everyone by
winning the Central Lakes Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of Jacob robbed some of the innocence of his
classmates, a burden they seemed to carry all the way through
school. On the day of their graduation, the principal called the
Wetterlings and asked them to speak to the departing seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to set them free,'' the principal said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling reminded the students about Jacob, a boy who was
not afraid to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob believed in a world of possibility and potential,'' his
mother said. ``Let your spirits soar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Jacob's world has changed without his
knowing it. He lost his grandpa last year. Marcus, his dog, died a
few years ago. And the fields near home have become thick with new
houses, a subdivision called Pound Meadow Ridge.

DISPUTE BETWEEN U.N. AND AFGHAN GROUP IMPEDES RELIEF WORK
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A hardening of positions by the United Nations
and the group that controls most of Afghanistan is crippling
efforts to resume international relief work there, officials from
both sides say.
</P>
<P>
   Stalled talks with the Taliban, the militant Islamic movement
that rules more than 90 percent of the country, mean that almost no
significant work in vital areas like health and reconstruction from
more than 20 years of civil war can take place in the country,
which has now fallen under the grip of winter.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, the United Nations children's fund, said this week that
education in Afghanistan had all but ground to a halt, with nearly
nine of every ten girls and two out of three boys not in school.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF said that 257 of every 1,000 children die before age 5,
the fourth worst rate in the world. Other relief groups say that
hospitals have run out of medicine and other essential supplies,
while inflation has driven up the price of food.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with the Taliban boils down to this: The United
Nations, which withdrew all of its foreign workers four months ago,
will not return until it has firm security guarantees for its
staff. And the Taliban will not allow other activities by the
international organization _ such as human rights investigations _
until the United Nations reopens its offices in the capital, Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the United States carried out missile attacks on
training camps in Afghanistan run by a Saudi-born militant, Osama
bin Laden. The United States has linked him to terrorist activities
against U.S. targets, including U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   After the attacks, an Italian military officer serving with the
United Nations was killed in Kabul, apparently in retaliation. The
United Nations is demanding that the Taliban account fully for that
killing and prosecute the attackers, and also that it solve the
mystery of the earlier killings of two Afghan workers attached to
the World Food Program in Jalalabad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's representative-designate at
the United Nations, said in an interview Tuesday that his
government had ``done a lot of work in this regard.'' Shortly after
the killing of the Italian officer, the Taliban authorities
arrested two Pakistanis and charged them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have these two convicts and we have been investigating
them,'' Mujahid said. ``So far they didn't admit anything. We gave
some information to the U.N., but they didn't consider that it was
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Taliban want to interview a French officer who
was wounded in the attack to determine if he could identify the
suspects in custody, but that their requests have gone unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said that the United Nations has also rejected as
inadequate the information gathered on the attack on the two local
relief workers in Jalalabad, a generally lawless city where
kidnappings an shootings are frequent.
</P>
<P>
   In November, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended that
the United Nations send human rights investigators to Afghanistan
to look into accusations of massacres of Taliban troops in 1997 by
opposition forces near the northern opposition stronghold of
Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were also to look into reports that forces
allied to the Taliban, if not the Taliban itself, had in turn
killed an unknown number of civilians and opposition fighters in
the same region this year, when the Taliban retook the area.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have relied on reports from people who fled
the area, who were largely supporters of enemies of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations also wants to investigate how a number of
Iranian diplomats and journalists were killed in Taliban military
operations this year. The Iranians had supported Shiite, ethnic
Hazara militias that were overrun by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 8, the Security Council supported those recommendations
for investigations and also backed a plan to set up a permanent
human rights and relief monitoring contingent in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary
Robinson, is putting together a five-member team of investigators
to study the reports of massacres. But her spokesman said that the
team would need the cooperation of the Taliban as well as that of
other fighters still in the area. This is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said that ``first the United Nations agencies should be
shifted back from Pakistan to Afghanistan, then the Islamic Emirate
of Afghanistan will help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nongovernmental aid groups, which had pulled their
headquarters out of Kabul in July after the Taliban demanded that
they move into a derelict technical college dormitory on the edge
of the city, have returned.
</P>
<P>
   Some aid agencies have pledged that they will move to the
building after it is renovated _ a date in the distant future _ in
return for the right to work among Afghans who, they say, need
their help immediately.

A LOST CANYON THAT IS ITS OWN PARADE GROUND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Thousands of visitors travel by jet here to
see the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl, and tens of thousands ply
Southern California's freeways to get to New Year's Day events. But
then there are the happy few who step out of their bungalows to
head down the hiking trails of Arroyo Seco and walk to the game via
the city's majestic river canyon. The ritual trip down
boulder-lined stairways set among the oaks and sycamores and into
the fabled wash is a pleasure, known primarily to residents of
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   This New Year's Day, however, Pasadena's best kept secret is
different.
</P>
<P>
   .
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, the arroyo has been undergoing an
extensive restoration to replace the exotic acacia, castor bean and
flowering plants that drove out the native fauna.
</P>
<P>
   For the first New Year's Day in memory, Pasadenans will
encounter a landscape of willows, toyon, coffeeberry, elderberry,
and laurel and lemonade sumac, all California natives, in a lush
riparian habitat. The habitat restoration, among the most ambitious
in Southern California, extends 1.8 miles from the old Colorado
Street Bridge, south of the Rose Bowl, toward the border Pasadena
shares with South Pasadena _ an area of 52 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena was founded in the late 19th century as a winter
resort. Houses were designed with sleeping porches and terraces
open to the San Gabriel Mountains and arroyo views that gave
Pasadena its character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the arroyo has been of great importance to
Pasadena _ it's one of the reasons the city is where it is,'' said
Adam Schiff, a California State Senator, on a recent tour of the
arroyo. ``Philosophically, the restoration of its natural beauty
speaks volumes about where Pasadena is, and was.''
</P>
<P>
   The degradation of the natural environment was gradual. The Army
Corps of Engineers rushed in after the devastating flood of 1938
and built concrete water channels down the arroyo, which controlled
floods but denied water to the rest of the riverbed, drying out the
vegetation that sustained native animals. In the 1950's, Pasadena
went through an economic downturn and smog invaded greater Los
Angeles. The city lapsed into shabby gentility.
</P>
<P>
   Residents rallied around its historic architecture. Restoring
the city's turn-of-the-century houses preserved entire
neighborhoods. (Despite its humble bungalows, Pasadena was once one
of the wealthiest cities, per capita, in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with better emissions controls, the smog lifted and
the San Gabriel Mountains came out of the haze. The step from
architectural restoration to the restoration of the arroyo was
logical: one implied the other. ``They are separate but intertwined
strands of the same rope,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of what was in effect Pasadena's Central Park
began with an environmental trade-off. In the early 1990s,
Browning-Ferris Industries, the waste-disposal company, began
filling a canyon about 20 miles away in the San Fernando Valley.
Browning-Ferris was required by state and federal regulations to
create a comparable riparian habitat elsewhere. The company spent
$5.5 million to recreate the Lower Arroyo between two of the seven
concrete viaducts that span the canyon. The Arroyo Seco Foundation
restored habitat south of La Loma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the concrete channel there was a whole meandering
stream system working through the arroyo,'' said Michael Zander,
head of Zander Associates, a Marin County environmental consulting
concern that designed the new habitat. ``What we didn't have was
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Just under the Colorado Street Bridge was a small dam. Zander
designed culverts to channel the water above the dam into streams
that irrigated about eight acres of the arroyo, turning arid
expanses into marshland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took out all the exotic grasses, flowering plants and the
weeds and trees that were in the way,'' said City Manager Cynthia
Kurtz, who oversaw the project as Pasadena's director of public
works and transportation. ``After a lot of research, we came up
with a mix of seeds for reseeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Willows and cattails dominate the center of the stream, and
toward banks and edges, there are alder, California black walnut,
sycamore, poplar, cottonwood and elderberry. Beyond the edges are
native centenarian live oaks. (The designers also left full-grown
exotic trees, especially the eucalyptus.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a month of opening the floodgates, the birds came as if
attracted by a magnet,'' said Rosa Laveaga, supervisor of Arroyo
Seco Park. ``They're drawn to the water, and to the willows and
alders, which provide great nesting areas. We had an overpopulation
of gophers and squirrels, which made it difficult for plants to
survive, but the increase in the number of birds helps keep the
rodent population down. The hawks help police the area.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Arroyo seco' means dry river in Spanish,'' Schiff said.
``But the Gabrielino Indians called it Hahamongna, which means
`flowing waters, fruitful valley.' What we do now will determine
whether the Indian or Spanish term is more accurate. I'd like
nothing more than to see the arroyo completely returned to the
Hahamongna.''

 &HT;    Viagra inventor Pfizer chosen company of year
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pfizer, the company that invented Viagra, is the
company of the year, Forbes (Jan. 11) reports in its 51st annual
report on American industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfizer has developed the most talked-about drug of the
decade,'' says the magazine, adding many more new products are on
the way from Pfizer's labs.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, Viagra, the sexual potency drug for men, is on its
way to $1.4 billion in sales in 1999, and ``trials for women are
under way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra was just a warm-up,'' says Forbes. ``Years of lavish
R&AMP;D spending and vast changes in the science of drug discovery have
pumped Pfizer's drug pipeline full to bursting.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also announced its annual ``Platinum List'' of companies
with the best performances in profitability and share price
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   UST of Greenwich, Conn., a tobacco products and wine company,
posted the highest profitability score based on a formula that
includes return on capital, cash flow per share, sales and net
income growth. Its average return on capital for five years was 92
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Others high on the profitability list include Avon Products,
second; Coca-Cola, sixth; Microsoft, 10th; and Intel, 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer of Round Rock, Texas, was the champion in
five-year stock price growth _ more than 9,000 percent. Next
highest was America Online, with shares up more than 4,800 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Think small in '99
</P>
<P>
   Smaller-capitalized stocks virtually disappeared from the market
for years, but most analysts look for their return in the year
ahead, Bloomberg Personal Finance (January/February) says in its
annual forecast edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small-caps'' are usually defined as companies with market
values of less than $1 billion, although some analysts put the
cutoff at $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomberg, small-caps may be the ticket in 1999
``if you want to change the risk-reward characteristic of your
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the big stocks that have been so popular for so
long also have the highest price-to-earnings ratios, making them
vulnerable to heavy selling in a market crisis. Not so the
smaller-capitalized stocks, which are typically cheaper in price
and valuation.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also sees the technology sector continuing to
sizzle, led by Internet stocks. Overseas, Bloomberg suggests
investors look at Japan and Europe, both of which are, in effect,
on the threshold of new growth, Japan by correcting its economic
problems and Europe with the common currency.

 &HT;    Proxy buyer purchases site near Coke headquarters
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A proxy buyer has purchased another piece of property
in the area between Centennial Olympic Park and Coca-Cola Co.'s
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A member of one of the families who own the property, the 19,500
square-foot Superior Printing Co., said last summer the 10 owners
were negotiating to sell the property to Coca-Cola. The selling
price of $51 a square foot, or $993,800, is close to the owners'
asking price last summer when Jim Hochgertle, whose wife was among
the owners, said Coca-Cola was offering $28 a square foot.
Hockgertle said Wednesday that the negotiations were later turned
over to an attorney and he didn't know the identity of the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   With this recent deal, Atlantic Financial Group, an Arlington,
Texas-based firm buying for a corporate client who does not want to
be identified, has spent $6.8 million since mid-year buying
property in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has repeatedly declined to comment on whether it is
Atlantic Financial's anonymous client.
</P>
<P>
   With its already-substantial landholdings around its North
Avenue headquarters and strong civic influence, Coca-Cola has long
been expected to play a key role in the redevelopment envisioned
around Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent tract in the area is under contract to be
sold, but BellSouth, which owns the property, declined to disclose
the identity of the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth property is a 0.7-acre site across Hull Street
from the eight-acre tract Coca-Cola bought before the 1996 Games
for its Olympic City festival. ``We are still trying for tomorrow
to get it closed by the end of the year,'' BellSouth spokesman Clay
Owen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Atlantic Financial also purchased a small
nearby property at 353 McAfee St. for $320,000.
</P>
<P>
   The properties purchased by Atlantic Financial are located
within several blocks on the north side of Coca-Cola's Olympic City
tract, a key location designated for residential ventures in the
park area redevelopment plans of civic and city planners.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Bill Hensel reiterated Wednesday that ``no
firm plans have been made for that property.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has also said it has made no decision on adding more
office space to accomodate its growing work force that has spilled
over from its headquarters into buildings in Midtown, downtown and
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the soft drink giant planned to buy Inforum, an
office building adjacent to Centennial Park, but the deal fell
through. Earlier in the 1990s, the company considered construction
of an office tower as high as 48 stories.

 &HT;    Home Depot offers shares via the Net
 &HT;    By Frances Katz and Robert Luke
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot, which this week began giving customized
tips to homeowners over the Internet, also has begun offering its
shares to the public at its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first public company to offer its shares directly
online to those who aren't already shareholders, said Charles B.
Carlson, editor of the DRIP Investor newsletter in Hammond, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see other companies follow suit,'' predicted Carlson.
He noted Compaq Computer already has announced plans to offer
shares online by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably see 20 to 30 companies doing it by the end of
1999,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, such as BellSouth and IBM, already offer direct
investment programs, which are expanded dividend reinvestment
plans, bypassing stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few allow enrollment via a clearinghouse: Netstock
Direct Corp., at http://netstockdirect.com. These include Allstate,
Campbell Soup, Ford, Merck, John H. Harland and National Service
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is the first to link enrollment to its own Web site
(http://www.homedepot.com), Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is hoping to convert loyal customers into loyal
stockholders. ``Our Internet strategy can't be different from the
way we serve our customers in our stores,'' says Home Depot
spokesman Don Harrison. ``Customer service is of paramount interest
to us. We've got to make it as easy for customers to purchase stock
as it is to purchase a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Buying stock from the Home Depot site is fairly simple process
that requires nothing more than the latest version of the Netscape
or Internet Explorer Web browser with a high level of encryption
technology for secure transactions.
</P>
<P>
   To enroll in the direct investment plan, called DepotDirect,
investors must make a minimum initial investment of $250, plus a
one-time $5 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Once they become shareholders, they may invest cash dividends
and make optional cash purchases of additional company stock. The
maximum they can invest each year is $100,000. The purchases, which
can be debited automatically from checking or savings accounts,
will be made Tuesdays and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   There is a purchase fee of 5 percent of the amount invested, up
to a maximum of $2.50 per transaction. There is a $10 charge for
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said many companies offer stock purchase plans to build
customer loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole concept of affinity marketing,'' he said.
``These are all potential customers of Home Depot. They can
communicate with them, maybe institute shareholder marketing
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The target customer is different for every company,'' says
Vice President and co-founder of Stock Power Pam Allio. Stock Power
(http://www.stockpower
</P>
<P>
   .com) manages the Web site stock transactions for Home Depot and
focuses on helping large public companies develop a one-to-one
connection with shareholders. ``Anybody with a predisposed interest
in a company can be targeted for these plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Allio says Power Stock's e-commerce payment and communications
software lets public companies target the type of shareholders they
want to attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Home Depot wants to target architects,'' she says.
``They can put a banner on the AIA (American Institute of
Architects) Web site and drive traffic back to the Home Depot
site.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while Home Depot and Compaq are using Stock Power to
offer stock directly to customers, Allio says the service isn't a
replacement for either conventional or discount brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of service is aimed at the long-term investor. This
is for someone who likes the direct connection and likes to be
closer to the company. It's the (former Fidelity Investments fund
manager) Peter Lynch model. Buy what you know.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Gov. Miller to join two boards, is looking for more
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Zell Miller, his term of office just days from
ending, has been appointed to the corporate boards of two
Georgia-based companies: Gray Communications Systems and Post
Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will join the two boards of directors in mid-January,
shortly after his second term as governor expires, according to
separate company announcements made Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he hoped to join other corporate boards in the
future. ``I have got to piece together a livelihood, but I don't
want to get too strung out,'' he said. Miller also said he also
wants to devote time to teaching, as well as writing, after he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Gray Communications, based in Albany, operates 10 TV stations,
and the Albany Herald, Rockdale Citizen and Gwinnett Daily Post
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited about Gov. Miller's addition to the company's
board of directors,'' J. Mack Robinson, Gray's president, said in a
press release. ``His many years of experience in state government
as well as his many years dealing with both the television and the
newspaper media will enable him to make an immediate contribution
to the operations of our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller will earn the standard $12,000-per-year director's
compensation from Gray, plus $1,000 per meeting attended.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board currently includes Hilton Howell, CEO of
Atlantic American.
</P>
<P>
   Post Properties is one of the nation's largest luxury apartment
developers. It owns about 32,500 apartment homes in 96 communities
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Post's board of directors includes Arthur M. Blank, president
and chief executive of Home Depot; and Charles E. Rice, vice
chairman of Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Williams, chairman and CEO of Cobb County-based Post,
called Miller ``one of the most successful and innovative governors
in Georgia's history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that he has agreed to share his insight and
wisdom to help guide the future of Post Properties and the cities
and states we invest in,'' Williams said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's annual compensation for the Post board will also be
$12,000, plus a fee of $500 paid for each meeting attended.

THIS HIKING HAVEN IS HEAVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For all of you with new New Year's fitness
agendas, a holiday hike may be a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   Placerita Canyon State and County Park _ an understated and
largely underappreciated 350-acre parcel in Newhall _ offers just
what the armchair recreationist needs to motivate: natural scenery,
relative solitude, definitive quiet, flowing creeks, cultural
history and an 8-mile loop route that is aerobically challenging,
gaining nearly 1,700 feet in a 2}-mile segment.
</P>
<P>
   The ascent is not for the weak of spirit or body, but the
rewards are many, said Frank Hovore. Hovore is a volunteer docent
at the Placerita Canyon Nature Center who in 1972 helped cut the
Manzanita Mountain Trail, which with the Firebreak Ridge Trail
composes the most arduous third of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult trail,'' Hovore said. ``It's steep and
the hard-surfaced parts are slippery, so if you are in tennis shoes
you can lose your footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone considering it should have appropriate high-top boots
with ankle support and lug soles and be in good physical
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   No worries if you aren't already in shape; you will be well on
your way after completing this section.
</P>
<P>
   The other two-thirds of the loop combine a gentle stroll through
shaded Placerita Canyon and an ascent _ or descent, depending on
which direction you choose _ over the centuries-old Los Pinetos
Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Together it's a hike that is as complete as any in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very diverse from the flora point of view. You have the
riparian, chaparral and oak woodland. It's really neat,'' said
Teresa Proscewicz, who calls the loop ``my backyard trail'' since
it's only an 8-minute drive from her Canyon Country home.
</P>
<P>
   The hike described here commences at historic Walker Ranch
(elevation: 1,800 feet), accessed via a short trail or service road
from the hiker's entrance (1,870 feet) along Placerita Canyon Road
on the park's east side. It climbs Los Pinetos Trail to the south,
descends northwest over Firebreak Ridge and Manzanita Mountain
trails, then moves east across quaint Placerita Canyon Creek Trail
back to the outset.
</P>
<P>
   (However, I would strongly urge visitors consider hoofing the
opposite direction, because heading downhill on the Firebreak
Ridge/Manzanita Mountain section is so steep, the trail so unkempt
and the sandstone so slippery, it can be dangerous. ``You can see
your life flash in front of your eyes if you are not careful,''
Hovore said.)
</P>
<P>
   Get your workout started with a warmup on the Waterfall Trail, a
1{-mile round-trip spur off the main loop that provides one of the
park's most stellar snapshots _ a thin 30-foot cascade in a cool
canyon (2,050 feet). Coast live oak, buckwheat and foothill yucca
point the boulder-hemmed route that gets a tad tricky at its end.
</P>
<P>
   After taking in the romance of the desert waterfall, retrace
your steps through Los Pinetos Canyon, defined by its trickling
flows and stagnated pools, to Walker Ranch, where Frank Evans
Walker built a cabin in the early part of the century. His family
resided in the area until 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Resplendent with history, the park is also the site of
California's first gold rush, in 1842, according to the guidebook
``Trails of the Angeles.'' As the story goes, one Francisco Lopez
of neighboring Rancho San Francisco was resting below an oak tree
after chasing stray horses when he dug up gold nuggets that were
clinging to a cluster of wild onions. Centuries earlier the region
was home to the Alliklik Indians.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient Indian trail, Los Pinetos climbs 2{ miles toward its
namesake ridge (3,200 feet), passing under oaks and a few
single-plank benches that are plenty wide enough for respites. Turn
right at the water tank that flags Los Pinetos Spring (2,875 feet)
to find the ridge and the fire road _ now on Angeles National
Forest land _ that is labeled on maps as Whitney Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   Turn right on the fire road and take in the sweeping vistas of
the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys _ and, on clear days,
Santa Catalina Island and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada range.
Be careful to stay to the right at the confluence of the next fire
road and look for Firebreak Ridge Trail at a northern clearing in
the road marked by two squatty pines. A U.S. Forest Service sign
labeled simply ``trail'' is your last clue to the route, which
proceeds about 2} miles down to the nature center (1,550 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Two miles into the descent keep a keen eye out for the unsigned
junction to Manzanita Mountain Trail; an arrow in the dirt formed
from shotput-size rocks is your best hint.
</P>
<P>
   After the ankle-turning decline, have lunch at the nature center
and enjoy the red-tailed hawk and rattlesnake exhibits. Then cross
Placerita Canyon Creek to the south for the final 2-mile stretch
back to Walker Ranch and your rig parked on Placerita Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   The most delightful Placerita Canyon Creek Trail usually has
year-round water and a canopy of creekside vegetation. It's
refreshing to know that such an oasis exists in the otherwise dry,
unremarkable area known as the Santa Clarita Valley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING
</P>
<P>
   To reach Placerita Canyon State and County Park from the Golden
State Freeway (5), take the Antelope Valley Freeway (14), exit at
Placerita Canyon Road, turn right and drive 2 miles to the park
entrance on the right at 19152 W. Placerita Canyon Road in Newhall.
</P>
<P>
   Park at the nature center or continue on Placerita Canyon Road
another 2 miles to the gated hiker's entrance on the east end of
the park near Walker Ranch. The hiking loop can be accessed from
each spot; either way you will need to pick up a $3 parking permit
at the nature center.
</P>
<P>
   The loop is found on the Mint Canyon and San Fernando 7.5-minute
series topographic maps.
</P>
<P>
   The park is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; allow five hours to
complete the 8-mile loop trail and an additional hour to tackle the
1{ miles up and down the Waterfall Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The loop can be broken into any number of out-and-back tracks,
but the waterfall is particularly worthwhile; be warned it is a
rugged route not recommended for young or inexperienced hikers.
Bikes are not permitted in the park. Information: (805) 259-7721.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight camping is permitted where the loop enters the Angeles
National Forest _ and offshoots from there. Call the Tujunga Office
of the Los Angeles River Ranger District at (818) 899-1900 or the
forest's trails information line at (626) 574-5200 for seasonal
fire and permit regulations and any other specific queries.

COOLER WATERS DON'T CHILL FISH COUNTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While its cold-shouldered sister, La Nina, has
largely made El Nino a forgotten phenomenon, ocean anglers had a
banner year targeting exotic sport fish just the same.
</P>
<P>
   This year's warm water wasn't nearly as deep or dense as in 1997
_ when El Nino was at full strength _ but the tepid temperatures
historically span a two-year cycle. That fact was reflected in the
counts of sport-caught exotics; 1998 could yield top-five tallies
for three species _ bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna and yellowtail.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-December, 14,000 bluefin were boated, which should be
good enough for second best among annual counts since
record-keeping began, said Steve Crooke, senior marine biologist
for the Department of Fish and Game in Long Beach. Tops was 34,187
in 1956. The 1997 total by mid-December was 6,327.
</P>
<P>
   With a count of 65,900, this year's yellowfin harvest could
place as high as fourth on the all-time list. Best was 116,298 in
1983; second was 1997's 89,097.
</P>
<P>
   Some 247,800 yellowtail also were taken, which means it will
rank as the fourth or fifth best year for mossbacks. The record was
established in 1959 at 457,350. That total may have been eclipsed
by last year's bumper crop of forktails, though confirmation was
not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking a top-10 mark was the catch of 120,300 albacore, which
will be seven or eight notches below the 229,341 hooked in 1962.
The 1997 total through mid-December was 60,046.
</P>
<P>
   The year's biggest surprise (read: disappointment) was the low
numbers of dorado taken. Only 4,800 were reported, good for just
15th on the species' all-time list. The high mark was set in 1990
with 31,540; last year through this period anglers had 29,471
dodos.
</P>
<P>
   Note that Crooke bases his statistics on newspaper fish counts,
since the DFG's own logs are usually three months behind at any
given time. But newspapers don't record the catches from multiday
trips that are tallied by the DFG, so the 1998 fish counts listed
here are 10 percent to 20 percent lower than the official year-end
results will reflect come March.

U.S. RESPONDS TO IRAQI FIRE WITH ATTACK ON AIR DEFENSE BATTERY
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time this week, American fighter
jets attacked an Iraqi air-defense battery Wednesday as Iraq
carried out its threat to fire on American and British aircraft
patrolling ``no flight'' zones.
</P>
<P>
   Four F-16s struck three parts of a surface-to-air-missile site
outside the southern city of Talil after a squadron of American and
British warplanes detected the launching of six to eight
surface-to-air missiles, American military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters attacked with radar-seeking missiles and
laser-guided 500-pound bombs, and the Pentagon said initial
assessments suggested that a missile launcher and two vehicles had
been damaged. On Monday, American jets attacked and destroyed a
surface-to-air missile site in northern Iraq, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has tried to play down the
skirmishes as ineffectual efforts by President Saddam Hussein to
test American resolve, a senior defense official said Wednesday
that Iraq had moved eight new surface-to-air missile batteries into
the southern zone and six into the northern zone.
</P>
<P>
   After the exchanges Wednesday, the government-controlled Iraq
News Agency said Iraqi forces had repulsed an American-led attack
that left a farmer dead and two other civilians wounded. The agency
again claimed, as it did on Monday, that it was ``virtually
certain'' that Iraqi forces had shot down one of the attacking
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration dismissed Iraq's claims, saying that
all 24 American and British jets flying over southern Iraq on
Wednesday had returned safely to their bases. And while pilots take
any surface-to-air missiles seriously, the missiles Wednesday never
seriously threatened the warplanes overhead, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies created the zones in northern
and southern Iraq after the Persian Gulf War to protect Iraqi
ethnic groups facing repression from Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials said they believed that
Saddam was hoping to weaken international support for the ``no
flight'' zones and, perhaps, to boost morale inside Iraq after four
nights of American and British air and missile strikes earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   One official said Iraq had made similar provocations in the wake
of American strikes in 1993 and 1996 and speculated that the
skirmishes would not continue much longer. ``They're for internal
consumption,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's defense minister, George Robertson, said Wednesday
that British and American pilots would continue to enforce the
zones and retaliate if challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's war machine was badly damaged by the recent campaign
of military action against his regime, and this latest gesture of
arrogance and defiance is a sign of his weakness,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Iraqi challenges have focused attention on the
American and British patrols, which are conducted from bases in
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and from aircraft carriers plying
the Persian Gulf. France, which joined in the creation of the
zones, stopped flying its Mirage jets based in Saudi Arabia after
the American and British strikes began on Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin reiterated Russia's
strong opposition to the raids and the continued clashes in a
40-minute telephone conversation with President Clinton. It was the
first time the two presidents had spoken since the strikes began.
In the aftermath of those strikes, Clinton had tried to get Yeltsin
on the phone, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Council's spokesman, David C. Leavy, said
Clinton explained to Yeltsin why the United States believed force
was necessary. Leavy said the two also discussed Russia's economic
crisis and its parliament's new delays in ratifying the second
strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start II.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agreed, despite the differences over Iraq, that it is
essential to continue to strengthen the relationship,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident Wednesday began about 9:30 a.m. local time when
four British Tornado jets saw the first of several surface-to-air
missiles being launched, officials said. The F-16s, which were
nearby, also detected the missiles. It was not clear which aircraft
were their intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   During the four nights of raids, American and British pilots
repeatedly tried to hit surface-to-air missile batteries. But they
destroyed only half of 16 sites they attacked. In the two clashes
since then, pilots have hit both batteries that fired missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq may be relying on a lucky shot to bring down an American
jet and its pilot. Several times in the last few days, Iraqi MiG
fighter jets and helicopters have flown into the zones, apparently
trying to lure American fighters toward surface-to-air missile
sites, Pentagon officials said.

 &HT;    Christian college students minister to Atlanta's poor
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sitting on the stoop of a run-down apartment in the
run-down Valleys of Conway complex, Angel Moore and Tenille King,
two college students from Washington, D.C., pondered what had
brought them to Atlanta this freezing holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   They had just sent the child they were talking to upstairs to
get his coat. When he and his sister came down, they showered them
with candy and urged them to tell their parents to come down to
hear about God and get some food.
</P>
<P>
   For them, food for the body came with food for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for college students to come down
and serve the community and witness to people for the Lord,'' said
Moore, 21, a sophomore at Trinity College. ``There are a lot of
things going on in D.C. that I could be doing, but coming here
gives me a chance to come together with other black students and
help people. If I can figure out how to better serve our community,
I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 African-American college students from 43
states, were in Atlanta this week as members of Impact, a part of
the Campus Crusade for Christ International that focuses on
African-American students and issues important to the
African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-day Impact98 conference that ends today,
students listened to speakers and attended seminars on topics like
the community, church, economics and spirituality. The bi-annual
conferences have been held in Atlanta four times since the first
one in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was community outreach day, so each of the 2,500
students fanned out across more than 30 of Atlanta's poorest
neighborhoods, identified by local churches, to deliver 850 ``Boxes
of Love,'' each filled with 28 pounds of food and a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these students are from privileged backgrounds. Some
of them have never seen the projects,'' said Joyce Bray, director
of the CCCI-affiliated Here's Life Inner City-Atlanta, a locally
based ministry. ``This puts their faith in action.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Valleys of Conway, an Atlanta apartment complex where
more than half of the 258 units are unoccupied, burned out and
boarded up, Moore and King led a group of about seven students from
the D.C. area through the occupied units to preach the gospel and
give out food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great impact here,'' said King, 22, a junior at the
University of District of Columbia. ``I used to live in Barry
Farms, the baddest projects in D.C. I always knew we would get out
and I knew when I got out, I would return one day to help those
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside of the boarded up building that served as the
pick-up station for the food, Valleys of Conway resident Anna
Mitchell watched amid a sea of her neighbors praying and picking up
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so great that they are doing this,'' said Mitchell,
her box of food tucked beneath her arm. ``I have received a
blessing today from these kids.

 By SERGIO R. BUSTOS 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  &HT;    New Mexico. Vermont. The U.S. Virgin Islands. Five years after
NAFTA went into effect, these were the only states and the only
U.S. territory to hear the ``great sucking sound,'' a phrase
uttered and made famous by former presidential candidate Ross Perot
in reference to the loss of U.S. jobs due to NAFTA.
 &HT;    Overall, according to a recent study done by the U.S.
Congressional Research Service, the United States had a ``net
gain'' of an estimated 680,000 jobs since NAFTA took effect in
January 1994. This more than offset the 191,000 jobs ``certified''
as lost by the U.S. Department of Labor. NAFTA-related job gains
represented 6 percent of the 12 million new jobs created since the
beginning of NAFTA.
 &HT;    About 1.7 million jobs were created in Mexico since mid-1995,
according to Mexican government figures. Moreover, unemployment in
Mexico fell from nearly 8 percent in 1995 to just over 3 percent in
July.
 &HT;    Despite the rosy government figures on both sides of the border,
leading U.S. labor organizations, especially the AFL-CIO, argue
that NAFTA has yet to fulfill its promises of job creation. They
say the side agreements related to labor have been ``ineffective.''
 &HT;    ``We see not only lost jobs, but lost job opportunities because
of NAFTA,'' says Thea Lee, assistant director of international
economics at the AFL-CIO, who says the United States continues to
import far more than it exports to Canada and Mexico.
 &HT;    ``Lots of people look at the growth in exports and not at the
growth in imports, but that's like watching a baseball game and
only noting the score of one team,'' she says.
 &HT;    For example, says Lee, if the United States exports certain auto
parts to Mexico, the workers who build the parts exported are
counted as having gained jobs. But if the automaker laid off
workers because the assembly plant was moved from Michigan to
Mexico, then jobs were, in fact, lost. ``These aren't newly created
jobs, they are auto workers who lost an assembly job and are now
making auto parts instead...We believe that the U.S. is losing good
jobs and gaining less than good jobs.''
 &HT;    Overall, NAFTA's impact on the U.S. economy, has been
``relatively small,'' says Mary Jane Bolle, an international trade
specialist with the Congressional Research Service. Trade with
Canada and Mexico, the first and third-largest U.S. trade partners,
account for just 20 percent of overall U.S. trade, she says.
 &HT;    ``Larger effects on the overall U.S. economy result from
structural changes taking place as companies shed employment due to
trade and other economic factors,'' Bolle wrote in a report
submitted to the U.S. Congress in September.
 &HT;    Interestingly enough, Bolle found that NAFTA actually boosted
U.S. jobs in manufacturing, a sector critics often predicted would
suffer most under NAFTA. Again, using U.S. Commerce Department
figures, an estimated half of the 680,000 export-related jobs
gained as a result of NAFTA were in the manufacturing sector.
 &HT;    ``It can be argued that NAFTA may have made a significant
contribution to the manufacturing employment turnaround,'' says
Bolle.
 &HT;    Still, not all economic sectors enjoyed such a revival. The
biggest losers were in the apparel and electronics industries,
where more than 78,000 jobs disappeared, representing about 40
percent of all job losses.
 &HT;    The U.S. government figures appear to reinforce the findings of
other studies and surveys done on NAFTA's effects on labor. For
example, in a widely circulated survey conducted by the Bank of
Montreal, more than nine in 10 North American business executives
interviewed said they had either hired more workers or kept the
same number since the beginning of NAFTA.
 &HT;    Only 9 percent reported laying off workers. The survey, released
last March, included interviews with 361 companies in Mexico,
Canada and the United States.
 &HT;    ``Instead of the promised 'sucking sound' of vanishing jobs,
what we hear are the winds of opportunity for millions of workers
across the continent, due to enlightened policies and strong
economic growth,'' said Bank of Montreal Vice Chair Jeff Chisholm
in releasing the survey.

 &HT;    Ga. boom in growth continues, census stats show
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia is the fastest growing state in the South and
the third fastest in the country, according to population figures
issued today by the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second consecutive year Georgia has held those spots.
And it's the seventh year in a row the state had about 2 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Nevada grew 4.1 percent to make it the
fastest-growing state for the 13th consecutive year. Arizona
trailed in second place with 2.5 percent growth. Population
declined in Pennsylvania, North Dakota, West Virginia and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Census estimates for states tracked the movement of people
across the country from July 1997 to July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise I think in these numbers is there's no change,''
said University of Georgia demographer Doug Bachtel. Growth in
Georgia ``just keeps coming. ... It speaks to a number of things _
job opportunities, quality of life and transportation, with
Hartsfield, the ports and the highways.''
</P>
<P>
   From July to July, Georgia added 152,225 people. Take them all
for baseball, they would fill Turner Field slightly more than three
times. Bachtel and other people watchers wonder how long the growth
boom will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``These places that are growing the fastest will eventually slow
down,'' Census demographer Marc Perry said. ``None of these trends
will stay the same.''

<P>
   Cinco anos despues que el NAFTA (TLC) entro en vigor, Nuevo
Mexico, Vermont y las Islas Virgenes de Estados Unidos son los
unicos estados y el unico territorio de EU donde se perdieron
empleos debido al pacto comercial.
</P>
<P>
   En general, segun un estudio reciente del Servicio de
Investigacion del Congreso, Estados Unidos tuvo una ganancia neta
de 680.000 empleos desde que se implemento el TLC en enero de 1994.
Esa cifra compensa con creces los 191.000 empleos que el
Departamento del Trabajo certifico como perdidos. Los empleos
aportados por el TLC representaron el 6 por ciento de los 12
millones de puestos creados desde el inicio del acuerdo.
</P>
<P>
   En Mexico se han creado 1,7 millones de empleos desde mediados
de 1995, segun cifras del gobierno mexicano. Ademas, el desempleo
en ese pais bajo de casi el 8 por ciento en 1995 a poco mas del 3
por ciento en julio.
</P>
<P>
   A pesar de las optimistas cifras gubernamentales a ambos lados
de la frontera, las organizaciones sindicales norteamericanas,
especialmente la AFL-CIO, afirman que el TLC aun no ha cumplido su
promesa de creacion de empleos. Dicen que los acuerdos colaterales
sobre el sector laboral han sido ``ineficaces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No solo vemos perdida de empleos, sino tambien perdida de
oportunidades de empleo debido al TLC,'' dice Thea Lee, directora
adjunta de economia internacional de la AFL-CIO, y cita que EU
sigue importando mucho mas de lo que exporta a Canada y Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muchos ven el aumento de las exportaciones y no el de las
importaciones, pero eso equivale a ver un juego de beisbol y
fijarse en la anotacion de uno solo de los dos equipos,'' comenta.
</P>
<P>
   Por ejemplo, dice Lee, si EU exporta ciertas piezas automotrices
a Mexico, se cuenta a los obreros que fabricaron las piezas
exportadas como empleos ganados. Pero si el fabricante despide a un
grupo de obreros porque la planta de ensamblaje se traslado de
Michigan a Mexico, entonces los empleos en realidad se perdieron.
``Estos no son empleos recien creados: son trabajadores que
perdieron un empleo de ensamblaje y ahora fabrican piezas
automotrices. Opinamos que Estados Unidos esta perdiendo buenos
empleos y consiguiendo empleos malos.''
</P>
<P>
   Sin embargo, el efecto del TLC en la economia de EU ha sido
``relativamente pequeno,'' dice Mary Jane Bolle, especialista de
comercio internacional del Servicio de Investigacion del Congreso.
El comercio con Canada y Mexico, el primer y tercer socio comercial
de EU, respectivamente, representa solo el 20 por ciento del
comercio total estadounidense, afirma Bolle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los efectos mayores en la economia de EU provienen de cambios
estructurales cuando las companias eliminan puestos de trabajo
debido al comercio y a otros factores economicos,'' escribio Bolle
en un informe presentado al Congreso estadounidense en septiembre.
</P>
<P>
   Bolle determino que el TLC en realidad aumento los empleos de
manufactura en EU, sector que segun muchos criticos seria el mas
afectado. Pero segun el Departamento de Comercio, aproximadamente
la mitad de los 680.000 empleos relacionados con la exportacion que
creo el TLC pertenecen al sector manufacturero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Se puede afirmar que el TLC puede haber dado un gran aporte a
la creacion de empleos en la manufactura,'' dice Bolle.
</P>
<P>
   Sin embargo, no todos los sectores disfrutaron de una identica
reanimacion. Los mayores perdedores en el terreno de los empleos
fueron las industrias de la ropa y de la electronica, donde
desaparecieron mas de 78.000 puestos de trabajo, alrededor del 40
por ciento de todas las perdidas de empleos.
</P>
<P>
   Las cifras del gobierno estadounidense parecen reforzar los
hallazgos de otros estudios y encuestas sobre el efecto del TLC en
el sector laboral. Por ejemplo, en un sondeo de gran circulacion
realizado por el Bank of Montreal, mas de nueve de cada diez
ejecutivos norteamericanos entrevistados dijeron que habian
contratado mas trabajadores o que habian mantenido el mismo numero
de empleados desde que el TLC entro en vigor. Solo el 9 por ciento
despidio a empleados. La encuesta, divulgada en marzo del ano
pasado, contiene entrevistas con 361 empresas en Mexico, Canada y
Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   ``En vez del ruido de los empleos que escapan, lo que escuchamos
son los vientos de la oportunidad para millones de trabajadores en
todo el continente, debido a las politicas visionarias y al
vigoroso crecimiento economico,'' dijo Jeff Chisholm,
vicepresidente del directorio de Bank of Montreal.

 &HT;    England's holiday revels a bawdy, bountiful escape
 &HT;    By Colin Campbell
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROAD CAMPDEN, England _ Our big New Year's fantasy of a few
months back was to find some fabulous old inn or Elizabethan
mansion _ one with soft beds, modern plumbing and a roaring
fireplace _ and just take the place over (family, friends,
children) for a week of feasting and hiking after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a nice way to close the book on our months in
Britain. It would have been practice for the millennium. It would
have been an orgy of Englishness, quaintness, quietness and beauty
before flying home to greet the brash weirdness of America again.
</P>
<P>
   Stupidly, I failed to realize Brits like to holiday in beautiful
old inns as much as we do. We quickly discovered (despite whole
magazines filled with great country places to rent) that they
tended be fully booked, or hostile to kids, or revoltingly
expensive, or excessively remote, or nothing worth writing home
about, or susceptible to freezing rain.
</P>
<P>
   We began thinking about staying home for New Year's in our bare
one-bathtub rented Victorian house. And we began eying the growing
stocks of wild game at the old covered market in downtown Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   There has been enough venison on display there lately (cubed for
stews, sliced as steaks, rolled into roasts, hanging as huge
unbutchered elk-sized carcases) to turn this animal-loving
country's stomach. There have been unplucked pheasants bright as
museum still-lifes, partridges by the heap, warrens of soft brown
rabbits with hoods over their heads _ not to mention the domestic
beasts in medieval poses: pigs' heads grinning from platters,
half-plucked free-range turkeys hanging from the walls, newly
killed geese piled into plastic dumpsters.
</P>
<P>
   For a country that loves animals and supposedly hates cruelty as
much as the English do, holiday eating habits represent the most
paradoxical sort of carnage. An atavistic, blood-loving carnival
seems to have broken out. We've noticed another odd thing about
holiday Britain. Is there another sophisticated country today in
which newspaper columnists talk so much about how drunk they got
the other night?
</P>
<P>
   It's like a throwback to the comedians of the '50s. Back in
America such talk has practically vanished: Alcohol is bad,
disgusting, a burden on other people's insurance rates, the cause
of violence and traffic deaths, something never to be laughed at or
even discussed, a waste of money, un-Baptist, un-Islamic,
un-Jewish, anti-Zen, fat-making, the opposite of glamorous. Being
in England over the holidays is like witnessing an eruption from
the primitive, dangerous, pre-puritanical past. The holidays
advanced, even so, and we soon learned a thing or two about how
much the staid English love games, pranks, puppet shows, charades
and bawdy reviews during the winter holidays. When strangers came
caroling, they nearly demanded to be let in, under threat of
mischief. It's like our Halloween. The demand, in a famous carol,
``So give us some figgy pudding,'' means give us a treat, or else.
</P>
<P>
   Every small town, moreover, seems to have its own live
``pantomime.''
</P>
<P>
   We took the kids to see one the other day. It turned out to be a
full-fledged musical-comedy burlesque of Cinderella _ and several
characters, such as the wicked stepsisters, were played by guys in
drag, another sign of the season's remnant wildness. The show was
pretty funny. But I doubt its double entendres would be allowed
even in New York these days, much less in small-town America.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as though by a poof of some fairy godmother's wand, we
got a second chance to flee our cold kitchen at New Year's to a
lovely, peaceful, 300-year-old golden-stone inn called the Malt
House, in a tiny little village in the Cotswolds called Broad
Campden.
</P>
<P>
   There's a pub in the village, tucked away in the rolling hills,
that has a fireplace so big you can sit in it, and a card game that
has lasted longer than the fire, and the best food I've tasted at
any pub.
</P>
<P>
   There's an old Quaker meeting house, a Norman chapel that has
been turned into a tall-windowed private house, and a few ancient
stone cottages.
</P>
<P>
   The silence is deafening. You rarely see a car. Only the crows
shout.
</P>
<P>
   And I doubt if any beds in the village are softer than those in
the Malt House, or any fireplaces cozier than those crackling in
the inn's entrance hall and in the parlor and in the beamed dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can their food be tastier than the inn's. Our New Year's Eve
menu, designed by a chef who could easily be famous in London,
consists of locally smoked salmon with aubergine Provencal and
chive creme fraiche; fois gras with green tomato chutney; Scottish
venison with sweet potato and mushy peas in red currant sauce;
grilled monkfish with timbale of peppers and basil jus; minted
orange soup; English and Irish cheeses, and warm chocolate tart
with honey ice cream. There's also a large wine cellar. And
although the genius-chef suggested in his New Year's flier that
children weren't 100 percent welcome, he changed his mind a few
days ago. Or perhaps his parents, who own the place, changed it for
him.
</P>
<P>
   In gratitude, I've resolved, bright and early on Jan. 1, to
remove my little screamers from the premises and take them on a
walk, rain or shine, across the nearest ancient meadow.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Campbell is living in England temporarily while his wife
does research at Oxford University.

VOODOO   SPIRITS AT HOME IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Optional trim in 2nd take.) 
(DW) 
 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every day except Sunday, when she goes to church,
Mama Lola ambles down several flights of stairs to a tiny basement
altar beside the washer-dryer in her three-story home in Brooklyn.
She passes a sugar-cane stalk, symbol, she says, of ``sweet good
luck,'' and a small statue of St. Lazarus, representing the Haitian
divinity Legba, the gatekeeper between spirit and material worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Papa,'' she says. ``He's the one who opens the door.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mama Lola, as for tens of thousands of other Haitian
 &UR;  &LR; emigres who ``serve the spirits'' of voodoo in New York City,
basements are sacred places. In this neglected space closest to the
earth, the 62-year-old matriarch and fifth-generation mambo, or
voodoo priestess, has created a one-stop-shopping center for the
spirit, in which every square inch is packed with ritual objects
used for healing work: sequined whisky bottles, wobbly candles,
blinking lights, statuettes in the shape of gorillas, pink plastic
necklaces, medicine bundles bound with satin, ribbon and feathers,
shiny perfume bottles and a dusty blowfish skeleton hanging from a
heating pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel comfortable?'' she, this Julia Child of voodoo, asks,
taking off her shoes before she enters the room. ``I have plenty of
spirits in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Home altars and basement temples with earthen floors are
flourishing throughout East Flatbush, Crown Heights and Canarsie,
Brooklyn, in eastern Queens and other neighborhoods where some
500,000 Haitian people live, said Dr. Henry Frank, executive
director of the Haitian Centers Council, a nonprofit social
services organization in Brooklyn. In contrast to the freestanding
temples of rural Haiti, temples in New York, where space is tight,
are tucked into homes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number is unknown because of the secretive nature
of voodoo, some estimate there are thousands of altars and hundreds
of basement temples, as the religion draws a new multicultural
generation. Paul Dorsinville, the deacon of Sacred Heart of Jesus
Roman Catholic Church in Cambria Heights, Queens, said that of
1,000 Haitian families in his parish, ``about half the people are
practicing both voodoo and some form of Christianity, mixing them
in some Edenic fashion, and more and more are willing to
acknowledge that they are practitioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceremonial spaces like Mama Lola's also have attracted scholarly
attention, most notably in ``Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou,'' an
exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History through Jan.
3, which has been embraced by the public, including Haitians.
(Vodou is the Creole spelling of an African word for spirit.)
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the ``most misunderstood religions in the world,''
said Karen McCarthy Brown, an anthropologist at Drew University,
the author of ``Mama Lola: A Vodou Priestess in Brooklyn''
(University of California Press, 1991).
</P>
<P>
   She called voodoo a healing-based religion, which emerged among
African slaves working 18th-century Haitian sugar plantations. In
bondage, they assembled found objects to create spiritual and
esthetic riches. ``Out of torn lace, sequins, feathers and empty
whisky bottles,'' writes Donald J. Cosentino, co-curator of the
exhibition, ``they made working models of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo blended African religions, including those of the Yoruba
and Fon, with French colonial Catholicism. Practitioners associate
voodoo spirits with Catholic saints, but the church does not
sanction voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo's deep connection to its West African roots has
contributed to suspicion and fear of it, said McCarthy Brown. The
understanding most Americans have of voodoo is derived mainly from
``novels, films and television, where images of sorcerers, zombi,
snakes, blood and violence abound,'' she wrote. ``Popular culture
dwells on images of voodoo's malevolence, an attitude as
nonsensical as equating Catholicism with satanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout voodoo's history it has had its dark side. ``Voodoo
shouldn't be looked upon as some variant of a charming folk
Catholicism,'' said Cosentino, the curator. ``It is what it needs
to be _ the religion of a creative and desperate people. Sometimes
to heal you have to use desperate measures, like spells.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitian politicians, especially Francois Duvalier, known as Papa
Doc, manipulated voodoo's association with black magic as a means
of political repression.

   As expressed in New York homes, voodoo is a vibrant but gentler
faith _ ``to the extent that life in New York is not quite so
desperate as it is in Haiti,'' said Cosentino. He calls it ``equal
parts happening and psychoanalysis,'' with festive cakes to feed
the spirits and drummers to lift the energy level.

   In Mama Lola's altar room in Brooklyn, where she works barefoot
serving the ``loa'' (pronounced loo-WAH), or spirits, she ministers
to clients seeking help _ among them Koreans, Japanese,
Italian-Americans and African-Americans. The room is filled with
``demann,'' or prayer requests, which can include everything from
help with the Immigration Service to the name of an errant husband
written 21 times on a piece of paper. Through card divination and
prayer, Mama Lola creates spiritual recipes. In the case of an
angry husband, for example, she might make a charm (wanga) using
sugar syrup to sweeten him up and ice to cool him down.
</P>
<P>
   Each shelf is dedicated to a particular spirit family: Rada,
considered ``cool'' and ``sweet'' spirits from West Africa; Petro,
a hot-tempered family derived from slavery experience, and Gede,
trickster spirits of sex, death and humor, headed by a deity Mama
Lola calls Bone. Bone smokes filterless cigarettes, likes to talk
dirty and is represented by flaking plaster skulls, cigarette packs
and Barbancourt rum. (Voodoo spirits possess human foibles, adding
to their appeal.)
</P>
<P>
   Mama Lola restyles the space periodically, recently with silver
Con-Tact paper ``for beautiness.'' The most sacred object in the
room is the ``ason,'' a gourd rattle with a bell attached to summon
the Rada spirits. It is encircled with rainbow-color beads and
python vertebrae, alluding to Damballa, the serpent deity
associated with wisdom.

   Mama Lola has had to adapt her religion to New York, with

   In the last decade, voodoo chic has set in among Westerners
seeking exotica, from an embrace of Haitian roots music through
bands like Ram and Boukman Eksperyans, to SoHo gallery owners
buying up sequined voodoo flags and marketing them as ``outsider
art'' at white-wine-and-satay openings. ``Americans are spiritual
questers,'' said Prof. McCarthy Brown, who compared voodoo's appeal
to psychotherapy. ``Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of Haitians from Boston to Miami also has
discovered voodoo, a religion many of their parents rejected. For
instance, Dorothy Desir Davis, 39, a curator and scholar who lives
in Harlem, was born in Haiti but moved to New York at 5, attending
Barnard College and then graduate school at Bard College. As a
middle-class Ivy Leaguer _ and the daughter-in-law of Ruby Dee and
Ossie Davis _ she is, in her words, ``not a typical vodouissant.''
</P>
<P>
   She was recently initiated as a voodoo priestess, a ritual that
she said ``has to be juggled between vacation time and comp time.''
The altar she designed for her Victorian home, shared with her
husband Guy Davis, a blues musician, and their son, Marcial, 8, is
reminiscent of another priestess _ Martha Stewart. Ms. Desir Davis
said she embraced the religion of her roots after troubling dreams
of deceased members of her family.
</P>
<P>
   Her involvement in voodoo upsets her father, Dr. Wilfrid Desir,
a physician. He fled Haiti in 1959, during the Duvalier regime,
after numerous college-educated friends and relatives disappeared.
His daughter says that voodoo has helped her ``to acknowledge the
past,'' reconnecting her to Haitian history, religion and art. Her
father sympathizes. ``I think she is searching for her Haitian
identity. The young came here as babies.'' But he added, wistfully,
``She should have embraced it as a scholar and not as a believer.''

   In Mama Lola's living room, hangs a photograph of President
Clinton. Just as she prescribes a mixture of onion and brown sugar
for her baby granddaughter's cough, so she sees the president in
need of professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man is going to have regret buried in his chest,'' she
said, shaking her head. ``I would tell him to give us a call.''

FTC APPROVES AMOCO-BRITISH PETROLEUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal regulators approved the proposed purchase
of Amoco by British Petroleum PLC Wednesday after extracting a
handful of minor antitrust concessions from the new company, which
will become the world's third-largest petroleum company.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Federal Trade Commission cleared the final
obstacle to the deal, which is expected to close on Thursday. It
will be the largest foreign acquisition of an American company
ever, and it immediately raised the question of whether regulators
will impose any significant obstacles on the far larger proposed
acquisition of Mobil by Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   By a unanimous vote, the four commissioners ordered British
Petroleum and Amoco, which will be called BP Amoco PLC, to sell 134
gas stations in eight markets and nine petroleum terminals. The
terminals will be sold to Williams Cos. In addition, an additional
1,600 independent and franchise dealers in 30 markets in the
Southeast and Midwest are free to end their agreements with the two
companies and seek better deals with their competitors. The two
companies sell gasoline through a total of 16,000 stations in the
United States, which represents about 16 percent of the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   The American depository receipts of British Petroleum plunged by
the end of the day as managers of index funds sold shares of Amoco,
which will be replaced by Firstar Corp. in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index once Amoco is acquired by British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amoco plunged $3.25, to $54.75. Adam Sieminski, an
analyst at BT Alex. Brown, said Amoco dragged down the American
depository receipts of British Petroleum, which fell $6.75, to
$83.1875. He added that British Petroleum had been bid up earlier
by index fund managers in Britain because the new company will be a
larger factor in the FTSE Index on the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Wednesday's closing stock price, the deal is worth
$52.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to predict whether the regulators would impose
any significant obstacles to the proposed acquisition of Mobil by
Exxon. On the one hand, the further consolidation of the industry
by the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco suggests that vigorous
antitrust enforcement could require big divestitures by Exxon and
Mobil to satisfy the regulators. But on the other hand, Wednesday's
decision continues the trend of the antitrust officials not to
impose serious impediments to deals in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials at the FTC, which has only just begun its review
of the Exxon-Mobil deal, cautioned Wednesday not to read anything
into their decision because the two mergers present different
issues. They said the wave of consolidation in the oil industry had
prompted them to be vigilant to antitrust issues but that it was
far too soon to make generalizations about the proposed Exxon-Mobil
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do these things one at a time,'' said Robert Pitofsky,
chairman of the FTC. ``You have to look at each one of these deals
on its own bottom. When there is an industry trend toward
consolidation, like there is here, we are required to look at these
deals particularly closely. But it would be an overreaction to say
what we did in this situation may or may not have an impact on
another case. These reviews turn to a remarkable extent on the
particular facts of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the government at the very least to require
Exxon and Mobil to sell some gas stations and refineries, but
whether they will be significant in number and whether more must be
divested to satisfy regulators may not become known for months.
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of about $140 billion, BP Amoco
will rank third in the oil industry behind Exxon-Mobil and Royal
Dutch/Shell Group. Pitofsky said he had been struck in the British
Petroleum-Amoco merger by the fact that the two companies were
``more complementary than competitive'' because ``BP has a powerful
presence in Europe and Amoco has a powerful presence in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the two have limited markets of competition, he said, the
modifications imposed on the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco
would, in his words, be modest for a deal valued at $52.4 billion.

ARGENTINE JUDGE STEPS UP `DIRTY WAR' KIDNAPPING PROBE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ With the arrest of two more retired
senior naval officers this week, an Argentine federal judge appears
to be expanding his inquiry into accusations that the armed forces
systematically kidnapped the children of dissidents in the ``dirty
war'' against leftists in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Former Adm. Ruben Franco, 71, who commanded the navy for a time
during Argentina's seven-year military dictatorship, was arrested
Monday on suspicion that he was a central organizer of the
kidnappings of an estimated 230 babies. On Tuesday a retired navy
captain, Jorge Eduardo Acosta, 56, formerly a top officer at a
clandestine torture center at the Navy Mechanics School, gave
himself up after two weeks on the run.
</P>
<P>
   A total of nine officers, including the junta leaders, Gen.
Jorge Rafael Videla, 72, and Adm. Emilio Massera, 73, have been
arrested, detained or summoned to court this year for their
suspected involvement in the baby-snatching scheme. Federal Judge
Adolfo Bagnasco, who is prosecuting the case, has a list of 30
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, scores of women who happened to be
pregnant were seized for political reasons, then taken to a
maternity cell in the Navy Mechanics School and forced into labor
or forced to have caesarean sections. They were then killed,
usually dumped alive into the ocean or shot and buried in secret
graves.
</P>
<P>
   Their children were handed over to childless wives of military
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group, has
found about 60 young adults who were taken at birth, and 30 have
been reunited with their families.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the suspects are now frail elderly men who,
during their prime, were among the most powerful and feared men in
Argentina. Several are also wanted by Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish
judge seeking the extradition from Britain of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, for their alleged
involvement in the murders of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Saul Menem pardoned top military officers for
their involvement in the dirty war soon after he was first elected
in 1989. His action was criticized by human rights advocates, but
his backers said it was the only way to stop a series of military
coup attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's pardon, however, did not cover the kidnapping of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta told Bagnasco that the children born in the Navy
Mechanics School were given back to their families. He told
reporters that the case was part of a ``propaganda campaign,''
adding, ``This is a direct attack on the Argentine armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Acosta was held in custody for five months in 1987 on charges of
torture and making illegal arrests, but was cleared of those
charges under Menem's amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The military high command, which has tried to distance itself
from crimes of the past, has been shaken by the flurry of arrests
as well as a separate investigation into illegal arms sales to
Ecuador and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been grumbling by retired officers and some
junior officers, the high command has made no official comment on
the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   This week Gen. Martin Balza, the armed forces chief, withdrew a
libel suit against the leader of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,
a human rights group of mothers of the disappeared, saying he hoped
to contribute ``a small grain of sand to the process of national
reconciliation.''

DRUGSTORE OWNERS SUE HPHC, CVS CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A group of independent drugstore owners went to court
Wednesday with their longstanding complaint that unfair
reimbursement policies by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Inc. and CVS
Corp. are driving small pharmacies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In a private antitrust lawsuit filed in US District Court in
Boston, the owners of four small drugstores allege that Harvard
Pilgrim, CVS, and a pair of affiliated organizations have benefited
from unfair repayment policies that for years made CVS the sole
source of prescription drugs for the 1.1 million Massachusetts
members of Harvard Pilgrim, the state's largest HMO.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting loss of business has cost smaller drugstores
millions of dollars and has driven out of business about 100
independent druggists in Massachusetts over the last three years,
so that only 300 or so remain today, a plaintiffs' lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim and CVS, the giant drugstore chain based in
Woonsocket, R.I., have denied in the past that their practices are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The issue appeared to be resolved in March, when Harvard Pilgrim
opened its pharmacy network and said it would begin reimbursing
drugstores other than CVS who fill prescriptions for its members.
The changes were undertaken to settle earlier lawsuits brought by
several large drugstore chains, including Osco and the Brooks
Pharmacy unit of Maxi Drug Inc. of Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rule changes, the small druggists allege that they
still aren't receiving the ``prices, terms and conditions'' offered
to CVS network pharmacies, according to the complaint. The
plaintiffs contend that the failure to live up to the agreement
violates antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Harvard Pilgrim and for CVS said the companies
hadn't seen the suit and couldn't respond to it directly.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard Pilgrim spokesman Alan Raymond said his organization
rejects the charge that it discriminates in its pricing. He said
that since the new billing rules went into effect this year, more
than 100 independently-owned pharmacies have joined Harvard
Pilgrim's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed our contracts were consistent with
state law,'' he said. Citing the new pharmacies that have signed
up, he said, ``We don't believe there are grounds for complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and lawyers' fees and asks
the court to require the defendants to further disclose their
distribution arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by four small retailers who are members of the
Boston Association of Retail Druggists, seeks class-action status
on behalf of other independent pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   The four plaintiffs are the J. E. Pierce Apothecary Inc. of
Brookline; the Sutherland Pharmacy Inc. in Brighton; the
Meetinghouse Community Pharmacy in Dorchester; and the Medfield
Pharmacy inc. of Medfield. The latter ceased operations in July
1997, allegedly as a result of the practices of the defendants,
according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also request damages for exclusive arrangements
prior to the rule changes. According to the complaint, agreements
in effect from 1995 to 1998 amounted to a ``conspiracy consisting
of a group boycott'' of small pharmacies by the HMO, arranged by
CVS. On this charge, the plaintiffs cite a 1994 state law that was
meant to open markets to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Harvard Pilgrim and CVS, the suit names as a defendant
Health New England Inc., an HMO based in Springfield that is
jointly owned by Harvard Pilgrim and the Baystate Health Systems
hospital group in Springfield. In addition, the suit names as a
defendant Pharmacare Management Services Inc., a Lincoln, R.I.,
company that administers pharmacy benefits for Harvard Pilgrim and
Health New England. A majority of Pharmacare is owned by CVS.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Health New England and Pharmacare didn't return
calls seeking comment.

 &HT;    Date for election to replace Gingrich planned
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Zell Miller will announce plans Monday for
scheduling the election to replace U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich
(R-Marietta), who resigned his congressional seat, state officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who also resigned as House Speaker, notified Miller in
November, and Miller immediately responded. But the governor
decided to wait until after the speaker finishes his term Jan. 3
before setting the election date, said Mark Cohen, Miller's
executive counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The election must be held at least 30 days after the governor's
order calling for the special vote.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that residents of the 6th District, which covers
parts of Cobb, Cherokee, Fulton and Gwinnett counties, will not
have a representative in Congress when the next session convenes
Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   For the election to fill Gingrich's seat, the secretary of state
has authority to choose a partisan or nonpartisan election and must
announce the decision within 10 days of the governor's order. But
Miller and Secretary of State Lewis Massey have agreed a
nonpartisan election is appropriate, considering the precedents,
Massey spokesman Chris Riggall said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonpartisian congressional elections were scheduled after Rep.
Larry McDonald was killed in the crash of an aircraft shot down
over Korea in 1983 and after Rep. Andrew Young was appointed U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   To win a special nonpartisan election, a candidate must receive
more than 50 percent of the vote in either a general or runoff
election.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Miller could wait and let Gov.-elect Roy Barnes
call the election. Barnes' inauguration Jan. 11 falls within the
10-day legal window for issuing the order.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Barnes said Miller had made it clear he
would handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the House Ethics Committee announced Gingrich
has made the final $150,000 payment on a $300,000 penalty for
violations of House rules. The penalty was imposed in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich admitted he misled the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct and should have sought better legal advice before
using tax-exempt organizations to advance his political goals.

U.S. JOINS 2ND WHISTLE-BLOWER SUIT AGAINST HEALTH-CARE GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced Wednesday that it had joined a
lawsuit filed by a whistle-blower against Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp., bringing new allegations that the company defrauded federal
health programs through a scheme involving bogus expense claims.
</P>
<P>
   The action is the second time since October that the government
has joined a whistle-blower suit contending that the health giant
systematically cheated federal programs like Medicare out of
millions of dollars by routinely overstating expenses in filed
reports.
</P>
<P>
   By joining the second suit, the government for the first time
has accused Columbia hospitals that were not previously owned by
Hospital Corp. of America, which merged with Columbia in 1994. The
October suit named more than 200 hospitals, all of which were once
owned by HCA. The latest suit names more than 100 other hospitals
that were owned by the company before it merged with HCA.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suit also for the first time brings claims that
Columbia hospitals manipulated expenses to increase reimbursement
for outpatient services like home care, sometimes by misreporting
expenses associated with the acquisition of companies involved in
those businesses. Because outpatient care is reimbursed on the
basis of cost, such a fraud could have a strong effect on any
hospital company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new suit contends that in 1994 Columbia bought
several home-care agencies from Olsten Kimberly Corp. at
artificially low prices and inflated fees to Olsten to manage them.
That shifted expenses from good will, which is not reimbursable, to
management fees, which are. Olsten has said it is cooperating with
the investigation. The suit says similar cost-shifting was done in
a 1993 transaction involving Rescare, another home-care agency.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also spells out specific instances where hospitals
misreported costs by inflating the amount of property taxes paid,
including unallowable marketing expenses or misreporting expenses
made for doctor recruitment and offices.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court
in Tampa, Fla., was originally filed in 1996 by John Schilling, a
corporate whistle-blower who had worked on reimbursement issues for
Columbia both as a consultant and an employee. Under the federal
statute governing such cases, the suit was then reviewed and
investigated by the Justice Department, which then decided to file
its motion to join the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the workings of a complex, little-understood part
of modern hospitals known as the federal cost-reporting system, one
that has meant billions of dollars in payments by the government to
hospitals and other health care providers over the years. Those
reports generate hundreds of millions of dollars in payments each
year to Columbia alone.
</P>
<P>
   Through that system, portions of costs associated with patient
care are reimbursed by programs like Medicare at different rates.
But, in its suit, the government contends that the companies
intentionally misrepresented costs to increase the reimbursement
rate or receive payment for costs that were not eligible for
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the government's critical evidence in the cost-reporting
cases comes from secret, second sets of cost reports and work
sheets maintained at the hospitals that contained significantly
lower expenses than those in reports submitted to the government.
But in this case, the government also obtained direct evidence from
Schilling. He left his job of helping four Columbia hospitals
prepare their cost reports in 1995 but rejoined the company after
his suit was filed. From then on, he turned over information he
obtained during that time to government investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Schilling went the extra mile,'' said Stephen Meagher, a
lawyer with Phillips &AMP; Cohen who represents both whistle-blowers in
the cases joined by the government. ``He was able to give
investigators a real-time picture of just how the cost-reporting
practices were working.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was a reimbursement manager for Columbia/HCA from 1993
through 1995 and was responsible for coordination and preparation
of cost reports filed by four Columbia hospitals in Florida, each
of which is named as a defendant. Schilling later worked as a
consultant to the company to help prepare cost reports filed with
Medicare.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The case was brought under the False Claims Act, which allows
whistle-blowers to file suit on behalf of the government. Under
that Civil War-era law, the government can potentially recover
three times any amount defrauded from a federal program. If the
suit is successful, Schilling stands to receive as much as 25
percent of any amount recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the allegations contained in the suit were not new.
Information provided by Schilling became the basis of a criminal
case filed last year against four mid-level Columbia executives,
charging them with cost-reporting fraud at Fawcett Memorial
Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla. Much of the other information
provided by Schilling was used by the FBI in support of an
application for search warrants that were served in several states
in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues raised in this suit and the previous suit related
to cost reporting are not new,'' said Jeff Prescott, a Columbia
spokesman. ``Specific issues and even the specific hospitals named
were all disclosed in the FBI affidavit that was unsealed'' in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawsuits are widely expected to be part of a broad
settlement of fraud charges between Columbia and the government.
Analysts have estimated that Columbia may have to pay more than $1
billion to settle various fraud claims being investigated by the
government, including the cost-reporting case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to see a lot more of these,'' said Nancy
Weaver, an analyst with Stephens Inc. ``But we are still waiting to
see if they can reach some kind of settlement in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and lawyers involved in the case think that
cost-reporting claims will make up the largest piece of any
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases show that the heart of the investigation of
Columbia involves cost-reporting fraud,'' Meagher said.

WESTERN TOBACCO COMPANIES HIT HARD TIMES IN RUSSIA, BUT VOW TO
STAY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JOHN VAROLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ After committing nearly $1 billion to
build new factories in Russia, most Western tobacco companies have
been hit with heavy losses since financial turmoil took hold this
summer. But they say they will remain in the market, expecting the
economy to pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's debt default and currency devaluation in mid-August
devastated consumer purchasing power, and foreign tobacco companies
have since seen a drastic decline in sales, losing ground to
cheaper cigarettes made by Russian producers.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in sales comes as Russia had been gaining importance as
a market for Western tobacco companies. The cigarette makers,
facing multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlements and aggressive
anti-smoking campaigns in the United States, saw Russia as a
lucrative new territory. Indeed, Russians smoke 250 billion
cigarettes a year and there are few restrictions on smoking,
</P>
<P>
   While Russian companies sell their cigarettes for two to three
rubles a pack _ 10 to 13 cents _ the cheapest local brands made by
Western manufacturers sell for six to seven rubles, while these
companies' import brands sell for 20 to 30 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   The average Russian earns about 1,000 rubles, or $50, a month,
and a quarter of the population does not receive its pay on time.
</P>
<P>
   Declining sales forced Rothman's International to close its $88
million plant in St. Petersburg in September. It is tentatively
planned to reopen early next year.
</P>
<P>
   A $150 million new R.J. Reynolds factory in St. Petersburg,
which opened in July, shut down in September for two weeks. And
early this month, Reynolds' parent company, RJR Nabisco Holdings,
announced that it would eliminate about 2,900 jobs in the old
Soviet republics, most of them in manufacturing, and take a $55
million pretax charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no denying we're suffering like other companies,''
said Axel Gietz, head of media relations for R.J. Reynolds
International. ``While Russians now have less purchasing power,
they are smoking just as much as before but downgrading for cheaper
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. continue to build a $330 million factory
outside St. Petersburg. While the company acknowledged that it had
been affected by the nation's financial turmoil, it refused to
provide details or make any other comment about its operations in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But British American Tobacco PLC, which has invested $170
million in Russia and acquired a venerable Russian brand in 1994,
stands out as the exception among international tobacco companies.
It says it is increasing production and gaining in its share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is opportunity in every crisis,'' said Sergei Krasnov,
managing director of British American's unit in Moscow. ``While
production and sales slumped in August and September, since October
production is back to pre-crisis levels.`
</P>
<P>
   British American, which produced 25 billion cigarettes in Russia
in 1997, has two factories, one in Moscow and one in Saratov, south
of Moscow on the Volga River.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnov attributes his company's gain to aggressive distribution
and marketing strategies and to a popular product. Its Yava brand
name, which it bought in 1994 from the Russian company Yava Tabak,
enjoys a 100-year-old reputation in Russia for quality.
</P>
<P>
   Selling for six rubles a pack _ two to three times the cheapest
Russians brands _ Yava can still sell well because its home cities,
Moscow and Saratov, are among the best off economically in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. tobacco manufacturers increasingly saw Russia, with its
chain-smoking population, as a key market. Russian cigarette sales
totaled $6 billion a year before the financial crisis, and Western
companies had 40 to 50 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Russian market has not been the only attraction
for the tobacco sellers. Unlike in the United States and Canada,
there are few restrictions on smoking in Russia, and health
consciousness is among the lowest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy smoking is one reason why the life expectancy of Russian
men is only 59.
</P>
<P>
   Western cigarettes, though more expensive, have long been
popular with Russian smokers. Before the collapse of communism, few
items were as coveted as Western cigarettes, which were often used
as hard-currency equivalents to pay taxi drivers or make bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the demand for high-quality cigarettes, Western tobacco
manufacturers moved in force into Russia in the early 1990s. The
first cigarettes were imported, but many companies quickly began
making them locally. Today, Western tobacco companies are among the
leading foreign investors in Russia, with almost $1 billion
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, R.J. Reynolds International has sunk the most of any
Western company into manufacturing in Russia _ at least $400
million, with two major plants in St. Petersburg. The one opened in
July has a capacity of 50 billion cigarettes a year, and it is R.J.
Reynolds International's largest. Over all, the factory ranks as
RJR Nabisco's second largest after the one in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent problems, all foreign tobacco companies say
the market's potential is too lucrative just to walk away. ``While
it will take about two or three years to return to pre-crisis
levels, I think basically it is still a hugely important market for
all manufacturers and they will remain here and continue to fight
for market share,'' said John Dowd, head of Rothman's International
in St. Petersburg. ``They've already invested too much, and it is
too big a market to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is very important for our global strategy,'' Gietz, the
R.J. Reynolds publicist, said. ``Since Russia opened up to the
West, this large country with a tradition of smoking has meant
great business opportunities for us and other tobacco companies. We
expect things to pick up in the second half of 1999, but we are
braced for however long it will take.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cautious spending and a robust national economy
have left virtually all the states in solid financial condition for
the fifth year in a row, according to a fiscal survey released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy economy has allowed the states to give taxpayers the
largest projected aggregate tax cuts by state governments in five
years, $7 billion for the 1999 fiscal year; 29 states have reduced
one tax or another.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors of the report, the National Governors'
Association and the National Association of State Budget officers,
warned that the rosy present faces important challenges in the
future. In addition to an uncertain national economy, they
amplified the warning many state officials have been sounding,
saying that states are confronting the projected loss of billions
of dollars in tax revenues to the sale of goods through mail order
purchases and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenue loss is not huge now,'' Raymond C. Scheppach,
executive director of the governors' group, said at a news
conference where he discussed the latest Fiscal Survey of the
States, a report that is published twice a year. ``But it is
growing very, very rapidly. If we don't correct the problem, it
will virtually lead to the collapse of state sales taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, sales taxes account for as much as 40 percent of all
revenues, with the rest coming largely from taxes on personal
income, fuel and tobacco products. Stymied by courts and Congress
in their efforts to capture taxes from Internet sales, states have
been pushing back, saying that their revenue base is threatened. In
comments Wednesday, the officials who produced the budget report
attempted to project just how significant that threat might be.
</P>
<P>
   Scheppach said the revenues from consumer goods and services are
steadily eroding as the convenience of shopping by catalog and, now
more than ever, by computer gains in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring how popular is difficult to gauge. By one recent
estimate, online sales this year could reach $5 billion, more than
twice expectations. Bob Chatham, an electronic commerce analyst
with Forester Research in Boston, said Internet sales projections
for 2000 could exceed four times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Going far beyond estimates by anyone else in business or
government, however, Scheppach predicted that by 2002 sales over
the Internet could reach as high as $300 billion. If that
prediction proves true, it could translate into as much as $20
billion in lost revenues for the states and local governments. In
addition, many of the most popular items sold over the Internet,
including airplane tickets, are not subject to state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But with Internet sales a relatively new phenomenon, no one
really knows how high sales might reach or how deeply they could
affect states as they try balancing their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a huge problem in 1998? I don't think so,'' said
William F. Fox, a professor of economics at the University of
Tennessee and past president of the National Tax Association, a
nonpartisan policy group. ``But if the future estimates I've heard
are anywhere in the ballpark, then yes, there could be a
significant and growing problem that states need to worry about.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The states, of course, are eager to recoup the losses, but their
aspirations have been complicated by the reluctance of Congress and
the Supreme Court to provide stronger guidelines as well as the
difficulties states have in collecting taxes they are otherwise
entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which
declared a three-year moratorium against taxes from online sales.
The legislation provided for the creation of a 19-member commission
to study electronic commerce and recommend solutions to any tax
inequities. But squabbles over the makeup of the commission have
delayed the start of its work, discouraging government and business
officials who were hoping for answers sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have hope,'' said Walter Hellerstein, a law
professor at the University of Georgia who specializes in state tax
laws. ``Realistic expectations are much different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has only visited the issue of catalog sales,
ruling in 1967 and 1991 cases that sellers are not required to
collect a tax on goods unless the company has a physical presence
in the state of the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, much of the revenues are there, just waiting for the
states to collect them. In the 45 states that have sales taxes _
the exceptions are Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and
Oregon _ purchasers are liable for the taxes, no matter how they
are bought. But few citizens voluntarily provide information that
would increase their tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   The overall health of the states, as reflected by the survey
report, derives in part by a conclusion that governors are making
prudent economic and political decisions, by holding down the
increase in spending and cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that states increased spending by 5.7
percent for fiscal 1998 and 6.3 percent for fiscal 1999, a rate
that is slightly below the 6.5 percent national average of the last
two decades. That combines the overall tax cut of $7.02 billion,
much of it in personal income tax. Overall, it represents about 1.6
percent of the states' revenues
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, the recent span of tax-cutting, states
have cut taxes by $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The states that enacted the largest cuts were California ($1.38
billion), New York ($1.10 billion), Massachusetts ($789 million)
and Ohio ($780 million). All had Republican governors at the time,
but Scheppach said that the economic health was evident is states
with Democratic governors, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Six states raised taxes for 1999, led by New Jersey, which
budgeted for $200 million in revenues from new cigarette taxes. The
others with increases are Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that almost all the states reported a surplus
for the 1998 fiscal year, but in addition to tax cuts, they used
the extra money for a variety of investment projects, likes schools
and roads. Almost half the states, including New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut, used some of the surplus to bolster the state
rainy day account.

SKI CONGLOMERATES OVERHAUL NEWLY ACQUIRED RESORTS 
</HEADLINE>

   PARK CITY, Utah _ When the big ski conglomerates, such as
American Skiing Co. and Intrawest, look to acquire properties, it
is usually with an eye toward established resorts in popular
destination areas _ places with a name value already attached, such
as Sunday River in Maine, Stratton in Vermont or Copper in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the more recent acquisitions by ASC and Intrawest
were more ambitious in scope. In July 1997, ASC bought the area
outside Park City, Utah, formerly known as Wolf Mountain (which
itself was formerly known as Park West) and embarked on a
multimillion-dollar transformation that included yet another name
change _ this time, to the Canyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been driving around the resort and as I looked out over
the enormous landscape of skiable terrain that includes seven
canyons and 14 mountain peaks, the Canyons seemed only
appropriate,'' said chairman and chief executive Leslie Otten.
</P>
<P>
   After an $18.4 million infusion for new lifts and new trails,
the Canyons opened on Christmas Eve 1997. By the time the Winter
Olympics arrive in Park City in 2002, ASC will have spent several
times that amount in its goal to create the largest resort in
America in terms of skiable acres. The acreage currently stands at
more than 2,700. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous management had never utilized and developed what the
area offered _ incredible snow in the higher elevation areas and
some of the most diverse terrain in the Rocky Mountains,'' said a
longtime resort employee, Dick Reynolds. ``Each owner that came in
never had the skills nor the resources to develop the resort to its
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Intrawest acquired the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge
area in New Jersey in February 1998, the overhaul it had in mind
was so dramatic that it, too, needed a new name.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, after a $20 million renovation that included
seven new lifts and a rebuilt lodge, ``Mountain Creek'' opened for
its first winter season with another $30 million in improvements
scheduled over the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place totally reeked of opportunity,'' said Ingrid
Campbell, director of marketing for Mountain Creek. ``There are 22
million people within a 90-minute drive, and there are four
mountain peaks, a variety of terrain and over a 1,000-foot vertical
drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter and Ski Windham have 1,600 vertical feet, so
considering our location, that compares nicely. But everything
here, the lifts, the lodges, was dysfunctional. Basically, all we
bought was a mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   After buildings were demolished and two new trails cut, 13
antiquated lifts were also removed and seven new lifts were
installed to replace them, including two detachable quads and one
detachable eight-person open-air gondola. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked, `A gondola in New Jersey?' but its really
amazing and very cool,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the resort's proximity to the New York metropolitan
area is a boon in terms of sheer numbers of skiers, the success of
Mountain Creek will depend on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Canyons, which has virtually no snow-making thanks to
325 inches of the natural stuff a year, Mountain Creek has invested
$8.5 million in new snow-making equipment, enough to cover the
field at Giants Stadium with 2 feet of snow an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is calibrated to operate at top efficiency at 26
degrees instead of the standard 16 degrees, so we can make snow
when other places are still waiting for the temperature to drop,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with perhaps only 90 days to work with this winter due to
the unusually warm weather through the early part of December,
Mountain Creek has to make the most of its short season to take its
place in the Intrawest firmament. The company has also bought what
was known as Action Park nearby and plans to expand the water park
to include mountain biking and rock climbing and other outdoor
adventure sports for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the first day-night operation in Intrawest, and the
night-skiing experience is something that we hope is an opportunity
to turn on a bunch of people to the sport,'' Campbell said. ``It's
been an exciting year, trying to get everything done in time: We
were putting the finishing touches on the lodge, decorating for
Christmas and getting our certificate of occupancy at the same time
_ it was crazy. But we're open, and that's a wonderful feeling.''

JUDGE BLOCKS WELFARE CUTS FOR 6,000 FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a major setback for Massachusetts welfare officials,
a judge forbade the state Wednesday from cutting cash aid to as
many as 6,000 families, who he found were illegally denied
disability exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John C. Cratsley ruled in a preliminary injunction the
state was ``unreasonable'' to reject claims by parents that they
were too disabled to work ``for the sole reason of not complying
with'' a form letter he called ``confusing'' and ``difficult to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Families that the state deems to be headed by disabled adults
are exempt from the 1995 overhaul of the Transitional Aid to Needy
Families program, which imposes a 20-hour-a-week work requirement
and a two-year limit on cash aid. Those who fail to abide by the
work rule are dropped from the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Under reform, the caseload has shrunk by almost half, to 60,171
</P>
<P>
   But James Breslauer of Neighborhood Legal Services in Lawrence,
who represented the welfare plaintiffs, said thousands were
unfairly dropped for bureaucratic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous victory,'' said Breslauer, after
Wednesday's ruling. ``These families will be able to retain their
sole source of income during the winter months.''
</P>
<P>
   Breslauer said the state rejected 10,000 disability claims
between 1995 and July 1 of this year. Up to 60 percent of the
rejections were simply for failure to follow instructions outlined
in the form letter, meaning as many as 6,000 families could have
their benefits restored under the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a dispute that both sides said may send them back to court
sooner than expected, Thomas Noonan, legal counsel for the state
Department of Transitional Assistance, called Breslauer's estimate
too high.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan insisted the ruling does not apply retroactively, but
rather only to about 3,000 families who are about to be cut off
because they will hit the two-year limit on cash benefits between
this month and February, when another hearing in the case will be
held.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Noonan said, ``We are disappointed. The basis of
this decision is one form letter.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the state will decide before week's end on whether to
appeal the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   The letter at issue was routinely sent out by Healthpro, the
private firm hired by welfare officials to gather medical
information and review the disability claims, until it lost the
state contract to University of Massachusetts Medical Center in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Healthpro was at the center of another lawsuit six years ago
involving Emergency Aid to the Elderly, Disabled and Children.
Another judge ruled in that case that the company had also
summarily rejected disability applications for technical reasons,
such as mistakes made by doctors in filling out medical forms.
</P>
<P>
   In the current case, the Healthpro form letter spelled out
requirments for recipients seeking a disability exemption that
Cratsley said would confound less-educated people. The requirements
included: to make an appointment with their doctor; notify
Healthpro of the date of the appointment in writing within 10 days,
but to call if the appointment is within 10 days; to fill out a
medical release form; and to make sure to bring the form to their
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Cratsley described the Healthpro letter as ``confusing;
difficult to understand, complete and return; and technical in
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore,'' he added, ``using it successfully likely
requires an educational level and/or language skill often not found
among those who most frequently apply for'' welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Chall, a Harvard professor emeritus of education, said in
an affidavit filed in the case that a person would need at least a
year of college to understand the text. Yet, the state's own data
shows that more than 80 percent of parents on welfare have no
college education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Breslauer said, the letter was sent only in
English, although many parents on welfare do not speak English
well, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who filed the lawsuit is Abigail Laboy of
Dorchester, whose first language is Spanish and who speaks little
English.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old mother of two said she had worked for years as a
house cleaner but went on welfare for the first time three years
ago so she could stay home to care for her husband after he was
diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, Laboy said she went back to work part-time two
years ago, but soon started to experience debilitating pain in her
legs that, after months of medical appointments, was finally
diagnosed as fibromyalgia.
</P>
<P>
   She applied for an exemption but it was denied for failing to
heed the form letter. Laboy said she did not even remember
receiving it. Her case is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Flynn, a Greater Boston Legal Services attorney who
represents Laboy, said, ``The welfare department does not know who
in fact it is terminating and the barriers they face. The simple
fact people are off welfare does not mean it is success of welfare
reform.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The half-million revelers expected to gather in Times
Square on Thursday night may not realize it, but they will really
be attending a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the brand-new music and sound effects, the 16-foot-tall
puppet of Father Time, the three video screens, the 27 extra
spotlights (including what is billed as the ``the most powerful
searchlight in the world''), even the extra half ton of confetti,
are all part of a dry run for New Year's Eve 1999. Or, as the
event's promoters like to put it, ``Times Square 2000, the Global
Celebration at the Crossroads of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   With a name like that, next year's event had better be an
extravaganza _ and no producers in their right minds would try to
put on such a show without at least a trial run. Which is what
Thursday night's festivities will be, said Brendan Sexton,
president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, which
is organizing the festivities along with Countdown Entertainment.
``We're going to use it to test some things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, that giant Father Time, which was designed by
Michael Curry, who made the puppets used in ``The Lion King'' on
Broadway. The puppet, which is 24 feet long and requires eight
handlers, is supposed to drift through the crowd carrying an
illuminated hourglass. Basically, it will be taken through safety
lanes that the police keep clear _ and it is the police who will
determine, in large part, if the experiment is a success, Sexton
said. ``If it works out, maybe we'll have more than one'' puppet
next year, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest innovation is probably the music and sound effects,
which will be broadcast starting a little after 10:30 p.m. from
speakers mounted on 10 buildings. The tunes on the play list remain
a secret; ``I can't tell you everything,'' Sexton said, relenting
only enough to describe the selections as international and
instrumental. But don't wait to hear ``Auld Lang Syne'' at
midnight; the music is to be turned off by 11:45 to focus attention
on the roar of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes that the throngs will be able to see more than the back
of someone's head, the producers are setting up three huge video
screens, two more than last year, on which they will broadcast the
festivities. Next year, the producers promise, such screens will
dot the entire neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope next year to use the music and video screens to
mark the turn of the century in each time zone around the world,
with appropriate local selections, sights and sound effects.
Manhattan, of course, will represent Eastern Standard Time; the
party will not conclude until Hawaii enters the year 2000, five
hours after New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some calendar sticklers, nit-pickers and party poopers may
insist that 2001 is really the start of the millennium, but New
York will not wait to hold what Sexton called ``the biggest party
ever in recorded history ever.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's crowd may be relatively small by comparison with the
hordes expected next year, but nevertheless, 100,000 more people
are expected to attend Thursday night's festivities than showed up
last year, according to the Times Square business group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some ways, Thursday night's celebration will be much like
those of years past, only more so. Much more so. Last year,
volunteers dumped only three tons of special Times Square confetti
_ it is bigger, of course _ out of windows; this year, they will
hurl three and a half tons down on the crowd (among those credited
with this production is a ``confetti master'' named Treb Heining).
</P>
<P>
   And while balloons have long been a feature of the party scene _
along with Mylar pom-poms and leis _ 15,000 of them will be
distributed this year to the crowd, which is supposed to fling them
into the air at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a mere 16 spotlights lighted up the sky; this year,
there will be 42, Sexton said, plus the giant 50 kilowatt ``space
cannon,'' which can apparently be seen from other galaxies (hint to
little green guys: focus your telescopes on 42nd Street just south
of One Times Square).
</P>
<P>
   And while pyrotechnic displays have added excitement to previous
shows, this year they are to be longer (45 seconds, starting at the
stroke of midnight) and bigger (atop three buildings _ One Times
Square, 1500 Broadway and 1501 Broadway). These are not real
fireworks, but rather the theatrical explosions one might see at
Beauty and the Beast, Sexton said, adding that though they are
perfectly safe, ``The Fire Department does stand there while we do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   And why would New Yorkers want to spend hours jammed into a
space with all the amenities of the Lexington Avenue subway at rush
hour _ especially with below-freezing temperatures expected. They
don't, for the most part. About 85 percent of the revelers are from
out of town, according to a study done in 1995 by the Times Square
business district.
</P>
<P>
   And those tourists spend almost $24 million, which helps explain
why (in addition to bragging rights) the city is willing to play
host to such a gigantic bash. The property owners around Times
Square have an economic incentive, too _ the more people who see
their billboards, the more they can charge advertisers to use them.
One Times Square, which is the chief sponsor of the event along
with the BID, has pretty much evolved into a billboard in building
form.
</P>
<P>
   It is also where the ball drops, and Sexton has reassuring words
about that. When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Sang Lan, the Chinese
gymnast injured in the Goodwill Games last summer, push the button
one minute before midnight, the ball will be the now-traditional
one that looks like a huge disco light _ not a big apple. (Nor will
a new ball that has been commissioned for the new century look like
a piece of fruit.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, that was only one year, in the 1980s,'' Sexton said
of the apple experiment. ``And everyone agreed it was hokey and
tacky. We immediately reverted to the ball.''

 HARMER E. DAVIS, TRANSPORTATION EXPERT, DIES At 93   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harmer E. Davis, the founding director of the California
Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California
at Berkeley, died on Dec. 24 at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif. He
was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spent 45 years on the Berkeley campus. He was born in
Rochester, graduated from Berkeley in 1928, earned a master of
science degree in civil engineering in 1930 and was appointed an
assistant professor in that discipline the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after World War II, the state Legislature decreed the
creation of the institute at Berkeley to train engineers needed to
upgrade California's roads and airports. Davis was named as its
director and led it until he retired in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The program he developed combined research with teaching and
left its mark on highway designs, traffic control, and airport
layouts and lighting. His approach led other states to turn to
academia for similar joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   As director, he became involved in transportation issues around
the country, especially in the areas of planning and financing
highways and airports. His research focused on the engineering
properties of concrete, asphalt and soils.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is survived by his wife, Phyllis E., a daughter and two
sons from an earlier marriage, Lynn Davis of San Diego, Eugene of
Union City, Calif., and Willard W. of Berkeley; a stepdaughter, Dr.
Artha Shelley of Pretoria, South Africa; a stepson, Miguel Melbin
of Calistoga, Calif.; three grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.

GOVERNMENT IN THE NETHERLANDS THWARTS MODERN PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Almost four centuries after the Netherlands gave the
Pilgrims refuge from persecution in England, a leading American
scholar on the Pilgrims has been caught in the Dutch government's
crackdown on immigrants and has been ordered to leave the
Netherlands by Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeremy Bangs, who last year founded a Pilgrim museum in
Leiden, said the Dutch Ministry of Justice had rejected his
application for permanent residency because, it said, he did not
qualify for a work permit and it did not believe he could support
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to get more ironic than to expel someone who is
working on the Pilgrims, who were the most famous example of Dutch
welcome and protection,'' Bangs said. At the time the Pilgrims fled
to the Netherlands in 1608, Bangs said, the government boasted that
it ``refuses no honest people free entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangs, 52, receives financial support from the New England
Historic Genealogical Society in Boston to conduct research on the
history of the Pilgrims while they were in the Netherlands before
leaving for America in 1620 and founding Plymouth. He recently
discovered the first contemporary painting showing the Pilgrims
embarking at Delftshaven on their way to America.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Fiske, the editor of the Register of the Historic
Genealogical Society, which will publish an article about Bangs'
discovery in January, said, ``This is a tragedy for Jeremy. He is
such a talented individual, and he has done so well in his research
and opening the museum, that this whole thing seems ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch Justice Ministry has been trying to deal with a record
50,000 illegal immigrants from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and the
former Yugoslavia this year to the Netherlands, already one of the
most densely populated nations. The immigrants contend they are
escaping political persecution, but the Dutch government has been
under pressure to treat them as economic refugees and expel them.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, Wijnand Stevens, said
that Bangs could appeal the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also said the government's crackdown and Bangs' case
were not related.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading Dutch newspaper, NRC Handelsblad, on Tuesday
poked fun at the Ministry of Justice, suggesting that Bangs was a
victim of bureaucratic stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Bangs is that he may not apply for a work permit
because he is an employee and director of the Leiden American
Pilgrim Museum, the paper said. Only an employer may apply for a
permit for an employee, under Dutch law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bangs does not cost the Dutch state a single penny,'' the
paper said. ``And his museum tells of a meaningful part of our
history. Hillary Rodham Clinton who will visit the Netherlands in
February has put the museum on her agenda. Perhaps she will arrive
at a closed door because Bangs had to leave the Netherlands on Jan.
15. Can someone explain this to Hillary?''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and acquaintances of Bangs say another part of his
difficulty may be that he lives simply, on the small income from
the Historic Genealogical Society, and that the Ministry of Justice
may not believe he has enough means of support.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bangs nor the society would say what he is paid, but Ms.
Fiske said: ``He lives very frugally, in a small apartment in an
old building, and it is hard to see how he gets by. I think he is
putting much of the money we give him into the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Bangs moved to Leiden two years ago, he lived in
Scituate, Mass., and was curator of Plimouth Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Bangs holds a doctorate in history from the University of
Leiden. He has written 12 books and more than 40 scholarly
articles.
</P>
<P>
   In his research, he has demonstrated that some of the people
Americans today celebrate as the Pilgrims were not English. Several
of them were French-speaking Walloons, or Protestants, and one even
came from Danzig, in Poland. They had all come to Leiden because it
was a center of religious tolerance at a time of warfare between
Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Bangs said that if he is required to leave, the museum will
likely close. If he does have to abandon Leiden, he may recall a
passage written about the Pilgrims' departure in 1620 by William
Bradford, later governor of Plymouth:
</P>
<P>
   ``So they left that goodly and pleasant city which had been
their resting place near twelve years; but they knew they were
pilgrims, and looked not much on those things, but lift up their
eyes to the heavens, their dearest country, and quieted their
spirits.''

COMPETITOR WARNS AGAINST MICROSOFT CONTROL OF WEB COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of Intuit Inc. stated Wednesday that Microsoft
Corp. could use its market power to gain control over ``major
areas'' of Internet commerce and asked the courts to give
Microsoft's rivals equal access to its Windows operating system and
desktop screen.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-page written testimony of William Harris of Intuit, maker
of Quicken personal-finance software, brings two new issues into
the Microsoft antitrust trial: Microsoft's potential impact on the
fast-growing field of Internet commerce, and possible steps to curb
Microsoft's power. Both issues have been much debated outside the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case against Microsoft focuses mainly on its
use and alleged abuse of the market power derived from its dominant
position in the market for personal-computer operating system
software. Microsoft, the Justice Department says, has used its
Windows monopoly to try to thwart the challenge posed by software
used to browse the World Wide Web, pioneered by Netscape
Communications Corp., and by Java, an Internet programming language
developed by Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computer industry witnesses for the government have
testified on the tactics Microsoft used to undermine the
Netscape-Sun challenge _ namely, that Internet software could
weaken Microsoft's grip on personal-computer software.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Harris, who is scheduled to take the stand on
Monday, does deal with one such episode involving Intuit in 1997.
To obtain prime placement on the Microsoft desktop, Harris said,
Intuit had to agree to bundle Microsoft's browser with Intuit's
online personal finance software and not bundle Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was negotiated for placement on a feature of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser called Active desktop.
Microsoft, Harris said, wanted Active desktop to be ``a new user
interface for Windows'' that would ``provide a choice of Internet
Web sites that could be directly accessed from the desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, he said, was prepared to pay ``a substantial fee'' for
this prime desktop real estate. ``But,'' Harris added, ``Microsoft
offered us this placement instead in return for our agreement to
forego future business dealings with Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   The government points to such testimony as evidence that
Microsoft has used its market power stemming from Windows, which
runs on more than 90 percent of personal computers sold, to
unfairly hamper Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replied in a statement that Intuit chose Microsoft's
Internet Explorer browser over Netscape's Navigator because by 1997
its software was superior. In fact, in his testimony Harris wrote,
``The recommendation of our technical team was to use the Internet
Explorer.'' But he added that it was Intuit's judgment that
Netscape could deliver the browser capability Microsoft had, though
a bit later. And Harris said he preferred to work with Netscape
because it was not an Intuit competitor _ Microsoft's Money
competes with Quicken _ and at the time Netscape's browser was used
by many more computer users than Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Harris goes beyond the Internet software market by arguing
that Microsoft can use its operating system dominance to influence
or control Internet commerce and programming. With Windows 98, the
operating system upgrade introduced in June, Microsoft has closely
integrated Internet Explorer with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Harris said, Microsoft's start-up page _ an
all-purpose Web site, or portal, with links to many other sites _
will ``become the default portal in the Windows operating system.''
A featured spot on that start-up site, now called MSN.com, is
regarded as prime real estate by other Web sites offering
everything from news to travel services to personal finance
information, according to Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his assumption about the importance of the operating
system as a ``choke point,'' and its growing importance in the
future, Harris called on the court to impose a sweeping sanction on
Microsoft that he terms ``operating system neutrality'' _
essentially a guarantee that the company enjoy no advantages in new
software or Internet commerce markets from its operating system
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft case, the subject of remedies will be taken up
only if Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rules against Microsoft _ and
then there will be a separate hearing. What weight, if any, the
views of Harris would have is uncertain. Microsoft called the
remedies section of his testimony ``an entirely new and irrelevant
concept Harris cooked up on his own'' based on ``speculation and
half-baked analyses.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts have also noted that Microsoft's Active
desktop initiative proved a failure because people did not use it
that much. Its failure has led many analysts to suggest that
placement on the Windows desktop, while useful, may not be as
important for Internet commerce and programming sites as Microsoft
had hoped or rivals like Intuit had feared.

   WASHINGTON _ The stain on his record will endure, reflecting a
six-month prison term for drug use that disrupted a long and
colorful career of public service.
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies the paradox of Marion Barry as he leaves office
Saturday, ending 16 years as mayor of the District of Columbia and
its most electrifying political personality for nearly three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   At noon that day, Anthony Williams, the city's former chief
financial officer and a relative newcomer to local politics, is
scheduled to be sworn in as mayor. Williams, 47, a Democrat from
California who moved to Washington only five years ago, easily won
election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Williams' triumph was achieved only after Barry, 62, chose
not to run for a fifth term, an apparent acknowledgment that he
knew it was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of all we accomplished,'' Barry said Wednesday at
his final weekly news conference, striking his familiar immodest
pose. ``I have no regrets. I'm not sad. I'm not anxious. I'm not
down. In fact, I'm up. I feel good physically, mentally,
spiritually, and some say I look pretty good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry's personality and politics shaped much of the District
through its economic rise and fall over his first three terms, 1978
to 1990. But after emerging from prison to make a remarkable return
to office in 1994, it soon became apparent his mighty touch was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   He could not escape the financial havoc that evolved during his
third term and the next four years under his successor, Sharon
Pratt Kelly. Huge deficits and dysfunctional agencies led the new
Republican-controlled Congress in 1995 to create a control board,
which snatched all meaningful authority over the city and left
Barry as little more than a bit player.
</P>
<P>
   Only this year has the city's economy shown improvement,
prompting the control board, in a final censure of Barry, to
announce that powers of running the city would be restored to the
new mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry leaves a legacy more complex than that of a political
leader who rose, fell and rose again after expunging the personal
demons of drugs, alcohol and adultery.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he will be judged depends upon who is judging,'' said Ron
Walters, a professor of political science at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   To many, especially black residents, he is still a hero. Mark
Plotkin, a political commentator on WAMU, a local public radio
station, said, ``To some people in the city, he had achieved almost
mythical proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   As an active campaigner in the civil rights movement and one of
the first black mayors to lead a large majority-black city, Barry
made it a priority to hire as many blacks onto the city payroll as
possible. He also encouraged the creation of minority-owned
business, worked for downtown redevelopment and made sure his
budget always had money for a summer jobs program for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The combination enabled thousands of once-poor District
residents to achieve dignity and middle-class status and helped
build a solid black middle class.
</P>
<P>
   He has also won e respect from blacks as well as many whites for
what he described as his spiritual and emotional recovery following
his prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Many District residents insisted they would have voted for him
had he sought re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think history will be kind to him for what he did for the
little man and for children,'' said Sam Jordan, a longtime friend
and political ally who heads the city's Office of Emergency
Preparedness.``He made some mistakes, but he went back to his
church and his Lord, asking for forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barry remains intensely disliked by other District
residents, who viewed his substance abuse and adultery as symbols
of arrogance, betrayal and malfeasance that left the city in
perilous financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a disaster,'' said Marie Drissel, a community
activist who helped recruit Williams to run this year. ``The idea
that our mayor could be caught smoking crack cocaine is something a
lot of other people aren't going to get over.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that sentiment was shared by Republican members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Barry always recognized the animus of his Republican opponents,
and said Wednesday, ``When the Republicans took over, I knew they
were philosophically opposed to returning power back to the people
of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   But he pressed on, poking at Congress and offering his own life
as an example of how to endure tough times and triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to summarize all of what I've done, and I've done a
tremendous amount,'' he said today, when asked how he would like to
be remembered, ``I have given help and hope to a lot of people who
didn't have any help and very little hope. I care deeply about the
city. I do.''

SENATE CONSIDERS VOTE TO CIRCUMVENT FULL TRIAL FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican and Democratic leaders weighing
President Clinton's impeachment are considering a plan to let
senators hear evidence from both sides and then cast a preliminary
vote on whether to move forward with a full trial, a Democrat close
to the negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, the resolution to proceed with a trial would
require 67 of 100 votes, the same number required to remove the
president from office, and would serve two purposes: It would give
the Senate an opportunity to sidestep a drawn-out, politically
unpalatable trial while at the same time allowing senators some
kind of vote on Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since impeachment by the House appeared inevitable,
senators have been wrestling with how to satisfy a multitude of
conflicting goals. On the one extreme are senators who want a full
trial that would result in Clinton's removal from office. On the
other are members who believe he has been punished enough and that
a long trial would hurt both the country and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal under consideration now would attempt to establish
a process that would be acceptable to both sides. And, the Democrat
said, it would show where the Senate is positioned on these
questions prior to any actual vote on the articles themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If the resolution to move to a trial fails, the Senate would
then vote to adjourn the proceedings, which would require 51 votes,
and take up a proposal to censure Clinton, the Democrat said. If
the resolution passes, the Senate would hold a full trial, which
would be likely to include witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrat cautioned that the proposal for a brief
proceeding was still being negotiated by Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader from Mississippi, and Sen. Tom Daschle, the
Democratic leader from South Dakota, who have been discussing it on
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   And, the Democrat stressed, neither leader had vetted the plan
with his Senate colleagues, who are scattered across the country
for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders would present the plan to their colleagues when
they return for the swearing-in of the new Congress on Jan. 6, the
Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Wednesday, ``We're working on this in a way that
meets both of our mutual objectives, which in large measure could
be defined as doing it fairly and expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's office had no comment Wednesday on the tentative plan.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the proposal drew a sharp response from Republicans on
the House Judiciary Committee, who will act as prosecutors during
the Senate trial. On Tuesday, they met to discuss their strategy,
emerging from closed doors with plans to call witnesses, only to
learn that Lott was proposing nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   In a stern three-page letter to Lott, Rep. Henry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said he was ``especially concerned'' with the proposal
to ``foreclose any trial if the House position fails to get a
two-thirds vote on a preliminary motion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal,'' Hyde wrote, ``effectively grants one-third of
the Senate the power to decide whether there will be any airing of
the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge that the Senate always has the authority to
alter its procedures and precedents,'' Hyde added, ``but to do so
in this instance would unwisely short-circuit the process.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lott seemed to suggest moving toward a more
expedited proceeding without spelling out the details. He told
reporters he would like to see a speedy, but fair trial with no
witnesses that would begin on Jan. 11 and conclude two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The comments on Wednesday by the Democrat who is close to the
negotiations indicate that both Lott and Daschle are tentatively
pursuing a course that could circumvent a traditional trial, at
least initially and perhaps entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan being discussed by Lott and Daschle, the House
and the White House would each present their cases, without calling
witnesses, a process that would take no more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the presentations, the Senate would take a ``summary
judgment'' vote on two issues: the quality of the evidence and
whether the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice rise
to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the Democrat
said.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Senate would set aside the House's vote on
impeachment and make a threshold judgment on the evidence and the
allegation on its own. It would also revisit a similar ``summary
judgment'' proposal that was offered by Democrats in October and
rejected by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote on this ``despositive resolution,'' which could
break out into two separate resolutions, would require a two-thirds
majority, the Democrat said. The number would serve as a a
barometer for any future vote on removal. Most senators have said
they do not believe there are 67 senators willing to vote to remove
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way people are on record saying, `Yes, I would vote to
move forward if these things are proven,'' the Democrat said. ``And
Democrats would say they are not proven and they don't meet these
high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, no resolutions of any sort have been written.
``There is no specific phraseology,'' the Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle, the Democrat said, must still work out the
details of the plan, including whether there should be an
opportunity for debate during the presentation of evidence and
whether the House should have a chance to rebut the White House's
case. During a trial, senators would be free to ask questions of
the prosecutors through Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who would
preside over the proceedings, but they would not be permitted to
debate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Senators still have profound differences about what a censure
resolution should say and what sort of penalties, if any, it should
include.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Lott, Hyde argued that the House and the
president should have an opportunity to present their cases. ``We
believe that proper presentation of the evidence will likely
require the appearance of a limited number of witnesses,'' Hyde
said. ``We also believe that the president and his counsel may wish
to call witnesses as part of their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat questioned the House's insistence on calling
factual witnesses before the Senate, especially since the judiciary
panel opted not to call anyone other than independent counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde defended his committee's decision not to call witnesses
during the impeachment inquiry, saying that the House and the
Senate hold two distinct functions. The House moves to indict, he
argued. The Senate moves to convict.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the entity granted the sole power to try an impeachment,''
Hyde wrote, ``the Senate should hear from live witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican moderate, agreed,
saying she would prefer to hear from witnesses, especially because
they might help settle disputed facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be helpful for me as a juror to hear firsthand the
testimony so I can assess credibilty,'' she said. ``It would be
easier in the long run.''

`MEAN JOE' SEES SIMILARITIES BETWEEN STEELERS AND CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - They had an owner who didn't win for 40 years,
fan support so low that kids were admitted for a dollar and a motto
that sounds so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   When defensive tackle Joe Greene joined the Pittsburgh Steelers
in 1969, the team was known as SOS _ ``Same Old Steelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, now defensive line coach of the Cardinals, was with the
Steelers in 1972 when they won their first-ever playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the sideline at Sun Devil Stadium last Sunday when the
Cardinals beat San Diego, 16-13, and clinched their first
non-strike playoff berth in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Pittsburgh) would have been the last place I would have
wanted to go when I was drafted,'' said Greene, the Steelers' No. 1
pick in 1969. ``Once I got there, understanding the history, it was
the only place I wanted to be, because when it happened and we won,
I would be one of the original participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing people are experiencing today in the
Valley. . . This past week to see all the red at Sun Devil Stadium
was special. It took me back to when I was in Pittsburgh, and you'd
see black and gold and no foreign colors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers were 2-11 the year before Greene joined them. Then,
Chuck Noll was hired, and he won his first game in '69 but then
lost the next 13 that season.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers owner Art Rooney was revered in Pittsburgh but not
because of his football expertise. He ran the team on a shoe-string
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big thrill wasn't winning on Sunday,'' Rooney once said.
``It was meeting the payroll on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene helped the Steelers win four Super Bowls for the Rooney
family.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he joined a Cardinals team that hadn't had a
winning season since 1984. But halfway through Coach Vince Tobin's
first season, he told reporters the Cardinals would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could be so confident the Cardinals would turn it
around under Tobin, Greene said, ``It was the message, the same,
solid message (Tobin) was giving the team. ``It was repititious. It
never changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew eventually these young minds would listen, understand
and comprehend. Quality players were being added. One quality
player who was added and made a significant difference is the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene was referring to Jake Plummer, who has guided the
Cardinals to nine comeback victories in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the NFL's longest playoff drought was over. These
weren't the ``same old Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand all the years of frustration and understand the
totality of it was when I looked at Mr. Bidwill in the locker
room,'' Greene said of Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill, who was
clutching the game ball, tears in his eyes. &QL;

 &HT;    Texas public officials soon take oaths
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   After months of campaign promises and platitudes, the winning
candidates of 1998 are about to become the state officials of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This means they have to actually report to work, sit at a desk
and accomplish something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Attorney General-elect John Cornyn said Wednesday as
he worked at home on his oath-taking address. ``That reality
settles in very quickly. The size of the job I've undertaken is
daunting. And with child support in such dire straits, the
magnitude of the job ahead of me has definitely sunk in.''
</P>
<P>
   For the new statewide officeholders, the swearing-in begins
Friday, when Cornyn takes the oath of office from a notary public
he has not yet selected.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the incoming officials, Cornyn will take the oath
twice: once in private so he can get on the payroll and get to
work, and again in a public ceremony so friends, family and anybody
else can share the moment.
</P>
<P>
   For Cornyn, that will be on Jan. 13 in the House Chamber, when
he ceremonially takes the oath from Chief Justice Tom Phillips, a
former colleague prone to referring to Cornyn as Justice Corndog
when they served together on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to retirements and political ambition-gone-bad, Texas
will have a bumper crop of new state officials. Four years ago, the
only turnover in the top six state jobs was at the top, where
Republican George W. Bush ousted Democrat Ann Richards. In the
other posts, the new boss was the same as the old boss thanks to
re-elections.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Bush is the only carry-over. The Republican
sweep in November put Rick Perry in as lieutenant governor
(replacing Bob Bullock, who did not seek another term); Cornyn in
as attorney general (replacing Dan Morales, who did not run); David
Dewhurst in as land commissioner (replacing Garry Mauro, who
unsuccessfully challenged Bush); Susan Combs in as agriculture
commissioner (replacing Perry); and Carole Keeton Rylander in as
new comptroller (replacing John Sharp, who challenged Perry for
lieutenant governor).
</P>
<P>
   Combs, like Cornyn, will take the oath twice. The first time
will be Friday, when Sharon Carter, chief clerk of the Texas House,
does the chore. Ceremonially, Combs will swear in again on Jan. 8,
when Bush administers a superfluous oath.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, a former state lawmaker, said the transition from
candidate to officeholder requires a changing of gears. And she
acknowledged that a good candidate does not always make a good
officeholder, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it lucky in my case?'' that she is both, Combs joked.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander, now a railroad commissioner, said the weight of the
duties that are about to fall on her hit home sometime after
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a profound feeling,'' she said. ``As you approach the
swearing-in, that's what hits you. You really do have a realization
of what is ahead. This is a massive operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The oath-taking continues through Jan. 19, when Bush and Perry
take theirs at the south side of the Capitol in an inaugural
ceremony that will end an era.
</P>
<P>
   When Perry ends his oath with the words ``so help me God'' and
the crowd begins applauding, Bullock will officially be out of
office and the highest level of state government will be a
Democrat-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly wish the winners well,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm,
state chair of the losers. ``However, we will be watching to ensure
that the new Republican agency heads practice what they preach, and
represent mainstream Texas families and not special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality, of course, is that many, if not all, of the new
Republican officeholders have visions of someday holding an office
higher on the food chain. They all say their new job is the only
one on their minds, but Texas history is short on little boys who
grew up dreaming to be land commissioner or little girls who grew
up dreaming to be comptroller of public accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For those on the way out, New Year's means new job hunting _ for
the elected leaders as well as the underlings who become casualties
of political war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (noose) may be tightening around here,'' one state worker
employee said in an e-mail to friends this week. ``Waddya hear
about work in the real world?''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the transitions have gone smoothly, with,
perhaps, one exception. Rumblings from the Dewhurst camp indicate
that the new land commissioner will soon be ready to go public with
details about what he found at the land office after 16 years under
Mauro's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of evidence of the somewhat testy Democrat-to-Republican
transition at that agency cropped up Wednesday when Mauro announced
his office is ready to accept entries for the 1999 Treasures of the
Texas Coast children's art contest. Entries are due Feb. 2, about a
month after Mauro will be off the letterhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is news to us,'' said Dewhurst spokesman Mark Sanders.
``But we will be happy to look at anything the schoolchildren of
Texas send in.''

EDITORIAL: A STEADY HAND, SO FAR
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 31:
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging to see Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
taking an assertive yet balanced leadership role in the
presidential impeachment crisis. He seems to have drawn the right
lessons from watching a temporary House leader, Bob Livingston,
collapse under the task of guiding that chamber through its
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week Lott firmly blocked the attempt by Rep. Henry
Hyde and the impeachment managers from the House Judiciary
Committee to dictate the procedural rules for a Senate trial. Now
comes the news that he and his Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle,
are pushing a plan to have expedited arguments that could produce a
censure vote before the State of the Union address on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this good beginning, Lott will confront sensitive and
complex tasks after New Year's Day. He must sell his party on this
creative plan to avoid a full-scale trial and a direct vote on the
articles of impeachment by interposing a procedural vote after both
the Judiciary Committee and the White House have outlined their
cases in brief opening presentations. At that point the Senate
would vote on whether the evidence constitutes high crimes and
misdemeanors and therefore requires a trial leading to possible
removal from office. If that proposition fails to pass, the Senate
could then move to consideration of a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican senators contend that the Constitution requires
a trial and a direct vote on the two articles of impeachment passed
by the House. But the Framers were not trying to design a legal
straitjacket for the Senate. That body therefore has room to
convene or adjourn a trial according to majority rule and to impose
censure at any point in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal floated Wednesday to hear the evidence and then
have a procedural vote to see if a trial is necessary looks like a
reasonable and constitutionally sound way to move toward censure.
It would also satisfy the demands of President Clinton's critics
for a vote that would show whether there are enough votes in the
Senate to warrant a trial that could result in removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Whether censure comes before or after a trial, it will need
Republican votes to pass. This is where Lott's skills as leader and
negotiator may meet a stern test. A negotiated censure resolution,
rather than one imposed by the Senate, would be best for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Senate Republicans will not and should not accept
Clinton's contention that he did not lie under oath. But that does
not rule out serious negotiations between the White House and the
Senate leadership. Those negotiations could cover the wording of an
admission on the essential offenses and the possibility of tying
such an admission by the president to assurances that he would not
be prosecuted after leaving office. After the Senate reconvenes
Jan. 6, Lott and Daschle should take the lead in offering specific
language for Clinton to consider.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since impeachment passed in the House, they have
worked hard to guide the Senate toward censure as the option that
fits the evidence and that also has broadest public support.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot, of course, force upon Clinton a realization that he
insults the public and the senators who will judge him by
continuing to insist that he did not lie. But they have made a
responsible start toward guiding the Senate in its task of writing
into the historic record a stern and proportional condemnation of
Clinton's false testimony under oath, his failure to uphold the
rule of law and his disrespectful use of the presidency and the
White House.

AT&AMP;T-TCI DEAL MOVES CLOSER TO COMPLETION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government took a big step toward
redefining the Internet Wednesday when the Justice Department
approved the proposed $31.8 billion acquisition of the cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc. by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced in June, still cannot be closed without the
consent of the Federal Communications Commission, whose officials
said Wednesday that the agency's staff was still more than a month
away from finishing its review under different standards and laws
from those considered by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   After the staff review and recommendations, the five
commissioners would have to decide whether the deal is in the
public interest or, as critics have argued, it would give AT&AMP;T the
power to sharply limit access to the Internet to other telephone
companies and access providers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Wednesday's decision by antitrust regulators
removed a significant potential obstacle and moved the two
companies closer to becoming a vast new telecommunications
conglomerate. That conglomerate would offer a big new artery of
higher-speed access to the Internet that the companies' executives
say would enable computer users to transfer data more easily, hold
clearer conversations and eventually receive TV-quality video.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate regulatory action, the Federal Trade Commission
approved the $52.4 billion acquisition of Amoco by British
Petroleum PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Wednesday with the Justice Department
was not without conditions. Because both AT&AMP;T and TCI hold
substantial interests in wireless telephone services, officials
approved the deal only on the condition that TCI divest its
interests in that business. The company will have five years to
sell its 23.5 percent interest in Sprint PCS, one of the nation's
leading providers of digital wireless telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust officials had raised concerns that the proposed merger
could affect the price of wireless service because AT&AMP;T, with about
9 million customers, is the nation's largest provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past few years, increased competition in mobile
wireless services has produced lower prices, higher quality and
millions of new subscribers,'' said Joel Klein, the assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust
division. ``The settlement reached today will insure that the
merger will not blunt the move toward a more competitive market in
wireless services and that customers continue to reap the benefits
of that competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the Justice Department, if the deal
closes before TCI divests its interest in Sprint, then the Sprint
stock must be placed in a trust until it is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at AT&AMP;T and TCI have said the merger will enable
consumers to get one-stop shopping for their local and
long-distance telephone service, cable TV, and access to the
Internet and data services. TCI and its affiliated systems reach
more than 14 million customers representing about one-third of the
nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the breakup of the Bell telephone network in 1984, AT&AMP;T
has not had direct access to most homes. But the proposed deal with
TCI, made possible by the sweeping deregulation of the
telecommunications industry two years ago, would change that.
</P>
<P>
   James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general counsel, said the decision was
good news for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now one step closer to finalizing a transaction that
will ultimately give residential customers broader choices for
local telephone service and other advanced services and products,''
Cicconi said. ``We think it is especially significant that the only
subject of today's consent decree is the ownership interest TCI
currently holds in the cellular business of Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   But other telephone companies have maintained that the deal is
fundamentally anticompetitive. They have expressed fears that it
will prevent them from using TCI's lines to offer access to the
internet. That issue is now one of the central ones before the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T-TCI deal is one of three large proposed mergers in the
telecommunications industry that are awaiting approval from
regulators in Washington and a variety of states. Officials are
also considering SBC Communications' $56 billion purchase of
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic's $52 billion purchase of GTE.

CARDS' DEFENSE BENDING AND BREAKING IN COMEBACK VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Three pivotal games, three sighs of relief from
the defensive coordinator after his unit flirted with disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGinnis has been pulling rabbits _ or, more on point,
``Cubs'' _ out of the hat to get his banged-up Cardinals defense
through the dramatic final stretch of the regular-season schedule.
</P>
<P>
   His unit was expected to be the strength of the team, and until
injuries changed its face, it was. It was dominating in wins over
Chicago and Detroit. It led the league in forced turnovers early,
with linebackers Ron McKinnon and Jamir Miller pushing the action
behind what was hyped as pro football's next great defensive line.
Eric Swann, one of the league's premier tackles, led a front that
included Andre Wadsworth, the third pick overall in the 1999 draft;
Simeon Rice, the third pick in the 1996 draft who was the league's
Defensive Rookie of the Year; and Mark Smith, a 1997 All-Rookie
pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were built on the premise that the defense will
win games and the offense won't lose them. But with Swann out for
the season because of knee surgery, McKinnon and Smith missing
games after injuries, Miller playing despite having a dislocated
wrist, and others suffering the nagging injuries that accompany a
physical game, it didn't go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals couldn't stop the pass against Washington, Kansas
City, Philadelphia and New Orleans. It couldn't stop the run
against Dallas, the New York Giants and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   While they surrendered yardage, the Cardinals defenders gave up
only four touchdowns in the critical three-game closing streak that
lifted them to a 9-7 record and put them in the playoffs Saturday
at Dallas (10-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense hung in,'' Wadsworth said. ``We knew what the
circumstances were. We knew what the stakes were. We believed in
each other that we could get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the closing three games, the defense gave up 17, 10 and 13
points, but the touchdowns came at bad times. San Diego's only
touchdown was with 16 seconds left, tying the game at 13. New
Orleans' only touchdown was with 1:21 to go, giving the Saints a
17-16 lead. Philadelphia's second one came with 12:58 remaining,
giving the Eagles a 17-10 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the only touchdowns in the last two games came
on the last drive, when the game was very tight, which you don't
like,'' McGinnis said. ``But I like the way this defense has
rebounded. After nine weeks, we were ranked in the top 10 in the
league. But then we had everybody healthy. We were rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries started to mount. Yes, we gave up too much yardage,
but we won those critical games when we had to. Basically, we've
been in a playoff mode for three weeks. I've been extremely proud
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Swann was particularly damaging. A run-stopping
force was gone. The pass rush suddenly was weakened. The
linebackers weren't as free to make plays. Bigger pass plays were
made because quarterbacks had more time to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still won nine and were able to get into the playoffs, so I
don't think things went south,'' McGinnis said. ``But we gave too
much yardage. A force in the middle of the defense is critical to
anything that you do. The bigger the force you take out, the
greater the impact it's going to have, and Eric's a big force. A
huge force.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches concocted exotic defenses to make best use of the
skills of the healthy players and plug the most glaring holes.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a five-man line to stop the rush, and the Cub
defense in which Wadsworth, who played tackle until his senior
season in college, was moved over center as a nose tackle, and
rookie Pat Tillman, a college linebacker who was converted to
safety, plugged in at middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with (head Coach) Vince (Tobin) professionally a
long time, and we've always had the belief that when your team
suffers setbacks, you need to be able to do something more for your
players than tell them, `Just play harder,' '' McGinnis said. ``You
need to be able to give them something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they step across the chalk, they have to make plays. But
your job as a coach is to at least get them into a position to make
plays. When you have injuries, you've got to be creative and come
up with some things to help. lf it helps you get one play in the
game, it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals got a game-turning fumble off a sack against the
Saints from the Cub.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know where we were coming from,'' said outside
linebacker Parick Sapp, who blind-sided New Orleans quarterback
Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The club has gotten numerous come-through performances from
stopgap players such as tackle Rashod Swinger, starting in place of
Swann; Bernard Wilson, a former starter who filled in admirably for
Smith; and Mark Maddox, who got the first sack in his eight-year
career while starting in place of McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through it all, we said as a team no crutches, no excuses, go
get the job done and win the ballgames, and that's what we managed
to do,'' McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and McKinnon returned last week. They were rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be a lot better this week,'' McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon and the defensive front have to slow Dallas Cowboys
running back Emmitt Smith and put pressure on quarterback Troy
Aikman. Five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas Williams, playing in
the secondary with three first-year starters, can't allow Cowboys
receiver Michael Irvin to make big plays. In a Nov. 15 game at Sun
Devil Stadium, Irvin's consecutive-game receiving streak ended at
117.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the year, even before all the injuries, we were the
youngest defense in the league by a full year per man,'' McGinnis
said. ``We knew it was young. Vince's philosophy, and I agree 100
percent, is that he's not afraid to play young people. They're not
going to get any better not playing. What we've gained from it is
that now we have guys seasoned, guys who have stepped in and played
in pressure situations. They've played, they've performed, and
they've won. We can only benefit from that.'' &QL;

PARCELLS' COACHING STRATEGY: AVOID LOSING
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone wants to understand at least one aspect of what coach
Bill Parcells is all about, then know this: He is not so much
preparing his New York Jets to win in the playoffs as he is
preparing them not to lose.
</P>
<P>
   For that is at the heart of Parcells' philosophy. Before you
understand how to win, he believes, you must understand what it is
that causes you to lose.
</P>
<P>
   This fear of losing also manifests itself in his compulsion to
nurture his superstitions.
</P>
<P>
   At first it seems odd that this high-energy successful coach
would look at the negative side of the ledger. But when he was
asked earlier this week what the Jets needed to do to win their
next two games to get to the Super Bowl, his answer was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back to this: How are you going to lose?'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Jets return to work Thursday after having three days
off and begin preparing for their Jan. 10 divisional playoff game,
they will hear Parcells talk about penalties and turnovers. They
will walk past a sign that reads: ``Smart players make smart plays.
Dumb players make dumb plays.'' From the moment Parcells tried to
make the Jets into something other than the old Jets, it was with
that credo in mind.
</P>
<P>
   This season has not simply been about quarterback Vinny
Testaverde's 29 touchdown passes. It is as much about his mere
seven interceptions. It is not solely about the yardage gained, but
about the yardage not lost.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Jets committed only 85 penalties, third-fewest in the
league, totaling 651 yards. But the Jets' opponents had 967 yards
in penalties. Parcells has figured over the years that every 100
yards you gain over an opponent, no matter where it comes from,
translates to 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells hates sacks. He growled every time Neil O'Donnell was
sacked last year _ once every 10 throws. Sacks slow you down, take
you out of field-goal range if you are deep in the opponents'
territory and cost you a play.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Jets were fourth-best in the league in preventing
the sack. Testaverde was dumped only once every 22 throws. He was
sacked only twice in the final six games, all Jets victories.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells warns his special teams players that if they have to
make a decision on whether to follow through on a play that could
lead to a penalty, do not do it. Decide to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' special teams committed only one penalty in the last
six games. During that stretch the opposition committed 16.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also preaches the importance of turnovers. Unlike some
coaches who merely talk about this being significant, Parcells
fires players who bobble the ball. The Jets went from minus-4 after
five games to plus-6 in winning 10 of their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand Parcells more fully, this fear and loathing of
losing almost translates to obsessions. His superstitions are part
of his fear of losing. He has his lucky elephants with the upturned
trunks. He has his special coins.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Parcells talks about the great motivating force in life:
fear of failure. He is proud that he got this from his father. He
cites his former coaches who goaded him this way.
</P>
<P>
   He does not keep the lucky charms around to bring him victories;
he keeps them to avoid bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while coaching the Patriots during their 1996 playoff run,
Parcells even carried a Chai, the Hebrew symbol denoting life,
which is considered a good-luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets had gone eight straight games earlier this season
without losing a regular player to injury _ and the club was the
only one in the league that week not to have one player listed as
hurt _ a reporter asked to speak to the medical and training staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Parcells, who is the only person in the
organization who can give coaches or any other football people
permission to speak to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Later, one of his confidants explained that Parcells did not
want to tempt fate by having someone write about his team's good
health. The story was written anyway, but with no comments from the
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   Was Parcells prescient? The next game, Aaron Glenn and Keith
Byars sustained injuries that would keep them out of the final
three games. They will return for the playoffs, though. But guess
what Parcells believes their injuries were due to.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season Parcells visited the dentist. The Jets won
the next game. Two days later Parcells showed up in the dentist's
office. Why? He wanted to sit in his good-luck chair. He had his
teeth cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, a reporter asked him to make his coaches
available for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   They have done a remarkable job on the club. Most have been with
him for many years. They include Bill Belichick, who should be the
object of attention by the half-dozen clubs looking for a head
coach but who is the Jets' head coach-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is the defensive coordinator. In that role, he has
presided over a defense that came within a single point of allowing
the fewest points of any team _ and just two seasons after the Jets
had given up a league-worst 454 points.
</P>
<P>
   And there is widespread interest in Charlie Weis, the offensive
coordinator, who calls most of the plays for a team averaging 26
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps people want to read about Mike Sweatman, who inherited
the worst special teams in the league in 1997 and has coached them
to become one of the most dangerous kickoff and returns units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' said Parcells, when queried about interviewing them.
``You can get them at the Super Bowl. I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   During Super Bowl week, all coaches meet with the news media.
League rules require they do so.
</P>
<P>
   But why not now? Parcells was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was not smiling.  &QL;

BIDWILL BASKING IN CARDINAL CONGRATULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Cardinals owner  &UR; Bill Bidwill has been receiving
a lot of congratulatory calls from around the league on his team
making the playoffs. These are uncharted waters since his arrival
in Arizona, and he's looking at the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players will be able to tell their children and
grandchildren that they were here at that event (Sunday's win over
the Chargers),'' he said. ``I hope we have a lot more wins to talk
about. I can boast that all my children and grandchildren were at
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   His attitude was infectious, and even center  &UR; Mike Devlin, who
was in the playoffs with the Bills, is pumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can say on my resume that I was part of the Cardinals
team that went to the playoffs for the first time (non-strike
season) in 23 years.'' &QL; 
New wrinkles not enough &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few wrinkles here and there, a trick play thrown in, too. That
all helps in the playoffs. But Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin knows that's just
window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas still has to be handled on the field,'' Tobin said.
``Different alignments can help, but the players still have to make
the plays. We still have to tackle  &UR; Emmitt Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said that wide receiver  &UR; Frank Sanders, who is not at full
strength because of an injured knee, is on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   ``His knee is still a little bit sore, but he's a lot better
than he was yesterday,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders mostly watched Wednesday's practice, but he said there
was ``no doubt'' that he would be ready to go Saturday. &QL; 
Red zone dreams &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Playoff teams are expected to use the tight end more in the
playoffs, a prediction that brings a smile to  &UR; Chris Gedney's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that's true,'' he said. ``In order to have a balanced
attack, you have to include the tight end, and I think the red zone
is a heck of a place to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gedney may get his wish.  &UR; Johnny McWilliams is having hamstring
problems and is listed as questionable for Saturday's game. &QL; 
Bon voyage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals and America West Airlines will hold a team
send-off Friday before the team heads for Dallas. The event, which
will last about 20 minutes, will be held at the west cargo ram area
of Sky Harbor International Airport. Gates open at 10:30 a.m., and
the Bandwagon, from the Cardinals' flagship station, KSLX-FM
(100.7), will provide entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The rally begins at 11:45 a.m., and the fans will hear comments
from Tobin, play-by-play man  &UR; Tom Dillon, and team captains  &UR; Lomas
 &UR; Brown,  &UR; Jamir Miller,  &UR; Jake Plummer and  &UR; Aeneas Williams. Team
officials also will be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Safety  &UR; Kwamie Lassiter was named the Miller Lite NFL Player of
the Week for his four interceptions against the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate enough to make the plays,'' he said. ``But
this is not a personal honor. It's a team honor. Everybody played
well.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Keith Brown, who has been the team chaplain for the Cardinals
and Suns for 11 years, will be in Dallas to hold a prayer service _
and he's paying his own way. It will be the first road trip this
season for Brown, who is also the football coach at Phoenix
Christian High School, will conduct the service at the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes congratulated the Cardinals after the second period
of Wednesday night's game against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Limited seating is available on the Cardinals' charter plane to
Dallas. The round-trip package price is $749, which includes hotel
accommodations and other amenities. Information: 998-922. &QL;

 &HT;    Europe woos NBA unemployed
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the NBA season only days from destruction,
European teams are turning up the pressure on Americans to join
them.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks free agent Tyrone Corbin is being so heavily courted that
Aek, a team in Athens, Greece, called Atlanta on Wednesday to find
out if Corbin is in playing condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Aek team says it expects Corbin to report next week.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Corbin said Wednesday from Columbia, S.C., where he is
spending the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been after me, but I've tried to tell them I can't
leave now, that I'm on the union negotiating committee and I can't
walk out,'' Corbin said. ``But I would be interested if the NBA
cancels the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbin, 36, said he fears that a full season away from
competition would terminate his career. And the NBA season is in
jeopardy. There was no movement on the labor front on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(If) we're going to play this season _ and I'm not giving up
by any means _ then I want to stay here,'' Corbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Aek, European Cup finalist last season, also has some interest
in Utah free-agent forward Chris Morris and Hawks free-agent
forward Pig Miller. The club plays through May.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's Nick Van Exel and New York's Marcus Camby and Reggie
Slater of Toronto Wednesday had a judge deny their suit against the
league for the right to go to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, European nationals Vlade Divac and Arvydas Sabonis
signed to play with teams in their native countries, although they
have reserved the right to return to the U.S. if the lockout is
lifted.

 &HT;    Holmgren `big domino' if he moves
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The purge on ``Bloody Monday'' created five of the
seven coaching vacancies in the NFL, but the impending voluntary
exit of Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren figures to have the most
significant effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Panthers wasted little time securing an interview
with former San Francisco coach George Seifert on Tuesday, but
Holmgren tops owner Jerry Richardson's wish list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is the guy everybody wants, but he can only take one of
(the jobs),'' said Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick,
arguably the hottest assistant in the league. ``He's the big
domino. Once he's situated, everything else will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Packers are in the playoffs, tampering rules
preclude teams from discussing openings with Holmgren, whose
contract stipulates that he can leave Green Bay only for a
combination coach-general-manager post. If the Packers lose Sunday
at San Francisco, however, Holmgren's telephone will be ringing off
the hook Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   With Bill Walsh set to return to the Niners' front office _ the
Hall of Fame coach has a verbal agreement, and an announcement is
expected within two weeks _ odds increase that Holmgren could go
back to San Francisco, where he once was offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would set into motion a chain reaction that might
result in current 49ers coach Steve Mariucci being hired by the
expansion Cleveland Browns franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the current openings and early possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   _ Baltimore: Vice president Ozzie Newsome three weeks ago
formulated a list that included 27 prospects, then began whittling
it down. Owner Art Modell spoke with Seifert on Sunday night, but
no interview is imminent, and Seifert has more attractive
possibilities. Other names include Jacksonville offensive
coordinator Chris Palmer, Steelers defensive coordinator Jim
Haslett, Michigan State coach Nick Saban and Mike Bellotti of
Oregon. Contrary to a broadcast report, the Ravens did not
interview Mike Riley of Oregon State at the Blue-Gray game. Look
for Billick to emerge as the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carolina: Seifert might prefer Seattle, and, like him,
Holmgren is a West Coast kind of guy. Richardson will throw lots of
money and plenty of control at both, but he could strike out. After
the Big Two, it's anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicago: While team president Mike McCaskey is on vacation,
operations director Mark Hatley will interview a dozen candidates
and pare the list to about three. Then McCaskey will get involved.
Despite the president's contention that the team has ``a core of
good players,'' the roster is lacking, and the Bears could have
trouble attracting a ``name'' coach. If Marty Schottenheimer were
to leave Kansas City unexpectedly, his friendship with Hatley might
serve Chicago well. But unless that happens, the candidates are
Palmer or Green Bay quarterbacks coach Andy Reid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleveland: Team president Carmen Policy covets Holmgren. He
was ``blown away'' by the thoroughness of Billick on Monday and was
impressed Tuesday with Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak. At
some point, Palmer and Reid figure to get interviews. But if
Mariucci becomes available, he's the guy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philadelphia: Director of operations Tom Modrak will interview
Haslett today and has recommended him to owner Jeff Lurie. But vice
president Joe Banner wants to talk with several candidates, and Dom
Capers might meet with team officials this week. With the NFL's
poorest practice facilities, a shabby stadium and an owner who is
perceived as having cash-flow problems, the Eagles can forget any
high-profile coaches.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Diego: General manager Bobby Beathard has begun tightening
his list a little, but college coaches Bob Toledo (UCLA), Ted
Tollner (San Diego State) and Tyrone Willingham (Stanford) are out.
Look for a young, offensive-minded assistant like San Francisco
offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg to get strong consideration.
Beathard granted a courtesy interview to incumbent defensive chief
Joe Pascale, but he has virtually no chance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seattle: Like folks in Chicago, team officials will monitor
the Schottenheimer situation, and owner Paul Allen hasn't written
off another run at Holmgren. The Seahawks will seek permission to
talk with Haslett, but Seifert is the guy most likely to be
coaching this team in 1999.

REPORTS SAYS CHINA HAS OBTAINED SENSITIVE U.S. MILITARY
TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moving in ``i'' news file.) 
(htv) 
 By JEFF GERTH and ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A select House committee, in a classified report
unusual for its bipartisanship, has found that over the last 20
years China has obtained, sometimes through theft, some of the most
sensitive American military technology, including nuclear weapons
design, government officials and witnesses before the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's final report, unanimously approved by its five
Republican and four Democratic members on Wednesday, found that
during Republican and Democratic administrations alike, China
acquired a range of technology and technical secrets far beyond the
transfers of information during the Clinton administration that
prompted the panel to begin its inquiry this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a carefully worded statement after the report was approved,
the committee's chairman, Rep. Christopher Cox, R.-Calif., said
that China's acquisition of American technology had harmed national
security and that its ``acquisition efforts over the past two
decades'' had been a ``serious, sustained'' activity.
</P>
<P>
   The panel released no details from its 700-page report on
Wednesday because so much of its six-month inquiry dealt with
classified information. The committee promised to begin a process,
in consultation with the Clinton administration, to declassify as
many of the findings as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But witnesses and intelligence officials who worked with the
committee said it agreed with assessments by the Pentagon and the
State Department that information shared with Chinese scientists by
two American companies, Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Space
and Communications, had improved Beijing's ability to launch
satellites and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, witnesses said, the panel's conclusion that China
had stolen military-related American technology might prove to be
the most explosive part of the report. The panel uncovered, for
example, a pattern by the Chinese of stealing nuclear weapons
design technology from American military laboratories, said one
person who has read part of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, these officials said, faulted policies from the
Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations and made 38
recommendations to address those policy failures. The
recommendations covered areas including security at U.S. weapons
laboratories, handling of sensitive intelligence data and
export-control policies.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee did not directly examine covert Chinese
contributions to the 1996 American elections, officials said it did
investigate the activities of a Chinese aerospace executive, Liu
Chaoying, who has been a conduit for payments by the Chinese
government to Democratic fund-raisers and who, with her father, Liu
Huaqing, the former senior general in the Chinese military, has
been involved in China's effort to acquire military-related
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators now say that access to American military
technology was a primary motivation behind the payments by the
Chinese government to Democratic fund-raisers that were later
traced to Ms. Liu and other possible conduits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu and her father have been active in China's effort to
acquire and sell sensitive technology, both in the United States
and abroad, according to documents and intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was organized last summer after The New York Times
disclosed that American satellite makers had helped Chinese
scientists rectify failures in their rocket programs, conveying
information that is applicable to long-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six months, the panel held 33 closed hearings,
taking testimony from intelligence officials, industry executives
and nuclear-weapons experts.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's inquiry initially focused on the interaction
between American satellite manufacturers and China, whose rockets
carry their satellites into orbit. It soon branched out to examine
the export of other advanced American technologies to China,
including advanced computers and machining equipment.

 WASHINGTON: machining equipment. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The panel hired outside experts to examine the question of
whether scientists from Hughes and Loral had harmed national
security by giving the Chinese lessons in rocket technology after
the failure of two Chinese rockets in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies deny any wrongdoing, but earlier this month, the
aDministration completed reports of its own on the subject, raising
national security concerns about the assistance, especially the
help that Hughes provided the Chinese in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence arm of the State Department found that the 1995
``tutorial'' by Hughes had ``resulted in significant improvement''
to China's rocket program, lessons that are ``inherently applicable
to their missile programs as well.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Wednesday at the Capitol, committee
members said their analysis had gone far beyond the reviews of the
failed Chinese rocket launches by Hughes and Loral.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was harm in some of the transfers of technology that
occurred, but it's also fair to say this is not the only problem we
uncovered,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the ranking
Democrat on the panel. ``These are serious problems that must be
addressed by the Administration and by the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   It is publicly known that China has an aggressive military and
economic espionage program, and that it has long sought to acquire
American technology, both legally and illegally.
</P>
<P>
   But the House panel, formally called the Select Committee on
U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the
People's Republic of China, learned new details about the depth and
scope of these activities as it completed the most comprehensive
examination of the issue ever conducted by any part of the American
government.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses before the panel included officials from U.S.
nuclear weapons labs, according to one witness. Last year the
General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, issued a
report that raised questions about the adequacy of security at the
weapons labs, including a decision in 1994 to reduce background
checks of various foreign visitors. The visitors, most of whom are
Russian and Chinese, are not allowed access to classified areas.
</P>
<P>
   The select committee's report may stir further debate over
relations with China. The report's findings come as new questions
are being raised about Beijing's harsh treatment of political
dissidents and foreign investors. But that debate will not take
place in public until the report, or at least key parts of it, are
declassified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we look forward to reading the report and studying
its recommendations,'' said David C. Leavy, a White House
spokesman. ``In terms of declassification, we need to work with the
committee in an appropriate way to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly how much the American public will learn
about the committee's findings. The issue of what to disclose is
usually resolved by the release of general conclusions, and the
withholding of details that might reveal how the sensitive
information was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the House of Representatives could find political
unity in a year of fractious discourse is probably due to the
serious national security concerns that underlie the work of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Cox and Dicks, the members of the panel are
Republicans Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, Porter J. Goss of Florida,
James V. Hansen of Utah and Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, and
Democrats John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Robert C. Scott of
Virginia and Lucille Roybal-Allard of California. Most of the
members have been active in national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our select committee was led to ever more serious problems of
technology transfers and their national-security implications,''
Cox said in an interview on Wednesday. ``Addressing that issue led
us to this extraordinary bipartisan result.''

BOEING MEETS GOAL, BUT LOOKS TO BIGGER CHALLENGE IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As the new Southwest Airlines 737-700 accelerated down
the runway at Boeing Field Wednesday, the roar of its two engines
nearly drowned out the excited words of Alan Mulally.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally, Boeing's new Commercial Airplanes boss whose
enthusiastic nature is legendary, was even more juiced than usual
and he was talking loudly to the media horde that surrounded him as
he walked down the flight line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing is coming back!'' Mulally said as the 737 headed off
into the morning sky, one of the last planes to be handed over to a
customer this year from the company's Boeing Field delivery center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful, wonderful thing. ... Boeing is doing what
it said it would do, which is the first step in our recovery,''
Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, Boeing had warned analysts that it might
fall a few planes short of its oft-stated goal of delivering a
record 550 airplanes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Boeing reach that goal, it exceeded it.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the tally was 556 deliveries. A Boeing
spokesman said it was possible the final delivery count could be
about 560, though the exact figure will not be made public until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although beaming with pride that Boeing had done what it said it
would do, Mulally was already looking ahead yesterday to an even
bigger deliver job in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it will deliver 620 planes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And it will have to do so with fewer workers. The company plans
to eliminate up to 38,000 jobs by the end of 1999, and an
additional 10,000 jobs in 2000. Many will come from the commercial
workforce in Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just going to do it again,'' Mulally said in response
to a question about meeting its 1999 delivery goal.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger challenge, he acknowledged, will be making more
money on those 620 airplanes than it did on those delivered this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for market share with European rival Airbus Industrie
the past few years has eroded Boeing's profits as it gave
double-digit discounts to airlines customers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said those days are over, and the company
will now focus on restoring commercial margins to what they once
were. It has no choice. Its stock, and reputation, have been
battered the last year and a half. For the first time in a half
century, Boeing ended 1997 in the red, and it will make little
profit this year.
</P>
<P>
   Time and time again in 1998, Boeing disappointed analysts and
investors with gloomy financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was one of the few bright spots in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most industry analysts did not believe Boeing would be able to
meet its 550-plane delivery goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing has been through a lot this year,'' Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in Boeing's recovery was making good on its
promise to deliver those 550 planes this year, he said, adding that
the second step is to deliver 620 planes in 1999 and ``make a
reasonable return on those airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's fourth-quarter results will be released Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The 550 figure was reached early Tuesday afternoon, a Boeing
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The company shipped 14 planes on Tuesday to tie a single-day
delivery record.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has aircraft delivery centers at Boeing Field, Everett
and at desert airfields in California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   David Palmer, head of the Boeing Field delivery center, said a
record 46 jetliners were delivered from his facility during
December. The final plane, a 757, was delivered yesterday. The
previous monthly delivery record at Boeing Field was 38 jets, set
this past June.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 Boeing planes were still on the flight line at the
delivery center yesterday. They will be delivered to customers in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The planes delivered this year include about 50 built at
Boeing's Douglas Division in Long Beach., Calif. McDonnell Douglas
was acquired by Boeing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's peacetime delivery record before the merger was 446
planes in 1992. Last year, Boeing delivered 375 planes, including
those from Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   After next year, however, production will fall. Boeing is ending
production of the MD-80, MD-90 and MD-11. The company expects to
deliver only 490 planes in 2000. Monthly production rates in Puget
Sound also will be slashed because of an industry-wide downturn and
the effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must make those fewer planes more efficiently, Mulally
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely essential to Boeing's future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing's production lines were in disarray earlier this
year, they are now are running much better, he said, as evidenced
by the fact that fewer workers were needed this holiday season than
last.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 holidays, between 12,000 to 15,000 employees, or
as much as 13 percent of the workforce, worked each day to meet
Boeing's delivery schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 3.5 percent of Boeing's workforce was needed this
year over the Christmas holidays. Typically, about 3 percent of the
workforce is used during that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear sign of improvement for Boeing Commercial
Airplanes,'' Mulally said. ``It's good to go into the New Year with
this kind of momentum.''

</P>
<P>
   Both companies deny any wrongdoing, but earlier this month, the
aDministration completed reports of its own on the subject, raising
national security concerns about the assistance, especially the
help that Hughes provided the Chinese in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence arm of the State Department found that the 1995
``tutorial'' by Hughes had ``resulted in significant improvement''
to China's rocket program, lessons that are ``inherently applicable
to their missile programs as well.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Wednesday at the Capitol, committee
members said their analysis had gone far beyond the reviews of the
failed Chinese rocket launches by Hughes and Loral.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was harm in some of the transfers of technology that
occurred, but it's also fair to say this is not the only problem we
uncovered,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the ranking
Democrat on the panel. ``These are serious problems that must be
addressed by the Administration and by the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   It is publicly known that China has an aggressive military and
economic espionage program, and that it has long sought to acquire
American technology, both legally and illegally.
</P>
<P>
   But the House panel, formally called the Select Committee on
U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the
People's Republic of China, learned new details about the depth and
scope of these activities as it completed the most comprehensive
examination of the issue ever conducted by any part of the American
government.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses before the panel included officials from U.S.
nuclear weapons labs, according to one witness. Last year the
General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, issued a
report that raised questions about the adequacy of security at the
weapons labs, including a decision in 1994 to reduce background
checks of various foreign visitors. The visitors, most of whom are
Russian and Chinese, are not allowed access to classified areas.
</P>
<P>
   The select committee's report may stir further debate over
relations with China. The report's findings come as new questions
are being raised about Beijing's harsh treatment of political
dissidents and foreign investors. But that debate will not take
place in public until the report, or at least key parts of it, are
declassified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we look forward to reading the report and studying
its recommendations,'' said David C. Leavy, a White House
spokesman. ``In terms of declassification, we need to work with the
committee in an appropriate way to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly how much the American public will learn
about the committee's findings. The issue of what to disclose is
usually resolved by the release of general conclusions, and the
withholding of details that might reveal how the sensitive
information was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the House of Representatives could find political
unity in a year of fractious discourse is probably due to the
serious national security concerns that underlie the work of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Cox and Dicks, the members of the panel are
Republicans Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, Porter J. Goss of Florida,
James V. Hansen of Utah and Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, and
Democrats John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Robert C. Scott of
Virginia and Lucille Roybal-Allard of California. Most of the
members have been active in national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our select committee was led to ever more serious problems of
technology transfers and their national-security implications,''
Cox said in an interview on Wednesday. ``Addressing that issue led
us to this extraordinary bipartisan result.''

MARKET PLACE: THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS ON WALL STREET
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lobbying that shapes legislation or precedes the
Academy Awards pales when compared to the anguished phone calls
made by some of Wall Street's biggest firms this week as they
battle for pre-eminence in the annual ranking of the most
influential deal makers.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary figures, expected to be released Thursday, are
to investment bankers what Hollywood's gold statuettes are to
actors: the basis for bragging rights to market their genius as
well as command lucrative fees from clients.
</P>
<P>
   League tables, as they are called, are compiled by Securities
Data Co. of Newark, N.J., and are little known beyond Wall Street.
But the figures sway corporate executives to pick one rainmaker
over another to advise on their next merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league tables are marketed as tangible evidence of power
and stature,'' said Samuel Hayes, a finance professor at Harvard
Business School. ``With job security reduced, some of these senior
officers at investment banks constantly have to provide evidence
that they are adding value.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mallea huddled in his cubicle at Securities Data each day
this week, fielding 20 to 30 calls from bankers inquiring about
their standing. One asked Mallea, the research manager, to increase
the value of an earlier deal that could improve his firm's ranking.
Mallea wouldn't do it. A lawyer called to make sure that they were
publishing the same types of tables as last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to influence you,'' Mallea said the lawyer told
him, noting how well his firm ranked last year. The tables remain
the same. Nothing seems off-limits; bankers even dispute whether a
competitor was involved in a deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds silly,'' Mallea said. ``But for their pitch books to
clients, it is important. They want a table that shows them in the
best possible light.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers who advise companies on mergers and acquisitions are
ranked, among other things, by the dollar value of all announced
and completed deals they worked on. This year, Goldman, Sachs beat
the competition, advising on $933 billion worth of announced deals
and $578 billion of completed deals worldwide, according to
Securities Data. That's ahead of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and
Merrill Lynch, which round out the top three.
</P>
<P>
   But bankers are loath to publicly discuss how much sniping goes
on. ``It's our little secret,'' said a banker who asked not to be
identified. ``We all do it.'' Still, some contend that the
competitive pressure to be No. 1 has gone too far. ``People have
become so self-conscious about league tables that they will take
any action to get credit for a deal,'' another banker said. ``It
has become a game.''
</P>
<P>
   And not necessarily a nice one. Consider the dispute after
British Petroleum in August announced that it was acquiring Amoco
Corp. People close to that deal said J.P. Morgan groused that
Merrill Lynch did not deserve the credit it claimed for advising
British Petroleum. Morgan insisted it had been the sole adviser and
Merrill's role was limited: Merrill was not even named as an
adviser in the press release.
</P>
<P>
   So Jack Levy, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at
Merrill Lynch, personally called executives at Securities Data to
provide evidence that it had been hired by British Petroleum, said
these people. Securities Data contacted executives at British
Petroleum to discuss Merrill's role and after a chat, concluded
that while J.P. Morgan had indeed been the lead adviser, Merrill
Lynch played a substantial enough role to share credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always worth it for a bank which is No. 1 or No. 2 to
spend time with us,'' said Jim Sussmann, a product manager at
Securities Data. Morgan and Merrill Lynch declined to comment about
their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Sussmann said bankers have questioned one aspect of almost all
of the top 10 mergers announced this year. At least five times a
quarter, he said, an investment banker will complain that a
competitor does not deserve credit. And overanxious bankers,
wanting to know how a potential deal will show up in the rankings,
have called him before the announcement to see where a
``hypothetical'' deal will stack up.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for credit is fierce, in part, because bankers hired
at the last minute get as much glory as those running the show.
Executives close to the talks between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications
Inc., which announced a merger in June, said Merrill Lynch was not
at the negotiations but still got full credit for a small role. A
similar grumble was made about Morgan Stanley and its participation
in the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger, which _ while all advisers had
limited roles _ was less than other banks that shared the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are happy to take a role, even if small,'' said an
investment banker who also asked not to be named. ``But other
bankers don't like that, and will complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers too are sometimes awarded a small part in a
deal as a favor from one of the corporations' executives _ another
reason bankers grouse. ``If a chief financial officer or a chief
executive want to make a friend on Wall Street, they'll let a
banker in a deal because it can help them,'' said the investment
banker. ``You have to look at whether a banker is being paid back
for other services, as well as the ability for an investment bank
to barge their way in at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But being on the team of a blockbuster deal doesn't always add
up to spectacular profits. ``If a banker is brought in later to
rubber-stamp a deal, fees can be thin,'' said Guy Dawson, co-head
of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for
Merrill Lynch in London. ``But if they are there from the
inception, they will get paid a fee that reflects that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Securities Data does not rank bankers by fees
because it does not have enough data to do so, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The December announcement of Exxon Corp.'s acquisition of Mobil
is hailed as the biggest merger ever, but people close to the deal
said J.P. Morgan was paid about $10 million for its services and
Goldman about $11 million. The reason is that the deal was
negotiated mainly between the two chief executives, those people
said. Those fees are a pittance compared with the $105 million
Goldman and Credit Suisse First Boston took in for advising on the
more complex combination of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz AG completed
this year, a deal valued at half that between Exxon and Mobil.
Neither J.P. Morgan nor Goldman will comment on fees paid.
</P>
<P>
   The grab for market share is likely to continue. Some newer
entrants into the European mergers-and-acquisitions market are
trying to further their standings by selectively trimming fees as
much as 30 percent on smaller deals to garner much-desired league
table status, said several bankers there.
</P>
<P>
   But shopping for cheaper fees is not the smartest way to pick a
banker, said Hayes of Harvard, who as a consultant has advised
chief executives on what bankers to choose. He's heard an earful of
pitches from bankers all professing to be No. 1. ``I'm polite,'' he
said. ``But I don't take them all that seriously.''

TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO TEST UDALL MAXIM
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 and PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona, as the late Mo Udall used to say, is the only state
where mothers tell their children they can't grow up to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   Now two Arizonans, Sen. John McCain and former Vice President
Dan Quayle, are about to test the Udall maxim in a contest that
will put the state in the national spotlight and strain the
political loyalties of local Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain filed a statement of candidacy with the
Federal Election Commission for the Republican nomination for pres
ident. He is now free to organize a committee to raise money for a
presidential campaign and is ex pected to make a formal announce
ment within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, while not formally an nounced, is making moves to launch
a presidential bid from Phoenix, where he recently opened his Cam
paign America offices near 29th Street and Camelback.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time an Arizonan has run for president, but
the likely dual candidacies of McCain and Quayle add an odd
footnote to the state's peculiar political history.
</P>
<P>
   The late Sen. Barry Goldwater became the first Arizonan to
launch a presidential bid in 1964. He won the GOP presidential nod
but was crushed in the general election after opponents cast him as
a reckless warmonger.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Morris Udall, a Democrat, ran in 1976 and suffered a string
of humiliating second-place finishes in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   After that, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt tried in 1988, but
his effort also was abortive.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential flops led Udall to coin the joke about
Arizona's snakebit presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's history of failed candi dates now raises a serious
question for McCain and Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Can a politician from a state with a population as small as
Arizona's win national support?
</P>
<P>
   McCain appeared in the single digits in presidential preference
polls taken earlier this year. One CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll showed
more than half of those surveyed either never heard of McCain or
had no opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain is counting on build ing a national following with
the help of the Eastern media, which warms to his maverick approach
to issues and his outspokenness. Mc Cain's gripping personal story
of being held a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for 5{ years, a
familiar tale to Arizona voters, is trumpeted in almost every story
by national reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``His story may be very familiar among the Arizona electorate,
but it's a powerful and new story to the rest of the country,''
said national GOP pollster Bill MacInturff, who is among those
advising McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very powerful story to tell . . . and it makes a pretty
strong contrast to the last six years of the current president,''
MacInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a strong ability to get positive,
substantial media coverage,'' said Sydney Hoff Hay, a Phoenix
conservative and political consultant who is chief consultant to
lesser-known GOP presidential candidate Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also starts at some thing of a disadvantage: His name
isn't a household word outside of Arizona. Unlike Quayle or Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, McCain will have to work to build up name
identification, and that takes time and money.
</P>
<P>
   If Quayle jumps in, an Arizona candidacy will give him the oppor
tunity to run as a Western candidate, a factor that has cachet with
the growing importance of early West ern primaries. It could also
help the former vice president put distance between himself and his
days as a Capitol insider, allowing him to run as a candidate from
``outside the Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also has an advantage in that he has contacts and support
on which to build in such early-primary states as Iowa and New
Hampshire, and he is substantially more appeal ing to wealthy
conservatives than is the firebrand McCain.
</P>
<P>
   To win in either state, candidates generally need to have been
around the same block several times and have backing from
supporters who are identifiably conservative, said Kyle McSlarrow,
vice chairman of Quayle's Campaign America.
</P>
<P>
   If both men survive the early primaries, Dodie Londen, Arizona's
former GOP chairwoman, expects an interesting race, but she's not
sure either is guaranteed an Arizona victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are well-known, likeable, with good political
instincts,'' Lon den said. But McCain's willingness to break with
party dogma _ notably on such issues as campaign reform and taxes
on big tobacco _ gives him an aura of moderation that could turn
off many on the Republican right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be somewhat held against him, I think,'' Londen
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Quayle has a weakness, it could be his inability to define
his core political values, analysts say. Quayle must vie for the
support of hard-right conservative voters against such potential
candidates as Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft; Gary Bauer, president of
the conservative Family Research Council; and Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see the serious conservative activists in this
party looking at Dan Quayle,'' said Hoff Hay. ``Many don't believe
he can seriously rejuvenate his image in the media _ the whole
potato thing . . . and he may not really be as ideological as they
would like.''
</P>
<P>
   If he survives until Arizona's primary, McCain's strong
re-election showing likely gives him an edge. But Bush also
attracted a strong turnout when he came to Arizona to raise money
for Gov. Jane Hull earlier this year, and Bush could compete with
McCain for the sup port of party moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The megawealthy publisher Steve Forbes, who won Arizona's 1996
GOP primary, also has some rem nants from his campaign organi
zation.
</P>
<P>
   Both men would love to win in Arizona, not so much for its
delegate count but because it is the first Western primary and
could help fuel much-ballyhoed ``momen tum'' going into the
delegate-rich California primary and Super Tues day.
</P>
<P>
   Londen said both men will have to work to win ballots from Arizo
na's populist voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something they can just count on,'' she said. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill has made it clear
all week that Texas running back Ricky Williams is not the player
the Bulldogs plan to focus on in the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ricky Williams is a great player, as everyone knows,''
Sherrill said. ``But Major Applewhite is the reason Texas has done
so well this season. He is the difference for them, and he's the
guy we have to go after.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, a redshirt freshman quarterback who guided the 8-3
Longhorns to seven victories in their last eight games, spent a
great deal of his time this year handing the ball to Williams. But
he also did more as a passer than any freshman signal-caller in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a blur,'' said Applewhite, who is nicknamed
``Opie'' because of his red hair and freckles. ``It all has gone by
so fast, but it has been the best year of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite threw for at least 200 yards in each of his nine
starts and ended the season with a UT freshman record of 2,453
yards passing and 18 touchdowns. His passer rating of 147.4 was the
highest of any freshman in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Baton Rouge, La., native has come a long way from his first
start, when Texas lost 48-7 at Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I'm much better, but I'm definitely
better,'' Applewhite said. ``I still have a long way to go, but
there are mistakes I was making early in the year that I'm not
making now. What I strive to do is be consistent. I'm much more
comfortable now with my reads and my checks. I anticipate things
sooner now.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that helped Applewhite was having with him in the
backfield a senior on his way to the Heisman Trophy. Defenses
stacked the line and keyed on Williams, which opened things up for
Applewhite and his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Ricky is something I will never forget,''
Applewhite said. ``It has been an honor just to be in the same
backfield with him. It seemed like every time I gave him the ball,
history was being made. It has been very special.''
</P>
<P>
   What will Applewhite and the UT offense do next season without
Williams?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to think about it,'' Applewhite said. ``Next
year, we will have to learn to live without him.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Applewhite and Texas offensive coordinator
Greg Davis have thought about it. Not only will UT lose Williams,
but the offense also will lose tight end Derek Lewis and four other
starters on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear to be a scenario that could lead to the dreaded
sophomore jinx for Applewhite, something that has happened to other
UT quarterbacks in the past. But he believes he knows how to avoid
any backslide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not to try to do too much,'' Applewhite said.
``That's the biggest obstacle I have to overcome. Just stay within
the offense. Coach Davis and I have talked about it. I have to play
within myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of quarterbacks have a great first season, then
come back the next year and try to outplay the previous season. You
can't do that. You have to approach things the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people might say Applewhite will have to be a different
quarterback next season because he will see different defensive
looks from the teams Texas will play. But Davis doesn't look at it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to be a different quarterback next season,''
Davis said. ``Obviously, there will be more eggs in his basket
without Ricky and without the experience on the offensive line. We
may throw the ball more, so his numbers may be different, but I
don't think he has to be different. His success in taking this team
from Point A to Point B is because he takes what's there. That's
what we want him to continue to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has tried to instill the conservative approach in
Applewhite. But it hasn't always been easy, because Applewhite
loves to throw deep and has been successful doing so. He had a
school-record 97-yard touchdown pass to Wane McGarity in the
Oklahoma game, and the tandem hooked up for a TDs of 67, 47 and 31
yards at Texas Tech on a night when Applewhite threw for four
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Major sees his receiver open in single coverage, we want
him to do that,'' Davis said. ``But we tell him the main thing is
to move the chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might see one-on-one coverage down the sideline, but if he
has a first-down maker in the flat, that's where we want him to go.
Nobody on our staff is ever going to say anything bad about him
dropping the ball off for a three-yard completion. That's part of
our philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis admits he has been surprised at how much poise the
20-year-old Applewhite has shown this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be surprised, because he hadn't done it,'' Davis
said. ``But I don't want to say I am totally shocked, because we
knew he was a talented player. In camp, I saw he was always headed
to the right place with the ball. You could tell mentally he was
going to be fine, but transferring that to a game situation, you
just don't know until they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-1 and 195 pounds, Applewhite has a bit of a frail look, but
Davis said his pupil's appearance is deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``His physical attributes would not lead you to believe he is a
tough guy,'' Davis said. ``But he can take a shot and get right up
and go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major has all the intangibles you look for at that position.
He is very mature and very bright. He studies a lot of film. The
best thing is it's important to him to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite credits a lot of his improvement this season to the
man he replaced _ senior Richard Walton. Applewhite inherited the
starting job when Walton broke his right hand in the UCLA game, but
Applewhite played well enough to keep the job when Walton was
healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory over Texas A&AMP;M to close the regular season,
Applewhite stood up in the locker room and thanked Walton for
everything he had done for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset for Richard when he got hurt, because he had
worked so hard,'' Applewhite said. ``We both wanted to play, but
the way he handled it made me feel more at ease. He just wanted us
to win and to see me get better. It was a true display of class and
character.''

   Applewhite realizes next year will present some new challenges,
but he is expecting big things in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that things may not go as smoothly early on
without Ricky,'' he said. ``But I think once we get rolling, the
offense will be just as explosive as it was this year. I just have
to be patient. I think this team can make a run at the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   A national championship after losing the Heisman winner?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Tennessee,'' Applewhite said. ``Peyton Manning didn't
quite win it, but they lost him and they are right there this year.
So it definitely can be done.''

PAC-10 HAS NOT LACK OF COMMITMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here'a a look at the reported Pac-10 oral commitments to this
point, and remember these commitments are not binding. National
letter of intent signing day is Feb.3.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (10):
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Brown, wr, 5-11, 185, Chabot Community College; Tyrone
Brown, te, 6-4, 240, San Diego Morse; Justin Levasseur, te, 6-5,
230, Antioch; Matt Molina, lb, 6-3, 210, Scottsdale (Ariz.)
Chaparral; Matt Perry, de, 6-3, 235, Gilbert, Ariz.; Brandon
Phillips, dl, 6-6, 275, Tempe (Ariz.) Corona del Sol; Lance
Relford, wr, 6-2, 190, Houston Jersey Village; Shelton Ross, lb,
6-1, 215, Hutchinson (Kan.) JC; Damion Segovia, wr, 6-3, 185,
Glendale (Ariz.) CC; Cliff Watkins, qb, 6-3, 190, Breckenridge,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats dipped into Texas to get a pair of players, but the
one they really want, linebacker Corey Redding, hasn't announced
his destination. Molina could be a future star at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State (9):
</P>
<P>
   Josh Amobi, lb, 6-2, 210, Phoenix Shadow Mountain; Jamall
Anderson, lb, 6-2, 235, Long Beach City College
</P>
<P>
   ; Michael Barth, k-db, Phoenix Mountain Pointe; Regis Crawford,
ol, 6-3, 295, San Diego Morse; Ryan Dennard, wr, 6-4, 210, Phoenix
College; Delvon Flowers, rb, 6-0, 185, El Camino College
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Chad Howell, lb, 6-4, 210, Phoenix St. Mary's; Nick Johnson, ol,
6-8, 310, Cottonwood (Ariz.) Mingus; Brandon Tomerlin, db, 6-2,
195, Superior, Ariz.; Shaun McDonald, wr-kr, 5-9, 170, Phoenix
Shadow Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   Tough year on the field, good start to the second season.
Johnson, Amobi, Tomerlin, Barth and McDonald are among the best
preps in Arizona. Anderson and Flowers are a pair of strong junior
college players.
</P>
<P>
   California (13):
</P>
<P>
   Josh Beckham, dl-ol, 6-3, 270, Yucca Valley; Nolan Bluntzer, ol,
6-4, 280, New Braunfels, Texas; Chris Chick, ol, 6-5, 270, Mesa
(Ariz.) CC; Derek Deutsch, dl, 6-5, 270, Torrance; Joe Echema, rb,
5-11, 185, Hawthorne; David Hays, ol, 6-2, 255, Liberty; Jeremy
Hersey, k-p, 6-0, 170, San Bernardino Pacific; Daniel Nwangu,
dl-te, 6-3, 255, Sugar Land (Texas) Kempner; Tim Pompa, dl, 6-5,
260, Glendale (Ariz.) CC; Nick Shaeffer, ol, 6-5, 255, Irvine
Woodbridge; Ryan Sorahan, qb, 6-4, 210, Los Gatos; Scott Tercero,
ol, 6-5, 250, Loyola; Mark Wilson, te-dl, 6-7, 250, Fall River
McArthur.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Bears begin with the beef and also landed a good
quarterback. However, the quarterback they really want is Hart's
Kyle Boller.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon (4):
</P>
<P>
   Eric Cheney, db, 6-1, 195, Junction City, Ore.; Curtis Doerr, p,
6-1, 185, Glendale (Ariz.) CC; Jermaine Hanspard, db, 5-11, 180,
LBCC
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Mitchell, db, 6-1, 185, Grossmont CC.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   Is Boller headed to Eugene? He has to be the Ducks' first
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State (15):
</P>
<P>
   Andy Arena, ol, 6-3, 290, Renton (Wash.) Liberty; Chad
Carpenter, db, 5-11, 185, LBCC
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Cesca, k, 6-0, 180, Mira Costa; Paul Davidian, dl, 6-4,
280, San Francisco CC; Matt Davis, ol, 6-5, 285, Salem (Ore.)
North; DeLawrence Grant, dl, 6-3, 255, El Camino College
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Douglas, rb, 6-2, 200, Cupertino Monte Vista; Dwan
Edwards, dl, 6-4, 240, Columbus, Mont.; Robbie Enghusen, ol, 6-7,
305, Renton (Wash.) Liberty; Shayne House, qb, 6-5, 205,
Placerville El Dorado; Shaman Jamerson, db, 6-0, 180, Palisades;
Benny Johnson, te, 6-2, 245, San Francisco City College; Brian
Kilkenny, ol, 6-5, 270, Santa Rosa Montgomery; Dan Rothwell, dl,
6-7, 220, Lake Oswego, Ore.; Lary Shyne, wr, 6-1, 175, Mount San
Antonio College.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   This impressive list gets better with the addition of running
back Patrick McCall, a 6-foot, 205-pound Michigan transfer and
Carson High graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (10):
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Carter, rb, 6-2, 215, Ontario (Canada) Henry Carr
Secondary; Drew Caylor, dl, 6-5, 240, Bethesda (Md.) Chevy Chase;
Jake Covault, lb-te, 6-3, 225, Tarpon Springs (Fla.) East Lake;
Justin Faust, rb, 6-1, 185, Arlington (Texas) Lamar; Brian Gaffney,
lb-fb, 6-2, 225, Phoenix Brophy Prep; Louis Hobson, dl, 6-4, 225,
Toronto Northern; Mike Holman, ol, 6-4, 275, Houston (Texas) Clear
Lake; Jim Johnson, db, 5-11, 175, Abington, Pa.; Chris Lewis, qb,
6-4, 210, Long Beach Poly
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Stimson, dl, 6-4, 260, Colleyville (Texas) Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal traveled the country and even ventured to Canada to
get their first 10, but the jewel comes from Long Beach. Lewis has
the luxury of being able to redshirt while learning to play
quarterback in college.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (9):
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ball, dl, 6-5, 230, Dixon; Matt Ball, dl, 6-5, 230, Dixon;
Asi Faoa, te-de, 6-4, 230, Anaheim Magnolia, Nathan Fikse, k, 5-11,
175, Anaheim Esperanza; Shane Lehmann, ol, 6-5, 280, Corona; Rodney
Leisle, dl, 6-4, 305, Bakersfield Ridgeview; J.P. Losman, qb, 6-3,
180, Venice; Jerry Owens, wr, 6-3, 180, Newhall Hart; Ryan Wikert,
wr-db, 6-2, 175, Temecula Valley.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   There could be several future stars in this group. Leisle and
the Ball twins will help shore up a young defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   USC (12):
</P>
<P>
   Sagan Atuatasi, dl, 6-2, 300, Los Alamitos
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Graham, lb, 6-1, 230, Bakersfield; Kareem Kelly, wr, 6-2,
195, Long Beach Poly
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   David Newbury, K, 5-10, 172, Navarro (Texas) CC; Chris Prosser,
lb, 6-1, 200, San Diego Morse; Darrell Rideaux, db, 5-8, 160, Long
Beach Poly
</P>
<P>
   ; Bernard Riley, dl, 6-2, 305, Los Alamitos
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Rogers, te, 6-6, 240, Oxnard; Markus Steele, lb, 6-2, 230,
LBCC
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   Nate Steinbacher, ol, 6-5, 325, Anaheim Esperanza; Malcolm
Woolridge, dl, 6-2, 300, Boca Raton (Fla.) Olympic Heights; Ty
Warren, dl, 6-5, 285, Bryan, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans took care of some defensive line needs and
Steinbacher is a good start on offensive linemen. The Trojans are
battling Michigan and Colorado for Westchester lineman Courtney
Morgan and UCLA for Mater Dei's Lenny Vandermade.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (9):
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, k, 6-2, 175, Boca Raton, Fla.; Turelle Bailey,
ol, 6-6, 260, Denver Jefferson; Lee Davis, ol, 6-5, 290, Serra;
Adis Davtyan, ol, 6-2, 305, Glendale (Ariz.) CC; Clayton Hawthorne,
de-wr, 6-3, 205, Menlo Atherton; Tyler Krambrink, qb, 6-1, 190,
Eatonville; Cody Pickett, qb, 6-4, 210, Caldwell, Idaho; Adam
Seery, db-qb, 6-2, 193, Albuquerque Eldorado; Kevin Ware, te, 6-3,
235, Klein, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   Ware is sensational and Pickett could be the quarterback of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State (13):
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Camarena, dl, 6-3, 260, San Francisco CC; Al Genatone,
lb-rb, 5-11, 210, Kennewick, Wash.; Collin Henderson, wr, 6-2, 185,
Puyallup, Wash.; Curtis Holden, lb, 6-3, 240, San Francisco CC;
Matt Kegel, qb, 6-5, 210, Havre, Mont.; Billy Knotts, ol, 6-6, 230,
Columbia River, Wash.; Kjell Nelson, qb-ath., 6-2, 193, La Canada
St. Francis; Josh Parrish, dl, 6-6, 245, Chewelah ,Wash.; Josh
Shavies, te, 6-6, 240, Oakland Fremont; Melvin Simmons, lb, 6-2,
205, Dominguez
</P>
<P>
   ;
</P>
<P>
   James Simon, ol, 6-6, 300, Fresno CC; Faafetai Tupai, dl-ol,
6-4, 298, Monterey; Milton Wynn, wr, 6-3, 200, L.A. Valley.
</P>
<P>
   What to think:
</P>
<P>
   The junior college players are a quick fix after a dismal
season, but the biggest pickups could be Kegel, Tupai and Shavies.

THE BEST AND WORST ADVERTISING OF '98  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The year that ends Thursday was a mediocre one for
Madison Avenue, as the few creative impulses that agencies managed
to muster appeared to have been diverted into making deals rather
than effective, enjoyable campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising that prevailed during 1998 was so dreary and
derivative that in comparison even the television season the
broadcast networks are inflicting on their remaining viewers seems
like another Golden Age. Worse yet for the established order, some
of the most celebrated new ads were produced not by outside
agencies but by talented teams employed in-house by marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers would be less fearful of what peddlers have in store
for them in 1999 if only advertisers like the Gap retail chain
would deal themselves into the agency business.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a look back at the rousers and howlers of the
year. To level the playing field, recent ads in outstanding
long-running campaigns _ for example, Absolut vodka, Altoids mints
and ESPN ``Sports Center'' _ were excluded. The following are the
acclaimed and the panned, starting with the high points in
alphabetical order:
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T
</P>
<P>
   A television commercial for AT&AMP;T Corp. can be called the most
touching spot of 1998 that was left over from 1997. The commercial,
centered on a soldier son who visited sites where his father fought
in Vietnam, was delayed because of concerns it would prove
contentious and exploitive. Viewers found the spot moving and
poignant. Agency: Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ADIDAS
</P>
<P>
   Five fanatical followers of the New York Yankees who painted the
letters ``Y-A-N-K-S'' on their ample torsos were the focus of a
hilarious campaign to promote the Adidas athletic apparel and
footwear sold by Adidas-Salomon. Best moments: when the men
mistakenly arranged themselves to spell ``A-N-S-K-Y'' and the
mysterious assistance they provided David Cone in a bathroom to
help him rest his pitching arm. Agency: Leagas Delaney.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA ANTI-SMOKING
</P>
<P>
   Advertising for the anti-smoking efforts sponsored by the
California Department of Health Services always has effectively
turned the iconography of the cigarette marketers against them, but
a TV commercial introduced in June proved particularly pointed and
prophetic. Months before ``60 Minutes'' drew attention to studies
linking impotence to smoking, the spot wickedly dramatized the
medical research by showing smoking men anxiously trying to impress
attractive women _ only to be deflated when their cigarettes
drooped like wet spaghetti. Agency: Asher &AMP; Partners.
</P>
<P>
   GAP
</P>
<P>
   Minimalism produced maximum results for Gap Inc. with campaigns
for khaki pants, Internet selling and holiday shopping that rarely
went unnoticed despite an understated, elegant style. One spot was
widely deemed the most appealing of the year: the exhilarating,
exuberant ``Khakis swing'' spot, directed by the photographer
Matthew Rolston, that combined an eye-popping contemporary
production technique, the moving freeze frame, with a rollicking
vintage Louis Prima tune, ``Jump, Jive an' Wail.'' The only ones
left wailing were competitors whose ads fell far short of Gap's _
and agencies worried that the retailer creates its own campaigns.
Agency: in-house.
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN DEW
</P>
<P>
   A clever, even intelligent television commercial for a soft
drink? Yes, it happened this year with a spot for the Mountain Dew
soda brand from the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc. The
commercial told the tale of a thirsty runner, the track star
Michael Johnson, who went for a Mountain Dew only to find the store
closed. The amusing premise was that he could run fast enough to
turn back time to when the store was still open, but his furious
efforts take him too far back _ to 1978, when a sign promised the
store was ``coming soon.'' Agency: BBDO New York, owned by the
Omnicom Group.indep
</P>
<P>
   NEW BEETLE
</P>
<P>
   The irreverent introductory work for the revamped version of the
VW Bug from Volkswagen of America was brilliant advertising that
deserved to be the most acclaimed campaign of the year. The TV,
print, outdoor and postcard ads helped make the New Beetle perhaps
the most popular highway revival since speed limits returned to 65
mph. The simple yet never simplistic campaign invoked the classic
soft-sell pitch for the original Beetle, created by the old Doyle
Dane Bernbach agency, yet still appealed to drivers born long after
Beetles _ and even Beatles _ disappeared from the cultural
landscape. Agency: Arnold Communications, part of Snyder
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   NIKE
</P>
<P>
   A delightful commercial directed by John Woo (``Face/Off'')
presented the members of the Brazilian World Cup soccer squad,
sponsored by Nike Inc., playing an impromptu match at an airport
when their flight is delayed. Fellow travelers were thrilled;
security guards were confounded; fans of the Brazilian tune ``Mas
Que Nada,'' heard in a version by the Tamba Trio, were pleased. Now
if only the team had not lost the tournament final to France.
Agency: Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   SATURN
</P>
<P>
   A deliciously quirky campaign, evocative of ``Twin Peaks,''
heralded the introduction of a three-door coupe from the Saturn
unit of General Motors Corp. In two spots, a boy stood strangely in
a field playing a tuba until a Saturn whisked him away. Another
commercial recounted an enigmatic story of a man who brought an
unusual friend _ a female mannequin _ along for a ride in a new
Saturn. Agency: Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney, owned by Publicis S.A.
</P>
<P>
   TACO BELL
</P>
<P>
   The shtick of talking animals is as commonplace in TV
commercials as shirtless beefcake is in Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch
catalogs, but the Taco Bell unit of Tricon Global Restaurants
offered a winning variation with a sassy, Spanish-speaking
Chihuahua that entertained while still peddling the product. A
campaign promoting a Taco Bell tie-in with ``Godzilla'' was far
better than the clunky movie. And Taco Bell has sold more talking
dog toys than Hasbro has sold Furbys. Agency: TBWA/Chiat/Day, part
of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   TIMES SQUARE SIGNS
</P>

   The elaborate electrical displays in Times Square, known as
spectaculars, grew more glowingly gaudy during 1998 as the
neighborhood was set ablaze nightly with lights, characters and
action. One new standout was a giant sign for Jell-O desserts, sold
by the Kraft Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. The billboard, built
by Artkraft Strauss Sign Corp., combined thousands of real spoons,
neon and electronic messages sent by consumers. Another was an
oversized billboard for Planters mixed nuts, sold by the Nabisco
Foods unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. The sign, built by
Spectacolor Communications, returned the dapper spokescharacter Mr.
Peanut to Times Square after 40 years. Agencies: Y&AMP;R Advertising,
Jell-O; the Ammirati Puris Lintas unit of the Interpublic Group of
Companies, Planters.

   AMERICAN AIRLINES
</P>
<P>
   An annoying television commercial celebrated a smug businessman
traveling in first class on American Airlines, part of AMR Corp.
When a fatuous American employee learned that his daughter had just
given birth, she treated him with an obsequious servility that
would make medieval serfs resemble Nat Turner. Agency: Temerlin
McClain, owned by True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTIS
</P>
<P>
   An overproduced TV spot promoting the Bahamas beach and casino
resort known as the Atlantis, owned by Sun International Hotels
Ltd., seemed to last forever. One version ran an interminable two
minutes. The cluttered, confused images, set to cloying New Age
music, had all the charm of a Las Vegas revue or an Atlantic City
motel. Agency: Ground Zero.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERIAN OUTPOST
</P>
<P>
   Deliberate tastelessness _ schlock meant to shock _ long has
been an attention-getting device in advertising. But the desperate
efforts by Internet and video game marketers to interest younger
consumers reached a nadir with a campaign for Cyberian Outpost, an
online retailer of computer products. Intentionally offensive
commercials, simulating violence against animals and children, even
ended by advising angry viewers where they could ``send
complaints.'' The smug certainty the device would succeed was
sobering in its cynical calculation. Agency: Cliff Freeman &AMP;
Partners, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   DIET COKE
</P>
<P>
   Dull, pointless commercials centered on dysfunctional families
made the thought of drinking Diet Coke, sold by Coca-Cola Co., as
appealing as downing a dose of ipecac. Coca-Cola is giving the
agency that created the campaign a second chance with a different
approach, which begins on Monday. Agency: Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST UNION
</P>
<P>
   In a year when overblown, overbusy work predominated, a campaign
for First Union Corp. was the most likely to be judged the product
of minds clouded by bad acid trips. The dark, ominous commercials
were dense with clashing images and overelaborate special effects:
a frightening carnival, angry animals, remote mountains. Good news:
Changes are promised for 1999. Agency: Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney.
</P>
<P>
   LEE JEANS
</P>
<P>
   Advertising about advertising was a popular trend in 1998, but
this campaign for the Lee jeans sold by the VF Corp. was too coyly
self-referential for its own good. Buddy Lee, a onetime brand
mascot that appeared in ads and window displays dressed in Lee
denim, was transformed into a postmodern icon mocking the marketing
convention of product as hero. Buddy, you're no Mr. Peanut. Agency:
Fallon McElligott.
</P>
<P>
   OLD NAVY
</P>
<P>
   Typically, ads for the Old Navy retail chain owned by Gap are
sweetly, campy fun, but a holiday campaign for its Performance
Fleece apparel was like a Christmas fruitcake come to life: dense,
cloying and full of nuts. The usual tongue-in-cheek tone was
replaced by a forced, over-the-top hilarity. Those who asked the
model Marcus Schenkenberg and the principal cast of ``The
Jeffersons'' to sing an Old Navy jingle ought to be exiled to South
Florida in August, clad entirely in layers of Performance Fleece.
Agency: in-house.
</P>
<P>
   PEPSI ONE
</P>
<P>
   The talents of Cuba Gooding Jr. were wasted in frenetic,
unpleasant commercials that introduced Pepsi One, a low-calorie
cola from Pepsi-Cola. Gooding, seemingly overcaffeinated, shouted
his way through the spots, which amounted to little more than tales
told by an actor, filled with sound and fury, signifying nothing.
Agency: BBDO New York.
</P>
<P>
   REEBOK
</P>
<P>
   The DMX line of athletic footwear sold by Reebok International
Ltd. was given a bombastic buildup in a widely seen campaign that
used special effects to liken Reebok's longtime competitor, Nike,
to a menacing dictator. Never mind that such an approach too
closely echoed the famous ``1984'' spot for Apple Computer. It was
also outdated: teen-agers buying boots and chunky shoes instead of
sneakers have rendered Nike a pitiful, helpless giant, far from the
omnipotent force for conformity portrayed by its rival. Agency:
Berlin Cameron &AMP; Partners.
</P>
<P>
   XEROX
</P>
<P>
   This was another example of an overly ambitious campaign, which
unfortunately turned out more muddled than a chameleon on a
Scotsman's kilt. Commercials for office equipment sold by Xerox
Corp. featured a toga-clad Greek chorus led by an omniscient god
played by John O'Hurley, the actor who can still be seen as J.
Peterman on ``Seinfeld'' reruns. Would that a god had descended
from Mount Olympus to whisper into the ears of Xerox executives the
Greek equivalent of ``Fuhgeddaboutit.'' Agency: Y.&AMP; R. Advertising.

 When Word Changes Your Name  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  About two months ago, Microsoft Word suddenly decided
that my name, which is Jeanne, should be spelled Jeannie. Every
time I type my name, it changes the spelling. This is making me
nuts! My daughter suggests the easiest way to fix the problem would
be to go down to the DMV and change the spelling of my first name!
Do you agree, or is there something I can do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Have you seen the lines at the DMV? You'd be there for
hours. Besides, you can fix the problem yourself pretty easily.
First, here's what probably happened. At some point, someone typed
Jeanne and Word thought it was misspelled, because it wasn't in the
program's dictionary. The spell checker offered Jeannie as an
alternative, and the typist mistakenly clicked on AutoCorrect. From
that point on, Word figured Jeanne ought to be Jeannie.
</P>
<P>
   AutoCorrect is actually a nifty feature. It lets you assign
words that you often misspell, along with the correct spellings.
Then it automatically fixes mistakes as you type.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, however, perhaps it should be called AutoScrewup.
In any case, here's what you do: Choose AutoCorrect from Word's
Tools menu. Scroll down the list until you come to your name. Then
delete the entry. That should do it.
</P>
<P>
   My Favorite Things
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me how to back up my Favorite Places and Address
Book in the new 4.0 version of America Online?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Sure. Both the Address Book and Favorite Places are
stored in a file that bears the same name as your screen name. The
file also contains your Personal Filing cabinet, which includes any
mail or messages you've downloaded. You'll find the file in the
folder labeled Organize inside the main AOL folder on your hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   To back up the file, simply save it to another place on your
hard drive, or to a floppy or Zip disk. You can also save your
Favorite Places by clicking the Favorites icon on the toolbar,
right-clicking the Favorite Places folder and choosing Save Folder
As ...
</P>
<P>
   The Right Stuff
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are a small nonprofit which is about to move into a larger
space and will need about half a dozen new computers that can
network with one another. Everything we have is old and
incompatible. We mostly use WordPerfect and Word and we don't need
fancy programs. But we do need e-mail and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of equipment do we need, and can you suggest a
reliable, well-priced hardware system?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: With so few PCs involved, you don't really need a
full-blown local area network in which a ``server'' computer
manages the others. You can get by with what is called a
``peer-to-peer`` network, in which all the computers are linked to
each other with cables. They can share files, documents and
messages, as well as peripherals like printers.
</P>
<P>
   Another, increasingly popular way to go is to create a wireless
network. Several companies, such as WebGear of San Jose, make
wireless networking equipment that can have your PCs talking to
each other in a jiffy, for less than $200 per PC.
</P>
<P>
   With a simple peer-to-peer network, you can hook up all the PCs
to a single phone line and give everyone Internet access. The
drawback is that only one person at a time can be on the Web. If
more than one person must be online at the same time, you should
opt for a more traditional type of network configuration.
</P>
<P>
   That means each PC will need a network interface card (NIC).
You'll also need a small device called a hub to connect the
computers. And you'll need a high-speed leased line to provide the
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   As for which computer system you should get, virtually any new
PC can be part of a network. And all major PC manufacturers have
lines of computers optimized for small businesses such as yours.
Check out the possibilities from Dell, Gateway, Micron, Compaq and
IBM in a copy of Windows magazine or PC World.
</P>
<P>
   The Fate of Files
</P>
<P>
   Q: On my computer when I delete anything it goes into the
Recycle Bin, which I eventually empty. When the bin is emptied,
where do the files go? Are they still stored in the computer, or is
it totally gone from the system?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: It's gone. Dead. Finished. Extinct, Kaput. So be careful.
The Recycle Bin is your last chance to change your mind and restore
a file after you've deleted it from the regular file system. When
you empty the bin, everything in it is erased from the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add an extra layer of protection, so that you can
recover erased files, you can install something like Norton
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are experts who can recover files even after they're
erased from the hard drive. That's because a ``ghost'' of the file
remains on the disk. The only way to completely erase it is to
overwrite the entire disk with random information many times.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  A San Leandro reader contributes this week's suggestion: For
easier Web surfing, use a ``metasearch'' engine, which
simultaneously uses a number of top search engines and returns the
best results from all of them. Three such searching powerhouses are
 &LR; www.metacrawler.com, &LR;   &LR; www.infind.com  &LR; and  &LR; www.isleuth.com. &LR;

 High-Tech Flops  &HT;       
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
All this new computer technology sure is wonderful. When it works.
</P>
<P>
   The more new technology promises to deliver, however, the more
it falls on its face. Hence our list of the year's biggest
high-tech flops.
</P>
<P>
   Television, we were told, would deliver sharper pictures than
ever. The Internet would get faster for average home users. One
Internet service provider promised lifetime hookups for one $60
fee. Other Web hucksters touted everything from virgin sex to live
births, Webcast to your home. Smart cards would eliminate cash.
Macy's Web site automatically would replenish women's depleted
supplies of stockings. Push technology would bring the television
model to new media, delivering information we want directly to our
desktops.
</P>
<P>
   None of these things materialized, at least not on the grand
scale that was promised. Sometimes, it was the technology that
failed. But sometimes, it was a more familiar story of human
frailty.
</P>
<P>
   People couldn't agree on standards for high-definition
television. Companies feuded over moving data at high speeds over
home phone lines. The Web's budding P.T. Barnums proved to be
working in the same tradition of another fin de siecle era's
snake-oil salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the failures, we maintain optimism. In the months
leading up to January 2000, technology will be better than ever.
Right?
</P>
<P>
   Our picks as the year's biggest flops:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The Spoils &LR; . &UR;  &LR; Microsoft sliced and diced archrival Netscape
like a holiday ham, leaving America Online with the leftovers. When
all was said and done, the company that brought the Internet to the
masses was swept aside by the growth of the Net _ and an Internet
pioneer had become the West Coast operations of an online pariah.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Pager Crash.  &LR; Paging customers got a rude awakening when
Galaxy IV, a PanAmSat Corp. satellite, spun out of orbit, leaving
millions of people with useless pieces of plastic attached to their
hips. The outage, which brought satellite-based communications such
as radio feeds and ATM transactions to a halt, was a rude reminder
of our reliance on technology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Still Waiting.  &LR; Digital subscriber lines (DSL) were portrayed
as Everyman's solution to the World Wide Wait, but companies spent
1998 squabbling over access to Pacific Bell's phone infrastructure
instead of ramping up service. When Pac Bell and others finally did
roll out DSL, prices were so high that most residential consumers
passed. Instead, homeowners opted for cable modems _ cheaper,
faster and available to more neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ No-See TV.  &LR; High-definition television, hailed as the
greatest innovation since color TV, made its debut in November. For
all the hype, however, few viewers noticed a difference. The
networks broadcast few programs in high definition, television
stations didn't get all the expensive transmission equipment in
place, other players in the computer and cable industries had
trouble agreeing on standards, and consumers were unwilling to
plunk down $8,000 or more for a device that would show only a
handful of programs. Was it a full-fledged flop? Not yet, but check
back in 2006, when the federal government expects all programming
to be converted to high definition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Tired Wired.  &LR; Formerly high-flying Wired Ventures hit tough
financial times. Its flagship magazine, which had been the
trail-blazing voice of the digital age, was sold to New York
publisher S.I. Newhouse, and its digital division was pawned off to
Internet search engine Lycos of Boston. Guess that rules out the
much-discussed initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Promises, Promises.  &LR; AtBigger.net confirmed the axiom that
bigger isn't necessarily better. The Internet service provider
promised lifetime online access for just $60, before bailing
because of money troubles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Virtual Unreality.  &LR; The virtual virgins never consummated
their relationship on the Web. That's because the producer of the
``Our First Time.com'' cyberevent _ the notorious Internet
Entertainment Group that gave the world the Pamela and Tommy Lee
sex video and Dr. Laura's naked pictures _ discovered that it was a
hoax and outed the finely sculpted twentysomething models, who were
posing as love-struck teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Mom Con.  &LR; The live birth on the Internet revealed not only
one of nature's miracles, but a fugitive from the law. The beaming
mom, Elizabeth Oliver, was arrested for passing bad checks. An
Orlando, Fla., judge eventually threw out the charges because the
legal time limit for prosecuting her had expired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Stripped Chip.  &LR; Giant chipmaker Intel's first stab at the
market for sub-$1,000 PCs turned out to be a clunker. Dubbed
``Celeron'' to emphasize its speed, the new chip was just a
stripped-down Pentium II. Lacking onboard memory, it performed
slower than comparable chips from Cyrix and AMD. Several months
after its April &UR;  &LR; debut, Intel added the much-needed memory to make
Celeron respectable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Not So Smart.  &LR; Smart cards, promoted as ``the future of
money,'' turned out not to be after four financial powerhouses
pulled the plug on their largest-ever test of electronic cash. The
chip-embedded cards were supposed to be easier than cash, but
consumers preferred ATM cards, credit cards or simply paying the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ No Pushing.  &LR; Push technology never quite came to shove in the
ravenous Internet world, prompting push poster children PointCast
and Marimba to scramble and come up with new identities. Their
status so far: identity crises.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Satellite Smash-Up.  &LR; Globalstar employees cheered on
September 9 when a Webcaster announced a ``gorgeous, gorgeous
launch'' of a dozen satellites on a single rocket from a cosmodrome
in Kazakstan. But around midnight, the company learned the sad
truth: The Russians were reading from a script and the rocket
actually had crashed in the Siberian tundra. It was only a
temporary setback for Globalstar, a San Jose company, but it
revealed the tenuous nature of getting satellite telephone service
off the ground.

   &UR; _ Footwear Software.  &LR; Macys.com thought it had hit on a great
idea when it set up a Web-based automatic hosiery-replenishment
service. The plan: instant refills on such items as stockings and
moisturizer that people buy (and run out of) on a regular basis.
But consumers, who still were new to e-tailing, weren't buying, and
Macy's discontinued the service this year. The retailer has plans
to relaunch it, betting that Macys.com _ with many new products _
will be more appealing and that consumers have become more
Web-savvy.

<P>
   &UR; _ Quirky Quark.  &LR; Quark's unsolicited bid to buy larger rival
Adobe Systems Inc. in August had the makings of a battle royal
between the two publishing software leaders but ended up as much
ado about nothing as Adobe rather easily rebuffed the unspecified
offer. Not only that, Adobe has rebounded from a weak third quarter
that brought layoffs and a major management restructuring. Adobe's
stock price has climbed from a yearly low of $23.63 on September 9
to the upper $40s, close to the 52-week high. Now Adobe is on track
to go after Quark's core high-end graphics market with a software
product some analysts are dubbing ``the Quark killer.''

MORE POLICE THAN EVER AS BALL DROPS IN TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With NY-MILLENNIUM) (sw) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square on
Thursday night will be patrolled by the largest police detail in
the city's history, as officials test crowd control efforts they
expect to use next year on an unprecedented crush of revelers.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department said on Wednesday that it would deploy
5,000 officers, a 25 percent increase over last year, to keep watch
over the half-million people expected to squeeze behind barricades
to watch the ball descend from One Times Square on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the department would use
``some resources we haven't used in the past, just to see how they
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that next year we are going to have the largest crowd
in history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir would not discuss the crowd control measures in detail,
but he said he believed that the bolstered police presence would be
both a useful preparation and necessary precaution, because the
Times Square crowd has grown in each of the last two years. This
year, the throng may balloon even larger, because party planners
have arranged to place three video screens _ two more than last
year _ in and around Times Square so more people can watch the
ball's descent.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for the revelers, the police said they planned to
shut much of midtown to traffic, beginning at 6 p.m. in Times
Square, and radiating out as the crowd builds. Judging from last
year's experience, Safir said he anticipates that by midnight, the
police might have to close the area from 34th Street to 60th Street
between Fifth and Eighth Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public transportation is the best advice,'' he said, ``and
don't bring alcohol, because it won't make it to Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said officers stationed on the streets and at
major bus and train stations would confiscate open containers of
alcohol, plastic coolers and hip flasks. No alcohol, even unopened
bottles or cans, will be allowed near Times Square, and those found
drinking will be issued a summons and have the alcohol confiscated,
said Lt. Sean Crowley, a department spokesman. The police also plan
to set up checkpoints around the five boroughs to try to catch
drunken drivers, Safir said.

 Y2K Minus One Poses Its Own Computer Perils  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Most people think of Jan. 1, 2000, as the magical moment when
computers may or may not stop working.
</P>
<P>
   But computer experts warn that 1999 is just as problematic. The
year is chock full of crucial dates when the so-called millennium
bug or one of its lesser known cousins could bite. And it all
starts tonight when the clock rolls over to Jan. 1, 1999, and
uncovers the ``99'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers in the 1970s and 1980s used the code ``99'' as a
shortcut for commands like ``end data,'' or ``end program,'' or
even worse, ``dump data.''
</P>
<P>
   They used the shortcut for the same reason computer programs
were written to recognize only the last two digits of a year _ to
save what used to be precious little memory space.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure what will happen when the 2000 arrives,
but some programs may assume it's the year 1900, which could cause
problems ranging from inaccurate age calculations to programs that
crash in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The same may be true when programs encounter the ``99'' in the
year 1999, and ``think it's the end of a file when it's not,'' said
Robert Martin of Mitre Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. The nonprofit
corporation advises federal agencies on Year 2000 remedies. Mitre
( &LR; www.mitre.org &LR; ) has cataloged critical dates to look for from now
until the year 2100.
</P>
<P>
   A computer that spots the ``99'' in the date on a sales report
or purchase order, for instance, could lock up the file so that no
other data can be entered. Or, in the worst case, data in a
document like an invoice may be erased.
</P>
<P>
   Some key dates to watch for: April 9, which is the 99th day of
the year; September 9, 1999, which in computer-ese is read as
``9/9/99'' or even ``9999;'' and September 23, or 99 days until the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   How widespread is the problem? The 99 command was fairly common
in older data processing programs, but the bulk of it has been
replaced by more modern programing, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   However, 99 codes still lurk in unknown places because new
programs often incorporate language used in older ones. ``We tend
to reuse things,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the world, but it is another aspect of
what you need to look for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies that have started Year 2000 remediation have also
been fixing 99 codes, said Larry McArthur, President and CEO of
Ascent Logic Corp. The San Jose company helps insurance companies
assess major corporations' risk of Y2K failures.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks and other companies that started fixing the Y2K
problem early will probably be the least affected by the 99
problem. ``But there's this great middle ground of companies
between $50 million and $500 million in sales that haven't done
anything,'' McArthur said.
</P>
<P>
   A variant of the 99 problem surfaced in a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration alert issued Tuesday that warned some medical
devices may not work properly tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA, one such device is a Hewlett-Packard
defibrillator, used to restore the heartbeat. The HP device will
defibrillate properly but will print ``set clock'' rather than
record the month, day, hour and minute when the instrument was
activated, the FDA said. The simple fix is to reset the clock to
1998, because the device does not print the year.
</P>
<P>
   The coming year is full of dates when the Year 2000 problems
begin to surface, especially when computers start to process budget
forecasts or other programs using dates in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For example, February 5 is the first date that airline
reservations may be affected because reservation systems typically
go only 330 days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And July 1 is the first day of fiscal year 2000 for California
and 45 other states. The same is true on October 1 for the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's August 21, when the internal clocks for Global
Positioning Satellites run out of room. The GPS satellites, which
can accurately locate any spot on the Earth, were designed by the
military but now also are used to make maps and tracking devices.
Some computer systems also use the GPS system to track time, ``and
some stock trading companies use GPS receivers as time sources to
date, stamp, buy and sell orders,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   When launched by the U.S. military Jan. 5, 1980, the satellites
had enough memory to track time in microseconds from that date for
exactly 1,024 weeks. That 1,024 weeks ends at midnight on August
21, and then the satellites are programmed to reset.
</P>
<P>
   Most ground receivers are programmed to roll over with the
satellites, so they should not have any problems, Martin said.
However, there are some ``cheap receivers'' that were not
programmed to make that switch, and they could ``run into a time
loop back to Jan. 5, 1980,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dangerous dates ahead, Martin said government
agencies and companies can get the Year 2000 problem under control
by the last crucial date, Dec. 31, 1999, if they keep working hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much too much overreaction and people are thinking the
worst and expecting the worst,'' he said. ``There is very little
likelihood of calamity. It's a hard problem, it's a complicated
problem, but it is one that can be dealt with.''

told her she was going to have so many babies. Quite the contrary.

   After 8 Days of Gains, Stock Market Declines
</P>
<P>
   The stock market ended lower for the first time in nine
sessions, Wednesday, weakened by investors who sold to secure some
profits from a 1998 rally that accelerated at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.34 points, to 9,274.64,
after having gained 530 points since Dec. 16. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index declined 9.88 points, to 1,231.93, and the Nasdaq
composite index dropped 14.82 points, to 2,166.95. In the bond
market, Treasuries rose for the third consecutive day as the yield
on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 5.08 percent.

<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission approved the proposed purchase of
Amoco by British Petroleum after extracting a handful of minor
antitrust concessions from the new company, which will become the
world's third-largest petroleum company. The companies will have to
sell 134 gas stations and 9 petroleum terminals. Shares of Amoco
plunged $3.25, to $54.75, as managers of index funds sold shares of
the company, which will be replaced in the S.&AMP; P. 500. The American
depository receipts of British Petroleum fell $6.75, to $83.1875.

   China Says Growth Target Met
</P>
<P>
   Despite the severity of Asia's economic problems, China said it
achieved growth of 7.8 percent for 1998, essentially meeting the 8
percent goal set by political leaders at the beginning of the year.
The growth rate was only 1 percentage point below the 1997 figure
of 8.8 percent and contrasted sharply with the recessionary data
reported by neighbors such as Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia.

PANEL CONCLUDES U.S. SECURITY HARMED BY TECHNOLOGY OBTAINED BY
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sales of U.S. military and satellite technology to China,
resulting from lax enforcement by federal agencies, have harmed
U.S. security and require immediate corrective action, a bipartisan
House committee unanimously concluded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The special committee's 700-page report remains classified, but
the panel has found an extensive, lengthy and sophisticated effort
by the Chinese government to acquire sensitive technology,
according to Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., the panel's senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say anything beyond this: We discovered areas of
significant transfers of technology that were adverse to U.S.
security interests,'' Dicks said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks has taken panel findings ``to the highest level at the
White House'' and said the Clinton administration ``has already
taken definite action'' on the most serious breach of security
uncovered by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the select committee, told
a Washington, D.C., news conference: ``These transfers are not
limited to missile satellite technology, but cover militarily
significant technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox added that China had conducted a ``serious and sustained''
effort to obtain sensitive U.S. technology that dates back through
four administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that there has been a pattern of effort by
the Chinese for the past 20 years that has led to their acquiring
technology,'' Dicks added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have used every means at their behest. They have done
everything they can. Because of our focus on the Soviet Union and
its allies, we were not as cognizant as we should have been about
technology exports to China.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-month probe by the panel, officially the House Select
Committee on U.S. National Security and Military-Commercial
Concerns with the People's Republic of China, has resulted in 38
recommendations. Dicks said he expects portions of the report will
be released within two months, after U.S. intelligence agencies get
to excise sensitive material.
</P>
<P>
   But witnesses and intelligence officials who worked with the
committee said the panel's conclusion that China had stolen
military-related American technology might prove to be the most
explosive part of the report. The panel uncovered, for example, a
pattern by the Chinese of stealing nuclear weapons design
technology from American military laboratories, said one person who
has read part of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was established last June in response to charges that
the Clinton administration relaxed laws and permitted transfer of
technology secrets to China in exchange for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The initial targets of the probe were two satellite
manufacturers, Loral Space &AMP; Communications Corp. and Hughes
Electronics Corp., which received licenses to use low-cost Chinese
rockets to place communications satellites into space. Senior
executives at Loral made major contributions to President Clinton's
1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A classified Pentagon report has concluded that Hughes
scientists did give the Chinese assistance after one of the Chinese
rockets crashed while carrying a commercial satellite built by the
American firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox told reporters in Washington, D.C., Wednesday: ``The
select committee has found that the transfer of sensitive U.S.
technology to the People's Republic of China goes beyond the Hughes
and Loral instances that were a significant part of the reason that
the committee was formed.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee spent relatively little time on campaign
contributions. It did not make any referrals to the Department of
Justice for criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   What it found, Dicks said, was laxity and inattention to rules
already in place. The 38 recommendations include action for both
Congress and the administration and involve security at U.S.
weapons laboratories, handling of sensitive intelligence data and
export-control policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of technology has gone to China that should not have,''
Dicks said. ``I would say, too, that the Russians in their economic
desperation are transferring technology of significant importance
to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in our case, and what the record will show, is
that if we had followed the rules, there would not have been any
improper technology transfer. The rules in place were not followed.
And that is what got these companies in trouble. Most of it was
laxity of enforcement of licensing requirements and government
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-Republican, four-Democrat committee conducted its
investigation at a time of partisan acrimony in the House,
culminating with the narrow vote earlier this month to impeach
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the investigation produced unanimous findings with no
dissent or minority report. The committee also did its work without
any advance leak of its findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kept their mouths shut and did their job,'' Dicks
said. ``In a difficult time, we showed that on a sensitive national
security issue, people of good will and fairness can still get
something done on Capitol Hill. We can still function. It's
important for people to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel also showed that opposites can work together. Its
chairman, Cox, is a conservative Republican from Newport Beach,
Calif., who worked in the counsel's office of the Reagan White
House. He is chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. By
contrast, Dicks is a a centrist Democrat and close friend of Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And an important old rivalry was put aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Cox went to the University of Southern California _ he's
a Trojan,'' said Dicks, a onetime University of Washington football
lineman. ``It took a lot just to get warmed up to this guy.''

LIFE INSURANCE: TAKING STING OUT OF DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the end of the year, when we look forward to
all the good things that life will have in store for us after
Father Time ushers in the new year. The last thing we want to think
about is death.
</P>
<P>
   But face it, death hides in Father Time's robes _ and eventually
pokes its ugly face out at you. Still, you can take some of the
sting out of death _ for the family you leave behind, at least _ by
taking out a life insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Double Indemnity'' and all those films noir featuring
greedy femmes fatales and villains who commit murder for that
insurance pot. A policy can actually be a good thing; at the very
least, you'll rest easy knowing that your family will be adequately
provided for after death comes knocking.
</P>
<P>
   You shouldn't jump into a policy, however, until you do a bit of
research to determine what is the best policy for you. Here are
some tips from the Washington, D.C.-based American Council of Life
Insurance to keep in mind on the road to buying a policy:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Before purchasing an insurance policy, check the
company's financial condition, which you can do by asking an
insurance agent, the California Department of Insurance or by
checking the company's rating in listings easily found in public
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be ready to provide details about your medical condition,
medical history and other aspects of your health. Also, some life
insurance policies require a medical exam.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're ever contacted by another agent or company asking
you to cancel your policy and sign on with them, don't cancel until
you've contacted your present insurer. Surrendering your policy
could prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whenever your situation changes (such as the birth of another
child or a child moving out of the house or the purchase of a new
home), review your policy to ensure that it's adequate for your
needs.
</P>

Insurance Consumer Helpline at (800) 942-4242. &QL;

REPORT SAYS CHINA HAS OBTAINED SENSITIVE U.S. MILITARY TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for smoothing throughout, correcting timing of start of
inquiry). (htv) 
 By JEFF GERTH and ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee, in a classified report unusual
for its bipartisanship, has found that over the last 20 years China
has obtained, sometimes through theft, some of the most sensitive
American military technology, including nuclear weapons design,
government officials and witnesses who appeared before the panel
said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's final report, unanimously approved by its five
Republican and four Democratic members on Wednesday, found that
during Republican and Democratic administrations alike, China
acquired a range of technical secrets far beyond the transfers of
information during the Clinton administration that prompted the
panel's inquiry in May.
</P>
<P>
   In a carefully worded statement after the report was approved,
the committee's chairman, Rep. Christopher Cox, R.-Calif., said
that China's acquisition of American technology had harmed national
security and that its ``acquisition efforts over the past two
decades'' had been a ``serious, sustained'' activity.
</P>
<P>
   The panel released no details from its 700-page report on
Wednesday because so much of its six-month inquiry dealt with
classified information. The committee promised to begin a process,
in consultation with the Clinton administration, to declassify as
many of the findings as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But witnesses and intelligence officials who worked with the
committee said it agreed with assessments by the Pentagon and the
State Department that information shared with Chinese scientists by
two American companies, Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Space
and Communications, had improved Beijing's ability to launch
satellites and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, witnesses said, the panel's conclusion that China
had stolen military-related American technology might prove to be
the most explosive part of the report. The panel uncovered, for
example, a pattern by the Chinese of stealing nuclear weapons
design technology from American military laboratories, said one
person who has read part of the report. It was unclear when or over
what period of time any of these nuclear-related thefts might have
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, officials said, faulted policies of the Reagan,
Bush and Clinton administrations but did not say whether the
problems were worse in one administration than in another. It made
38 recommendations for legislation or executive orders to address
those policy failures. The recommendations covered areas including
security at U.S. weapons laboratories, handling of sensitive
intelligence data and export controls.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee did not directly examine covert Chinese
contributions to the 1996 American elections, officials said it did
investigate the activities of a Chinese aerospace executive, Liu
Chaoying, who has been a conduit for payments by the Chinese
government to Democratic fund-raisers and who, with her father, Liu
Huaqing, the former senior general in the Chinese military, has
been involved in China's effort to acquire military-related
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The committee began its inquiry after The New York Times
disclosed that American satellite makers had helped Chinese
scientists rectify failures in their rocket programs, conveying
information that is applicable to long-range ballistic missiles.
Over the last six months, the panel held 33 closed hearings, taking
testimony from intelligence officials, industry executives and
nuclear-weapons experts.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's inquiry initially focused on the interaction
between China and the American satellite manufacturers whose
satellites are carried into orbit on Chinese rockets. It soon
branched out to examine the export of other advanced American
technologies to China, including advanced computers and machining
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The panel hired outside experts to examine the question of
whether scientists from Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of the
General Motors Corporation, and Loral had harmed national security
by giving the Chinese lessons in rocket technology after the
failure of two Chinese rockets in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies deny any wrongdoing, but earlier this month, the
administration completed reports of its own on the subject, raising
national security concerns about the assistance, especially the
help that Hughes provided the Chinese in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence arm of the State Department found that the 1995
``tutorial'' by Hughes had ``resulted in significant improvement''
to China's rocket program, lessons that are ``inherently applicable
to their missile programs as well.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday at the Capitol, committee members
said their analysis had gone far beyond the reviews of the failed
Chinese rocket launchings by Hughes and Loral.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was harm in some of the transfers of technology that
occurred, but it's also fair to say this is not the only problem we
uncovered,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the ranking
Democrat on the panel. ``These are serious problems that must be
addressed by the Administration and by the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   It is public knowledge that China has an aggressive military and
economic espionage program, and that it has long sought to acquire
American technology, both legally and illegally.
</P>
<P>
   But the House panel, formally called the Select Committee on
U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the
People's Republic of China, learned new details about the depth and
scope of these activities as it completed the most comprehensive
examination of the issue ever conducted by any part of the American
government.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses before the panel included officials from U.S.
nuclear weapons labs, according to one witness. Last year the
General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, issued a
report that raised questions about the adequacy of security at the
weapons labs, including a decision in 1994 to reduce background
checks of various foreign visitors. The visitors, most of whom are
Russian and Chinese, are not allowed access to classified areas.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly how much the American public will learn
about the committee's findings. The issue of what to disclose is
usually resolved by the release of general conclusions, and the
withholding of details that might reveal how the sensitive
information was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we look forward to reading the report and studying
its recommendations,'' said David C. Leavy, a White House
spokesman. ``In terms of declassification, we need to work with the
committee in an appropriate way to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the House of Representatives could find political
unity in a year of fractious discourse is probably due to the
serious national security concerns that underlie the work of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Cox and Dicks, the members of the panel are
Republicans Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, Porter J. Goss of Florida,
James V. Hansen of Utah and Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, and
Democrats John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Robert C. Scott of
Virginia and Lucille Roybal-Allard of California. Most of the
members have been active in national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our select committee was led to ever more serious problems of
technology transfers and their national-security implications,''
Cox said in an interview on Wednesday. ``Addressing that issue led
us to this extraordinary bipartisan result.''

SENATE CONSIDERS VOTE TO CIRCUMVENT FULL TRIAL FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS throughout to clarify and add details on possible Senate vote
on impeachment trial.)  (htv/js) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican and Democratic leaders weighing
President Clinton's impeachment are considering a plan to let
senators hear evidence from both sides and then cast a preliminary
vote on whether to move forward with a full trial, a Democrat close
to the negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, the resolution to proceed with a trial would
require 67 of 100 votes, the same number required to remove the
president from office. If the resolution to move to a trial failed,
the Senate would then vote to adjourn the proceedings, which would
require 51 votes, and would take up a proposal to censure Clinton,
the Democrat said. If the resolution passed, the Senate would hold
a full trial, which would most likely include witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since impeachment by the House appeared inevitable,
senators have been wrestling with how to satisfy a variety of
conflicting goals. At one extreme are senators who want a full
trial that would result in Clinton's removal from office. At the
other are members who believe he has been punished enough and that
a long trial would hurt both the country and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal under consideration would try to establish a
process that would be acceptable to both sides. It would give the
Senate an opportunity to sidestep a drawn-out, politically
unpalatable trial while allowing Republican senators some kind of
vote on Clinton's removal from office, but one falling short of
actual conviction on the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would also back a plan that would avert a trial and
would get to a censure resolution quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators have said they do not believe there are the 67
votes necessary to remove Clinton, and it is unclear whether the
Senate could muster the same number to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned
that the proposal for a brief proceeding was still being negotiated
by Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, and Sen.
Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader from South Dakota, who have been
discussing it on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   And, the Democrat emphasized, neither leader had vetted the plan
with his Senate colleagues, who are scattered across the country
for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders would present the plan to their colleagues when
they return for the swearing-in of the new Congress on Jan. 6, the
Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's office had no comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Wednesday, ``We're working on this in a way that
meets both of our mutual objectives, which in large measure could
be defined as doing it fairly and expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the proposal drew a sharp response from Republicans on
the House Judiciary Committee, who will act as prosecutors during
the Senate trial. On Tuesday, they met to discuss their strategy,
emerging from closed doors with plans to call witnesses, only to
learn that Lott was proposing nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   In a stern three-page letter to Lott, Rep. Henry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said he was ``especially concerned'' with the proposal
to ``foreclose any trial if the House position fails to get a
two-thirds vote on a preliminary motion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal,'' Hyde wrote, ``effectively grants one-third of
the Senate the power to decide whether there will be any airing of
the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge that the Senate always has the authority to
alter its procedures and precedents,'' Hyde added, ``but to do so
in this instance would unwisely short-circuit the process.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lott seemed to suggest moving toward a more
expedited proceeding without spelling out the details. He told
reporters he would like to see a speedy, but fair trial with no
witnesses that would begin on Jan. 11 and conclude two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The comments on Wednesday by the Democrat who is close to the
negotiations indicate that both Lott and Daschle are tentatively
pursuing a course that could circumvent a traditional trial, at
least initially.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan being discussed by Lott and Daschle, the House
and the White House would each present their cases, without calling
witnesses, a process that would take no more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the presentations, the Senate would take a ``summary
judgment'' vote on two issues: the quality of the evidence and
whether the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice rise
to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the Democrat
said.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Senate would set aside the House's vote on
impeachment and judge the evidence and the accusations on its own.
The Senate vote on this ``dispositive resolution,'' which could
split into separate resolutions on the evidence and on the
accusations, would require a two-thirds majority, the Democrat
said, the same margin needed to remove Clinton from office. The
number would serve as a barometer for any future vote on removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way people are on record saying, `Yes, I would vote to
move forward if these things are proven,'' the Democrat said. ``And
Democrats would say they are not proven and they don't meet these
high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, no resolutions of any sort have been written.
``There is no specific phraseology,'' the Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could set the two-thirds majority requirement simply
as part of its rules for handling the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle, the Democrat said, must still work out the
details of the plan, including whether there should be an
opportunity for debate during the presentation of evidence and
whether the House should have a chance to rebut the White House's
case. During a trial, senators would be free to ask questions of
the prosecutors through Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who would
preside over the proceedings, but they would not be permitted to
debate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As far as a censure resolution, senators still have profound
differences about what a censure resolution should say and what
sort of penalties, if any, it should include.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, Sen. Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican moderate,
said, before hearing talk of the plan, that he would oppose censure
``under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate should either convict or acquit the president and
nothing else,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Lott, Hyde argued that the House and the
president should have an opportunity to present their cases. ``We
believe that proper presentation of the evidence will likely
require the appearance of a limited number of witnesses,'' Hyde
said. ``We also believe that the president and his counsel may wish
to call witnesses as part of their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat questioned the House's insistence on calling
factual witnesses before the Senate, especially since the judiciary
panel opted not to call anyone other than independent counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde defended his committee's decision not to call witnesses
during the impeachment inquiry, saying that the House and the
Senate hold two distinct functions. The House moves to indict, he
argued. The Senate moves to convict.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that both sides would be permitted to present
witnesses, if the Senate moves ahead with a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican moderate, agreed,
saying she would prefer to hear from witnesses, especially because
they might help settle disputed facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be helpful for me as a juror to hear firsthand the
testimony so I can assess credibility,'' she said. ``It would be
easier in the long run.''

VIOLA FARBER, CHOREOGRAPHER, DIES AT 67 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viola Farber, a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance
Company, a choreographer and the director of the dance program at
Sarah Lawrence College, died on Dec. 24 at Lawrence Hospital in
Bronxville, N.Y. She was 67 and lived in Bronxville.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, Jeff Slayton, her former
husband and longtime dance partner, said.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, long-bodied individualist with cropped hair long before
that was fashionable, Ms. Farber was an unself-conscious study in
quiet unpredictability. She moved with a fierce passion and
intensity and a gentle lyricism. She could speak with the softness
of a shy, reflective child or, in the studio, with the toughness of
a drill sergeant. An edge of lazily subversive wit lay beneath her
plain-spokenness in conversation and in her dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In the quintessentially Farberesque ``Legacy,'' which she
choreographed in 1968 to a Chopin etude, Ms. Farber moved like a
dreaming, elegant giraffe, dressed in a flowing shift but wearing a
baseball catcher's mitt on one hand. Poetic and mysterious, the
solo was not at all Dadaist despite the incongruity and potential
humor of the mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her body often had the look of one part being in balance, and
the rest extremely off,'' Cunningham wrote of her in David
Vaughan's book ``Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,'' in a description
of Ms. Farber in his 1960 ``Crises,'' created in part for her odd
talents. ``Now and again it was like two persons, another just
ahead or behind the first. This was coupled with an acute rhythmic
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Ms. Farber came to the United
States with her family at the age of 7 and became a naturalized
citizen six years later. She met Cunningham and his collaborator
John Cage in 1952 at Black Mountain College, where she was studying
dance with Katherine Litz and music with Lou Harrison. Ms. Farber
joined the Cunningham company in 1953, dancing there through 1965.
She created roles in some of Cunningham's major early works, among
them ``Crises,'' ``Rune'' and ``Nocturne.''
</P>
<P>
   During her Cunningham years, she also performed with Litz,
playing a vampire in her ``Dracula,'' and with Peter Saul and Paul
Taylor. Her last performance was in a 1995 collaborative duet,
``Threestep (Shipwreck),'' which she created with the choreographer
Ralph Lemon, a former student, for his company's season at the
Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farber formed the Viola Farber Dance Company in 1968,
creating most of her choreography for the troupe, which disbanded
in 1985. Writing in the International Encyclopedia of Dance,
Christopher Caines describes her earliest dances as having a
febrile atmosphere and ``a dark, violent intensity that some
interpreted as sadomasochistic, despite moments of tenderness.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970's, Ms. Farber had mellowed considerably. ``My dances
report what I see,'' she told Jack Anderson in a 1978 interview in
The New York Times. ``They are my response to the way everything is
mixed up together in this world _ people and microbes and elephants
and cassowary birds.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 1973 ``Poor Eddie,'' Ms. Farber incorporated the gestures
of flight attendants as they demonstrate the use of safety
equipment in planes. Her own nervousness about driving in the
middle, passing lane on a three-lane highway inspired the creation
of another dance, ``Route 6.'' Like Cunningham, Ms. Farber favored
the juxtaposition of disparate kinds of activity in dance, where
formal patterns and the combinations of steps often mattered more
than the steps themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farber was especially popular in France, where she won a
gold medal, with Slayton, in the Ninth International Dance Festival
in Paris in 1971. From 1981 to 1983 she was the artistic director
of the Centre National de Danse Contemporaine in Angers,
establishing, at the same time, an institute for the training of
dance teachers in Paris. Ms. Farber returned to the United States
in 1988 to take the Sarah Lawrence post, but continued to teach and
choreograph in France into the 1990's. She also taught at the
London Contemporary Dance School from 1984 to 1987 and, from early
in her career, at universities and dance festivals throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French government recently named Ms. Farber an Officier de
l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two sisters, Elisabeth Lanzl of Chicago and
Irene Aikin of Parkdale, Ore.  &QL;

GRAND JURY FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF CONSPIRACY IN OKLAHOMA BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ A state grand jury created largely through the
efforts of a grieving grandfather and a suspicious legislator ended
18 months of investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing
Wednesday, saying it found no evidence of a broader conspiracy or a
government coverup.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 117 witnesses and weathering criticism that its
work gave legitimacy to wild conspiracy theories surrounding the
blast, the grand jury reported: ``We cannot affirmatively state
that absolutely no one else was involved in the bombing of the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. However, we have not been
presented with or uncovered information sufficient to indict any
additional conspirators.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury did return one sealed indictment. Prosecutors
would not say what was in it, but in an interim report in October,
the grand jury criticized, without going into specifics, ``improper
and perhaps illegal attempts to exert influence on the outcome of
our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was convened in June 1997, after a petition drive
organized by Charles Key, then a Republican state legislator from
Oklahoma City, and Glenn Wilburn, whose grandsons, Chase Smith, 3,
and Colton Smith, 2, were killed in the day care center at the
federal building.
</P>
<P>
   Wilburn, who died of cancer in July 1997, was not satisfied with
the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and had sought
out witnesses on his own and pressed for more investigation, even
as law enforcement officials and some relatives of other victims
said he should let the government do its work.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh and Nichols were convicted in separate federal trials in
Denver, McVeigh of conspiracy and murder, Nichols of conspiracy and
involuntary manslaughter. McVeigh was sentenced to death and
Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilburn, who suspected a broader conspiracy, did not believe
official denials that no one in federal law enforcement had any
warning of the April 19, 1995, attack that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   Key, who helped collect more than 10,000 signatures on the
petition to form the grand jury, criticized its conclusions. ``It
was a ditto of what the federal government presented in the McVeigh
trial,'' he said Wednesday. ``It had huge, gaping holes.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trials of McVeigh and Nichols, theories that the
bombing was the result of a wider conspiracy, involving domestic
hate groups or foreign terrorists, flooded the Internet, right-wing
talk shows and magazines, and short-wave radio. One theory held
that the government itself was involved and used McVeigh as a fall
guy.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury said it found no credible evidence that the
bombing, which was the worst act of terrorism on American soil and
shook the nation's sense of security within its borders, was linked
to foreign terrorists. It concluded that it was an act
``perpetrated by Americans on Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   It also reported: ``We can state with assurance that we do not
believe that the federal government had prior knowledge that this
horrible terrorist attack was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses called before the grand jury ranged from Dennis
Mahon, a Tulsa, Okla., leader of White Aryan Resistance, an
extremist group, to Arlene Blanchard, an Army sergeant at a
recruiting office in the building who survived the bombing. The
grand jurors also reviewed hundreds of exhibits and thousands of
pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand jury's effort to interview federal investigators
and examine the evidence they had gathered was delayed for many
months by the federal trials of McVeigh and Nichols and by their
appeals. The restrictions were lifted by the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Denver last fall, and federal agents appeared
before the grand jury in November.
</P>
<P>
   Key, meanwhile, set up and won nonprofit status for a private
group, the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee, which also
gathered information about possible witnesses and submitted their
names to the grand jury and urged Congress not to let the federal
investigation drop.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday his committee would present its own final
report, and ``it will read quite differently than this report
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the grand jury investigated the identity of
John Doe No. 2, the mystery suspect depicted in FBI sketches
shortly after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It reported that 26 witnesses offered such conflicting
descriptions that he could have been anywhere from 5-foot-3 to
6-foot-3, with a skinny build or perhaps a stocky physique.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury called on Bob Macy, the district attorney in
Oklahoma City, to carry through with his plans to bring state
murder charges against McVeigh and Nichols for the deaths of 160
people whose individual cases were not brought in the federal
trials.

PLAYERS PLAN TO PRESENT RESPONSE TO OWNERS' OFFER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to an ultimatum from Commissioner David
Stern that the owners will cancel the National Basketball
Association season unless the players accept the latest proposal,
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, informed his
membership Wednesday that the players would soon make their last
offer in an attempt to salvage the season.
</P>
<P>
   In a pugnacious response to the owners' revised proposal _ one
that Stern has said is final _ Hunter sent a four-page letter by
fax or express mail to his players last night. In it, he expressed
hope that the two sides could complete a new collective bargaining
agreement before Stern's Jan. 7 deadline, while also dissecting the
league's plan in an effort to explain why he found it unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have called David Stern and requested an opportunity to
present it to the owners' labor committee as soon as they are
available and certainly before the Jan. 7 date that Stern (finally)
has said is the owners' deadline,'' Hunter wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The league's chief legal counsel, Jeff Mishkin, would not say
whether a new union proposal would constitute the resumption of
negotiations, but he acknowledged that the two sides would probably
meet before canceling the season.
</P>
<P>
   In a point-by-point analysis, Hunter's letter said that the
league's deal did not contain ``enough help for the middle class
and minimum-salary players.'' He also said that the players could
not accept the league's total revenue distribution plan, which
calls for the players to receive no more than 54.5 percent of
basketball-related income.
</P>
<P>
   As the lockout turned six months old, no new negotiations were
scheduled and it appeared the two sides were indeed headed toward
either an 11th-hour settlement or the first cancellation of a
professional sports season due to labor strife in American sports
history.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, Hunter and internal bargaining teams from each side met
in Denver last Sunday and appeared to be inching toward a
settlement when the talks abruptly broke off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of talking this week, the two principal negotiators
waged their second postal battle in two weeks. On Dec. 17, Stern
sent a letter to the players expressing his concern that the season
would be lost and outlined the league's proposals. Hunter responded
with a lengthy letter.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Stern again corresponded with the players, sending
them the latest proposal and sounding even more grave as he
reiterated that it was the owners' final offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is of course your prerogative to reject our proposal
_ as you did in Denver _ the consequences of that decision will be
so catastrophic to your members that simple fairness suggests they
be given a chance to be heard,'' Stern wrote in his cover letter to
Hunter. ``Accordingly, we request and strongly urge that you put
the NBA's final offer to a vote of the entire union membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's letter, which was also sent to reporters, lists the
additional concessions the owners offered in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has steadfastly refused to have the full membership vote
on any of the proposals. In his letter to the players Wednesday, he
detailed areas where the sides remain in disagreement, including
changes to salary cap rules that the union calls a ``List of
Horribles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiating committee and I do not believe the owners have
met us halfway yet, and we are not prepared to recommend that you
accept this proposal,'' Hunter wrote. ``We believe this latest
offer still contains steps backward that justify our continuing the
struggle. Simply put, we have come too far to take a deal that is
not a fair compromise for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``It is now a matter of sitting down for a last
bargaining session where we each can reveal our respective bottom
lines and engage in whatever trading may be necessary to get a deal
done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the players' negotiating committee and the agents'
advisory committee held separate conference calls Wednesday, in
part to discuss the impact of Stern's most recent proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling among the majority of agents was that the
commissioner would not cancel the season without further
compromises on both sides during at least one final bargaining
session next week _ despite Stern's insistence that there will be
no more negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   With Stern and Hunter not expected back in New York until after
the New Year's holiday, the possibility of all-night negotiations
next week in Manhattan looked more and more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions ran high on the agents' conference call, with several
giving impassioned pleas about not accepting the deal on Stern's
terms.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, according to an agent who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, Leonard Armato, the agent for Shaquille O'Neal, tried
to offer his peers some insight into Stern's thinking. Last
Wednesday, Armato acted as a sort of liaison for the two
principals, letting Stern and Hunter use his Los Angeles offices
for a secret meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One agent replied, ``Leonard, you're being used.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, too, refused to defer to the league in his response. In
one of the more provocative responses to the league's plan for
increased drug testing, he wrote: ``The commissioner wants more and
more untapped control of the conduct of players. Stern has given
nothing in exchange for all these noneconomic concessions described
in his last two pages, ignoring, for example, our demand for
independent review of commissioner's on-court suspension of three
games or more. These disciplinary issues should be negotiated to
their proper resolution, not imposed upon you from on high.''
</P>
<P>
   But finally, he added, ``I have no doubt we could have a deal in
a matter of hours.''

THE CARDINAL TELLS A HASIDIC TALE 
NO TUX THIS YEAR 
ELKE VS. ZSA ZSA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Israel, Germany)   (mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one, as it turned out, made any ``Heard the one
about the priest and the rabbi?'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because there were so many priests and rabbis around,
nibbling on kosher hors d'oeuvres. On Tuesday night, Ambassador
Shmuel Sisso, consul general of Israel in New York, and dozens of
Jewish leaders invited Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New
York, and dozens of Roman Catholic officials to Sisso's Upper East
Side town house for a reception to commemorate the fifth
anniversary of an agreement that established formal diplomatic
relations between Israel and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Sisso, who had paperwhite flowers flown in from the Jordan
Valley as a gift to the cardinal, did not venture into theological
debate. But O'Connor, seeking to make a point about deceptive
appearances in international relations, tried his hand at the
Hasidic folk tale.
</P>
<P>
   The one he related went something like this: In olden days, a
woman who believed rabbis could perform miracles asked a rabbi to
help find her lost husband. The rabbi got up on a chair and said he
could see her husband about 120 kilometers away. She asked, ``If
you can really see that far, why did you have to get up on a
chair?'' Because, the rabbi said, ``I wanted to appear normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Guest for a Change
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bismark Irving has spent the last 10 New Year's Eves
in a tuxedo, working to make sure that thousands of other people
had a good time. On Thursday night he plans to have one for
himself. His black tie will be in a box. He will join about a dozen
people at an Upper East Side dinner. He will fret over none of the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't he sound happy about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I won't have all that magic upstairs around me, you
know?'' said Irving, 44, who since 1987 had served as the maitre
d'hotel at Rainbow and Stars, atop Rockefeller Center. The cabaret
is part of the Rainbow Room restaurant complex, which is under new
management and was closed Dec. 19. It will now be used mostly for
private parties, which means Irving is between jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny enough, today I was shopping at Saks and I thought as I
was looking around, `Hey, I don't have to wear a tuxedo this
year,''' Irving said Wednesday. ``It will be nice, but it will feel
strange. It will also be strange to think about that place up there
without all of us on a New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   When he started there, Irving _ no one at the Rainbow Room ever
called him that; he was known as Bismark _ was the kind of
starry-eyed New Yorker for whom the room seemed to have been
created. He grew up in Hutchinson, Kan., and before he moved to the
city, he and friends would drive here from Kansas just to catch a
Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   Since New Year's Eve 1988, he presided (in the manner of Rick at
Rick's Cafe Americain) at the lavish $450-a-person celebrations,
which recently featured a conga line threading its way through the
elegant tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always be there until about 3 in the morning _ made for a
very long day,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to being a guest, I
guess. I don't know how it will feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking of Pigs and Bad Blood
</P>
<P>
   Elke Sommer, the German actress renowned lately for her run-ins
with the Hungarian actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, has won the latest round
in a court battle with Ms. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederick Von
Anhalt.
</P>
<P>
   A Bavarian court rejected an appeal from the German prince, who
had been ordered by a lower court to stop telling people that Ms.
Sommer had once said, ``All German men are pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Ms. Sommer could not prove that she had not made the
statement, the court did not order the prince to make a full
retraction.
</P>
<P>
   There has been bad blood between the two actresses, Ms. Sommer
said, ever since she once remarked that Ms. Gabor had a big rear
end.

REPORT BESEECHES L.A. RESIDENTS TO SUPPORT TINSELTOWN BY GOING TO
MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How can Angelenos guarantee the financial health
of their city? By seeing two movies a month, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the advice of the New Los Angeles Marketing
Partnership, which is urging Los Angeles County residents to add a
two-movies-per-month pledge to their New Year's resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   If all 9.6 million Los Angeles County residents adopted the
resolution, they would buy a stunning 230 million more movie
tickets in a year that would be worth over $1.38 billion at the box
office, based on a $6 average price.
</P>
<P>
   That level of business would have added more than 15 percent to
the 1.45 billion admissions and $7 billion spent in North American
movie theaters this year.
</P>
<P>
   Why Angelenos? Well, L.A. is the entertainment capital of the
world, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Root for your home team, Los Angeles,'' said Regina Birdsell,
executive director of New LAMP, as the organization is known.
``It's time for residents of L.A. to be its top ambassadors and
show pride in their hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it turns out that New LAMP is making the suggestion
somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Officials with the civic booster
organization want Angelenos to see more movies, but they know two
additional movies a month might be too much for many.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New LAMP officials say if Angelenos boosted their movie
attendance by 2.8 additional visits per year, that would add an
additional $161 million into the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping is that we'd make people think about
attending the movies a little more often,'' said Jack Kyser, chief
economist with the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. and
author of New LAMP's movie-revenue forecasts. ``It would inject
additional money into the local entertainment industry and ensure
that sound stages and special-effects houses stay busy.''
</P>
<P>
   The go-to-the-movies proposal was part of a year-end package of
resolutions issued by the five-year-old public-private group with
the goal of keeping the local economy growing and uniting the
area's 88 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some are straightforward, such as supporting construction of a
subway line to help traffic congestion, backing tax reform and
supporting the plan to bring a professional football team back to
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   But others keep with the organization's light-hearted approach
at promoting Los Angeles. They include reminding ``culture snobs''
that Los Angeles has more museums per-capita than any other U.S.
metropolis; welcoming tourists, who spend an average of $500 per
visit; and stopping the complaining about local filming, since the
entertainment industry generated an estimated $27 billion in
economic activity locally last year.
</P>
<P>
   New LAMP, which was launched amid the depths of the region's
recession, will close at the end of March as required by the bylaws
that established it in 1994. The image-marketing work will be
handed off to the Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau and
the Chamber of Commerce; the Economic Development Corp. will take
over the business assistance program. &QL;

BURKE IS TWICE THE LINEMAN UCLA HAS FACED TO DATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wisconsin defensive end Tom Burke will be a
76-inch measuring stick for UCLA offensive tackles Kris Farris and
Brian Polak in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   An All-American and the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year,
Burke is the best lineman the Bruins have faced this season _ a
6-foot-4, 250-pounder who is relentless and fundamentally sound.
</P>
<P>
   Farris will use Burke to test his readiness for the NFL Draft _
``If I struggle against him, how dare I move on,'' Farris said _
while Polak, a sophomore, will measure his progress in his first
year as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burke never, never gives up,'' Polak said. ``He's got a real
high motor, and we've got to match it. I have to get in my mind
that the play's not over. (Offensive line coach Mark) Weber is
trying to instill in me that I have to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke will line up on the left side and the right. He is strong
and fast, equally adept at stopping the run and pressuring the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the best defensive end Farris and Polak have faced is
Oregon State's Inoke Breckterfield.
</P>
<P>
   Burke is two Breckterfields.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best in the country,'' Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   Close ties: UCLA tight end Bryan Fletcher's older brother,
Terrell, played for Wisconsin in the 1994 Rose Bowl against UCLA,
but that's not the only tie between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Taylor, UCLA's director of football operations, is close
friends with Wisconsin defensive coordinator Kevin Cosgrove and the
former college roommate of Badgers offensive coordinator Brad
Childress.
</P>
<P>
   All three were graduate assistant coaches on Mike White's staff
at Illinois in 1980. They spent the Fourth of July on Cosgrove's
boat in Madison, Wis., and at a barbecue with Wisconsin coach Barry
Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saying, `Hey, wouldn't it be funny if we met in the
Rose Bowl,''' Taylor said. ``Then we decided we didn't want that,
because we wanted to be able to root for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they'll be the closest of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: Long Beach Poly linebacker Dennis Link has
given UCLA an oral commitment, upping its commitment total to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Like Temecula safety Ryan Wikert, Link does not have a large
national reputation but is well-regarded within Western recruiting
circles. Washington, Colorado and Arizona State were among the
schools interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Receiver Brian Poli-Dixon did not practice
Wednesday because of a sore hamstring, but he's expected to play.
Defensive end Pete Holland (sprained elbow ligaments) will attempt
to play, and linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo (knee ligaments) is
expected to start.

INQUIRY AND CONDOLENCES IN AUSTRALIA AFTER YACHT RACE DEATHS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SUZANNE McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the government of New South Wales ordered a coroner's inquiry
into the death of the six yachtsmen competing in the Sydney-Hobart
yacht race, the commodores of the hosting yacht clubs on Thursday
visited the families of five sailors who died during the
storm-ravaged event.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo van Kretschmar, of the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia,
and David Boyes, of the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania, went to
Launceston in Tasmania to visit the families of the crewmates and
neighbors of Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs, who died on board the
Business Post Naiad late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Guy and Skeggs were taken from the dismasted boat,
which was towed into the fishing port of Eden, in Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were rescued, their surviving crewmates had strapped
Guy's body inside the boat's hull, where he had died of a heart
attack. The body of Skeggs, 34, was still tangled in the rigging on
the boat's deck. He drowned when he could not escape from his
safety harness when it was swamped by an enormous wave.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Guy's and Skeggs' survivors, the commodores flew
to Sydney to see the relatives of three sailors who had been aboard
the Winston Churchill, the oldest yacht in the race. Jim Lawler,
Michael Bannister and John Dean were swept off a life raft they had
entered when the 57-year-old yacht began taking on water. The
bodies of Lawler and Bannister were recovered, while Dean was
missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the New South Wales inquiry, the Cruising Yacht
Club of Australia will also investigate the disaster, addressing
yacht and life raft design and weather forecasting. But the club
has drawn criticism because its investigation will be private.
</P>
<P>
   The race organizers have the support of the Australian prime
minister, John Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a yachtsman,'' Howard said. ``I have to respect the
views of people who understand the sea. It seems pretty sensible to
me that the only principle that you can work by is that each
skipper is in command of his own ship and he alone has to decide
what that boat is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maritime Authority abandoned its search Tuesday for Dean and
the other missing sailor, Glyn Charles, a British Olympian who was
washed off the deck of the Sword of Orion Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Planes will fly over Hobart's Constitution Dock, the finish line
of the race, to honor both the dead and the 30 search and rescue
aircraft that spent four days scouring the churning waters of the
Bass Strait, between Australia's southeast coast and Tasmania, for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the winning boats crossed the finish line on Tuesday, the
race continued. Wednesday night, 28 boats from the original
115-yacht fleet had finished and 17 were still racing. There was
little wind in the Derwent River heading to the finish line; the
flags around the dock drooped somberly at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   A brief presentation was made to AFR Midnight Rambler, the race
winner on handicap and one of the smallest yachts in the fleet.

THREE NBA PLAYERS DENIED CLEARANCE TO PLAY IN EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BKN-NBA-LABOR)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge Wednesday denied an attempt to force
the National Basketball Association to provide clearance for three
players to join teams in Europe, instead sending them to an
arbitrator to negotiate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The players _ Nick Van Exel of the Denver Nuggets, Marcus Camby
of the New York Knicks and Reggie Slater of the Toronto Raptors _
claim they are being prohibited from playing in Europe because the
NBA, along with USA Basketball, will not give them unconditional
releases to play overseas.
</P>
<P>
   While the NBA says players are free to play during the lockout,
they will have to return to play for the NBA if the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   That means they fall short of the ``unconditional'' clearance
required to play in Europe under an agreement between the FIBA, a
governing body for European basketball, and the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sim Lake boiled the matter down to one issue: whether the
individual Uniform Player Contracts remain in force despite the
183-day lockout by owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sole, precise legal issue,'' Lake said, ``the continued
validity of the players' contracts with the teams _ is a matter
required to be arbitrated by the plaintiff's Uniform Player
Contract, the CBA and the March 14, 1997, agreement between the NBA
and the FIBA.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding the case, Lake found no irreparable damage to the
three players, who claimed they were being damaged as a result of
wages lost because they were not allowed to play in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   According to sports agents who testified during the hearing, a
team in Athens is willing to pay Van Exel as much as $2.5 million
to play the last four months of the European Cup season, and other
teams are waiting in the wings to make offers to Camby and Slater.
</P>
<P>
   James Bryant, a lawyer and representative for the three players,
contacted the players association in an attempt to locate the
arbitrator who handled grievances under the collective bargaining
agreement that was terminated on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone can decide whether these contracts are ongoing _
yes or no _ we have a victory,'' Bryant said.

BULKED-UP MODELS TO DEBUT AT L.A. AUTO SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking a cue from home-run king Mark McGwire, a
number of automakers bulked up for the new season, which officially
gets under way Saturday with the opening of the 1999 Greater Los
Angeles Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   Held at the sprawling Los Angeles Convention Center, the
nine-day show will feature more than 1,000 cars and trucks awash in
a rainbow of gleaming paint and sparkling chrome.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a huge display of after-market products that can
add additional doses of glitz, glamour and horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Los Angeles is the industry's first show of the
year but plays a subordinate role to next week's North American
Auto Show in Detroit, which gets more international media action.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the Los Angeles show is generating more buzz
because manufacturers are using the venue to debut a dozen new
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense because this is the style center for the auto
industry,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp. ``People look to us for what's next in
autos. You show it here and if our eyes light up maybe you have
something.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lot of purchasing power our here as state
residents bought more new cars and trucks _ 1.6 million _ in 1997
than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Ford Motor Co. resorted to baseball's
heaviest hitter to snag some attention this week. The company's
Lincoln-Mercury division brought McGwire, who crushed a record 70
home runs this past season for the St. Louis Cardinals, to town for
a brief Kodak moment Tuesday to pose with the Lincoln Blackwood, a
concept truck that looks like the offspring of a sport-utility
vehicle and a hulking pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln is not sure when or if it will produce the upscale
truck, which can carry more than its weight in golf clubs or Louis
Vitton luggage. But McGwire _ a former University of Southern
California baseball player _ emerged from the Blackwood on Tuesday
and proclaimed it a ``home run.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's biceps aren't the only thing bulging at the Convention
Center. Automakers are betting that giving some of their models a
more powerful profile will help boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new Honda S2000 prototype sports car that is
making its world debut at the show resembles a Mazda Miata on
steroids. Scheduled for release in the fall as a ``Year 2000''
model, it features a high-revving, 240-horsepower dual overhead cam
engine that roars to life with a push on a racer-style starter
button.
</P>
<P>
   ``The S2000 is a reflection of Honda's heritage, much of which
was learned on racetracks around the world,'' said Dan Bonawitz,
vice president of corporate planning for American Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Mazda unveiled its new entry into the popular
midsize truck market, the industry's first import four-door cab
model. It's available as part of the B-series line, which also
features three models with graphics by designer Troy Lee, noted for
his stylish racing helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stavana, Mazda's group manager for product marketing plans,
calls it a truck with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can go anywhere and take a beating from the terrain. It's
designed for the hard-core weekend warrior who likes extreme
sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles to be displayed cover almost the entire range of
the income spectrum, too.
</P>
<P>
   Living on a tight budget? Then you might want to check out the
1999 Geo Metro three-door coupe powered by a three-cylinder engine
for about $9,800.
</P>
<P>
   And if money is no object, there are lots of options.
</P>
<P>
   There's the 1999 Bentley Azure, a $339,000 convertible. And
there's the new 1999 Porsche Carrera coupe, which carries a
$75,000-plus price tag and has room for you, a passenger and maybe
the Taco Bell Chihuahua in what passes for a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff like luggage and golf clubs will have to find other
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who buys a Porsche for its trunk space? &QL;

STATE CONSIDERS `LETHAL FENCE' FOR WALLA WALLA PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY GEORGE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ The Washington state prison at Walla Walla may
soon stop escapees dead in their tracks _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke's budget proposal to the Legislature includes
$1.45 million for a ``lethal fence'' that could carry enough
voltage to kill anyone trying to climb it.
</P>
<P>
   The fence would be used at the Walla Walla prison's 96-cell
Intensive Management Unit _ also known as ``the hole'' _ which
houses death-row inmates and the most dangerous offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say the intent isn't to kill escapees _ it's to
save as much as $500,000 a year because guards would not be needed
in observation towers around the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main focus is on the deterrent. We are using the strongest
deterrent possible,'' said Locke spokesman David Chai. ``The
governor is not making the decision to kill them (escapees). It's
their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But one advocate of prisoners' rights called the lethal fence a
death penalty for escapees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me extreme to kill somebody,'' said Nancy Horgan,
deputy director of The Defender Association in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal fences have been used in California prisons for five
years, and are either in use or are being installed in Alabama,
Colorado and Wisconsin, said Allen Randall, a California engineer
who designs the fences.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been killed by a lethal fence, but only because no
one has tried to climb one, said California and Washington prison
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The fences carry 5,000 volts of electricity _ compared to 120
volts in a typical household electrical socket.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people die touching 480-volt'' wires used in
industrial settings, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Birds and other animals have been killed by the fences, which
adds to the deterrent effect, Randall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while you'll get a stray cat that will jump
the fence and die. The inmates see that,'' he said. ``It's not
something that the inmates want to reckon with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington prison system first studied lethal fences in
1996, when it was exploring ways to cut staff costs. But this is
the first time a lethal fence has been included in a capital budget
proposal, said Bill Phillips, Corrections Department capital
program administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Walla Walla's Intensive Management Unit has two observation
towers now staffed round-the-clock by armed guards at an annual
cost of $500,000, said Bob Johnson, corrections capital projects
manager.
</P>
<P>
   California has saved $39.5 million a year by installing lethal
fences and eliminating guard towers at 23 prisons, said California
prison spokeswoman Terry Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   But cost isn't the only consideration. California and Washington
prison officials say they want to protect the public from dangerous
escapees.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, convicted murderer John Lamb escaped from Walla
Walla's Intensive Management Unit, although it's supposed to be the
state's most secure lockup.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb used a broken hacksaw to remove a ceiling light in his cell
and crawled out through a corridor for water and sewer pipes. Then
he forced open a door to the corridor and, once outside, scaled two
fences topped with razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   He was recaptured without harming anyone after he stole clothing
from a home.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's escape, one of only two in the unit's 15-year history,
prompted prison officials to reevaluate security and spurred the
request for a lethal fence, said Lori Scamahorn, spokeswoman at the
Walla Walla prison.
</P>
<P>
   The high-voltage fence, with a generator back-up in case of a
power outage, would be installed between the two razor-wire-topped
fences that now surround the unit. That double fencing and other
safeguards would prevent an accidental lethal jolt, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates sent to the unit have been sentenced to death or have
proven extremely dangerous both inside and outside of prison walls.
Death-row inmates can be moved to another unit after a year of good
behavior, Scamahorn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``IMU is like a jail within a prison,'' she said. Inmates can
leave their cells for only one hour each day to shower, make calls
and exercise indoors. They are never allowed outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor's budget proposal specified a lethal fence,
it's possible to set the fence at a level that would stun rather
than kill, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   California chose not to buy the stun-option fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our fences are strictly lethal,'' Thornton said. ``We
felt that more people would try to escape if they knew, `I'll only
get stunned.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has not decided whether to pursue a stun-option
fence, said Phillips, the prison capital program administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when a stun option might be used at Walla Walla, Scamahorn
said, ``I don't know that it wouldn't be on `lethal' all the time,
as a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were set to stun, ``I don't know that we would make it
public. We might not want the inmates to know'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Ida Ballasiotes, R-Mercer Island and co-chair of the
House Criminal Justice and Corrections Committee, said Wednesday
she was unaware of the proposal and wants to know more.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't expect much philosophical debate in the
Legislature. Noting that prisoners in Walla Walla's Intensive
Management Unit are the most violent in the state, she said,
``They're not supposed to escape.''

RESTAURANT, UNHAPPY CUSTOMER SETTLE TIFF OVER TIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Fischbein, a self-styled high-powered
Manhattan lawyer, and Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, a self-styled fashionable
Manhattan restaurant, announced Wednesday the settlement of
Fischbein's multimillion dollar lawsuit that arose out of the
restaurant's attempt to make him pay a $353.79 tip.
</P>
<P>
   Fischbein had said the restaurant's service for a Nov. 17 staff
dinner _ totaling $2,481.44 _ was abysmal. He refused to pay the
restaurant's mandatory 18 percent service charge for large parties,
though he tipped one attentive waitress $100. The restaurant
detained Fischbein and called police. On Dec. 2, Fischbein sued,
alleging slander and false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The case seemed to strike a sympathetic chord among people
skeptical of the notion that tips are a birthright of restaurant
workers, no matter the quality of the service. Fischbein said he
had received dozens of letters of support from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the restaurant and the lawyer each agreed
to pay $10,000 to the Children's Aid Society, one of Fischbein's
favorite charities. The restaurant, a steakhouse and cigar bar at
233 Park Ave. South, also issued an apology, of sorts, saying it
was sorry ``for any misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wolf, an owner of the restaurant, declined to comment,
citing the terms of the agreement. Fischbein, 56, a veteran
litigator, said he, too, could not talk about the lawsuit, except
to say the nationwide response had been ``mind boggling.''

HOW HAVE PACKERS OWNED 49ERS? COUNT THE WAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci was asked Wednesday to
explain why his 49ers have lost five successive games to the Green
Bay Packers, including three straight in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many sacks,'' Mariucci quickly responded.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, he added: ``And the turnover ratio has been
lopsided in their favor. The number of big plays for them _ the
quick-strike factor _ has been a definite issue. Injuries have
played a role.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that drives you nuts while you're
going through it, and then you find a way out,'' he said. ``It's
not a whole lot different than the Packers' situation with Dallas a
few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 49ers and Packers meet again in the divisional
playoffs Sunday at San Francisco's 3Com Park, everyone has an
opinion about what makes the regal, high-flying 49ers such flops _
home or away _ against the rough-and-ready Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes down to a lot of luck,'' Green Bay safety
LeRoy Butler said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a factor Packers Coach Mike Holmgren had considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning streaks are tough to explain sometimes,'' Holmgren
said. ``I think we kind of snuck up on them a little bit in 1995,
and that got it started.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay's coming of age as one of the National Football
League's elite teams can be traced to its 27-17 upset in San
Francisco in the 1995 National Football Conference divisional
playoffs. The Packers fell a game short of the Super Bowl that year
but have gone to the two Super Bowls since then.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Packers twice defeated the 49ers in 1996 _
23-20 in overtime during the regular season at Lambeau Field and
35-14 in the divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Green Bay went to 3Com Park and came home with a
23-10 victory in the conference championship game. Last month, nine
sacks of 49ers quarterback Steve Young led to a 36-22 Packers rout.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be, then, that it is just one of those things, and the
Packers have the 49ers' number?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think there's anything psychological,'' 49ers
running back Garrison Hearst said. ``We play a physical game.''
</P>
<P>
   So might the 49ers be finally due to win one?
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think that,'' Butler answered. ``But I kind of
remember hearing the same thing the last time we played them.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Mariucci said it is driving him nuts. It is also
clouding his future, or has at least led to speculation about his
contract status.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports in Bay Area newspapers that Mariucci's
job could be in jeopardy if he loses his third consecutive game to
the Packers. Mariucci's predecessor, George Seifert, had the best
winning percentage in the history of the NFL, but he was 0-3
against Green Bay. He was eventually run out of town.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the intrigue, one rumored successor to Mariucci is
Holmgren, who was an assistant in San Francisco for five seasons
and might be looking for a job as coach and general manager
somewhere else next season. In this bizarre scenario, Mariucci, a
former Packers assistant under Holmgren, could replace his former
boss in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Holmgren was miffed at suggestions that Mariucci was
coaching for his future this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Holmgren said. ``I'm proud of the job he's
done in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci, for his part, politely declined to be specific about
his situation or any potential new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put it on the back burner,'' he said. ``The intentions
of all parties involved is to get it done right after the season is
over. We are focusing on the playoffs, not on speculation. I
addressed the team and told them the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an important football game to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, the game.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens this time of year, coaches and players
Wednesday seemed to focus on stopping their opponent's running
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch 49ers film and you see Hearst running with the
football in the other team's secondary, you're watching a team
losing to the 49ers,'' Butler said. ``He'll kill you if you don't
tackle him before he gets much past the line.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Packers defeated the 49ers in last year's conference
championship game, they held San Francisco to just 33 yards rushing
on 18 carries. Hearst was coming back from a broken clavicle and
rushed for only 12 yards on 8 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers also sacked Young four times in the fourth quarter
of that game, holding him to 1 yard rushing. Containing Young in
the pocket is another goal of the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rattle Steve Young,'' Butler said. ``But you can hit
him and make you sure you tackle him when you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the 49ers know that the principal reason Green Bay
struggled at times this season was that injuries made the Packers'
running game virtually purposeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, we could not run at all,'' Holmgren said. ``Now
at least we can run it a little. Nobody is going to be at midseason
form, but we're getting a little more healthy there. Hopefully it's
not too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Packers running back Dorsey Levens returned late in the season
to gain 378 yards on 115 carries. But he rushed for only one
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A productive running game would lessen the load on Green Bay
quarterback Brett Favre, who in an attempt to make up for the
Packers' rushing deficiencies has thrown 23 interceptions this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mariucci awaits the renewal of a longtime
rivalry, one that dates to 1950. It has been a streaky series, with
the 49ers twice winning six or more games in a row and the Packers
winning five successive games three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we kick if off, it will be 0-0,'' Mariucci said. ``It's a
new football game.''

NEW CONFIDENCE GAVE TCU HOPE IT'S BOWL WORTHY

   They'll tell you that they always thought this was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' being a berth in today's Sun Bowl game, playing with a
national television audience looking on, playing nationally
recognized USC, et al.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, on the list of goals TCU players and coaches
set before the season. They hung a sign in the locker room to serve
as a daily reminder. It's right above winning the Western Athletic
Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to a bowl game ... '' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence that maybe, deep down, they didn't really
think it was going to happen this season, comes by glancing at
Horned Frogs players' pre-Sun Bowl New Year's Eve plans.
</P>
<P>
   Goals look good in locker rooms, but airline tickets are
non-refundable.
</P>
<P>
   Frog defensive lineman J.W. Wilson had long ago bought a ticket
to go skiing in Steamboat Springs during bowl season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we were retired,'' Wilson said, ``and now we're
coming out of retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Frogs coach Dennis Franchione: ``If you had told me before

   TCU has become the are-you-kidding-me team playing in today's
are-you-kidding-me Sun Bowl looking for an are-you-kidding-me upset
of USC in front of a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' wildest dreams surpassed just by getting to a bowl,
is it any wonder that nobody is giving them a chance of winning?
Their preconceived notions of what they'd be able to accomplish
already blown away, is it any wonder that they can't fathom not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after we won our second game we could've said: `OK,
we're happy.' We didn't then and we aren't now.'' Frogs wideout
Michael Crawford said. ``This is our chance to prove we're not the
team everyone thought we were coming into this season''
</P>
<P>
   What they were is sobering. The numbers bear repeating.
</P>
<P>
   TCU finished 1-10 last season, the lone victory coming in the
final game of the season. Many players remember trudging through
that season, of walking away from game after game as losers.
</P>
<P>
   They bring it up because it best explains what they've become.
</P>
<P>
   To go from being so low then to being so high now, on some days,
seems to be too improbable of a leap.
</P>
<P>
   On others, it doesn't seem that far at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people are talking about this team going from a 1-10
team to going to a bowl game. Well, that's not exactly true,''
Horned Frogs safety Reggie Hunt said. ``We're not the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're also not stupid.
</P>
<P>
   They can tell you why they are here. It's part luck and part
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The luck had to come first. TCU's bowl hopes hinged on Ohio
State getting into a Bowl Championship Series bowl, an event that
needed two undefeateds _ UCLA and Kansas State _ to be defeated in
a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Both lost, and TCU became a bowl hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Coach Fran: `You guys put yourselves in a position for
luck to be a factor,''' Horned Frogs athletic director Eric Hyman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The politics came next. Three teams in the WAC have better
records than the Frogs. Two of them, Wyoming and Colorado State,
defeated TCU this season. None of them are going to bowl games, the
best chance for each of them, the Sun Bowl, passed on them in favor
of TCU.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't considered because they were among the eight teams
that announced plans to abandon the WAC last spring. The game is
being held on the campus of UT-El Paso, one of the WAC schools left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, of course, there were some other factors,'' Horned Frogs
wideout Royce Huffman said. ``Don't think we don't know that and
that a lot of people don't think we belong in a bowl. But we're
going. We're going with the intention of proving that we do
belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's also part chutzpah that brought TCU to this game, a
brashness that grew as the season progressed.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain this emergence of this boldness, player
after player offered a two-word synopsis: ``Coach Fran.''
</P>
<P>
   He brought an ingredient lacking in last season's team _ hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between what you think can be done and
what you can do if you don't think about it,'' Franchione said.
``What these players did was redefine what was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason that the Sun Bowl chose them.
</P>
<P>
   There is something warm and fuzzy about a this team, like the
way you felt when the slipper fit Cinderella at the end of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   The story is so unbelievable that even the players themselves
have trouble believing it even if they say they knew it was
possible all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things that aren't possible are the things you think
you can't do,'' Hunt said. ``Now, I'm not going to sit here and
tell you that we were sitting around at the beginning of the season
talking about what bowl we were going to go to, but nobody said it
couldn't be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing they will tell you is to go and look at the list
of season-long goals.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it says go to a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   The official wording, though, is somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says: `Go to a bowl game and win,''' Huffman said. ``And
that's what we're going to do.''

THE SHOW GOES ON WITH THE UNDERSTUDY 
</HEADLINE>
 (dw) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sign that no theatergoer wishes to see was up the
day of the performance: The star of the show _ in this case Martin
Short in ``Little Me'' _ was out sick. At 4 p.m. on the Monday
before Christmas there already were a dozen ticket-holders at the
box office, demanding their money back, indifferent to the talent
of the fellow who was taking over the starring role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, boy, I sure wouldn't want to be that guy,'' an actor,
Michael McGrath, said as he walked by. This was an extreme inside
joke. He was that guy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``Little Me,'' a farce originally written for Sid
Caesar in the early '60s, demands that the star sing, dance and do
36 costume changes for seven parts, including a French crooner, a
show biz agent, and a prince from a country so small ``it had been
defeated in war by Luxembourg.''
</P>
<P>
   Would McGrath _ who, in addition to being Short's understudy,
has five roles in the show _ share his feelings about taking on the
starring role on 24-hour notice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Shock,'' McGrath, 41, says after posing outside the Roundabout
Theater on Broadway, where as usual, nobody recognizes him.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Marty was having trouble vocally,'' says McGrath
(pronounced McGraw), ``but I'd understudied for him before, in `The
Goodbye Girl,' and I had never gone on. The man's got cords of
steel; he never missed a show. They told me I was going on after
the Sunday matinee. I went home, ran lines with my wife until
10:30, then I went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. The most
fearful thing is I'm going on for Martin Short. I'm not naive, I
know people won't be coming to see me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when I stepped out on the stage, I got entrance applause
and I thought, `OK The people who are here want to be here.' After
a while it felt like I could do no wrong, that the people were on
my side. They were seeing live theater, something that doesn't
happen all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a theater story we never tire of: the understudy who,
with little notice, takes over for the star and brings down the
house.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, who lives in Weehawken, N.J., with his wife, Toni
DiBuono, an actress, and their daughter, Kathleen, 3, went on for
the star, who was ill with a cold, three times last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of McGrath as an overnight sensation would not be
correct. Outside his theater, there was no sensation.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath has made a living as an actor for 20 years. He's starred
in the Groucho Marx role in a revival of ``The Cocoanuts'' two
years ago, and has been featured in a number of other shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm called a quirky leading man,'' McGrath says, ``quirky''
being the show business euphemism for a person who does not have
classic good looks and is known to cut up. (He has also been called
``puckish,'' which is show biz for short.)
</P>
<P>
   Except for ``The Cocoanuts,'' McGrath has not had a starring
role to call his own in a major New York show. When he did, he did
not keep it long, moving on to a supporting role in another
musical, ``Once Upon a Mattress,'' where he stayed for only three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a big mistake,'' McGrath says, ``but I learned my
lesson: Never do something for money. We had a new child; I was
making less than $1,000 a week on `The Cocoanuts.' Going to the new
show, I was making nearly three times that. It just didn't work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   What did McGrath earn going on for the star in ``Little Me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' McGrath says, without rancor.
</P>
<P>
   This is the thing that McGrath believes made him an actor: the
pleasure of showing off, from the time he was a boy. He grew up in
Worcester, Mass., the youngest of five children. His father was a
car salesman who always sang around the house; his mother was a
baker. McGraw put in three months at the Boston Conservatory of
Music before quitting and got his first job, in summer stock,
within the year.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting thing happened when McGrath went on for Short.
Fueled by the terror or excitement of a leading man who had never
had a full rehearsal, the cast was energized. McGrath seized his
seven roles with manic glee. When lines were blown, the cast
improvised, sometimes breaking into unscripted, laughter
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, McGrath found a bottle of Dom Perignon, from
Martin Short, in his dressing room. Then McGrath and his wife went
to Cafe Un Deux Trois for what was to have been their fifth
anniversary dinner, and it became a double celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Me'' is to close at the end of January. In March,
McGrath is scheduled to do another off-Broadway show, ``Exactly
Like You,'' a Cy Coleman musical.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll always have that Monday curtain call, in which the
audience _ including this reporter, who had planned on seeing
Martin Short _ gave McGrath the special ovation for people who leap
into impossible situations full throttle and soar. They rose to
their feet, screaming, ``Bravo! Bravo!''

BUCKEYES HOPE SUGAR BOWL ROUT WILL LEAD TO AP NO. 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Their most-celebrated player, linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer, has observed a self-imposed boycott of media requests
during Sugar Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the Ohio State Buckeyes have a keen interest in
members of the fourth estate. In particular, they seek to court
favor with the 70 voters who cast ballots in The Associated Press
college football poll.
</P>
<P>
   Those voters, say the Buckeyes, need to pay close attention to
what unfolds tomorrow night in the Superdome when No. 3 Ohio State
(10-1) meets No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M (11-2). In their perfect world, the
Buckeyes would rout the Aggies and No. 2 Florida State (11-1) would
follow on Jan. 4 with a narrow victory over top-ranked Tennessee
(12-0) in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, all 70 first-place votes that currently belong to
Tennessee would be left to the whims of AP voters. And each of the
three highest-ranked teams would have one loss.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, the Buckeyes admit they probably would not pick
up enough votes to win a national championship. But they cling to
hopes for a miracle. And those hopes are dependent upon a sound
thrashing of A&AMP;M, a 12 1/2-point underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about the AP poll all the time,'' said Damon Moore, a
strong safety who leads the team in tackles (76). ``If we show the
world that we really are the best team and everyone ends up with
one loss, who do you vote for? Maybe we could catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow out Texas A&AMP;M, that may not win us the national
championship. But it will turn some heads. And our only hope is to
turn some heads. We can't do that with a close win. We've got to
really stick it to them. That's what we'll try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes' focus is on the AP rankings because voters in the
coaches poll agreed before the season that they would crown the
winner of the Fiesta Bowl as the national champion. AP voters are
not obligated to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, said offensive guard Rob Murphy, the
Buckeyes, who spent nine weeks atop both polls before a 28-24 loss
to Michigan State on Nov. 7, hope to split the final AP poll to the
point that many college football observers would hail Ohio State as
the best team in the country regardless of the final balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, that's what we'd like to happen,'' Murphy said. ``If
we are clicking, we are the most dominating team in the country. We
want to show people that. We want to dominate this game and let
people know that, regardless of the polls, we had the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M players have been taken aback by the Buckeyes' brash
discussions of a possible blowout. The Aggies, after all, defeated
teams ranked No. 1 (Kansas State) and No. 2 (Nebraska) in the
respective polls at various points this season to win the Big 12
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, to a certain extent, they're overlooking us,'' A&AMP;M
tight end Dan Campbell said. ``They seem caught up in having an
outside shot at the national championship. They'd better have their
eyes set on Texas A&AMP;M or they're in for a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes view the situation a little differently. With a
defense ranked first in the nation against the run, A&AMP;M's offensive
strength, and a balanced offense that averages 37 points per game,
Ohio State players are not shy about saying they like this matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in this country still believe we're the best
team, and I'm one of them,'' running back Jonathan Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Added wide receiver Dee Miller: ``We've got the pride factor on
our side. We want to try and win convincingly against Texas A&AMP;M,
and I think we can. If the voters see that and think we're the best
team in the country, we agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, said Ohio State defensive coordinator Fred Pagac,
the Buckeyes are placing extra pressure on themselves with their
pregame posturing. But he does not consider the team overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to a New Year's Day game, you know you'll be
playing a good football team,'' Pagac said. ``If you're
overconfident, you're not too smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some teammates, cornerback Antoine Winfield does not
harbor hopes for a major Buckeyes' uprising in the AP poll. He'd
simply like a few votes and some postseason respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wins the Florida State-Tennessee game should be the
national champion. They deserve it,'' said Winfield, winner of the
Jim Thorpe Award given to the nation's top defensive back. ``But we
can be the people's champion. I feel like we're still the best
team.''

PLUMMER'S WILD CARDS HAVE LITTLE TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The last time the Cardinals won a playoff game,
Harry Truman was president.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Jake Plummer will lead a handful of overdue
veterans and a nameless supporting cast into Irving, Texas, for a
playoff game against the Dallas Cowboys, who, quite simply, own
them _ twice this season, 16 of the last 17 times overall and every
game at Texas Stadium in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what it's like to lose there,'' said Lomas Brown, a
seven-time Pro Bowl offensive tackle. ``We don't know what it's
like to win there.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the post-season, the Cardinals don't know what
it's like to win anywhere. The Chicago Cardinals won the National
Football League title game against the Philadelphia Eagles in 1947.
But the franchise has played four post-season games since then and
lost them all. Since relocating from St. Louis in 1988, the
Cardinals have suffered 10 consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Chris Jacke kicked a 52-yard field goal as time
expired to defeat the San Diego Chargers, 16-13, last Sunday and
vault the Cardinals into the playoffs for the first time since
1982, the sellout crowd at Sun Devil Stadium couldn't get it right,
failing to tear down the goal post.
</P>
<P>
   Long-suffering fans don't have big-game experience. What about
the players who haven't beaten a team with a winning record this
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to experience the pressure yourself, there's no
osmosis in the NFL,'' said Coach Vince Tobin, whose club finished
9-7, its first winning record since 1984, after a disastrous 4-12
mark in 1997. ``We've played pressure games. I don't think it's
that big a leap to the pressure of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke, who was out of football when he got a call in November,
kicked three consecutive game-winning field goals on the last play.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's practice, the Cardinals' veterans were making
the task of beating the Cowboys (10-6) sound daunting, even if
Deion Sanders doesn't play because of a toe injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always envisioned what this was going to be like,'' said
five-time Pro Bowl defensive back Aeneas Williams, who has spent
his eight-year career in Arizona. ``I badly wanted to be here when
we did it. Now that we've made it, I don't know if I'm confident
about winning, but I sense an air from this team that we believe we
have the ability to win. There's more substance to believe that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   A string of miraculous finishes does wonders for the psyche. The
Cardinals, who lost six games last season in the final minute, have
reversed the script this year with the elusive Plummer getting much
of the credit for seven victories of 3 points or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in situations too many times where we've had to
come back,'' said Plummer, who without shoulder pads has a
place-kicker's build.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'd like for that to change,'' added Plummer, who
was already a local hero at Arizona State, where he led the Sun
Devils to victory in the 1997 Rose Bowl. ``I'd like to be ahead
instead of behind. But this year nobody expected us to get this
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Plummer was rewarded with a four-year, $29.7 million
contract extension that puts him just behind Steve Young as the
second highest-paid football player. He ranked only 10th in the
National Football Conference _ 17 touchdowns, 20 interceptions _
but the Cardinals aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's improvisational skills seem best suited for the
frantic, no-huddle, two-minute-drill situations dictated by final
drives with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his competitiveness, the way he directs the team, his
athleticism,'' said Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who is 11-2 in
the post-season. ``You look at that team's season, the way they
pull out close games, and it's apparent that football team won't
quit. Teams with lesser character would quit and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   This team was constructed by the vice president of player
personnel Bob Ferguson. In addition to drafting Plummer last year,
he traded down one slot last March so San Diego could take Ryan
Leaf and Arizona could get a king's ransom from San Diego: two
first-round picks, a second-rounder, the wide receiver Eric Metcalf
(whose kickoff return set up Sunday's victory) and linebacker
Patrick Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved to people we are not the dumbest kid on the block;
we just didn't fall off the turnip truck,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Murrell, the former Jet, was acquired in the off season,
and led the team in rushing with 1,042 yards and eight touchdowns.
Another former Jet, wideout Rob Moore, caught 67 passes for 559
yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see some similarities with this team and when Green Bay just
started to get good,'' said Jacke, who went to the Super Bowl with
the Packers and joined the Cardinals after Joe Nedney blew out his
knee.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday they will try to do something they haven't done in
51 years: win a playoff game. They're a confident bunch. They know
they'll be facing Troy Aikman and not Craig Whelihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if this game goes down to the last few minutes,
because that's when Jake comes to the fore and takes charge,''
Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Plummer has done the last three weeks.

EDITORIAL: THE IMMIGRANT LOCKUP  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 31:
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people who are not accused of any crime or who have
completed prison terms for minor crimes spent this Christmas _ and
may spend the next _ in jails around the nation. They are
immigrants detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which has filled its own detention centers and has now resorted to
using local and county lockups.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of immigrants who are seeking political asylum share
cells with people accused of violent crimes, and are often subject
to abuse because they are foreigners. Keeping them in jails is
cruel, unnecessary and a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions have more than doubled since 1995 because
Congress now provides money for the INS to rent beds in local
jails. In addition, punitive new immigration laws kicked in this
year that expand the categories of immigrants the INS must detain
as they await possible deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16,000 people in detention on any given day are
immigrants, legal as well as illegal, who have committed crimes,
including very minor ones such as marijuana possession or
turnstile-jumping, even if their convictions were long ago. They
are held by the INS after they have finished their prison terms.
Another group comprises illegal immigrants rounded up in raids on
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The third group is asylum-seekers. The new immigration laws
provide that everyone who comes to America seeking asylum is
detained before a first interview. Those who pass it are then often
detained for months or even years as they wait for their asylum
hearings. Many of them are victims of torture or other traumatic
events whose problems are exacerbated by jail.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has not been able to assure decent conditions even in
the centers under its control. In 1995 inmates at an INS detention
center in Elizabeth, N.J., rioted over beatings and the use of
shackles. The INS later criticized the private company that
administered the center, Esmor, for ``inhumane'' conditions.
Conditions in local jails are often far worse, and the INS cannot
supervise them. Human Rights Watch has collected numerous
allegations of beatings and other mistreatment. The INS has called
for a government investigation of alleged torture of immigrants by
electric shock in a Florida jail. Immigrants often have no access
to lawyers or even someone who speaks their language. Worst off are
the 1,800 people scheduled for deportations to countries that will
not take them back, such as Cuba. They are jailed indefinitely,
some for years.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for INS detention is that the vast majority of
people at risk of deportation skip their court dates and simply
vanish, given the chance. The INS is beginning to study how to get
people to keep their court appointments without locking them up.
One pilot project run by the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit
group, keeps immigrants who seem unlikely to flee out of jail if
they check in regularly and receive home visits from supervisors.
Preliminary results show that compliance has soared _ at one-sixth
of the $20,000 per year that detention costs.
</P>
<P>
   The INS should expand its search for alternatives to detention,
including the use of bail. The 5,000 children detained each year
should be put in group homes or foster care, not juvenile jails.
Some people will require detention, but it should be in centers for
immigrants. Congress should allow the INS to build its own
facilities, which must be strictly supervised.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the INS and Congress must abandon their punitive
mentality. It is hard not to suspect that they are trying to deter
immigration by making the process as harrowing as possible.

EDITORIAL: CALLING A TRUCE ON DIVORCE WARFARE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec.31:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wins in long, drawn-out divorce cases, not spouses and
especially not the children who are caught in the middle,'' says
New York State's Chief Judge, Judith Kaye. With that thought in
mind, the judge has announced a series of practical changes
intended to make the process of breaking up less adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 60,000 divorces granted by New York courts
each year, about 75 percent are uncontested. But the remaining ones
that are contested can get messy.
</P>
<P>
   The new program builds on reforms Kaye introduced in 1993. Those
reforms _ including the assignment of judges to concentrate on
divorces _ have seen the average time it takes to process divorce
cases in New York City drop from 854 days to 433, even as the
annual number of divorce filings has increased by 12 percent. Now
Kaye is focusing on the bitterest divorce cases and aiming for a
more well-rounded approach.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a practice already used successfully by most other
states, the courts have begun offering classes to sensitize
divorcing parents about the effect breakups can have on children.
The idea is to provide a reality check that encourages early
settlement of custody and visitation issues by warring parents.
</P>
<P>
   These classes, which are now offered on Long Island, in
Westchester County and in two upstate cities, are to begin this
month in New York City on a voluntary basis, with an eye to
eventually making them mandatory statewide.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, the court is expanding a promising pilot
program that uses volunteer lawyers to provide the parties with a
neutral evaluation of their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   This exercise, in which the risks and weaknesses of each side's
case are exposed, injects a missing measure of legal reality that
can help facilitate settlements. In another innovation, the court
is hiring social workers with backgrounds in divorce and family law
to help families settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Other sensible changes advocated by Kaye require the approval of
the State Legislature. These include allowing a judge to freeze
marital property to prevent parties from shifting or hiding assets,
and mandatory disclosure of tax returns, bank statements and other
key documents to expedite the discovery process and settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Good ideas frequently die in Albany's partisan atmosphere. But
the chance to make divorces quicker and less traumatic for children
should have appeal across party lines.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ David Boston is getting even tougher to catch up
with.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fast, strong and elusive, Ohio State's star wide receiver has
dodged every member of the Sugar Bowl media horde that is longing
to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Boston has been slippery all season _ on the field,
that is _ and expects to be so again Friday night when he and the
third-ranked Buckeyes face No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the media wanted to ask a single question, though it was
sure to be cleverly disguised in different forms and run by him
dozens of times.
</P>
<P>
   But because Boston arrived in town hampered by an ankle injury
suffered when he slipped on ice while home for Christmas, there are
now two questions everyone wants to ask the junior from Humble:
</P>
<P>
   Are you going to leave school early to enter the NFL draft?
</P>
<P>
   Will you be at full speed for the Sugar Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Boston's answers? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   All week, Boston's teammates have tried to answer those
questions for him, but the 6-3, 215-pound All-American has refused
to speak for himself, leading many to believe his injury might be
more serious than first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Boston did run straight ahead at Tuesday's practice but was not
allowed to make any cuts or quick starts and stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors gave him a shot, (and) the swelling has gone down
somewhat,'' Ohio State coach John Cooper said. ``There is no
question David will play in the ballgame. How effective he will be
remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is also Ohio State's punt returner and has averaged 14.9
yards per runback this year. But with the injured ankle, he is not
likely to be assigned that task Friday, handing it over to freshman
Nate Clements.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the NFL and the ankle injury. The bigger mystery is
why Boston isn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   Highly publicized Buckeyes linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer has been
about as vocal as Charlie Chaplin this entire season after being
ridiculed for a group of soft courses he took over the summer to
retain his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston typically is not the type to go silent _ just ask any
of Ohio State's opponents _ and he has been that way since he
exploded onto the scene as a two-way star at Humble High School.
</P>
<P>
   An all-state pick for a Class 5A Division II semifinalist in
1995, Boston hit the ground running at Ohio State, and not even his
mouth has slowed him down.
</P>
<P>
   He went 58 yards for a touchdown against Rice the first time he
touched ball as a freshman, followed that with three scores the
next week against Pittsburgh (one coming on a 66-yard punt return
with just eight Buckeyes on the field) and closed that season with
a pair of touchdowns against Arizona State in the Rose Bowl,
including the game-winner with less than 20 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Boston had no qualms about talking,
proclaiming himself the best wide receiver in the country. He then
did all he could to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Boston led Ohio State with 74 receptions, breaking his school
record in the process. His 1,330 yards and 13 touchdowns put him
second on the school's all-time single-season list, and his seven
100-yard receiving games tied Terry Glenn's school mark.
</P>
<P>
   For his career, Boston tops the school's charts for receptions
(180), touchdown receptions (34) and 100-yard receiving games (12).
</P>
<P>
   All told, Boston has set or tied nine Ohio State records and
could up that total to 11 in the Sugar Bowl. He needs just 43 yards
in receptions to break Gary Williams' career record and 82 yards to
break Glenn's single-season mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around the NFL and see great Buckeye receivers
setting records,'' said Ohio State offensive coordinator Mike
Jacobs, who can point to such stalwarts as Glenn, Joey Galloway and
Cris Carter. ``David is very similar to Cris Carter. He has the
physical stature and strength. He has the great speed to get to the
deep ball, but he also has the strength. David certainly has a
bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Miller, who combines with Boston to give Ohio State one of
the top receiving duos in the country, said the twosome's on-the-
field trash talk is overblown. Still, it does not overshadow their
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never start it,'' Miller said. ``Guys will start the game
saying stuff to us, and when we respond, all we see is, `There they
go again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But the most important thing is we wanted to show we were one
of the best tandems of receivers in the country, and I think we
have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the numbers they have put up, Boston and Miller have had
plenty to talk about. Miller, a senior, had 58 receptions for 887
yards during the regular season for the Buckeyes' sixth-rated
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M's defense, which finished 10th in the country in yards
allowed, will have its hands full.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know those two guys are very good and make a lot of big
plays,'' safety Rich Coady said. ``We will have to be prepared to
make a play on every down. If you get caught looking, they will
break one on you.''

R.E. SCHREIBER, PHYSICIST WHO WORKED ON ATOM AND HYDROGEN BOMBS,
DIES AT 88 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raemer E. Schreiber, an experimental physicist who helped
develop the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb, died on Dec. 24 at his
home in Los Alamos, N.M. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, who was born in Oregon, received his doctorate from
Purdue University in 1941, not long after the discovery of nuclear
fission made it evident to scientists that some radioactive
substances might be employed to construct the most powerful bomb in
history.
</P>
<P>
   He worked during World War II on the Manhattan Project, the
secret program to design and make the world's first atomic bombs.
In 1943, Schreiber, his wife and his 16-month-old baby went to Los
Alamos, where a center for nuclear research had been set up to
create the atom bomb. Secrecy was so heavy there that his driver's
license listed a number, not a name.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1975, Schreiber emphasized that he and other
American atom-bomb scientists had had few misgivings during World
War II about the destruction that their research would lead to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a survival war,'' he said. ``If there was anything to
be done, we wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1945, he was part of a group of Los Alamos
scientists that has been called one of the greatest collections of
scientific brainpower ever assembled in one place.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1945, he and his co-workers completed the final assembly
of the world's first atomic bomb, ``The Gadget.'' It was set off on
July 16, 1945, atop a tower roughly 120 miles south of Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   That explosion, at 5:29 a.m., raised the curtain on the nuclear
era. It also created an enormous flash of light that made the
desert brighter than at noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could almost see through your eyelids, it was so bright,''
Schreiber recalled to an interviewer in 1980 during a 35th
anniversary reunion at Los Alamos of 600 people who had helped
construct the bomb. They met on the beautiful mesa where they had
built it.
</P>
<P>
   Later he became part of the scientific team that was sent to
Tinian in the western Pacific to put together the two nuclear bombs
that were dropped on Japan. That island, which American forces had
conquered in 1944, became the takeoff site for the aircraft that
dropped the bomb called Little Boy on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945,
and the bomb called Fat Man on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really was the key person involved for the assembly of the
Nagasaki bomb,'' Jim Danneskiold, a Los Alamos National Laboratory
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Schreiber said that his work on Tinian had helped
save the lives of American troops by making an invasion of Japan
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, he decided to continue working at Los Alamos
because, he said in the 1975 interview, of the ``heady atmosphere''
there, and because he could not see himself tied to the routine of
college teaching.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb'' by
Richard Rhodes, (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1995) Schreiber is quoted with
his recollections of the period after the atomic bombs were
dropped: ``That was the time one realized that it would be
impossible to simply say, those are fine gadgets, they ended the
war and now let's just lock everything up and forget about it.
Really one had to live with this situation from here on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the war's aftermath, he was named a group leader in the
weapons division of what is now Los Alamos National Laboratory. In
1946, he was observing some sensitive assembly work by a colleague,
Louis Slotin, when they and others were accidentally exposed to
radiation. Slotin died, but Schreiber and several others survived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Schreiber was named the leader of the laboratory's
weapons division, which went on to do important work on the
development of the first hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, a timetable was set for those who were, as Rhodes put
it in his book, ``to design and deliver a first experimental
H-bomb'' for a test in November 1952. He wrote, ``it was clear from
the beginning that the test device would be large.''
</P>
<P>
   The device became known as Mike, and the forthcoming test, on
Eniwetok, an uninhabited atoll in the central Pacific, was
sometimes called ``the Mike shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The more exotic materials that Mike was to be made of, Rhodes
wrote, included ``waxy polyethylene, purple-black uranium, gold
leaf, a breath of tritium, silvery deuterium,'' but ``Mike was
never put together in its entirety in the United States.'' Its
steel casing and its other components were sent to Eniwetok by
ship.
</P>
<P>
   On the atoll, during the ticklish final step in the process of
assembling Mike, Rhodes wrote, ``Schreiber was in charge of the pit
crew. `They knew what they were doing,' he says lightly; ```I
provided moral support.'''
</P>
<P>
   In its final form, Mike was 6 feet 8 inches by 20 feet and
weighed 82 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The time of ``the Mike shot'' was set for 7:15 a.m. Nov. 1,
local time. A minute earlier, Rhodes wrote, loudspeakers warned
military and civilian personnel on a task force of ships in the
area to don high-density goggles or to turn their backs on the
upcoming blast and to cover their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A radio signal from one of the ships, the U.S.S. Estes, traveled
30 miles and triggered Mike, letting go a fireball that was more
than 3 miles wide and became an immense mushroom cloud: The width
of its stem grew to a maximum of 8 miles, its top, to 27 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really filled up the sky,'' Schreiber recalled to Rhodes.
``It was awesome. It just went on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rhodes noted, Mike's blast, the first megaton-yield
thermonuclear explosion on earth, ``would have obliterated all New
York City's five boroughs.'' The blast was nearly 1,000 times more
powerful than the one at Hiroshima,
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Schreiber became the leader of the laboratory's nuclear
rocket development division. In 1959, he reached a milestone in a
nuclear-powered rocket propulsion project, code-named Rover, with
the first test of an experimental engine using the tremendous
energy potential uranium 235, the original basis of atomic bombs.
The test, which was successful, was carried out at the Atomic
Energy Commission's bomb-testing reservation 100 miles north of Las
Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber went on to become deputy director of the laboratory
from 1972 until he retired from that post in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in McMinnville, Ore., and received a bachelor's
degree in 1931 from Linfield College in Oregon and a master's
degree in 1932 from the University of Oregon. He taught at Purdue
University from 1937 to 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Marguerite
Elizabeth Doak; two daughters, Paula Dransfield of Santa Fe, N.M.,
and Sara Schreiber of Corvallis, Ore.; and a sister, Anna Bergstrom
of McMinnville.

<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Heading to the foul line with 2.5 seconds
remaining and the game tied, North Texas freshman Jalie Mitchell
had a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Miss the first, make the second.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people will believe her, but it worked as she hit her
second free throw, giving the Eagles a 65-64 victory against the
Houston Cougars at the Super Pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make it more exciting,'' said Mitchell, who
finished with a team-high 17 points and four steals.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tight throughout, with six ties and 11 lead
changes; there were four lead changes in the last five minutes as
neither team led by more than eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good, but I didn't anticipate it would be this
close,'' UNT coach Tina Slinker said. ``This is a tremendous
confidence lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 64-61, UNT received a break when Rosalyn Reades
collected her own deflected shot and scored, tying the game with 23
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing possession, Houston tried in vain to pass the
ball to center ShaRonda Lasseter, who had 16 points and 16
rebounds, but settled for a Chiara Combs running jump shot that
missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles collected the loose ball and pushed the ball up the
floor, where Mitchell stopped on the baseline and was fouled by
Combs.
</P>
<P>
   After Mitchell's free throw, Cougars guard Vashika Battle's
leaning 3-point attempt missed as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing all of the second half, the interior scoring of
Lasseter and Kokeesha Randle, who finished with a game-high 21
points, gave the Cougars a one-point lead with 5:10 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   However, they committed four of their 24 turnovers in the final
five minutes, compared to just one in that stretch by UNT.
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped the Eagles' two-game losing streak and
improved their record to 8-4, their best start in nine seasons. The
loss was the Cougars' (4-7) third consecutive and marked their
eighth consecutive road defeat dating back to last season.

 &HT;    Keep rolling: Recruiting key to FSU, Vols
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ When Phillip Fulmer was hired as Tennessee's
football coach in 1992, he promised to take an already successful
program to the next level _ the national championship level.
</P>
<P>
   The national championship level is where a program and its fans
expect to contend for the title every year, regardless of
graduation, injuries and NFL defections. For those teams, the
conference championship is almost a given. The talent is so deep
and the coaching is so strong that fans are shocked and
disappointed if their team doesn't have a chance come New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama used to be there. So did Miami. Until this year,
Nebraska was a charter member. Florida State has been on that level
for a dozen years. Now, Tennessee thinks it is there and is looking
for an opportunity to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's Fiesta Bowl will determine this season's title.
In many ways, it was inevitable that the two programs would meet
for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   No team has more victories during the 1990s than Florida State,
with 97. For 12 consecutive years, beginning in 1987, Florida State
has lost no more than two games in a season and has finished no
lower than No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll. The Seminoles
won a national championship in 1993 and have contended more often
than not.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols can't match that consistency, but they aren't far
behind. Besides FSU, only two other teams, Nebraska (96) and
Florida (92), have posted more victories in the '90s than
Tennessee's 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of consistency that every program aspires
to,'' said Fulmer, who has won 66 games and two SEC championships
in slightly more than six seasons. ``If people don't think we're
there yet, I've got to believe we were pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons why Florida State and Tennessee and a handful of
other programs reload rather than rebuild every season include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Recruiting. No one has done it better in the '90s than Florida
State, but Tennessee is not far behind. The Vols have the ability
to stack one great recruiting class on top of another, which serves
as a hedge against injury and other personnel problems.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State lost a ton of defensive talent from last year's
11-1 team, including Andre Wadsworth, Sam Cowart and Darryl Bush.
But this year's defense is faster and more athletic and is ranked
No. 1 nationally. Offensively, the Seminoles lost starting
quarterback Thad Busby to graduation and their next two
quarterbacks _ Dan Kendra and Chris Weinke _ to injuries. But they
are playing for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Peyton Manning, Tennessee lost from its 1997 SEC
championship team 13 players who were invited to NFL training
camps. Four weeks into the 1998 season, the Volunteers lost their
best offensive player, running back Jamal Lewis. But sophomore
Travis Henry, one of the top recruits from Florida two years ago,
stepped in, and the Vols led the SEC in rushing in a 12-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You recruit as many great players as you can, knowing that
sooner or later you'll need them all,'' Fulmer said. ``With only 85
scholarships, you can't have too many players.''
</P>
<P>
   And the beat goes on. Tennessee already is headed to another
great recruiting class, led by Chris Simms, the nation's best high
school quarterback. Florida State already has the best prep
quarterback from 1997, Jared Jones of Walla Walla, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coaching stability. Head coach Bobby Bowden is in his 23rd
year at Florida State. His assistant coaches average 13 years on
the job. Three _ Chuck Amato, Jim Gladden, and Billy Sexton _ have
been at Florida State more than 17 years. The FSU staff ranks
fourth nationally in longevity, with a total of 142 years at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps in recruiting when kids know we're not going
anywhere,'' said Amato, Bowden's assistant head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer concurs, which is one reason he tends to be very loyal to
his staff, promoting from within when a rare vacancy occurs. In
1995, when Fulmer needed a new defensive coordinator, he ignored
suggestions to go out and hire a big name and instead promoted John
Chavis, his linebacker coach. Earlier this month, after offensive
coordinator David Cutcliffe left to become head coach at
Mississippi, Fulmer promoted running-backs coach Randy Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to the staff and it's important to your players
to have as little disruption as possible,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Facilities. Both schools have poured millions into their
stadiums and other facilities that have a direct impact on
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's most recent expansion to Neyland Stadium brought its
seating capacity to more than 107,000, second nationally to
Michigan. It has a multimillion-dollar football office complex with
a state-of-the-art indoor practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's multimillion-dollar face-lift of Doak Campbell
Stadium has increased capacity to 80,000 and has given Bowden and
his staff a first-class facility to use as a recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors have an effect, too, including fan support,
administrative support and academic support. Tennessee and Florida
State have all of them at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, and not just the players and the coaches,
have worked very hard to make our football program something
special,'' Fulmer said. ``It has to be a total commitment from
everybody from the president's office on down. At places like
Tennessee and Florida State, you have that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the two teams meet again in a championship
game. Of Florida State's top 44 players for the Fiesta Bowl, 35 are
scheduled to return next season, plus sophomore Weinke, who will be
back from a neck injury. For Tennessee, 33 of the top 44 will
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's harder to maintain a program at this level with
only 85 scholarships, but once you start winning you can get some
momentum,'' Fulmer said. ``Right now, I think we have that
momentum.

 &HT;    Rematch sees matured Tech awaiting Irish
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ What Georgia Tech sees in its Gator Bowl
opponent Notre Dame is an opportunity to beat a traditional
national power on New Year's Day, to reach 10 wins for the first
time since 1990 and to push its way into a top 10 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets also can use Notre Dame as a gauge of exactly
how far they have come on offense. Offensive coordinator Ralph
Friedgen began his return to Georgia Tech with the first game of
1997, when Tech lost to the Irish 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played them the first time, it was like Mo, Larry and
Curly,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``We had four new
offensive linemen that we were just hoping to hit somebody. ... I
think we're a completely different team than when we played them a
year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's offense has flourished under Friedgen. The Yellow Jackets
averaged 35.5 points per game this season, which ranked 11th
nationally, the highest Tech ranking in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   Tech set a school-record with 50 touchdowns and had its
fourth-highest total-offense average at 388.7 yards per game. In
the process, quarterback Joe Hamilton rose to first-team All-ACC
and one of the top players at his position in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But from where they are all sitting now, the Tech players and
coaches say the beginnings _ as in the Notre Dame game last year _
were humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``(When) I watch the film now, I see guys blocking the wrong
guy, staggering through it, really,'' Friedgen said. ``Coaches,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then Friedgen took for granted that offensive assistants
would know how he likes plays charted and what information he
expects to be available to him during a game. When at one point he
asked whether Notre Dame was in a man-to-man or zone coverage in
its last third-and-8 situation, he didn't get a response.
</P>
<P>
   And Friedgen said he was making mistakes, too. O'Leary wanted
him to coach from the sideline so he would be working closely with
Hamilton during the game. Friedgen had called games from the
sideline, rather than the press box, only a couple of times, as an
interim head coach when Bobby Ross was out sick with the San Diego
Chargers. Several times against Notre Dame, Friedgen said, he
thought it was third-and-2 or -3 when it was really third-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a confusing day, but Friedgen said he saw
glimpses of good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our kids were in awe a little bit, playing at Notre
Dame (and) the rededication of the stadium,'' Friedgen said. ``I
think our kids got to the point where they didn't believe they
could win it. We had a lot of mistakes at the end in the same plays
that we had run well early against the same defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen's offense is intricate and involved, and he had to
start off slow. When asked to compare how much Tech had installed
offensively for Notre Dame the first game of 1997 with what Tech
has in now, Friedgen said ``It's like kindergarten to graduating
from college.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the difference has to do with Hamilton and what he has
learned in the 23 games he has played under Friedgen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come up to the line now, it's, `What is the defense
doing?' '' Hamilton said. ``I'm not thinking about our play we're
calling, which direction this is going or what routes the receivers
are running.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference, Friedgen said, doesn't have as much
to do with formations, blocking schemes or routes as much as it
does attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our first game (last year) was Podunk U., those kids would
have been nervous and making mistakes, but when you're in a game
playing against a national power, it's more so,'' Friedgen said.
``I think it was a great experience for them. I think the
difference is, now we believe we can win. I don't think we did at
that time. That's why we lost the game.

 &HT;    On similar, yet different paths
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Virginia accepted an invitation from the Peach Bowl
more than a month ago and responded by staging the greatest
comeback in school history. Georgia, whose players expected a
return trip to the Outback Bowl in Tampa, learned after the season
it would be playing in its own back yard instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan will find out tonight how his players
will respond to that challenge when No. 19 Georgia battles No. 12
Virginia in the 31st Peach Bowl in the sold-out Georgia Dome. The
game will be televised nationally by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little worried coming over here, because it was so
close to home,'' Donnan said, ``but our guys have worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (8-3) and Virginia (9-2), both ranked as high as seventh
nationally this season, arrived in Atlanta after similar seasons.
Both teams were left out of New Year's Day bowl games, in part
because of collapses against Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia blew a 21-point lead to Tech in the third quarter and
lost 41-38 in Atlanta on Oct. 17, costing the Cavaliers a share of
the ACC championship.
</P>
<P>
   But they still have plenty to motivate them. Virginia, which
rallied from a 22-point halftime deficit to beat Virginia Tech
36-32 in its regular-season finale, can become only the second team
in school history to win 10 games in a season. That record probably
would propel the Cavaliers into the top 10. Georgia, which lost 75
percent of its offense from a year ago, wasn't expected to do much
in Donnan's third season in Athens. But the Bulldogs stormed to a
4-0 record before losing to Tennessee, Florida and Georgia Tech _
in which they blew a 12-point fourth-quarter lead and were beaten
21-19 on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   When bowl berths were handed out, they were snubbed by the
Outback, which took Kentucky instead. For some Georgia players, the
hourlong trip to Atlanta doesn't seem like much of a reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of speculation that we weren't happy to be
(playing in the Peach Bowl),'' Georgia offensive tackle Matt
Stinchcomb said. ``But we're just glad to be in a bowl. It was only
two years ago that we were sitting at home.'' Now, they're back in
the Peach Bowl, where they played their final game under former
coach Ray Goff in 1995. ``It is kind of ironic,'' Stinchcomb said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's fondest bowl memories have come in Atlanta. The
Cavaliers are 2-0 in the Peach Bowl, beating Purdue on a late field
goal in the 1986 game and then stunning Georgia 34-27 on Demetrius
Allen's 83-yard kickoff return with 57 seconds left in the '95
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we win, it will be good,'' Donnan said. ``If we
don't win, it won't be the end of the world.''

 &HT;    Emmitt has plenty left in his tank
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By his own reckoning it has been 15 years since Emmitt
Smith, then a freshman at Escambia High School in Pensacola, earned
an ``A'' for a book report on ``The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience didn't certify the Dallas Cowboys tailback as an
expert on the works of Mark Twain. It made him a big enough fan,
though, that when asked earlier this week about a widely held
preseason notion that he was ready for the NFL's scrap heap, Smith
fired back with a line from an author whose homespun wisdom he
enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the old thing about reports of my (demise) being
greatly exaggerated?'' the prideful Smith asked. ``The whispers
came from behind my back, but I heard them all: `He doesn't have
anything left. Emmitt's finished.' Well, maybe I'm not the same car
I was back in 1990, when I first came here. But I'll get you where
you want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys begin another playoff trip against the upstart
Arizona Cardinals on Saturday, it is Smith who is apt to provide
the power.
</P>
<P>
   At age 29, he ran for 1,332 yards this season, his best output
since 1995 and enough to catapult him to the No. 5 spot on the
career rushing list with 12,566 yards. His 13 rushing touchdowns
gave him 125 for his career, making him the all-time NFL leader.
Smith exceeded 100 yards rushing seven times this season, his most
in four years.
</P>
<P>
   In a season when the Cowboys frequently struggled with the
newfangled multiple-set offense installed by rookie head coach Chan
Gailey, the nine-year veteran turned back the clock and got down to
basics.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he stayed healthier than he has been the last several
seasons, and for a runner whose style is reminiscent of the old
amusement-park bumper cars, that was a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times the last couple years when Emmitt was running
in self-defense just to protect himself,'' fullback Daryl Johnston
said. ``He'd go out and play with injuries that should have kept
him on the bench. This year, he ran through people again. And now
we're getting to the time of year he loves, so he'll really be
jacked up.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back Johnston's contention that playoff time is
Emmitt's time.
</P>
<P>
   With 1,413 yards in the postseason, Smith ranks second all-time,
and he can supplant Franco Harris at the top with 144 more yards.
He is the all-time postseason leader in rushing touchdowns (18) and
100-yard games (seven), and is tied with Thurman Thomas for the
most overall touchdowns (20) and most points (120) in playoff
history. His 319 carries are the third-most for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the games,'' he said, ``that you live for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 playoffs, Gailey, then the offensive coordinator in
Pittsburgh, inexplicably took the ball out of the hands of star
tailback Jerome Bettis, and that flawed strategy contributed to the
Steelers' demise. If anything, Gailey was a victim of his own
offensive imagination last year, sacrificing strength for
gimmickry.
</P>
<P>
   Against an Arizona front seven weakened by injury and powerless
to stop the run during the final month of the regular season, power
is more valuable than guile. Several Dallas players hinted this
week that it is fine to have diversity of formations and to put
wide receivers in motion, but it's running the football that wins
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that his 319 rushes in 1998 were 58 more than he had
had in his injury-filled season of a year ago, but still five fewer
than he had averaged his first eight years. He is, Smith
emphasized, fresher than in past playoffs, in part because backups
Chris Warren and Sherman Williams combined for 100 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty of training camp, where he often appeared spent
in the 105-degree heat of Wichita Falls, Texas and looked awkward
in an offensive scheme that forced him to take a lateral jab-step
before cutting into the line, is just a memory.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is fond of the expression that he has ``plenty of tread
left on (his) tires,'' and he wants Gailey to rub some of it off in
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go all the way back to high school, and I have carried the
ball a ton in my career, but I still want it,'' Smith said.
``People say I've come back strong. In my mind, I really never went
away. It's all about perspective, you know? If you set the bar
high, expectations are higher for you. If (Mark) McGwire hits 50
home runs next year, people are going to say, `Oh, man, he's
slipping.' But I'll bet he'll never doubt himself, and that's how I
am.

all older people who move into smaller quarters try to cram in as

lives, approached the move with a pioneering spirit. Their new
homes become opportunities to express new attitudes about life. By

are pushing new standards of 22 by 14 by 9 inches or ``45 linear

the game via the city's majestic river canyon. The ritual trip down
boulder-lined stairways set among the oaks and sycamores and into
the fabled wash is not a short cut but a pleasure, known primarily
to residents of Pasadena.

LONGHORNS, BULLDOGS GLAD TO BE EARLY TO BED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ To stay up or not even bother to go out?
</P>
<P>
   That's today's biggest dilemma facing fans of Texas and
Mississippi State as they contemplate tomorrow's red-eye kickoff
(10:15 a.m) for the 63rd Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The teams, however, have no such heady options to consider.
Early bedtimes are in effect. And both coaches said yesterday that
their players are in need of some rest after a week of early wakeup
calls, long practices, media interviews, visiting with family and
friends and attending Cotton Bowl functions at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a fast week, but we've been busy every day, and our
players are tired,'' Bulldogs coach Jackie Sherrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown echoed Sherrill's comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are tired, too,'' Brown said. ``They're ready to
get to bed. The week's been great, but it's time to play now.''
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff is the earliest in Cotton Bowl history. The reason
is the four -year agreement that was signed in September between
the Cotton Bowl and the Southeastern Conference. A clause in the
SEC's agreement with the CompUSA Citrus Bowl prevents another
conference team from playing in a bowl that conflicts with the
Citrus' noon start. Further complicating matters is the Rose Bowl's
exclusive afternoon slot as a member of the Bowl Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches said the early kickoff complicates the week's
routine, but both also understand the complex factors involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pluses and minuses everywhere,'' Sherrill said.
``This game will be very highly rated. Texas is a tremendous draw.
Ricky Williams is a tremendous TV draw, so there'll be a lot of
people watching this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college football. . .it is called exposure. The bowl games,
the TV contracts have been very good for college football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, of course, have had favorable experience with
eye-openers _ upsetting Texas A&AMP;M in a 10 a.m. game. Brown said the
exposure of being the only game on television at the time can be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in America will be focused on this ballgame,'' Brown
said. ``It helps the exposure of both teams nationally. I think
that's a real positive for the Cotton Bowl. No question it makes an
impact on recruiting. Everyone watched our A&AMP;M game at least
through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative we felt like for the A&AMP;M game was for the fans.
If they had to drive from Houston or Dallas to get to Austin, they
had to leave really early _ but they were there. The Mississippi
State and Texas fans will be here, so I don't think that's an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, coaches like to get up and play early. Those night
games are the ones that are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches paid huge compliments to each other and their teams
and debated over which might have the advantage _ MSU because it
played most recently in the SEC Championship Game on Dec. 6, or
Texas because it regularly plays in the Cotton Bowl stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a positive that we've played here and played well
\Rdefeating Oklahoma, 34-3\S,'' Brown said. ``I think it's more of
a positive for Mississippi State to have already played in a
ballgame with a bowl atmosphere against a great team a week after
we played.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were only a couple of plays away from beating a team
\RTennessee\S that is playing for the national championship. You
think about our team; there's not a guy who has played in a bowl
that we've won. Half our team has never been to a bowl. That
probably has more bearing than where we've played before.''

   ST. JOSEPH, Minn. _ It is the middle of the night, as Patty
Wetterling sits on the living room couch, staring out the window,
waiting for her boy, Jacob, to come home.
</P>
<P>
   She has been waiting for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still, deep in my heart, believe it is possible that he's
alive,'' said Ms. Wetterling, who hung Jacob's stocking from the
fireplace mantel again this year, as she does every Christmas
season. ``Sometimes I look out the window and expect to see him
come running up the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob was 11 years old when he was abducted by a man with a gun
in this small town on Oct. 22, 1989. His brother, Trevor, who was
10, and a friend, Aaron, 11, were with Jacob that night. The three
boys were riding their bicycles home from the Tom Thumb convenience
store, where they had rented a movie, ``Naked Gun,'' when a man
wearing a mask stepped out of a driveway. The man told Trevor and
Aaron to run, or he would shoot them. And then he took Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   No arrest has ever been made. No body has ever been found. All
that remains is uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wetterling family, the uncertainty has meant nearly a
decade of life lived in the half-step, not quite here, not quite
there, reluctant to lose themselves completely to the moment,
moving ahead with daily routines, because there is no choice,
learning to sing again, even to laugh, but never as freely, or
lightly, as before.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is the burden of doubt known to people who live with
mysterious holes in the family fabric, voids that go unexplained,
losses that are never properly mourned: people who can only wonder
at what became of a father, last known living in some faraway
place, or a sister, tormented by emotional demons until vanishing
into the streets, or a child, who went out to play one day and
somehow crossed paths with evil.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Erwin Wetterling was born on Feb. 17, 1978, a boy who
liked to celebrate his birthday with his grandpa, who loved to fish
with his dad, Jerry, who slept with one arm around his brother,
Trevor.
</P>
<P>
   A great fan of sports, he played soccer, hockey, baseball and
football, and so worshiped Marcus Allen, the star Los Angeles
running back, that he named his dog Marcus, and dressed the pup in
a Raider's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He could never eat enough peanut butter or guacamole. He was
famous around the house for playing tricks on his mother for April
Fool's, and for making her beautiful artwork for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of the sixth grader in this town 75 miles north of
Minneapolis, initially drew hundreds of law enforcement officials.
But the case no longer gets much attention. It has faded from the
headlines in the Minnesota newspapers. Agents for the FBI pulled
out years ago. Only the local sheriff's department keeps close tabs
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But Patty and Jerry Wetterling keep looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning, I lay in bed and couldn't go on anymore,'' said
Ms. Wetterling. ``It was too hard. I pulled the covers up over my
head and decided I was never going to get out of that bed again.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she envisioned Jacob. He was huddled in a corner,
saying he was going to give up.
</P>
<P>
   And she found herself speaking out loud: ``Hold on, Jacob. We're
going to find you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I pulled myself out of bed and took a shower, and went out
to find him,'' she said. ``And that's what I do every day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Searching faces on buses and trains, at construction sites and
shopping malls, Ms. Wetterling looks for a young man with brown
hair and blue eyes, probably about 6 feet tall now, with a 21st
birthday just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling started a foundation, Jacob's Hope, which focuses
on the plight of missing and exploited children, a forum that gives
her a chance to talk with law enforcement officers across the
nation and keep her son's case from being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Some leads still come, but none has panned out. There are people
who call, from all over the country, and say they think they have
seen Jacob, sometimes sending pictures. There are con artists who
call and ask about a reward. There are sadistic pranksters who call
to try to twist their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Wetterlings came home one night and switched on the
answering machine. The voice of a young man whispered into the
telephone. ``This is Jacob Wetterling,'' he said. ``And I want you
to know I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wetterlings felt certain it was not Jacob, but there
remained a shred of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long,'' Ms. Wetterling said. ``Would we recognize
his voice?''
</P>
<P>
   The police traced the call and determined it was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of psychics have called, some looking for self-promotion,
some apparently driven by a misguided hope to help bring an end to
their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob is cold and dead,'' said one caller, who identified
himself as a psychic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling responded with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you had some funny feeling sitting in New York,'' she
said, ``you decide to call and tell me to just quit and give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the horror of the abduction, the Wetterlings led a
seemingly charmed life, a popular and handsome family with a sense
of playfulness and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Wetterling, a chiropractor with a growing business in
town, was president of the local branch of the NAACP. His wife, a
former math teacher, stayed home with the children, was president
of the PTA and a soccer coach.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest child, Amy, was sailing through school like a yacht.
Jacob and Trevor were confident and happy-go-lucky. The youngest,
Carmen, raced at life like fire across the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the earthquake, in the words of an aunt in San
Francisco, that never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Amy started to carry the world on her shoulders, driven to excel
in everything she did, certain it was her role to make the world
right. Carmen began to withdraw socially, especially as she neared
age 11.
</P>
<P>
   The parents worried most about Trevor. They looked him in the
eyes and talked to him about the abduction, the night when his
parents and police officers asked him a thousand questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know that there was nothing different that you
could have done,'' his mother told him. But to this day, she does
not know if he believes that.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob had been an outstanding hockey player, a goalie on the
traveling team. When it came Trevor's turn to join the travel team,
he suited up, skated once around the rink, and walked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit,'' he told his father, and never went back.
</P>
<P>
   He is a student at St. Cloud State University, just 10 miles
from home. He has never much liked to be alone, a trait his mother
calls ``a survival skill,'' and he has not wanted to go far from
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pay you to go to that college you've talked about in
Colorado,'' his mother said she has told him. But Trevor is not
ready to go far from home yet.
</P>
<P>
   Amy recently graduated from the University of Minnesota with a
degree in psychology and a minor in criminal justice. Carmen is a
junior at St. Joseph High School.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no extra time for anything but comforting the
children, and searching for Jacob, the parents gave up their duties
at the NAACP. and the PTA. Ms. Wetterling abandoned her plans to
return to teaching part-time.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob's class of 1996 seemed to carry him with them. He was
given a page in the school yearbook. The hockey team listed his
name on the roster, since he should have been playing. The football
team dedicated its season to Jacob, and then surprised everyone by
winning the Central Lakes Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of Jacob robbed some of the innocence of his
classmates, a burden they seemed to carry all the way through
school. On the day of their graduation, the principal called the
Wetterlings and asked them to speak to the departing seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to set them free,'' the principal said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wetterling reminded the students about Jacob, a boy who was
not afraid to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob believed in a world of possibility and potential,'' his
mother said. ``Let your spirits soar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Jacob's world has changed without his
knowing it. He lost his grandpa last year. Marcus, his dog, died a
few years ago. And the fields near home have become thick with new
houses, a subdivision called Pound Meadow Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who just turned 50, now has just a touch of gray in
his hair at the temples, and his mother, 49, wears eyeglasses most
of the time these days.
</P>
<P>
   But if he should ever find his way back to the driveway, he
would see a big display of white lights on the garage door. It
reads, ``Jacob's Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The family would never consider moving, since they need to be
there when Jacob comes home. And they would not change the
telephone number, despite some of the crank calls, because that's
the number that Jacob knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids do come home,'' Ms. Wetterling said. ``And they do
heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, the mother sat down to write a letter to
Jacob's abductor, an appeal she intended to touch ``that shred of
compassion'' his mother hopes exists in every human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the man who took Jacob,'' began the letter, which was
printed in some Minnesota newspapers. She reminded the abductor
that he, like Jacob, had once been an 11-year-old boy, and that
something very wrong must have happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my own survival, I have had to let go of a lot of anger or
I would be swallowed up in it,'' she wrote, asking that he call her
and tell her what happened to her son. ``You have held the answers
for so long. You also hold the pain. Please talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fireplace glowed with red embers, winds whipping across the
frozen prairie, as she gazed out the window into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world is about ready for a miracle,'' she said.
``Let it be here.'' &QL;

TEXAS A&AMP;M'S NGUYEN SAYS HE WILL BE NEAR FULL STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen, the team's
leading tackler the past four seasons, said yesterday that he
expects to play at less than full speed in tomorrow's Sugar Bowl
because of a sprained big toe on his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about 85 percent,'' said Nguyen, who suffered the injury
during practices last week in College Station. ``The problem is
cutting, but it's getting better. It wasn't as sore \Ryesterday\S
as it has been. I'll be close to 100 percent by game time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, winner of the 1998 Lombardi and Bednarik awards,
registered 147 tackles during the regular season (11.3 per game),
giving him a school-record 517 for his career. Surgery for Slocum's
son John Harvey Slocum, son of A&AMP;M football coach R.C. Slocum, will
undergo a heart catherization Jan. 13 in an attempt to prepare him
for major heart surgery in April. The younger Slocum, 21, has a
congenital heart defect that was discovered at birth and limits the
flow of oxygen through his body.
</P>
<P>
   The family was urged to delay surgery as long as possible, said
the A&AMP;M coach, to increase the chances for success. Recently, said
R.C. Slocum, ``The doctors told us we're to the point we can't keep
waiting ... We all have our crosses to bear. We're just trying to
stay positive.''
Double the pleasure
A&AMP;M punter Shane Lechler, who doubles as the team's No. 3
quarterback, predicted that both Branndon Stewart and Randy McCown
will take snaps in tomorrow's game. McCown, who is coming back from
a broken collarbone suffered Nov. 27, is 6-1 as the Aggies'
starting quarterback this season. Stewart, who will start against
Ohio State, is 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we'll use both to try and give them two
different looks,'' Lechler said.
Like players, like coach
Ohio State coach John Cooper joined Buckeyes' players in stating
that tomorrow's goal is to run up as big a score as possible on the
underdog Aggies in hope of impressing voters in The Associated
Press poll. Ohio State (10-1) is ranked No. 3, behind Fiesta Bowl
participants No. 1 Tennessee (12-0) and No. 2 Florida State (11-1).
The Fiesta Bowl will be played Monday.

<P>
   ``Anything can happen \Rin the final poll\S, so you want to be
as impressive as you can in a game like this,'' Cooper said.
``Certainly, we'll try and score as many points as we can.''
Boston's role limited
Although he is expected to play in tomorrow's game, Ohio State
receiver David Boston (74 catches, 1,330 yards, 13 TDs) has yet to
cut at full speed on a sprained ankle suffered when he slipped
while walking in icy conditions during the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ]Cooper said yesterday that he is concerned about how effective
Boston will be in the game. As a result, Cooper said the junior
from Houston has been scratched as a punt returner, with that role
to fall to Nate Clements.
Stunned by Kansas State
A&AMP;M players expressed shock and disappointment that the Kansas
State team the Aggies defeated in the Big 12 title game lost to
Purdue, 37-34, in Tuesday's Alamo Bowl. It marked the first
postseason loss by a team from the Big 12, which has seven schools
in bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed. I wanted the Big 12 to go 6-1 in
bowls, with Texas losing and the rest winning,'' Lechler said.
``K-State didn't look like the same team we played. They really let
their guard down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (11-2), who missed a chance to play for the
national championship by virtue of their 36-33 loss to A&AMP;M,
suffered six turnovers against the unranked Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they'd put up 70 points on them,'' said deep snapper
Kyle Lednicky. ``But it didn't seem like their hearts were in it,
and I guess that's pretty much due to us. They never got over that
loss.''

DEVILS DEFEAT CAPITALS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The Devils had already missed on a penalty shot in
the first period and had given away a goal on an unforced turnover
in the final seconds of the second period. And in the final seconds
of the game, Brian Rolston skated into the Washington Capitals'
zone and stared down an empty net. When he got off his shot, he saw
it hit the post, ricocheting the other way as the Capitals mounted
one final threat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A shot was deflected away and as the bodies and the puck were
cleared from in front of the New Jersey net, the Devils had
survived for a 3-2 victory over the Washington Capitals at the MCI
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Just how they could be high-fiving after a game that included
these sorts of mistakes had even the Devils at a loss to explain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some breakdowns,'' goalie Martin Brodeur said. ``But we
played pretty good and luck was on our side all the way through. We
never got behind in the game and that makes a big difference. When
it was 1-1 and 2-2, I made saves and we able to come back.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victory sent the Devils into the new year with a 21-9-4
record and an Eastern Conference-best 46 points. It also gave them
a 2-0 record on a three-game road swing that concludes in Ottawa on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't mean to miss the empty net,'' Rolston said.
``When it comes back on the other end and they almost got a good
shot there, you have to really think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, who has been the hottest player in the National
Hockey League in December with league bests of 12 goals and 18
points, gave the Devils the lead at 7 minutes 14 seconds of the
third period. Dave Andreychuk directed a pass through traffic to
Holik, skating alone near center ice along the left boards. Holik
skated in, faked a pass to his rear that held the defenders and
then slipped the puck around goalie Rick Tabaracci. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils never trailed, but had seen the Capitals match them
every time they scored in the first two periods. The Capitals
entered this game missing six players, including Adam Oates, but
their spirit, which may have been broken in the second period, was
resurrected when the Devils gave away the tying goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-1 lead after a short-handed goal by Rolston, with help
from Vadim Sharifijanov, the Devils had killed off a 5-on-3 power
play for two minutes, frustrating the Capitals. And now they were
just trying to last out the final seconds of the second period when
Scott Stevens picked up a puck alone behind his own net. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as Stevens attempted to send the puck back out of the
Devils' zone, Peter Bondra closed in from behind, and in a rush
Stevens inadvertently directed it right to the stick of
Washington's Steve Konowalchuk, who was alone inside the blue line.
Konowalchuk fired immediately and Brodeur stopped the slap shot's
initial thrust, but the puck trickled softly and slowly behind him.
As he tried to dive back in vain, he collided with Sheldon Souray
and the puck just went over the line to tie the score at 2-2 with
14.7 seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils jumped out in front at 7:36 of the opening period
with Sharifijanov converting a pretty wrap-around goal. But the
Capitals tied the score on a 2-on-1 break after Bondra cleared the
puck to center ice, with Konowalchuk swooping in from the right
side and swinging to the left, then feeding Michal Pivonka as he
darted to the right post and one-timed the shot over Brodeur. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils squandered an opportunity to take a lead when Jay
Pandolfo took off on a breakaway at 14:20 of the first period.
Pandolfo was taken down from behind by Dmitri Mironov and awarded a
penalty shot. But as he faked left and then tried to slip the puck
into the right side of the net, Tabaracci, who did not fall for the
fake, forced him to shoot wide right. &QL;

DRIVER ERROR SUSPECTED IN TOUR-BUS ACCIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ State police officers investigating two recent
nonfatal Atlantic City tour-bus accidents appear to be focusing on
driver error, but in both cases have been unable to interview the
drivers about reports from passengers that they fell asleep at the
wheel, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver in a crash early Sunday morning that injured all 30
passengers on their way home to Chinatown in Manhattan from
Atlantic City has been unable to speak because of his injuries,
said the spokesman, Lt. Daniel Cosgrove. The driver of a bus that
crashed on its way to Atlantic City on Monday night was not
injured, but refused to give a statement to the police, Cosgrove
said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver involved in the Sunday crash, Gerald Jones, 56, of
Brooklyn, is in critical condition at Robert Wood Johnson
University Hospital in New Brunswick, said Laura Garofano, a
hospital spokeswoman. Jones, an employee of Academy Bus Tours of
Hoboken, N.J., suffered multiple leg fractures and injuries to his
lower abdomen. He had been pinned inside the bus for nearly an hour
after the Sunday morning crash.
</P>
<P>
   The second driver, David Turner, who works for Greyhound,
submitted to mandatory blood and urine tests but declined to make a
full statement to investigators, Cosgrove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make him talk,'' said Cosgrove, adding that
investigators would try to piece together what happened without
Turner's help and that Turner could be held accountable ``for
whatever the investigation reveals without his statement.''
</P>
<P>
   A Greyhound spokeswoman, Katherine A. Williams, said Wednesday
that Turner had been ``visibly and understandably shaken after the
incident, so he was not comfortable giving a complete official
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's bus was carrying 27 passengers when it crashed into a
bridge abutment while traveling on the Garden State Parkway through
Wall Township about 9:30 p.m. Monday. One passenger suffered
serious injuries and about a dozen others received cuts and
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Several passengers told reporters at the scene of the accident
that they thought that Turner had fallen asleep at the wheel and
run off the road into the abutment. Cosgrove would not confirm that
investigators had received direct reports that the driver had
fallen asleep, but said they would consider all possibilities.
``Driver error generally in accidents is over 90 percent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has been employed by Greyhound since April 1997 and had a
clean driving record until the incident Monday night, Ms. Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two nonfatal accidents came after a crash last Thursday of
an Atlantic City-bound tour bus killed 8 passengers and seriously
injured 14 others and the driver. Officials with the National
Transportation Safety Board pressed ahead Wednesday with what is
expected to be a long inquiry, lasting up to a year, into the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The three accidents, in quick succession, have led to calls from
lawmakers and other officials in New York, Trenton and Washington
for reconsideration of bus safety guidelines, including the amount
of rest required for drivers between shifts and the possibility of
requiring seat belts on all motor coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Richard J. Codey, on Wednesday
called on Gov. Christie Whitman to use her emergency powers to
lower the speed limit for buses on all state toll roads to 55 mph
from the current 65.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor, Pete McDonough, said that
emergency action changing the speed limit for buses would be
premature.
