<HEADLINE> Symposium on Opium War and HK Held in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 120 Chinese and foreign
experts attended an international symposium on the topic
concerning Opium War and Hong Kong here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the symposium, from China's interior area, Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as Canada, Japan and Portugal,
presented some 60 papers, in which they explored Hong Kong's
history from its political, economic, military, educational and
literary aspects.
</P>
<P>
According to participants, the best lesson that has been drawn
from the studies on the Opium War and Hong Kong topic is that
"lagging behind other countries creates opportunities to be
bullied and invaded by powerful countries," the symposium
indicated.
</P>
<P>
Future generations of the Chinese nation, they noted, should
forever bear in mind this historic truth, experts said at the
symposium.
</P>
<P>
Experts recalled that the 100-plus year history of
the struggle for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland is
actually repeated demonstrations of national strength between
China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The founding of New China has made it enventually possible for
a complete settlement of the Hong Kong issue, Some experts held.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British negotiations for the settlement of the Hong
Kong issue have succeeded, they said, adding that it is attributed
to Deng Xiaoping's theory of "one country, two systems" and
China's comprehensive national strength, which has been greatly
increased since the reforms and opening-up were launched in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rapid development of Hong Kong over the past two
and three decades is closely related to the development of China's
vast interior market, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
These experts also expressed the convinction that Hong Kong
will surely maintain its stability and prosperity after its return
to the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
and south China's Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City are among
those attending the opening ceremony of the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Irish Ruling Group Lags Behind in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton's
ruling coalition lags 10 points behind its chief opponents in the
run-up to national elections next Friday, according to a poll
published by The Irish Times newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The survey put support for the main opposition Fianna Fail and
smaller Progressive Democratic party at a combined 49 percent,
bringing them close to securing a majority in the Dail, the Irish
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The total support for Fine Gael, led by Bruton and his partner
Labor and Democratic Left parties, was 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted among 1,000 electors at 100 sampling
points in all constituencies last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
fighting against British rule in neighboring Northern Ireland,
says it can win a seat. It gained two British parliamentary seats
in Britain's May 1 general election.

<HEADLINE> Counties to be China's Huge Potential Market, Says Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- County-level administrative areas,
which hold 80 percent of China's population, are a huge potential
market, one economic reform expert says.
</P>
<P>
An Zhiwen, the director of the Research Office of China's
Restructuring, said here today research on developing the
county economy in central and western parts of China, an
economically disadvantaged region, has been a priority.
</P>
<P>
Counties contributed 60 percent of the country's GDP in 1996,
and more than 40 percent of its revenue and these figures are
increasing. Links should be made between coastal and inland
enterprises, An said.
</P>
<P>
This would benefit industrial improvement in coastal areas and
large and medium-sized cities to develop potential markets in
counties nearby, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Reforms and the growth in township businesses have brought
fundmental changes in the economic structure of China's rural
areas in the past 18 years. During that time, 130 million Chinese
farmers changed to secondary and service industries, while grain
output increased from 200 billion kg to 500 billion.
</P>
<P>
An said that increases in farmers' incomes and purchasing power
have played an important role in making rural areas a buyer's
market. Retail sales at or below the county level now account for
half the country's retail sales, and that could be nearly 70
percent when farmers' expenditures in cities are added in.

<HEADLINE> Children across China Celebrate Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- From Tian'anmen Square in the
capital of Beijing to Lhasa on the "roof of the world," Chinese
children today held an array of colorful activities to mark their
own holiday, International Children's Day, which falls on June 1.
</P>
<P>
China is home to three million children, the majority of whom
live in its vast rural areas. Youngsters in the relatively poor
regions realized today they have not been forgotten by adults and
other kids in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and his wife, and Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, together with children from
Beijing watched this evening's annual charity concert to raise
funds for school dropouts in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The concert series, which started back in 1994, has
successfully raised funds to set up three primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs in Xi'an, home of the world-renowned terra-cotta
warriors, held an event to donate books and school materials for
kids in the province's poor regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Shanghai, the country's economic powerhouse,
children visited a special show of toys and children's books. The
exhibit hall, complete with multimedia computers, was the hottest
venue for incoming little visitors, who enjoyed electronic games
and calling their new-found friends in Beijing with the aid of a
video-conferencing system.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland has
become another popular theme for the children's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
A group of Tibetan children in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, sang and danced at the foot of the Potala
Palace. "I'm a little Tibetan child, living under the feet of the
snow mountain... I'm a child from beautiful Hong Kong," the chorus
rang out.
</P>
<P>
Children performing in Beijing set up a countdown clock on
stage to express their eagerness for the rejoining of the "Pearl
of the Orient" to its ancestral land.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the show, a group of children from both Beijing
and Hong Kong, hand in hand, danced to the accompaniment of a song
titled "Seeking Friends." And a slogan written on the backdrop of
the stage read "We love the motherland, and we love Hong Kong."

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Denies Charges of Ethnic Purity Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on
Saturday denied that the policy of his government is aimed at
making Croatia a pure nation country.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia is not embarking on any policy of ethnic purity but
rather recognizes fully all human and ethnic rights of all
communities in this country, including Serbs," Tudjman said after
his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"It is our challenge to create as soon as possible the
conditions for co-existene" of different nations in Croatia,
Tudjman added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Croatian government respected the right of
Serbs who had fled Croatia during the 1991-95 war to return and
that it would continue to comply with the other aspects of the
Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Albright hinted that if Croatia prevented the return of Serb
refugees, Washington would block Croatia's desired integration
with wealthy European countries.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia will not travel the road to Europe unless all its
peoples, Croats and Serbs, make the journey," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during the meeting with Croatian leaders,
Albright also threatened to veto the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Loans to Croatia, if it failed to take required measures on
the issues of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Stolen Car Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite the prevalence of
various modern alarm systems, Israel is still the stolen car
capital of the world, with five car-thefts occurring every hour.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Israeli Police statistics, every 12
minutes a car is reported missing, and insurance companies paid
off over 1 billion shekels (some 300 million U.S. dollars)
against car thieves last year.
</P>
<P>
Several bigger Israeli insurance companies are now sponsoring
a special police unit, using helicopters, to fight the car-theft
plague.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that some 80 percent of the stolen cars end
up in the Palestinian autonomous areas, as the motor repairing
industry is flourishing in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have poor people live next to rich people,
there will always be a flow of properties from the richer side to
the poorer side," officials from insurance companies said.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians, prevented from working inside Israel because
of the closure imposed by Israel on Palestinian autonomous
areas, are making easy money by bringing the stolen cars to one
of the West Bank repairing yards, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers at various check points look up suspicious
vehicles, but local Palestinians can always find their way by
using many unpoliced back roads, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police want cooperation from the Palestinian
police in fighting against the car crime, and in fact, the
Palestinian Authority did return hundreds of cars to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In an atmosphere of real peace, this kind of cooperation
is demanded every day, every hour," said Jerusalem city
council member, Ornan Yekutieli, whose stolen car was found
and returned by Palestinian Police last month.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Sign Friendship Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and
his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, today signed a Treaty of
Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership, straightening twisted
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, the two countries should respect each other's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, not violate the present
borders, nor interfere in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the treaty requires the two parties not to pressure on
each other by military or economic means and not to form alliance
with a third country to oppose the other.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is a historic event in bilateral relations, Yeltsin
and Kuchma claimed.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the signing ceremony, Kuchma
stressed that disputes over the port city of Sevastopol have now
ended.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the treaty is adopted in accordance with the
wishes of the peoples of the two countries, adding that Ukraine
and Russia are two equal democratic nations.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that neither Russia nor Ukraine make any
concessions in dividing the Black Sea Fleet and interests of both
have been safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed his satisfaction with the treaty, saying that
the treaty has given no problems to the future relations of the
two nations, and vowed that Russia and Ukraine would work
together to build Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine, the two biggest former Soviet republics,
have been at odds since the former Soviet Union disintegrated in
1991, and their relations hurt because of conflicting claims to
the Black Sea Fleet and its main base Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached three agreements on dividing the
fleet on May 28 when Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
visited Ukraine, ending two years of quarrels and making Yeltsin's
visit a reality.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Plans to Have Pro Referees in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZURICH, May 31 (Xinhua) -- International soccer ruling body
FIFA plan to have professional referees in place by the year of
2000, FIFA General secretary Sepp Blatter said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No change in the system of international referees will be made
before next year's World Cup finals but a new way of paying
referees would be set up afterwards, said Blatter.
</P>
<P>
"We want to start having professional referees who are under
contract with FIFA," Blatter said. "We are trying to speed up the
movement...By the end of the century we want to have the right
project for professional referees."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week FIFA discussed proposals to set up a pension
fund for referees in a bid to stamp out corruption in the game.
</P>
<P>
FIFA believes officials are at their most vulnerable to bribes
towards the end of their careers when they are thinking about
their financial future.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia to Bring Islands Dispute to Int'l </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Malaysia have finally
signed an agreement to bring the two countries' dispute over
Sipadan and Ligitan islands to the International Court of Justice
(ICJ) in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry in a press statement here said
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and his Malaysian counterpart Dato
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi signed the agreement in Kuala Lumpur today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the informal ASEAN foreign
ministers' meeting there, said the press statement.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, Indonesia and Malaysia would put to the ICJ's
hand to decide the ownership status of the islands based on the
agreed legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
"We all realize that territorial disputes of any kind can
occasion tension that may exacerbate the bilateral relations
between the disputants, particularly if they fail to arrive at an
understanding on how to resolve it amicably," Alatas was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"An amicable solution could be reached through a political
settlement or through the involvement of a third neutral party in
an adjudication process," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the settlement of the dispute would in turn contribute
to efforts to maintain peace and security in the Southeast Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdullah Badawi said the agreement indicates the two
countries' readiness to accept an ICJ decision as "final and
binding."
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Ligitan and Sipadan islands, off the coast of
Malaysia's Sabah state and Indonesia's East Kalimantan province,
has been a thorn in the relations between the two neighbors since
1969 when both laid a claim to them.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the two countries agreed to refer the
dispute to the ICJ after failing to reach a settlement through
bilateral negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Appeals to Europe to Help Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hammadi has appealed to European
parliaments to help lift without delay the sanctions imposed on
Iraq, the official Iraqi news agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to participants in the ongoing meeting of the
European Parliament held in Helsinki, Finland, Hammadi said Iraq
has met its obligations under the U.N. Security Council's
resolution 687 and that it has positively cooperated with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarming weapons of
mass destruction in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Security Council has to reciprocate by
putting into effect paragraph 22 of resolution 687 which provides
for the lifting of the almost seven-year sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Stringent sanctions were imposed on Iraq by the Security
Council immediately after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August,
1990.
</P>
<P>
The most important prerequisite to lifting the sanctions is the
UNSCOM's confirmation that Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations
of its disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi stated that the sanctions have caused the deaths of
about 830,000 Iraqis up to April this year because of the lack of
food, medicine, baby milk and other basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the need for the European Parliament to make
known the facts about the sanctions to the public in their
relative countries, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the speaker also blamed "an influential power
in the Security Council" for the continuation of the
sanctions, a reference to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has submitted to the U.N. sanction committee hundreds of
contracts with foregin countries for its purchase of food and
medicine and other daily necessities, but only a small part of
them have been approved.

<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 31 (Xinhua) -- When Chinese head coach
Li Yongbo decided in November to let Liu Yong and Ge Fei team up
to train for mixed doubles, he never dreamed of their chance at
the world title.
</P>
<P>
"I thought they are still young and they could train then for a
medal at the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000," he said after Liu and
Ge beat Denmark's Jens Eriksen and Marlene Thomsen to win the
world championships here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since their international outing early this year, the
invincible pair won Japan Open, South Korea Open, Swiss Open
before romping to victory at All England title in March.
</P>
<P>
They share many characteristics in personality. Unlike many
good introvert-extrovert combination for doubles event, both are
quiet but happy people who seem to smile always.
</P>
<P>
Both were born in Jiangsu Province in 1975, the Chinese year of
Rabbit. But on the court, the two "rabbits" transform into an
aggressive pair that fights in concord and precision.
</P>
<P>
Ge Fei is the creative one with excellent control and touch at
the net while Liu Yong holds the key of mixed doubles success with
good serving skills and backcourt ability.
</P>
<P>
Ge also played in the women's doubles while Liu competed in
men's doubles, but both appeared to have little problem physically.
</P>
<P>
"We are young at 21 years. And the rigorous systematic training
ensures us good physical abilities," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
And the pair is aiming high, despite their immediate goal is to
win the October's National Games for home Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we want to win more international events," Liu said,
when a smiling Ge looked on.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Bans Slaney for Positive Dope Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- American runner Mary Slaney has been
banned from competition after a positive dope test, according to a
Saturday decision by the International Amateur Athletic Federation
(IAAF).
</P>
<P>
Sandra Farmer-Patrick, another American runner, was banned by
the U.S. Track and Field Association for four years earlier this
month for testing positive for the steroid testosterone, but
Reineri said the IAAF had yet to be informed of the ban.
</P>
<P>
IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said all athletes testing positive
would from now on be suspended immediately.
</P>
<P>
"If a federation is reluctant to act immediately in accordance
with IAAF rules, then the IAAF Council will from now on suspend
the athlete until the national federation decides (a ban or not),"
he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF decision was prompted by what it considered to be the
sluggish handling of the doping cases involving Farmer-Patrick and
Slaney by the U.S. Track and Field Association.
</P>
<P>
Farmer-Patrick ran in the Atlanta Olympics last August despite
the positive test because the case had not been concluded.
</P>
<P>
Slaney's case is not yet over. She was found to have high
levels of testosterone in her body at the U.S. trials last June.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Mediation Does Not Bow to Outside Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
today Egypt's mediating efforts to restore the Mideast peace
process are based on its own interests, without bowing to any
pressure.
</P>
<P>
The president said during discussions with Egypt's leading
media staff on the occasion of the 14th Media Day that Egypt
cooperates with the United States and all other concerned parties
to achieve peace in the Middle East but "it does not accept
pressure from any quarter or any country."
</P>
<P>
Speculations have it that the U.S. pressure is behind
stepped-up Egyptian role in the Mideast mediation since the
shuttlings by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross failed to bring the two
sides back to the negotiating table. Egypt is believed to be
siding with the Palestinians in mediating an end to the peace
crisis with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision is an Egyptian decision dictated by
national considerations and Egypt's interests," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Safwat al-Sherif said after the meeting
that Mubarak has stressed that Egypt does not negotiate on behalf
of the Palestinians or others.
</P>
<P>
"They are the people concerned," he quoted the president as
saying, "Egypt's role is to bring Palestinian and Israeli views
closer."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks broke down in March when Israel
began building expansion of Jewish settlement in Har Homa in Arab
East Jerusalem. The Palestinians have made their return to the
negotiating table conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary
policy.
</P>
<P>
The president described the Har Homa settlement, a contentious
issue taking central stage in the two-month-old peace crisis, "a
small problem compared to other problems which are more serious."
He stressed that the Jerusalem issue should be settled within the
framework of final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was reportedly floating a five-point plan to persuade
the two sides back to the table, which includes a temporary halt of
settlement activities in Jerusalem and the West Bank and the
immediate resumption of the final talks.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of breaking the deadlock
in the peace process, referring to his meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Binjamin Netanyahu in the Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Mideast cause is complicated and problems cannot be solved
overnight," he added.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Completion of Somali Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today stressed
the necessity of accomplishing national reconciliation among
various Somali factions and offered support and assistance to the
process.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement today, AL Assistant Secretary General
Ahmed Bin Hali, who is in charge of the Somalia file, said that a
recent Agreement increased success opportunities of national
reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Somali faction leaders reached the agreement here Thursday on
holding peaceful talks to end the civil war that has ravaged the
country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's reconciliation agreement was signed by Ali Mahdi
Mohammed, chief of the Somali Salvation Alliance and Hussein
Farah Aideed, head of the United Somali Congress.
</P>
<P>
"It provides for ceasing hostilities and solving problems
between the Somalis through peaceful means," said Hali, who called
for an early definition of the venue and date of the projected
conference on national reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged full support and "various kinds of aid" for
making any such conference a success.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League will pursue its endeavors that are aimed at
bringing Somalia back to normal in order to play its role at
Arab, African and world arenas," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a conference of national reconciliation
will be held inside the country in the coming months to remove
the remaining differences among the Somali people.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid held intensive talks
over the past few months with the Somali faction leaders with the
aim of bringing closer viewpoints and removing differences
between the parties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, together with other African countries, has also been
involved in mediating an end to the six-year-old Somali crisis in
the previous few months.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late President Mohammed Siad
Barre, Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by
faction leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs
despite several unsuccessful peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fightings combined with a 1992 famine have
claimed about 350,000 lives in the country.

<HEADLINE> GCC Calls for Turkish Pullout from Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the six
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states today called on Turkey to
withdraw from northern Iraq, reports reaching here from Saudi
capital Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said the call was made by Qatari
Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Bin Jaber al Thani, also
chairman of the current GCC ministerial council, at the
inaugural session of a two-day meeting in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
He said the council expressed their regret over the Turkish
military incursion into northern Iraq and the Turkish violation
of Iraqi territorial sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the Turkish military operation is a serious threat
to the security and stability of the region and international
peace as well."
</P>
<P>
For two weeks the Turkish troops have been operating in
northern Iraq to against Turkish rebels of the Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is the 63rd of its kind by foreign
ministers of the GCC, namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, since the founding
of the regional political and economic block in 1981.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Sheikh Hamad also congratulated newly-elected
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on his victory in the recent
Iranian election.
</P>
<P>
Hamad also expressed hope that the GCC-Iranian relations
would develop further during his term of office, especially with
regard to the territorial dispute between the UAE and Iran over
the islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reaffirmed the Iranian sovereignty over the three islands
at his first press conference after election, but expressed
willingness to start talks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the GCC members sent greetings to congratulate
Khatami on his landslide victory in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister also voiced regret on behalf of
the GCC states at the deterioration of the Middle East peace
process due to Israel's anti-Arab policies.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to remain committed to complying with
agreements with the Palestinians, halt the construction of the
new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and adhere to
Madrid's conference and the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Jewish state to resume peace negotiations
with Syria from where they stopped and complete withdrawal from
the Golan Heights, south Lebanon and Western Beqaa.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Coupists Seek Peace with Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Coup leaders that toppled the
elected government in Sierra Leone a week ago said today they are
in negotiations with sub-regional leaders to resolve political
crisis and restore peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation in Sierra Leone remains tense, the
Nigeria Television Authority reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the military regime led by Major
Johnny Paul Koroma has set up checkpoints around the capital
Freetown as west African countries may intervene militarily to
reverse last Sunday's coup.
</P>
<P>
Ghanian troops are reportedly marching towards the border of
Sierra Leone while other west African countries may try to
re-install ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Revolutionary United Front rebels who have
been fighting a civil war in the country for the past five years
have come to Freetown following the call of the new military
leaders for the return of their former leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was reportedly detained in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian delegation led by chief of defence staff
Major-General A. Abubakar has been in Freetown since Wednesday to
discuss with the coup leaders for a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The development of the negotiations has not yet been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have evacuated their nationals in Freetown
and the military authorities have ordered a closure of borders
for security reason.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. States Department Spokesman, John Dinger, said on
Friday the U.S. opposes to use foreign forces to intervene in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. would continue to pursue all diplomatic efforts,
including all international pressure possbile, to restore the
democratically elected government in the west African country,
he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Refits Nuclear Bomb Against Enemy Bunkers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has for the first time
since the end of the Cold War put a nuclear weapon with new
capabilities into the field, a "bunker buster" designed to destroy
underground factories or laboratories, a news report said today.
</P>
<P>
"The weapon, called the B-61, is a repackaging of a hydrogen
bomb that has been deployed in the nation's arsenal for 30 years,"
reported the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was originally designed to be dropped from an airplane
by parachute and exploded while still aloft.
</P>
<P>
The warhead of the bomb has been fitted into a new,
needle-shaped heavy case. Dropped without a parachute, it can
burrow as deep as 50 feet into the soil before exploding, but
cause relatively little surface damage, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted critics as saying that the re-designed
B-61 is a new weapon intended to be used against small countries
like Iran, Libya, which Washington suspects may be developing
chemical weapons underground.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials, however, said the bomb was developed to
address a potential threat from traditional nuclear adversaries
like Russia, stressing it is not a new weapon.

KATHMANDU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's first private radio
station will start its trial operation Monday after getting a
broadcasting license from the government.
</P>
<P>
Radio Sagarmatha, named after what the world's highest Mount
Qomolangma is called in Nepal, is broadcasting educational,
informative and entertainment services for two hours every morning
on a trial basis within the Kathmandu area, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Information and Communications Jhalanath Khanal
today handed over the radio's broadcasting license to the Nepal
Forum of Environmental Journalists (NFEJ), the major sponsor of
Radio Sagarmatha.
</P>
<P>
Khanal said the license was issued as the first step to
liberalize the communications sector under the government's policy
of involving the private sector in the responsibilities so far
being carried out by the state alone.
</P>
<P>
Radio Sagarmatha will become the first non-commercial radio
station operated by the private sector in the South Asian region,
sources from the NFEJ said.
</P>
<P>
They said the radio will extend its daily service time
gradually after a two-month trial period.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Policeman Dies After Being Beaten by Mob </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An off-duty Northern Ireland
policeman died this morning after being beaten by a mob in the
town of Ballymoney in Country Antrim, reports from Belfast said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said at least seven pro-British protestants
assaulted the 45-year-old officer outside a bar. He died from the
injuries several hours later.
</P>
<P>
The protestants targeted the police probably because they were
angered at being barred from holding marches in the past few
months in the County Antrim village of Dunloy after the mainly
anti-British Roman Catholic Irish nationalist residents protested
strongly to the local government.
</P>
<P>
This was the first serious incident after Labor Party won a
landslide victory in the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security forces found a bomb detonation wire in west
Belfast as they investigated an IRA claim that it had abandoned a
defused landmine, police said.
</P>
<P>
An IRA statement said one of its units had aborted a planned
attack on security forces on Saturday and left the landmine in a
van in the Poleglass district.
</P>
<P>
It was the IRA's first reported hostile action in the province
for six weeks, during which Britain has resumed contacts broken
off 16 months ago with their political wing.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been fighting against the British rule of Northern
Ireland over the past 28 years. The new Labor government has
offered to resume official contact with IRA's political wing Sinn
Fein.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of talks were held in the past 10 days, bringing new
hope of a breakthrough in the deadlocked peace process in Northern
Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Rasmussen Beats Sun to Take Men's Singles Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Peter Rasmussen won
Denmark's first world men's singles title in 20 years by battling
two hours to beat China's Sun Jun in a spectacular final at the
World Badminton Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, a 25-year-old student doctor, rallied from one set
down to beat Sun 16-17, 18-13 and 15-10 and won the honor for
Denmark again since Flemming Delfs took the title at the first
World Championships in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, whose deceptive smashes worked well against a
sometimes hesitant Sun, led the first game 14-10 to reach his
first game point, only to see Sun come back to save another game
point on his way to tie the score 14-14.
</P>
<P>
In the three-point setting, Rasmussen got his third game point
at 2-1 but squandered it again to finally concede 16-17.
</P>
<P>
Sun, 22, broke away from a 6-6 tie to lead 13-6 in the second
game. But left-handed Rasmussen then rallied with delicate and
clever net play to tie 13-13 before winning the setting 5-0 with
pinpointed accurate smashes along the lines.
</P>
<P>
In the deciding game, an exhausted Sun managed to lead the game
5-3 when he suffered a cramp but spent several controversial
minutes twice on court to treat his left leg as umpire Chan Chun
Sang of Malaysia watched on.
</P>
<P>
He struggled to win five more points for a 10-3 lead before the
cramp took its toll and a ruthless Rasmussen easily
out-manouveured the staggering Sun to take his very first world
title.
</P>
<P>
Sun won the silver medal. Both Indonesia's Heryanto Arbi and
Denmark's Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen were placed third and took the
bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible experience for me. I was amazed. This is
the hardest match that I have ever played," said Rasmussen at the
post-match press conference.
</P>
<P>
He added, "I opened the court a lot and tried to be patient
before I made the smashes."
</P>
<P>
He said he was not affected by the controversial moment when
Sun disrupted the continuity of match to treat his cramp in the
left leg.

<HEADLINE> Ma's Runners Show Poor Results in China Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, China, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ma Junren, who coached "Ma
Family Army" to win three gold medals in the 1993 Athletics
Worlds, tossed his head in dismay about the poor results showed by
his women runners at the Chinese national track and field
championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Don't expect my runners and me to create the miracle again
before the next century," shouted Ma, who guided Wang Junxia, Qu
Yunxia and Liu Dong to beat the world in the Stuttgart World
Championships and set three world records in the 1,500, 3,000,
10,000 meters in 1993.
</P>
<P>
With Olympic 5,000-meter champion Wang Junxia pulling out this
meet due to poor health condition, world 1,500-meter record holder
Qu struggled hard in her thrump event, finishing 10th in 4 minutes
48.25 seconds, almost one minute slower than her personal best.
</P>
<P>
"I'm finished. Injuries and illness have bothered me a lot
these years. It will be my last year on the track, next season
I'll be an assistant coach," said the 27-year-old Qu.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junxia and Liu Dong broke away from Ma's camp in 1994
after a bitter dispute with the coach. The two talented girls now
are coached by Mao Dezhen.
</P>
<P>
But Liu, who won the 800-meter gold in Stuttgart, only managed
6th in the 1,500 meters in 4:29.34. The top three places were won
by Yan Wei in 4:13.49, Liu Liping in 4:18.98 and Wang Qingfen in
4:19.07.
</P>
<P>
With Qu and Liu already lost their competitive abilities, Wang
remains the only hope for China's athletics. But after the Olympic
triumph in Atlanta, Wang is losing her interest in running.
</P>
<P>
"She has stopped training since last October. She said she had
been bothered by a consistant headache. Many people persuaded her
to stick on, but she said she just wants to quit. I can do nothing
about it, even though I am her coach," said Mao.
</P>
<P>
"I guess she wants to rest for a while. Wang will not compete
in the World Championships this August," Mao added.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Wang and Coach Ma are still like water and
fire, hating each other. One of the reasons is Ma refused to give
Wang the Mercedes Benz car which Wang won as a gift at the
Stuttgart Worlds. "No way, it is not belong to you," Ma was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ma is coaching a new army including many teenage runners. Ma
said, "Now I've laid my sights on the 2,000 Sydney Olympics. I'm
sure there young girls will be good enough by then."

<HEADLINE> Italy Revokes Nomination of New Ambassador to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government revoked the
appointment of Manfredo Incisa di Camerana as new ambassador to
Albania, a statement issued by the foreign ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
"Following the offer by ambassador Manfredo Incisa de Camerana
to renounce the appointment bestowed on him, the government has
decided to revoke the nomination," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The decision came only two days after Incisa was named to take
over the sensitive post from Paolo Foresti.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the reversal came as the
result of a "rather disconcerting" statement made by the
newly-named ambassador to the press.
</P>
<P>
Incisa, a former ambassador to Mozambique, was quoted in the La
Repubblica newspaper on Saturday as saying that the Italian
Foreign Ministry was going through a period of weakness and
Foresti, his would-be predecessor, had always been
politically-aligned.
</P>
<P>
Today, the newspaper quoted him as saying that his comments had
been off the record and were distorted. At the same time, he had
offered to stand down from the post.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that the decision to revoke the nomination was a
particular event involving an individual who showed he was not up
to the situation, and it would not harm Italy's image.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Albania is sensitive but there is no
immediate emergency. We have an ambassador with great experience
who has completed his mandate. We should have recalled him some
time ago. So in the next few days, we will manage a new
nomination," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Rebuilding Treaty of Nanking Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Repair of an exhibition hall in a
temple where the Treaty of Nanking negotiations took place in the
capital of East China's Jiangsu Province has been completed here
today.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed on a British naval ship in August 1842,
ceding Hong Kong to Britain, and forcing China to pay an indemnity
of 21,000,000 silver dollars, along with other humiliating
things. The treaty marked the start of colonization of China by
western imperialist powers.
</P>
<P>
The original exhibition hall, which contains historical
documents on the Treaty of Nanking, was built in 1990. Jiangsu and
other local governments spent over five million yuan last year on
renovating the temple, which was built in 1425.
</P>
<P>
The hall's size was tripled to 2,100 sq. m. It also contains
more than 1,100 treaties China signed with western powers.

Kong returns Home".

<HEADLINE> Christians Pray For Blessings on Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Christians gathered
here today to pray for blessings upon Hong Kong, which will become
a special administrative region of China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The grand prayer meeting, held in the open air at the
35,000-seat Hong Kong Stadium, was intended to unite Christians of
different sects to pray for this land before the advent of the
historic moment, said the Reverend Paul C.C. Ng, chairman of the
Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Christians Prayer Convention.
</P>
<P>
Strains of music played by Hong Kong Boys' Brigade Band sounded
at six o'clock in the evening to open the two-hour prayer
convention, which comprises four sessions -- testimony, presence,
commitment and prayer for blessings.
</P>
<P>
In the final prayer, pastors and Christians shared their common
wishes -- pray for a smooth transition in the society of Hong
Kong, and ask for God's grace and glory to be upon this place.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Mr. Ng said: "The majority of Christians in Hong Kong
are optimistic about the future of Hong Kong, and that's why they
stay here to witness the historic handover."
</P>
<P>
Having served the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ In
China for 15 years, the Rev. Mr. Ng was confident that believers
in Hong Kong would continue to enjoy religious freedom after July
1. "The Basic Law ensures that Hong Kong people's life style will
remain unchanged in the next 50 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of launching a grand Christians prayer meeting first
came to his mind two years ago, and dozens of churches expressed
their support. This year the organizer sent invitations to more
than 1,000 churches and 200 religious organizations across Hong
Kong, asking for their participation.
</P>
<P>
There are about 250,000 to 280,000 Christians in Hong Kong,
including Chinese, Filipinos, and those from English-speaking
countries.

HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's young people have
finished a 997-m-long scroll painting, which depicts the past,
present and future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The scroll, which comprises 997 one-meter-long pictures or
calligraphic works, was displayed here today when it was a
one-month countdown before Hong Kong's return to China on July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The works of painting and calligraphy by Hong Kong youngsters
will be linked to a 1,000-m-long scroll drawn by the young people
in Shenzhen, the city bordering Hong Kong. Their concerted
efforts will create a 1,997-m-long painting scroll, a gift for the
historic moment when China resumes its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong.

<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Both Conchita Martinez and Alex
Corretja joined the exodus of seeds as they were stopped in the
fourth round of the French Open tennis tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Amanda Coetzer and Belgium qualifier Filip
Dewulf became the winners over the Spaniards on the red clay of
Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
Coetzer, the 11th seed, won a three-set game over Martinez 6-7,
6-4, 6-3 while Dewulf upset eighth seed Corretja, one of the
pre-tournament favourites, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 on the centre court.
</P>
<P>
The win was the first for Coetzer against Martinez in their 11
meetings, which last two hours and 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Before today I had never beaten her, I don't think I had even
taken a set from her."
</P>
<P>
Coetzer jumped to a 5-2 lead, before Martinez, the 1994
Wimbledon champion, stormed back to take a 6-5 lead and win the
set in one hour and 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 4-1 in the second, the 25-year-old South African broke
Martinez three times winning the next five games and the set.
</P>
<P>
The decisive set saw the two women trading breaks twice before
Coetzer finally controlled the court to end Martinez's bid for a
ninth consecutive semifinal appearance.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Dewulf made the big surprise by becoming the
first Belgian to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf, ranked 122 in the world, clinched his most significant
win of his career in two hours 57 minute.
</P>
<P>
"I came here to play the qualifying and I'm in the
quarter-finals, it's totally unexpected," said Dewulf who failed
to advance beyond the second round in previous Grand Slam
events.

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Substitute Li Jinyu scored a late
goal to award China a 1-0 victory over Turkmenistan here on Sunday
in the World Cup Asian zone Group eight qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nationals dominated the field with 18 goal attempts
against four for Turkmenistan, and seven corner kicks against one
for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Yet, a string of opportunities were either blown away by the
hosts or blocked in front of the goalmouth by the in-form
Turkmenistan goalie who made perfect dive saves time and again.
</P>
<P>
With five minutes to go, Li Jinyu swung in his header to the
cheers of the crowded home fans at the Beijing Workers' Complex.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China enjoyed a clean slate of four straight wins to
maintain the top spot in the group with other two home games to go.

Early Sunday, Tajikistan scored a 4-0 victory against Vietnam

NANJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held this morning
for the new "Warning Bell" in Jinhai Temple in Nanjing, the

This bell will mark the first unequal treaty of modern Chinese

years ago, in which the government of the Qing Dynasty ceded Hong
Kong to the British government.

The 3.5-ton, 1.84-meter-high bronze bell has a seal cut at its
top from an inscription by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu

the glorious struggle the Chinese people have waged against
foreign invaders since 1840.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Fail to Break Israel's Closure by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) - The Palestinians failed to break
Israel's closure of their territories to secure economic autonomy
with the cancellation of the Palestinian Airlines first ever
commercial flight scheduled today to leave here for Al Arish,
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations, which also include Palestinian Airline's
flights between Al Arish and Saudi Arabia, Cyprus and Turkey, are
due to reasons "beyond our control," Director of the Palestinian
Civil Aviation Authority Fayez Zaidan told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed its closure to the Palestinian territories
now and then over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that Israel closed the Palestinian
territories for 91 days in 1993, 71 days in 1994, 125 days in 1995
and 310 days in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the closures, Palestinian-made products are unable to
move from Gaza to the West and vice versa. Palestinian goods also
find difficulty in reaching Jordanian, Egyptian, other Arab
states' and European markets.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli closure policy almost damaged the Palestinian
economy, incurring some 1.2 billion U.S. dollars loss so far and
giving rise to unemployment and poverty, according to statistics
from the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made repeated efforts to break the
closure and secure contacts with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a new Palestinian airport is just another
try of the Palestinians to procure a free way to somewhere beyond
the closure.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Palestinians planned to open an airport in Rafah
in the southern tip of the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli hard-line government refused the plan,
insisting on having full control over security and checks on
passengers and cargo at the new airport, something the
Palestinians refuse.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which stems from Israeli claims of concern over
the possible smuggling of weapons and unauthorized people into the
Palestinian-ruled areas, have held up approval for the airport and
construction of a port in Gaza City for months.
</P>
<P>
Then Egypt agreed to build an airport in Al Arish for the
Palestinians, which stands at the border between Egypt and the
Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Voting Rate Rises in 2nd Round of French Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- More people participated in the second
round of the legislative election in France today than the last
round by mid-day, and the result of the election would be projected
in the evening after the voting.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac cast a vote this morning in
Sarran in the central department of Correze where he is a deputy
mayor, while Lionel Jospin, the Socialist Party leader and
Chirac's major rival, voted in Cintegabelle in the southwestern
department of Haute-Garonne.
</P>
<P>
The French Interior Ministry said that the participation rate by
12:00 today was 24.08 percent, 1.34 points higher than the 22.74
percent rate of the last round, held on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the participation rate rose from 18.77 percent to
21.04 percent in the first half of the day. But some departments
of the Paris region saw a slightly lower rate.
</P>
<P>
Both the left and right parties of France had appealed to the 31
percent of the voters who abstained in the first round to vote for
them in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The leftist Socialist-Communist bloc won the first round of the
legislative elections, forcing Chirac's central-right coalition
into a corner.
</P>
<P>
The French media said that it was difficult to predict which
side will win in the second round, but the leftist parties could
have better chances.
</P>
<P>
The 15 percent of the voters who voted for the extreme-right
National Front in the first round were believed to be playing a
decisive role in the second round.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Handicapped Orphans Celebrate Children's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Today was the tenth birthday of Wei
Peng, a special day for the girl who lives in the Beijing
Children's Welfare Institute, because she received a "red scarf"
from a senior Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
She wore a pink dress and sang and danced with other children
at the party held by the institute for the International
Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
But, when she came to the institute nine years ago, she had a
harelip. The institute sent her to a hospital for plastic surgery,
and today hardly any trace of her former problem can be found.
</P>
<P>
"I have a mother now, and this is her birthday present to me,"
she said holding up a parasol. "She's talking about a woman who
gives her pocket money every month and takes her out to play," her
teacher explained. "We call those women `assistant mothers'."
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who attended
the party, gave Wei Peng the young pioneer's red scarf.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lin, Premier Li Peng's wife, who is deputy director of the
Chinese National Committee of Care for Children, brought a big
cake, and fruit and flowers to the institute on behalf of the
premier. Various units and people from Beijing gave 600,000 yuan
(about 72,000 US dollars) worth of food and gifts to the institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute has more than 400 orphans, 95 percent of whom
are handicapped, says Wang Chenguang, its director.
</P>
<P>
"Taking care of these handicapped children is a hard task," she
explains, "but our staff treat the children as their own." She
added that many teachers did not go home after the night shift but
stayed for the celebration today.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1984, the institute has a total floor space of
12,000 sq me and 500 beds for children under the age of 15.

<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ten-year-old Liu Shigang is an
orphan who was one of the 100 children from poor families from
Beijing's poorer suburbs who were downtown today for a celebration
of International Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
They were invited by the municipal government and the women's
federation to the Great Hall of the People and Tian'anmen Square
where the usual solemnity was turned into a big playground for
children, with slides, games, puppet shows, and acrobatics. "I've
never seen so many wonderful things," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
What excited him even more was that he met a pal he had
corresponded with since the beginning of the year but had never
seen. Chen Shu, a boy of the same age, from one of the city's best
schools, had helped Liu with his studies through the mail.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave Liu some stationery and said: "We can continue our
correspondence and help each other with our studies."
</P>
<P>
The 100 children are outstanding students and have good moral
character, says Hu Zhaoguang, vice-mayor of Beijing. He says that
a well-educated younger generation is crucial to dealing with the
backwardness in remote mountainous areas, and the 100 children are
the future of those areas. "We hope that today's activities will
help the children love their hometowns and the motherland and will
encourage them to contribute to the development of their hometowns
when they grow up."
</P>
<P>
For Children's Day, all museums and parks in Beijing were free
to children.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Political Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
called today for developing the current East Africa Cooperation
(EAC) into a political federation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"My hope for the longer term is that our present cooperation
will develop into a political federation for east Africa, once
economic integration is in place," Moi noted.
</P>
<P>
The EAC, comprising Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, is also
committed to the establishment of "a single market for east
Africa," he said here today when presiding over the celebrations
marking the Madaraka Day.
</P>
<P>
On the day 34 years ago, Kenya formed its self-government
and attained the right to manage its own affairs from British
colonialists.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Mkapa, together with tens of thousands of
Kenyans, attended the celebrations including a military review,
flying-past by Kenya's Air Forces, scouts' march, colorful dances
and choirs.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful celebrations came just one day after the police
broke up a banned rally organized by the opposition for
constitutional reforms at the Uhuru Park of Nairobi yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Fierce running battles between the police and opposition
sympathizers lasted several hours Saturday, leaving at least
dozens of people injured and a complete standstill of businesses
in the city. Some cars and shopwindows were smashed.
</P>
<P>
In response, Moi reiterated today that no change in the
Constitution will be made before the forthcoming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution that has served us so well should therefore
not be subjected to changes that are designed to satisfy
short-term interests," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Even discussions on the Constitution can only be held
meaningfully after the general elections and then a commission
concerned will be appointed, said Moi.
</P>
<P>
He added that a new law -- the Peaceful Assemblies Bill --
will soon replace the current Public Order Act. However, he did
not reveal the main points of the new bill. enditem

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Supports Intervention in Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Commonthwealth Organization, Emeka Anyaoku, on Saturday gave his
support to foreign intervention in Sierra Leone, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku told BBC that "If they (the coupists) persist in upsetting
an elected government, in inflicting looting and damage on the
country, I think every effort to restore order and legitimacy would be
welcomed".
</P>
<P>
With 1,300 soldiers of the west African peace-keeping force in
Liberia known as ECOMOG already in Freetown and more Ghanian troops
coming, the prospects of a military intervention further heightened
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi has said that his country and
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have the
responsibility to restore peace, stability and the legitimate
government of outsted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
As at Saturday, the evacuations of their nationals by the U.S,
France, Lebanon and other countries have nearly finished, the capital
of Sierra Leone is said to be in an uneasy calmness.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the May 25 coup, Major Paul Jonny Koromah, was
reportedly in negotiations with ECOWAS leaders for a peaceful
resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He has also reportedly appealed to the United Nations for
protection against what appeared to be an imminent intervention,
which he has earlier vowed to resist.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State Spokesman, John Dinger said on Friday
that the U.S. would oppose military intervention but would resort to
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here said the U.S. charge d'affairs in
Freetown, Ann Wright has given support to military actions taken by
the ECOMOG forces led by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
As African heads of states gather tomorrow in Harare, Zimbabwe, for
the 33rd summit of the Organization of African Unity, the issue of
Sierra Leone is expected to be the highlight of their discussions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Tries to Narrow Palestinian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today that current Egyptian peace efforts are designed to
narrow the differences between the Palestinians and Israelis,
instead of exerting pressure on them.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arab
radio, Moussa said "Egypt is not required to urge the Palestinians
to accept something which contradicts their interests."
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who is now attending the Organization of African Union
(OAU) ministerial meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, said the
Palestinian cause will be discussed during the 33rd African summit
slated for Monday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He warned the current crisis facing the Mideast peace process
is very dangerous and urged an immediate solution to the peace
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"Activating the stalled peace march requires a halt of Israeli
settlement activities, a sincere implementation of the signed
agreements, a respect to commitments and sound understanding of
the present regional conditions," the Egyptian top diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks collapsed since mid-March when
Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement on disputed land
in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made the resumption of talks conditional
on a halt to Israel's expansionary policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has refused to stop the Har Homa construction
and instead proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the
Jewish housing project.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Saturday that Egypt is
not biased to the Palestinians but it supports the Palestinian
cause "because their land is in Israeli hands."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak's political advisor Osama al-Baz left here
this morning for his fourth visit to Israel within 10 days to
continue Egypt's consultations with both the Palestinians and
Israelis to break the deadlock in the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Air Traffic Develops Fast in Uganda (by Cai Guozhong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's air traffic has developed
fast in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) show that
arrivals at the country's sole international airport in entebbe near
kampala had increased from 110,100 passengers in 1991 to 300,000
passengers last year, representing a 172-percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the statistics indicate that domestic flights had
increased from 5,887 passengers in 1992 to 27,958 this financial
year, representing an over four-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
Cargo transport has also increased dramatically. Total cargo
through the airport had tripled between 1992 and 1995, from 6,700
tons to 20,000 tons. Turnover had increased from 400,000 dollars in
1991 to nine million dollars in 1996. And this year turnover will be
12.6 million dollars as CAA has predicted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 33 scheduled and regular airlines operating
at the airport as compared to 11 airlines in 1991. In 1982 when
political turmoil prevailed throughout the country, there were only
13 flights from Entebbe to a few foreign destinations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uganda Airlines Corporation is to acquire by lease a
new plane of 737-300 series with a larger seating capacity of 118
passengers. The 737-200 series leased from Air Zimbabwe will be
returned to owners in November this year.
</P>
<P>
The above situation is attributed to various factors such as
stable political climate, the liberal economic policies, the
relaxation of immigration requirements and deliberate marketing
policies of the government and the CAA.
</P>
<P>
During the political turmoil from January 1971 to January 1986,
Uganda's economy was operating at a crawling speed. In 1986 when the
current government came to power, the country's economy started to
recover.
</P>
<P>
In order to maximise the size of the airport, the ACC is to repair
the old airport near the new one to handle cargo as well as domestic
flights so that the new terminal caters for international flights.
</P>
<P>
The CAA is making sure that with renovation taking place, the
design of the terminal will change to suit different tenants who will
be running business at the airport.
</P>
<P>
If the airport is further developed, it could serve as a
central and regional hub that would improve air transport across
the continent, the managing director of the CAA said here last
week with confidence. enditem

<HEADLINE> GCC Calls for Turkish Withdrawal from Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the six
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have called on Turkey to
withdraw its troops from northern Iraq and stop intervening in
the internal affairs of its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers, who ended their 63rd meeting in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, late Saturday night, expressed in a
statement their "profound" worry over the latest Turkish military
operations in northern Iraq, reports reaching here from
Riyadh said today.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our firm stance with regards to the necessity of
preserving Iraq's independence and sovereignty, we call on
Turkey to withdraw its troops from Iraqi territory," Qatar's
Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani said
at the meeting's opening ceremony earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled to be held on June 7-8 but later
moved up to May 31.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the ministers also renewed their firm
stand on Iraq's full compliance with U.N. resolutions relating
to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
They also condemned Iran's pursuit of the status quo policy
in the Islands of Abu Mousa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs,
which they insisted constitutes a violation of the United Arab
Emirates' sovereignty over the islands and undermines regional
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
On the results of the Iranian presidential elections, the
ministers hoped that the future would witness better ties
between the Gulf and Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also voiced "profound" worry over the stalemate
in the peace process due to Israel's provocative policies, mainly
its settlement policy in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
They condemned the Israeli "illegitimate and irresponsible"
practices, urging Israel to honor the signed accords with the
Palestinians, halt the construction of new Jewish settlement and
adhere to Madrid's conference and the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also urged Israel to resume peace
negotiations with Syria from where they stopped and complete
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, south Lebanon and Western
Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
They hailed the efforts of Egypt and the European Union
toward pushing Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's IFP Leader Backs Unity with ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Mangosuthu Buthelezi, top leader
of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), has expressed willingness to unite
with South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC), the local
daily Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It would be "an ideal thing" if the two black parties get united,
Buthelezi said in an interview with reporters of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, also Minister of Home Affairs, made the
remarks when ANC National Chairman Jacob Zuma and his IFP counterpart
Ben Ngubane are in the forefront of a peace initiative which has seen
a significant thawing in relations between the major black parties.
</P>
<P>
The immediate aim of the present talks is to bring peace to Kwazulu
Natal Province and to put a stop to the bloody conflict between ANC
and IFP supporters that has claimed more than 14,000 lives since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Following the peace initiative, the level of violence has
decreased substantially and the parties can now explore restoring
their relations to their pre-1979 status, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi colluded with the then-banned ANC to form IFP in 1975,
but cordial relations soured in 1979 when they differed on strategy,
and a bloody war ensued.
</P>
<P>
For now, the peace initiative is still at a sensitive stage,
but Buthelezi said he believed that the ANC and the IFP had been
driven apart by differences that were "not really necessary" and
which should not have led to a split.
</P>
<P>
Sources closed to the peace initiative sketched a scenario of
voluntary cooperation being forged at local level and extending to
national government.
</P>
<P>
This would result in the ANC and the IFP working together even
after 1999, during which a general election would be held in South
Africa, they said. enditem

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Sugar Industry Expects Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhu) -- The South African sugar industry is
expecting a record 2.5 million ton crop this season and the
continuation of its export growth which earned the country 273 million
U.S. dollars last season, the local daily Sunday Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The coming recovery will make the sugar industry the largest
agricultural exporter in terms of foreign exchange earnings, Andrew
Barr-Simm, the South African Sugar Association's export manager was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the 1996/97 crop did not fulfil its early promises, at 2.3
million tons, it was 50 percent above the average of the past four
years, and helps the sugar industry claw its way out the ravages
caused by an unprecedented drought, the industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to a market analyst, sugar prices in the world market are
reasonable and last season saw South Africa make use of its geographic
position to sell sugar to the West, the Far East and also to North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
From just three traditional markets, Japan, Korea and Israel,
South Africa has now expanded its exports to 31 countries, the
sources said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Airline Suffers Losses From Engine Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific Airways, the
leading airline in Hong Kong, is expected to lose between 120
million to 150 million HK dollars (15 million to 19 million U.S.
dollars) because of the grounding of its A330-300 fleet.
</P>
<P>
Cathay canceled 143 flights over the past week when a
succession of in-flight engine shutdowns forced its 11 A330-300
jets grounded.
</P>
<P>
The airline's chairman, Peter Sutch, said the estimated cost
includes the loss of ticket revenue, costs of chartering aircraft
from other carriers and spending on accommodations for stranded
passengers.
</P>
<P>
He expected that all grounded aircraft would be flying again in
two weeks. The problem with the Trent 700 engines that power
A330-300s has been identified and replacement will start this
week, according to the chairman.
</P>
<P>
The same engine crisis also affected another Hong Kong-based
airline, Dragonair, which grounded its four A330-300 planes.

<HEADLINE> Big UK Companies Top Pollution List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Five of Britain's largest companies
become the worst polluters by illegally releasing thousands of
tons of toxic gases and dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
ICI, Blue Circle, Castle Cement, Rhone-poulenc, and Coalite are
among the worst lawbreakers in an investigation list published by
The Sunday Times today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Meacher, the environment minister, criticized the
Environment Agency, which was set up last year to regulate
pollution in England and Wales, for failing to punish offenders
properly.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear that I expect the agency to take a tougher
line on enforcement and prosecution in the future. I have been
advised that it is doing exactly this in the ICI case," he said.
</P>
<P>
The agency's data indicate that Britain's most poisonous plant
is ICI's Merseyside chemical factory at Runcorn.
</P>
<P>
The data show that since 1995 the Runcorn plant has broken the
law 472 times, sometimes releasing toxic chemicals into
neighboring communities.
</P>
<P>
Families living near such factories are reportedly more likely
to sustain chronic respiratory illness and are at greater risk of
lung cancer and leukaemia.
</P>
<P>
Medical studies of the health of residents living in the shadow
of plants run by the ICI, Blue Circle and Castle Cement also
suggest four times the usual rate of lung cancer and asthma among
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Last month the agency summoned senior ICI executives to a
special meeting. Ronald Hampel, the ICI chairman, admitted that
his company had been at fault and he regretted the incidents.
</P>
<P>
"From time to time there are human failings. I have made the
point to our businesses that this was unacceptable," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Envoy Returns to Israel for Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
political advisor Osama al-Baz left here this morning for Israel
to continue Egypt's consultations with both the Palestinians and
Israelis to break the deadlock in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with Israeli top officials, Baz will get
acquaint with Israel's stance toward the Palestinian side's
demands to restart the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He will also convey the Israel's reply to the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Intensive Egyptian diplomatic efforts to revive the Mideast
peace process climaxed last Tuesday when Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak met with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Baz has been shuttling between the two sides since Tuesday's
summit in a bid to bring Israel and the Palestinians back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
His trip came a day after two leading Palestinian negotiators
held consultations here Saturday on Egypt's efforts to save the
peace talks that collapsed when Israel began building Har Homa, a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Local government Saeb Erekat and
senior negotiator Hassan Asfour arrived here Friday night, the
same day the Palestinian leadership, during a weekly meeting in
Ramallah, voiced welcome and support for the Egyptian bid to
reactivate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made their return to the negotiating
table conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary policy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was floating a five-point plan to persuade the two sides
to the table, which includes a temporary halt of settlement
activities in Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as the
resumption of Palestinian-Israeli security coordination.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Palestinian officials have declared their opposition
to a map reportedly being drafted by Netanyahu to give
Palestinians 40 percent of the West Bank lands in the final talks.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu denied that he has decided on any such map.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to stop the Har Homa construction and
instead proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the Jewish
housing project as well as other measures to ease the limitations
against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the severity of the two-month-old crisis, clashes
broke out Friday between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank town of Bethlehem. Two were wounded when some 500
Palestinians marched to protest the death of a Palestinian
man in Israeli custody.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Traffic violators in Iran will face
heavy fines starting from June 7, the Persian daily Akhbora reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Interior Minister Gholamhossein Bolandiyan
announced Saturday that starting from next week, drivers who have
excessive speed, violate the left lane which belongs to the
incoming traffic, pass other cars on the right, or have defective
lights will have to pay five times more fines.
</P>
<P>
He said that fines for excessive speed, unlawful passing and
violating the incoming traffic lane will be increased from 10,000
rials (3.3 U.S. dollars) to 50,000 rials (16.66 dollars) and the
fines for defective lights will increase from 500 rials (0.16
dollars) to 2,500 rials (0.83 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new measures are adopted after a recent study
sponsored by the Interior Ministry showed that the four types
of violations are major causes of accidents in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran reported an average of 36,000 traffic accidents per year,
ten times more than in other countries.
</P>
<P>
In last Iranian year (1995-96), Iran recorded 205,000
collisions for some 3 million cars. Around 5,000 people were
killed in traffic accidents.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Activists Stage Anti-Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Peace Now activists
held a rally here Saturday night against the government's hardline
policy regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators of Peace Now, one of the major Israeli peace
organizations supporting the Oslo Accords, marched from the Prime
Minister's Office to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's home in
Beit Hakerem, to mark a "year of failure" and symbolically to show
him the way to go home.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators carried placards with slogans reading: "Bibi
(the prime minister's other name) is destroying peace" and "Stop
building Har Homa," a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem
which has stalled the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks since March.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the rally accused Netanyahu of neither achieving
peace nor security since he came to power following election
victory on May 29, 1996. On the contrary, they stated, a danger of
war with Arab neighbors appears to be increasing.
</P>
<P>
When the last speaker began to address the rally, power was all
of a sudden cut off. Peace Now blamed rightwing extremists for the
outage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the major opposition Labor Party and left-wing
Meretz party are also planning to launch an anti-government
campaign, which will focus on the stalemate of the peace
process.

<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) is spending over three million US dollars on developing the
capabilities of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to prevent,
manage and resolve verious conflicts in the continent.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Alieu Sallah, UNDP resident representative to
Ethiopia and the OAU to the local press.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail today quoted Sallah as saying that the UNDP is
working with the OAU Secretariat to prepare it to deal with
occasional conflicts in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Sallah was pleased with the OAU performance in peace-keeping and
conflict prevention, though it has operated with limited resources.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has realized that conflict resolution is a responsibility
that will live with the organization for a long time, hence the move
to develop structures such as an early warning system.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is encouraged by current efforts to finalize the
protocol establishing the African Economic Community but feels its
success will be curtailed by the instability caused by conflicts,
the UNDP representative said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Banned Refrigerators Sold in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of refrigerators banned in the
"first world" because of their ozone depleting substances (ODS) are
finding their way into Zambian market, Sunday Times of Zambia reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Because of low importation costs the business is roaring in the
country, according to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) is unable to control the
importation of these ice boxes because of absence of punitive
legislation.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the newspaper shows that second hand refrigerators and
compressors mostly from European countries are on sale with prices
ranging from 200,000 Kwacha (about 150 US dollars) to 500,000 Kwacha
(about 380 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in Europe, who are just picking up the fridges from
people and shops at almost no cost at all, are making huge profits on
sale of the obsolete coolers, according to survey.
</P>
<P>
It is apparent that Africa has once again become a dumping ground
for such, a local fridge dealer complained.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted him also saying that the influx of the second
hand fridges has killed business for brand new ones which are ozone
friendly.
</P>
<P>
ODS producing refrigerators have been banned in most of the "first
world" countries which are signatories to the Vienna Convention and
Montreal Protocol signed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But a special schedule for developing countries was put in place to
slowly phase out the ODS until July 1, 1999 wheh there will be a total
ban. enditem

<HEADLINE> Africa Must Strive for Economic Unity: Salim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, Jnne 1 (Xinhua) -- African countries should put to
rest ''for good'' the notions of Afro-pessimism and work towards
economic integration as an African economic community, OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim has said.
</P>
<P>
The body, said Salim in an exclusive interview with the Sunday

to surmount them.
</P>
<P>
These challenges included the laying down of the foundation of
economic integration and of solving the problems of socio-economic
transformation in most previously war-torn African countries like
Mozambique and Angola. The issue of conflict prevention, resolution
and management was still an area that needed closer attention and
could feature prominently during the summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
''We have been involved in all African conflicts. In the past it
was considered unthinkable to discuss internal conflicts, now it's
considered unacceptable when these are discussed when the oau is not
involved,'' said the 55-year-old former tanzanian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, he said, the African leaders should
form the long-awaited African economic community and the Harare
summit was expected to ratify the formation of the AEC. Already
44 countries had ratified the transformation and ''those who have
not will do so'', he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this demonstrated the level of political commitment from
the heads of state of Africa and the expected transformation would
see Africa playing a direct role on the international scene and move
away from being followers of old bodies like the European Community.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''Africa just has to put its act together. We have to
take the issue of economic integration with the seriousness it
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
Unity within the continental body had remained one of its
strongest points, he said.
</P>
<P>
''We need the unity and solidarity as we face the new challenges
of economic integration, that of refugees, that of democratisation,
the challenges of people refusing to be marginalised. It is African
people who can put to rest those new theorists of afro-pessimism,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''in unity we have been able to achieve our political
freedom and in unity we shall be able to be a force to reckon with in
the international system.''
</P>
<P>
The OAU Secretary-General was reelected for a second term in June
1993. He was seeking reelection for his third and probably last term.
</P>
<P>
If reelected, Salim said, he would not only continue with
reforming the organisation to ensure the full use of the limited
resources but would also look at building a greater constituency for
the organisation. enditem

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Airlines Fails to Launch Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) - The Palestinian Airlines fails to
launch its first ever commercial flight scheduled today to leave
here for Al Arish, Egypt, leaving the Palestinians another
set-back in their efforts to break Israel's closure to their
territories.
</P>
<P>
The exact reasons for the cancellation, which happened as the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled for more
than two months, have not been disclosed yet.
</P>
<P>
"The indefinite postponement of the inaugural flight is due to
reasons beyond our control," director of the Palestinian Civil
Aviation Authority Fayez Zaidan told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All Palestinian Airlines flights between Al Arish and Saudi
Arabia, Cyprus, Turkey and other destinations of Egypt due to
start next month, have also been put back, the director said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know when the problems preventing us from launching
these routes will be resolved," he added.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of the flight is believed to be another
set-back in the efforts of the Palestinians to secure the autonomy
of their economy, which has lost some 1.2 billion U.S. dollars so
far due to Israel's closure of their territories.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Airlines decided earlier to launch the routes
from Al Arish, near Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip, after
Israel refused to let them open a new airport in Rafah in the
southern tip of the strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli hardline government insists on having full
control over security and checks on passengers and cargo at the
new airport, something the Palestinians refuse.
</P>
<P>
The disputes, which stem from Israel's claims of concern over
the possible smuggling of weapons and unauthorized people into
the Palestinian self-ruled areas, have held up approval for the
airport and construction of a port in Gaza City for months.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Airlines has two Fokker 50 planes donated by
the Netherlands. The planes carried Palestinian Muslims to the
annual pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, from Al Arish this year.
</P>
<P>
The Rafah airport was authorized under a 1995 autonomy accord,
and its opening is seen as a symbol of Palestinian ambitions to
sovereignty and a much-needed boost for the economic autonomy of
the territories, which now must export most of their goods via
Israel and have seen huge unemployment, decrease of income and
increasing poverty among the Palestinians due to the Israeli
closure.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Beats Australia in Hockey Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- World Cup champions Pakistan
defeated Australia to win their six-match field hockey
international series on goal aggregate in Melbourne on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistanis, showing admirable resolve, fought back from 1-0
down at halftime and the loss of Danish Kaleem, dismissed for
misconduct five minutes before the changeover, to beat Australia
3-1 in the sixth and final match of the series.
</P>
<P>
That left the series tied at three matches all, but Pakistan
claimed the series on goals scored throughout the six matches,
12-11.
</P>
<P>
In effect, Rahim Khan's 63rd minute score in Sunday's game gave
Pakistan the series.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Smith gave Australia the lead in the 32nd minute, but
Pakistan roared home, scoring three times in the second half --
Muhammad Khalid Jnr in the 38th minute, Kamran Ashraf in the 43rd
minute and Rahim Khan seven minutes from full-time.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan won the opening match of the series 3-2 in Perth on
May 21 before Australia won back-to-back games 3-2 and 2-1 in
Adelaide last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistanis levelled the series with a 3-2 victory in Sydney
last Wednesday, before Australia pulled ahead after another close
tussle 3-2 in Canberra Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will be returning to Adelaide in October for the
six-nation Champions Trophy Tournament, which also features
Atlanta Olympic champions the Netherlands, as well as Spain,
Germany, South Korea and Australia.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Stresses Need to Achieve Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos has stressed the need to establish an
independent Palestinian economy to avoid the eruption of
violence, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos made the remarks at an assembly of Arab, Druse and
Beduin local authority heads who met Saturday near Tiberias to
protest the freeze in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos noted that it was the EU's financial assistance that
had helped the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) survive in
the past years.
</P>
<P>
Due to the frequent closure on the territories by Israel for
security reasons, the fledgling Palestinian economy, which is
largely dependent on Israel, suffers tremendously as workers are
often prevented from entering Israel to work, and goods and
merchants from flowing freely.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the EU aid would not last forever, Moratinos
stressed the importance of establishing Palestinian economic
independence in order to prevent widespread violence.
</P>
<P>
"But these efforts of European Union will have an end. We
need the Palestinian National Authority to have the autonomy to
export, to import and to freely establish a real economy
intergrated between Jordan and Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos' remarks came following recent reports about the
PNA's irregularities in using the financial aid from foreign
donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, an audit report compiled by the PNA Auditing
Office revealed that 323 million U.S. dollars -- almost 40
percent of the PNA budget -- had been misused and wasted by
ministries or corrupt officials. The 1997 PNA budget is set at
866 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Council discussed the misuse of funds the
week before, accusing some officials of living far beyond their
salaries. PNA President Yasser Arafat has ordered investigation
into the financial irregularities.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Accelerate Equitization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to accelerate the
equitization process of state-owned enterprises, Vietnam News
Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The major acceleration steps to be taken by the government
include improvement of relevant laws and regulations and the
establishment of a stock market in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that equitization process of the enterprises
has proceeded "slowly" since it was initiated a decade ago. The
report attributed the reasons to people's unfamiliarity with the
concept, worries over losses, the hesitation of investors and the
unfavorable legal environment.
</P>
<P>
To date only 10 of the 150 businesses selected for pilot
equitization have completed the process, with five in Ho Chi Minh
city, the economic hub of the country.
</P>
<P>
The equitization, carried out as part of a plan to establish a
stock market in the country, is designed to attract more domestic
investment to help renovate equipment and management with the
ultimate aim of promoting economic development and boosting
business efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The report explained that unlike privatization, which means
selling all state assets to private buyers, equitization is the
transfer of part of assets via shares to workers, other businesses
and private buyers including foreigners.
</P>
<P>
In government terms, this process is called diversification of
ownership and the state holds some 30 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
Equitization has led to an annual growth rate of 56.9 percent
in turnover, 70.2 percent in profits, 98 percent in state-budget
contribution and 20 percent in employees' year-on-year incomes.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Protecting Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has found administrative and economic ways to halt the
process of rapidly-shrinking arable land.
</P>
<P>
It is trying to keep the amount of arable land lost to economic
development annually to below 14,667 hectares, to maintain a
balance in land use.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is China's oldest heavy industrial base and has a
population of 40 million, half of whom are urban residents, with
big demands for farm produce. But, a decade ago, 32,000 ha of
arable land was being lost annually, a process that would leave
almost nothing to cultivate after 100 years.
</P>
<P>
So, land administrative departments have put 333,333 ha of
farmland under protection, and do not allow any organizations to
touch it. Arable land production is estimated at 16 billion kg of
grain and enough vegetables and fruits to meet local demand.
</P>
<P>
The province also intensified wasteland reclamation over the
past decade and has recovered up 86,667 ha for farming.
</P>
<P>
The provincial People's Congress has also passed local land
laws parallel to the Law on Management of Land, which took effect
nationwide in 1986, and has set up special teams to enforce the
law.

<HEADLINE> Nateq-Nouri Re-Elected Iranian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite failure in recent
presidential election, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri was re-elected
the speaker of the 270-seat Parliament for another one-year term
with a majority of votes.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that out of 243
deputies present in the open session of the Parliament this
morning, Nateq-Nouri secured 211 votes.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Nateq-Nouri was the only candidate for
the post. In the elections for the presiding board of the
Parliament last year, Nateq-Nouri had got 146 votes.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the re-election of Nateq-Nouri as
the parliament speaker indicates that the conservatives still
dominated the parliament and the dominance will pose a severe
challenge to open-minded President-elect Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no explanation why Nateq-Nouri is
the only candidate in today's voting.
</P>
<P>
Today's English daily Iran News reported that the alliance of
left wing called the Society of Combatant Clergymen (SCC) and
pro-Rafsanjani faction called G-6 were to nominate former
interior minister Abdullah Nouri for speaker.
</P>
<P>
The conservative camp called the Association of Combatant
Clergymen (ACC) fielded Nateq-Nouri for the post of speaker.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old speaker, one of the main contenders in the
May 23 presidential elections, was defeated by his arch
contender Mohammad Khatami because he obtained only 24.9 percent
of the total votes cast in the election.

<P>
NANJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu
Province in East China, has set regulations to standardize its
rapidly-growing shipbuilding and ship repair industry.
</P>
<P>
The regulations say that those wanting to open shipbuilding or
ship repair businesses must get approval from communications
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The document also says that design, construction and reparation
of ships must comply with standards, technical requirements, and
rules of the State and certain international agreements. And ships
that fail to pass an examination can not leave the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
The document takes effect July 1, and is intended to prevent
the fast-growing industry from developing in an irregular way,
sources say.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, which is on the Yangtze River, now has 15 shipbuilders
in its townships and 45 private companies in that business.
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of regulations, problems and disputes over
quality and cost have arisen.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa with Promising Future But Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics by the United
Nations African Economic Commission show that Africa registered
an annual GDP growth of 3.9 percent last year, as against two
percent in 1994 and 2.74 percent in 1995. 1996 was the first year
when the economic growth rate of Africa surpassed its population
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, foreign trade of Africa also improved with the value
of exports increasing by 8.7 percent and the value of imports by
9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has predicted that in the coming 10 years the
African economy will continue to grow at an annual average rate
of 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a vast continent with rich human and natural
resources for exploitation. It is the only potential market left
in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Africa remains in poverty due to long-time colonial
rule in the past and the unjust and unreasonable political and
economic orders in the world. There are still unrests in some
countries in the continent, particularly in the Great Lakes
region. Outside forces are still trying to intervene in Africa's
affairs for their own interests. All these are grave hindrance to
its development.
</P>
<P>
Though African countries have made good achievements in
economic revitalization in recent years, the continent is still
far behind other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Africa's trade value accounts for only two percent of the
world's total. From 1991 to 1995, direct investment from the
outside accounted for only two percent of the world total and
five percent of the total of developing countries. It stood at
4.5 billion US Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debts of Africa grew from 328.7 billion US Dollars in
1995 to 340.5 billion US Dollars in 1996. Two thirds of the
people in the continent live in poverty. In addition, the
problems of refugees, unemployment, illiteracy and the spread of
diseases seriously restrict developments of African countries.
</P>
<P>
If it is said that the struggle in the 1960s for national
independence from colonial rule was the first wakening of Africa,
the present common drive for stability and development is the
second wakening of the continent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the imminent 33rd OAU summit will surely
further promote peace, stability and development in the
continent.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Revitalizing State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwest China
is on the road to revitalizing its stagnant state-owned sector, so
far reducing losses of the 1,454 state industrial enterprises that
have independent accounting systems by 8.13 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The state enterprises, which account for 23 percent of the
province's total industrial businesses, produced 77 percent of the
industrial profit and tax last year, thanks to improved management.
</P>
<P>
The province introduced the modern enterprise system to 32
selected state enterprises, whose net assets worth 16.95
billion yuan make up one-fifth of the province's state-invested
capital.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies such as the switch from appropriations to
loans, helped reduce the average liability-asset ratio of the
pilot enterprises from 64.2 percent to 61.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Share-holding reform is going strong in the province. And six
of its state enterprises have issued shares at the Shanghai and
Shenzhen bourses, with a total capital stock worth nearly 500
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Gansu reorganized 1,001 of its enterprises, involving 2.4
billion yuan worth of assets, and re-located 82,700 of the firms'
workers.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Walking Tractor Plant has increased its production
capacity from 100 million yuan to 500 million yuan by merging
three and half enterprises in three years, to become the largest
of its kind in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The province has allowed more autonomy to small enterprises,
and transformed 152 of them by issuing shares, being leased, or
selling at auction.

<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The 33rd summit of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) will be held in Harare, capital of
Zimbabwe, on June 2-4.
</P>
<P>
There are three major topics to be discussed at the summit,
namely, further maintenance and enhancing of peace and stability
in the continent, economic and social revitalization and
development, and election of the secretary general of the
organization for the next term.
</P>
<P>
Since the last summit, which was held early July, 1996,
political and economic developments in the continent have been
getting better in general.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the OAU and sub-regional organizations have
made their contributions to strive for and maintain stability in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
In May, OAU Secretary General Salim Ahamed Salim reiterated
that the OAU will continue all its efforts to maintain peace and
stability in Africa on the basic principle that African affairs
are settled by the Africans themselves.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Angola has been successful and
satisfactory. Liberia has embarked on the road to national
reconciliation. Major warring factions in Somalia have reached a
peace agreement. The Central African Republic has solved in a
peaceful way its political crisis resulted from a military
mutiny. And, the presidents of the Sudan and Uganda have agreed
to stop hostilities and cooperate for national development.
</P>
<P>
In the political and economic ups and downs since the end of
the cold war in the world arena, African countries have made
efforts to try to find their own ways for economic and social
developments.
</P>
<P>
They have come to a common view that the Africans should rely
mainly on themselves to build political systems in accordance
with Africa's historical and cultural traditions in the interest
of state stability and national unity so as to create a peaceful
and stable political environment for economic development.
</P>
<P>
In a comparatively suitable political and economic environment
in the continent and the world at large, African countries have
further adjusted their policies so as to attract more
investments, intensify economic cooperation and integration in
the continent and strengthen economic and trade exchanges with
the rest of the world. Their efforts have brought in success.

A memorandum against tobacco advertising along with 100,000

</P>
<P>
The memorandum, submitted by a local anti-smoking organization,

advertisement in the governmental media.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements relating to tobacco mainly are mainly carried by
state-run media in Nepal, the memorandum said, adding that the
glamorization of cigarette smoking has made a negative impact and
helped increase the number of tobacco consumers.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has more than 50,000 cancer patients among its population
of 20 million and some 80 percent of the patients are tobacco
victims, a health expert said at the program.
</P>
<P>
About 7.1 million people in Nepal above the age of 15 are
smokers and the smoking rates among men and women are 65 and 60
percent respectively, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Mainali disclosed on the occasion that steps
have been taken to discourage the habit of smoking and remove
tobacco advertisements from the governmental media.

<P>
He also promised to enhance a publicity campaign through the
official media to create people's awareness against tobacco and
offset the effect of tobacco advertisements.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Repeat Voting at 111 Polling Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented move, the
Indonesian government has acquiesced to a party's demand for a
repeat of voting at 111 polling stations on Madura Island, East
Java.
</P>
<P>
General Elections Institute Secretary-General Suryatna Subrata
said here Saturday that the voting on May 29 in the area was
disrupted due to a "security disturbance," institute officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
Suryatna did not admit it but his statement was an indirect
denial of previous reports that residents of Sampang and Pamekasan
regencies were so outraged by what they called blatant poll
rigging that they rioted, causing a great deal of destruction,
before demanding fresh polling.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, riots have broken out in several
East Java cities after preliminary election results gave the
ruling Golkar group an overwhelming lead.
</P>
<P>
After the riots, the United Development Party (PPP) demanded a
repeat of the voting.
</P>
<P>
The repeat balloting will be held on June 3 in 86 sites in
Sampang and another 35 in Pamekasan at the request of their
respective district election committee chiefs.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first repeat voting ever under President
Soeharto's New Order government, which held its first election in
1971.
</P>
<P>
Suryatna reiterated that vote-rigging allegations lodged by PPP
supporters were behind the decision to repeat the balloting.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional vote counting results announced last
night, the Golkar has won 74 percent of the vote, the PPP 23
percent and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are vying for 425 seats in the 500-member
House of Representatives. The remaining 75 seats are reserved for
the Armed Forces whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
A total of 124,740,987 people were eligible to vote in the May
29 general election, the sixth in the country since 1971.

<HEADLINE> Italian Banker Calls for Flexibility in Labor Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio
today appealed for flexibility in labor policy, saying that
Italy's high jobless rate and widespread irregularly employed
"black labor" are products of inflexible labor practices.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Italy is as high as 12.1 percent and
an estimated 2.4 million workers are irregularly employed.
</P>
<P>
The way of bringing black labor to surface is to find
incentives for flexibility in the use of labor and the wage by
deregulating rigid labor contracts, Fazio said.
</P>
<P>
Black labor is estimated to account for 8 percent of the total
work force. Irregular immigrant labor from outside the European
Union is about 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central banker said an increase in investment is also
needed to get job creation moving.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Tagging Asked to Reduce Prison Overcrowding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Italy's chief anti-mafia prosecutor
today appealed for the introduction of electronic tagging to
relieve prison overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
Piero Luigi Vigna argued that being electronically tagged is
better than being held in a 16-inmate jail cell.
</P>
<P>
"In Italy, when we talk about electronic tagging, there are
people who reply that it is worse than being in prison because it
limits freedom, as if being in a cell with 15 others was some kind
of liberty," Vigna told a conference in Florence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Italy's Prison Doctors' Association warned
of an explosive situation in the country's prisons, with more
than 50,000 inmates held in accommodation built for 32,500.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crimes Rise in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Increased crimes of
assassinations, burglaries and stickups in the first five months
have made Costa Ricans feel more insecure, according to an opinion
poll.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities noted that the higher insecurity is due to
a change in the strategy of the criminals, who now attack
videoclubs, restaurants, universities, drug stores, suppliers and
houses.
</P>
<P>
Women and old people feel most insecure because they are most
unprotected from criminal attacks, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Linnette Saborio, head of the organization of judicial
investigation, proposed to increase interpolice cooperation in
combatting organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Arms and drug smuggling, bank and business hold-ups, and car
thefts are the most common crimes in Costa Rica.

<HEADLINE> China aims to Improve Trade with Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China expects to work with
Britain's new government to enhance bilateral trade, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to discuss ways of further developing bilateral trade
and economic relations with our counterparts in the United
Kingdom," the paper quoted Hu Chusheng, a senior official from the
Foreign Trade Ministry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Sino-UK Trade and Economic co-operation Joint
Commission met for the first time in London. The commission is
intended to promote two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
It consists of three sub-groups in power, chemicals and
aerospace.
</P>
<P>
Britain was the last country in Europe to form such a
commission with China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese statistics, two-way trade grew steadily in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Sino-British trade volume increased 9.1 percent from the same
period last year to 1.15 billion US dollars in the first three
months. It helped bolster Britain's position as China's second
largest trade partner in European Union.
</P>
<P>
China's exports soared 16.8 percent to 721 million US dollars,
while imports from Britain fell 1.8 percent to 425 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume surpassed five billion US dollars for
the first time in 1996, the paper said. Trade between the two
economies has proceeded smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the largest EU investor in China. By the end of
1996, China had 1,800 British-funded enterprises, involving 11.93
billion US dollars contractual funds and 3.5 billion US dollars
actually invested.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Britain ranked third among EU countries in trade
volume with China. Bilateral trade was 5.08 billion US dollars. Of
that, China's exports were 3.2 billion US dollars and its imports
were 1.88 billion US dollars, Chinese statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Although trade volume has been growing, the volume does not
suit the economic power of the two nations, Beijing-based trade
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Britain should try to expand its technology exports to
China, they said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sets Tough Demands for Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright today warned that the United States would not ease
sanctions on Serbia unless the former Yugoslav republic improves
the situation in the volatile Kosovo and stop backing Bosnian
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
At a 90-minute meeting with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, Albright said that Serbia should also take actions in
punishing Bosnian war crimes, returning refugees and improving
political and media freedom before expecting any change in outside
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on a whirlwind tour of the three Balkan signatories
to the 1995 Dayton peace accord, said at a news conference after
the meeting that Serbia was "at a fork in the road."
</P>
<P>
If Serbia fails to meet U.S. demands, she said, "the United
States would make sure they are not part of the dynamic trend that
was taking place in Europe and that they would be left far behind."
</P>
<P>
Making clear the U.S. determination to "fully support Serbia's
efforts to build democracy and an open society," Albright said her
country will give Serbia 5 million U.S. dollars this year to
encourage the nation's democratization and independent press.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Milosevic expressed the desire to
normalize relations with the United States and sought U.S. backing
in its bid to regain its positions in the United Nations and other
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright insisted the premise is Serbia's full
observance of the U.S.-brokered Dayton pact to end the 43-month
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
"I made clear to President Milosevic that it now was up to him
if there would be steps toward normalization," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Describing her talks with Milosevic as "probably the toughest
meeting" she has had with any president, Albright said she urged
Milosevic to help bring war criminals to justice who were indicted
by the war crimes Tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told reporters after the meeting that their talks
were very open. "I am certain that we will achieve better and
better progress as regards the questions we discussed and
normalize our relations step by step," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later today Albright met representatives of Serbian opposition
parties and their media.
</P>
<P>
Albright had met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman earlier in
Zagreb and will fly to Sarajevo tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Fujian, Hong Kong Anticipate Close Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Fujian Province expects
closer co-operation with Hong Kong after China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Provincial Governor He Guoqiang, Hong Kong has
been Fujian's largest trade partner, accounting for half of the
province's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1996, trade value between Fujian and Hong Kong was
38 billion US dollars, accounting for half the province's foreign
trade volume.
</P>
<P>
In that time, Fujian imported 15 billion US dollars of goods
from Hong Kong, or 52.8 percent of its imports. It exported 22
billion US dollars of goods to Hong Kong -- 44.2 percent of its
exports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Fujian had approved 12,600 projects
funded by Hong Kong investors. The contracted value was 27.1
billion US dollars, 60 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been the spring-board for Taiwan business people
who look for investment opportunities in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
About half the tourists visiting the province each year are
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The steady growth of bilateral trade has supported Hong Kong's
foreign trade and shipping industry.

<HEADLINE> Scalfaro Says Secession Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
said today that Italy is indivisible and secession is
constitutionally banned.
</P>
<P>
His remarks are made in response to the secession calls of the
separatist Northern League party and its outspoken leader Umberto
Bossi.
</P>
<P>
"Secession is, according to our constitution, a
constitutionally illegal act," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1948 Constitution states that Italy is one and
indivisible.
</P>
<P>
The president said he agreed to talks of autonomy and
federalism, but not secession.
</P>
<P>
The Northern League switched to separatism from federalism last
year after it failed to win the balance of power in parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it even held a symbolic declaration of independence
for "Padania", a name Bossi has given to his nebulous state which
has no recognized powers, institutions or borders.

<HEADLINE> Overseas RMB Banks to Pay Income, Business Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks will be subject to
national taxation treatment when they deal in local currency, but
they will continue to be eligible for tax incentives for their
foreign currency operations, reported today's China Daily
(Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a Ministry of Finance official as saying that
like domestic banks, foreign banks selected for the renminbi pilot
must pay 33 percent income tax and eight percent business tax.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, favorable tax treatment for overseas banks' foreign
currency business remains unchanged; they continue to pay a 15
percent income tax and are exempt from the business tax for five
years.
</P>
<P>
"The move aims to standardize the tax system, unify taxation
policies and promote fair play on the financial market," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
It is practical to give foreign banks different tax treatment
because they are required to set distinct accounts for their yuan
and foreign currency businesses.
</P>
<P>
The separate tax treatment provides a way to continue tax
incentives as well as bring foreign banks in line with domestic
banks, moving forward the unification of China's tax policies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, foreign financial institutions grew quickly in
China. by the end of 1996, foreign companies had 156 operational
financial institutions for foreign currency businesses in 17
cities.
</P>
<P>
With the nation's deepened reforms and winder opening, more
foreign banks are eager to gain licences to deal in renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Nine foreign-funded banks have been approved to operate in yuan
in Shanghai"s Pudong New Area.

<HEADLINE> Treaty Marks Normalization of Russia-Ukraine Ties: Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Ukraine are normalizing
relations by signing the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and
Partnership, says a joint declaration issued today by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
The treaty signed today in Kiev would put the bilateral
relations on a sound footing, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents emphasized that Russia and Ukraine should shape
their relationship on the principle of equality, mutual respect to
each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, said the
document.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised Ukraine for becoming a non-nuclear nation, and
restated that Moscow will ensure Ukraine's safety according to an
agreement signed by the United States, Russia and Ukraine on
January 14, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under that agreement, the United States and Russia would
guarantee Ukraine's security because the former Soviet republic
pledged to give up its nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kuchma warmly applauded the efforts of both
countries in resolving the dispute over the division of the Black
Sea Fleet. The resolution to the Black Sea Fleet is the key to the
normalization of relations between Russia and Ukraine, the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries had been standoffish as
both claimed the fleet and its main base Sevastopol after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
After two years of quarreling, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin came to Kiev Wednesday and signed three agreements on
the division of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The issue was finally settled with Moscow officially
recognizing Sevastopol as Ukrainian territory and leasing the
naval base for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents expressed their satisfaction with the
arrangement of the fleet issue, saying it will fortify regional
security.
</P>
<P>
The two countries vowed to cooperate in international
affairs. Both sides stressed the importance of strengthening the
role of the United Nations and stood for the establishment of a
common European security package for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to develop close political, economic and
social relations between members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the joint declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kuchma also hoped to expand economic links between
the two countries. They vowed to implement the free trade accord
between them.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents have plans to encourage mutual investment,
construct cross-border transport routes, establish trans-national
consortia and expand cooperation on the space industry,
agriculture and nuclear energy, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the treaty left no problems whatsoever for the
future ties between the two countries as it covered cooperation in
almost all aspects.
</P>
<P>
However, the treaty doesn't mean that Moscow and Kiev can
foresee a period of honeymoon after Yeltsin returns to the Kremlin
from Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Although the treaty said neither side should sign any treaty
against the other side with a third party and neither side should
allow its territory to be used to threaten the security of the
other side, they hold contrary views on relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russia openly opposes NATO's eastward expansion while Ukraine
believes that an enlarged NATO will harm no one, but create a more
stable Europe.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the difference would last for some
time.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Gen.
Chettha Thanajaro has called for talks between Thailand and
Myanmar to solve their dispute over an islet on their border.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between Thailand and Myanmar could be
avoided if both sides agreed to consult each other over border
issues affecting them, the local press today quoted Chettha as
saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said the latest dispute over Myanmar's dredging of the
Moei River would have been unlikely to occur if both sides had
held talks to clear up the matter first.
</P>
<P>
An islet has been created in the Moei River, which forms the
border between the two countries, because of a change in the
river's course, forcing the river further into Myanmar's land. And
Myanmar was reportedly dredging the river in an effort to restore
the river to its original position.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said Thailand and Myanmar, both of which consider the
banks of the Moei River their border lines, should consult with
each other if any side wanted to do anything beyond the river
bank.
</P>
<P>
he said there would be no further border problem if both sides
followed the proposed rule.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said he would soon seek a meeting with Myanmar Army
Commander-in-Chief Gen. Maung Aye to create more understanding on
border problems.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Iodized Salt Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government set to build
more than 100 iodized salt production sites nationwide and finally
form an overall production capacity of eight million tons in an
effort to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) in the
country by 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's State Planning Commission has approved the iodized salt
project last November, which was estimated to cost 980 million
yuan, including a loan of 27 million US dollars provided by the
World Bank, a loan of 190 million yuan from China's State
Development Bank, and 190 million yuan paid by local salt
administrations.
</P>
<P>
According to Dong Zhihua, general manager of China Salt
Corporation, the year 1997 is of pivotal importance for the
project. All salt administrations nationwide are required to speed
up the implementation of the project and the salt monopoly.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with high occurrence of IDD. According to
officials with the Ministry of Health, some 450 million Chinese
people live in iodine-deficiency areas, taking more than 40 percent
of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10.17 millions mentally-retarded people in China, around
80 percent are victims of iodine-deficiency. Some six million
infants are born in China's iodine-deficiency regions a year, of

</P>
<P>
Early in 1994, the Chinese government has approved regulations
to eliminate IDD before 2000 and set concrete targets in the
regard. The legal document promulgated that not only all edible
salt must be iodized, but also all salt used by food processing
and animal husbandry should be iodized.
</P>
<P>
China Salt Corporation is empowered to issue licenses on
production, wholesales and transport of all edible
salt. Non-iodized salt sellers should be punished in accordance
with the same rules on counterfeit drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
Data from China Salt Corporation indicated that China last year
produced 6.06 million tons of iodized salt.

<HEADLINE> MFN Status Should Become Permanent, Says Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese trade official has
urged the United States to clear hurdles over most favored nation
(MFN) status to provide a permanent anchor to growing business
contacts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported Chinese Vice-foreign Trade
Minister Sun Zhenyu as saying that the United States should
encourage bilateral trade and investment by permanently settling
the MFN issue.
</P>
<P>
Washington reviews MFN status annually, casting a pall of
uncertainty over the prospect of Sino-US business.
</P>
<P>
"China has mutual unconditional MFN arrangements with all
trading partners that have trade agreements with it except the
United States which, proceeding from its domestic law, has
insisted on the annual review," Sun said, "It goes against the
interests of both countries."
</P>
<P>
Sun said MFN was essentially a basic, normal treatment between
any two trading partners. "It should not be mistaken as an
one-sided arrangement."
</P>
<P>
"The cancellation of MFN is a double-edged sword that hurts not
only China, but US middle-and lower-income consumers, as well as
US investors in China."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will be hurt as a free trade and world financial
center, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted the US had become China's second largest trading
partner by 1996 with a bilateral trade volume of 42.8 billion US
dollars. US direct investment in China amounted to 14 billion US
dollars and involved more than 20,000 projects. This made the
United States the second largest foreign investor in China.
</P>
<P>
"If the US provides permanent MFN and further relaxes tech
export control to China, Sino-US economic co-operation will go
forward,"Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's total import from 1997 to 2000 would surpass
700 billion US dollars, creating a huge market for foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
"For construction in energy, transportation and
telecommunications, we need to purchase at least 100 billion US
dollars of technology and equipment each year (until 2000)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome US businesses to compete in the Chinese market," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warship to Be Salvaged in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China has begun salvage work of a
cruiser named "Zhiyuan," which was attacked by Japanese bombers
and sank in the Yellow Sea of northern China at the end of the
last century.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held recently on Dalu Island in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, marking the beginning of the
preparatory work for raising the sunken warship.
</P>
<P>
During the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), launched by Japan
to invade China, the Chinese navy of the imperial Qing government
suffered heavy losses, including the sinking in the Yellow Sea of
four warships bought from western countries.
</P>
<P>
Captain Deng Shichang, who went down with the Zhiyuan, has
become a household name in China over the past 100 years, and his
story was the subject of a popular film.
</P>
<P>
The province has conducted a series of maritime surveys on the
sunken cruiser, which reportedly rests on the bed of the sea 16.9
kilometers southwest from Dalu Island.
</P>
<P>
The warship suffers from heavy rust damage, and has accumulated
large amounts of sand, according to the China State Shipbuilding
Corporation, which is responsible for the salvage project.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a hard nut because the salvage work can only be
carried out from May to August," said a representative from the
corporation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Lift Embargo to Ecuadoran Shrimp Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States decided to lift the
embargo to the imports of shrimp from Ecuador, the U.S. embassy
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State determined that Ecuador is really
trying to guarantee the life of marine turtles in danger of
extinction during the capture of shrimp, said the embassy in a
communique.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Department of State was based on the recent
inspections made to Ecuadoran shrimping boats.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran authorities said Wednesday they were confident
the U.S. shrimp embargo would be lifted from June 1.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed the embargo May 1 considering that
the Ecuadoran shrimping boats did not used adequately the devices
to release the turtles during the capture of shrimp.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy said that the U.S. government had
congratulated the Ecuadoran Foreign Trade Ministry for having
shrimpers use the devices that protect the turtles.
</P>
<P>
The shrimp embargo caused Ecuadoran shrimpers losses of up to
5 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Campaign Launched in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's Social Security Fund
(CCSS) and Education Ministry will launch an anti-smoking campaign
in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is designed to counteract the cigarette producers'
publicity promoting tobacco consumption among young people,
announced the Costa Rican authorities today.
</P>
<P>
Cigarrette producers spend 1.24 million U.S. dollars a year on
cigarette publicity in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
CCSS medical administrator Julieta Rodriguez said that
cigarette producers have developed an aggressive plan to conquer
the younger population.
</P>
<P>
She noted that selling cigarettes with an allegedly low content
of nicotine and tar is another way to attract more consumers.
</P>
<P>
The two institutions will develop an education program and
publish an publication titled "Tobacco, the Epidemic of the 21st
Century" to educate all the students, said the government official.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Institute for Alcoholism and
Pharmaco-Dependency, 35 percent of Costa Ricans from 12 to 70
years old have smoking habit and many of them started smoking
before 16.
</P>
<P>
The CCSS spends 3.25 million dollars a year to treat
smoking-related illnesses including cancers. enditem

<HEADLINE> Liu Yong and Ge Fei Starts Chinese Gold Rush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yong and Ge Fei
started a Chinese gold rush when they won the mixed doubles of the
world badminton championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sudirman Cup winner China also has two more gold medals
ensured, with a possible fourth in the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Liu and Ge, both 21 years old, beat Denmark's Jens Erikson and
Marlene Thomsen 15-5, 16-17 and 15-4 in the final.
</P>
<P>
They said they had not expected to win the world title, but had
much confidence before the championships.
</P>
<P>
"But we were too eager to win that last point when we led 14-12
in the second game. In the third game we lowered our expectation
and fought point by point," Ge said after the match.
</P>
<P>
Ge, who will team up with Gu Jun in the women's doubles
semifinals against another Chinese pair, is the only shuttler who
has the hope to win two golds here.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, China's Sun Jun vanquished 31-year-old
Denmark's Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen 15-7, 14-17,
15-9 to meet another Dane Peter Rasmussen in the final.
</P>
<P>
Sun, the former world junior champion, said he knew he could
win even before the match began.
</P>
<P>
"I expected to win. I held a 2-1 record over him before the
match and I knew I could win."
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, who never beat Arbi in the past four encounters
since 1995, rallied from one set down to gain a 9-15, 15-9 and
15-2 victory in 76 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Actually I didn't expect to win. His attacks are very
good... I just played relaxed. If you are too tense, you cannot
play your normal game," said Rasmussen after the match.
</P>
<P>
In two Chinese-only women's singles semi-finals, defending
champion Ye Zhaoying beat Wang Chen to meet compatriot Gong
Zhichao, who defeated teammate Han Jingna.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's final will be the second time in two months after All
England Open that Ye meets Gong, who sailed into the semi-final
here by beating Indonesian badminton queen Susi Susanti.
</P>
<P>
In women's doubles semi-finals, China's Tang Yongshu and Qin
Yiyuan ousted second seed Rosiana Zelin and Eliza 11-15, 15-11 and
15-9.
</P>
<P>
They will meet world number one pair Ge Fei and Gu Jun, who
defeated fellow countrywomen Qian Hong and Liu Lu 15-3, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
In a rematch of the Olympic men's doubles final, Yap Kim Hock
and Cheah Soon Kit of Malaysia took sweet revenge by winning
against Olympic champions Rexy Mainaky and Ricky Subagja 15-9,
2-15, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
The only Indonesian hope for a medal here is Budiarto Sigit and
Candra Wijaya, who in turn evaporized South Korean's only medal
hope Lee Dong Soo and Yoo Yong Sung with a 15-11, 15-11 victory in
the other men's doubles semi-final.

<P>
CARACAS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The basket price of crude oils and
byproducts of Venezuela at the close of the week indicates a 45
cent drop compared to that of last week, according to data from
the Energy and Mines Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the price was due to a growing offer of crudes
and byproducts in the internatinal market, especially from the
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which increased production by 400,000 barrels a day,
in comparison to the month of march.
</P>

The OPEC basket price was quoted at 19.01 dollars per barrel at

<HEADLINE> Georgia Has No Plan to Join NATO: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Foreign Minister Irakly
Menagarishvili said today that his country has no plan to apply
for NATO membership soon but welcomes a closer cooperation with
the western alliance.
</P>
<P>
While dismissing the prospects that Georgia would consider a
bid for NATO membership in the near future, Menagarishvili told
reporters that the Georgian leadership places emphasis on
developing ties with the 16-nation bloc under its Partnership for
Peace Program.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Georgian leaders repeatedly said that the enlargement
of the Council of Europe was more important than NATO's eastward
expansion, because the 37-nation council plays a greater role in
guaranteeing stability and fostering economic development in the
outer Caucasian nations.
</P>
<P>
Georgia, a former Soviet Republic on the Black Sea between
Russia and Turkey, joined the Partnership for Peace Program in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Krajicek Storms Out in French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek
joined the lengthy list of men's seeded casualties when Patrick
Rafter and Mark Woodforde ensured the best Australian showing at
the French Open since 1969 here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter enjoyed a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 success over Krajicek, a
result which left the Dutch sixth seed so gisgusted he refused to
appear for his post-match press conference and was fined 2,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Woodforde, ranked 79 in the world, than guaranteed an
all-Australian fourth round meeting with a convincing 6-4, 7-6,
6-3 victory over 11th seed Albert Costa.
</P>
<P>
With their respective victories, Rafter and Woodforde joined
compatriot Mark Philippoussis among 10 unseeded names in the last
16.
</P>
<P>
Although moody Chilean Marcelo Rios, seeded seventh, steamed
past Arnaud Boetsch in straight sets, the presence of just six
seeds in the last 16, one short of the record low set in 1994,
suggests the title is as wide open as many predicted beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Those, however, who felt the men's event would almost certainly
be an all-Spanish affair have been proved dramatically wrong.
</P>
<P>
Neither Woodforde or Philippoussis have ever progressed this
far in Paris and there has not been an Australian in the
quarter-finals for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
But after a week of constant sunshine, the red Parisian clay is
playing faster than normal and, of the foremost claycourt experts,
only Rios and the Spanish duo of Alex Corretja and Sergi Bruguera
remain.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov is still lurking in the
top half of the draw but the most significant fourth round
encounter in the bottom half looks set to be the showdown between
former champions Michael Chang and Bruguera.
</P>
<P>
Chang disposed of his third successive French opponent when
Stephane Simian retired with a groin strain at 5-2 in the second
set, and looks in an increasingly determined mood.
</P>
<P>
South African 13th seed Wayne Ferreira did not even make it on
court for his third round match against Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira twisted an ankle in practice on Friday, allowing Korda
to book his first French Open fourth round berth since reaching
the final in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The top women were all involved in a succession of mis-matches
as they progressed to the last 16 without dropping a set or, in
some cases, breaking into a sweat.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis, the women's world number one, was arguably the
most impressive, flattening her teenage rival Anna Kournikova 6-1,
6-3 to maintain her unbeaten record this year.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova was powerless against the variety of Hingis's
strokes, holding out for only 42 minutes in what had been billed
as a showdown between two potential champions of the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will be back in action on Sunday against 16th seed
Barbara Paulus of Austria while Monica Seles is due to face Mary
Pierce, the sole French survivor.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who beat Dominique Van
Roost of Belgium, meets Natasha Zvereva who downed 14th seed
Brenda Schultz-McCarthy 7-6, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Sun Jun Upsets Hoyer-Larsen to Enter Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Sun Jun beat
Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen here on Saturday to sail
into the world badminton championships men's singles final.
</P>
<P>
The former world junior champion sprinted to a 10-0 lead before
winning the first game 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, a left-hander who beat Sun at Swiss Open in three
sets this March, staged a comeback to win the second game 17-14.
</P>
<P>
A more lively Sun was never behind in the deciding game and
spurted to a 14-9 lead before Hoyer-Larsen returned a backhand
clear beyond the boundary line to concede loss.
</P>
<P>
"I expected to win today. I know I should win because I hold a
2-1 record against Hoyer-Larsen before this match," said Sun after
the 82-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen said, "Sun had fantastic defence today... The
reason that I lost was Sun got the first set too easy. I made
mistakes I should not do."
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, 31, said he still wanted to play the next world
championships to be staged in Copenhagen, the Netherlands, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"My major target now in the future will be to compete in 1999,"
said two-time All England Open champion.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, Sun will take on another Dane Peter
Rasmussen, who downed defending champion Heryanto Arbi of
Indonesia in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, who never beat Arbi in the past four encounters
since 1995, rallied from one set down to gain a 9-15, 15-9 and
15-2 victory in 76 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Actually I didn't expect to win. His attacks are very
good... I just played relaxed. If you are too tense, you cannot
play your normal game," said Rasmussen after the match.
</P>
<P>
"I just take it easy and enjoy playing badminton," he added.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Sets World Best in Two Miles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia set
a two miles world best of eight minutes 1.08 seconds at an
international meet in Hengelo, Netherlands on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian took nearly two-and-a-half seconds off the mark
of 8:03.54 set by Deniel Komen of Kenya in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite setting the new world mark, Gebrselassie missed out on
a one million U.S. dollar payout, leaving the Fanny Blankers Koen
Stadium without a cent for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
A one million dollar cheque was on offer if any runner in the
race, built up as a head-to-head clash between Gebrselassie and
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, broke the eight-minute barrier.
</P>
<P>
Philip Mosima of Kenya was second in the two-mile race in
8:14.45 and Mohammed Mourit of Belgium third in 8:14.88.
</P>
<P>
Morceli dropped out at the start of the final lap, clutching
his left thigh and later complained of having suffered badly from
jet lag after his return from high altitude training in the United
States four days ago.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the remainder of the meeting was the 1,500
meters in which Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran 3:29.51, the
fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
Assefa Mezgebu of Ethiopia, a training partner of Gebrselassie,
showed shades of his compatriot's ability by winning the 10,000
meters in 27:25.01. He took nearly 40 seconds off his previous
best for the distance.
</P>
<P>
Kim Batten of the United States, the world champion and holder
of the world best in the women's 400 meters hurdles, won her
specialist event in 54.41. She was first to rise from the gun and
finished well clear of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Lydia Cheromei of Kenya was an equally impressive winner of the
women's 3,000 meters. The former world junior cross country
champion clocked 8:38.86, the fastest time in the world this
year.
