<HEADLINE> China Planning On Cleaning Up Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China plans to improve the
environmental quality of the Bohai Bay in the north in ten years
and to finish cleaning it in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy-director of the Environmental Protection
Administration, Zhu Guangyao, told a conference on marine
environmental protection here today that they will focus on land
polluters, major sea areas, and the mouths of river and will have
strict controls on the emission of certain pollutants like
nitrogen and phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
Laizhou, Bohai, and Liaodong bays, the sea area around 13 major
cities, and the mouths of the Liaohe, Haihe and Yellow rivers are
included in the state anti-pollution plan.
</P>
<P>
China plans to make all factories, ships, and other polluters
in the area meet emission standards by the year 2005 to stop the
deterioration of the marine and the terrestrial ecology.
</P>
<P>
They expect to improve the area's environmental quality and
ecosystem by the year 2010 and to clean the sea by the year 2030,
Zhu says.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Bay has a 77,000-sq km area. Because of rapid
economic growth along the coast, and the narrow bay mouth,
pollution problems have become even more serious. Some 2.8 billion
tons of industrial waste sewage and more than 700,000 tons of
various kinds of pollutants are discharged into it each year,
damaging fishery resources, causing marine disasters, and even
threatening the health of humans.
</P>
<P>
A technical group will be formed for the cleaning project.

<HEADLINE> Four Kidnapped Foreigners Found Killed in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The bodies of three Britons and
a New Zealander kidnapped in Chechnya in October were found near
the Russian republic's border, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be the first killing of foreign hostages in
Chechnya. All other foreigners have been released following
lengthy talks and, possibly, the payment of ransoms.
</P>
<P>
British citizens Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf
Petschi and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, who were installing a
cellular telephone system under a contract with a privately owned
Chechen phone company, Chechentelekom, were kidnapped on October 3
in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were decapitated, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov blamed the murders on outside forces vying for
influence over the Caucasus and their henchmen in Chechnya, lured
by the large sums of money paid to them.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway republic has been plagued by abductions in recent
years. Kidnap victims included federal government officials,
ordinary residents and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said in
November that some 700 people were being kept hostage in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Organized criminal groups have distributed profitable
operations, some doing kidnapping, others whisking hostages away
while still others "providing maintenance, medical service and
food", Rushailo said.

KUNMING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Second International
Seminar on Flora Resources opened today in the capital of China's
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from China, Britain, the United States and seven
Asian countries are attending the seminar to discuss research and
development in flora resources, nature protection, flora
diversification, and forest and environment regulations.
</P>
<P>
Flora diversification was understood by people in the distant
past, the scientists pointed out, but it has been damaged severely
by increasing human activities and the destruction of forests in
recent decades.
</P>
<P>
East and Southeast Asia have some of the richest flora
resources, the scientists said and asked the whole world to make
an effort in environmental protection and developing flora
resources.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Kunming Plant Research Institute. The first seminar of this kind
was held in the city ten years ago.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Right to Development, A Must in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- As the world is marking
the 50th anniversary this week of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, it should be further stressed once again that the
right to development should remain fundamental in realizing all
other human rights, especially in the current age of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"The right to development is the measure of the respect of all
other human rights. That should be our aim: a situation in which
all individuals are enabled to maximize their potential, and to
contribute to the evolution of society as a whole," U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said.
</P>
<P>
The right to development was first proclaimed as an inalienable
human right by the international community in 1986, following
years of debate. The Declaration on the Right to Development,
adopted that year by the United Nations General Assembly,
represented a new approach to the pursuit of the ideals of the
world body.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration says, "The human person is the central subject
of development and should be the participant and beneficiary of
the right to development." It further states that "The full
realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of
economic, social and cultural right is impossible."
</P>
<P>
Although everyone agrees that the goal of development is
economic progress and the creation of conditions to ensure a life
of dignity, debate continues on how to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
This is especially true in today's world of rapid globalization
where levels of official development assistance (ODA) are dropping
and private capital flows are increasing to certain parts of the
world to the exclusion of others.
</P>
<P>
While the globalization of the world economy has provided new
opportunities for development, it has also created new risks.
There is a risk of marginalization of countries, groups and
individuals that are unable to compete, as well as the increased
possibility of economic or financial instability and social
discontent.
</P>
<P>
At the July 1998 session of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council, Alioune Sene, former chairman of the Working Group on the
Right to Development which was set up by the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights in 1981, called for emergency measures to prevent the
exclusion of developing countries, especially least-developed
countries, from the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that each country needed to elaborate a policy
of development that was centered around the human rights.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics show that the greatest benefits of
globalization have been garnered by a fortunate few. The world's
least developed countries, with 10 percent of the world's people,
have only 0.3 percent of world trade -- half their share of two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Further worse, the terms of trade are not favorable. Average
tariffs on industrial country imports from the least-developed
countries are 30 percent higher than the global average.
</P>
<P>
Overall, developing countries lose about 60 billion U.S.
dollars a year from agricultural subsidies and barriers to textile
exports in industrial nations. Also, more than half of all
developing countries have been bypassed by foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. figures, 1.5 billion people must get by on
less than one U.S. dollar a day. In South Asia, half of all
children under 5 are malnourished. Only a third of the people in
sub-Saharan Africa are likely to live past 40.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the time has come to move from a theoretical
debate to practical measures aimed at the realization of the right
to development. Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for
human rights, has said, "Human rights bring to the development
discussion a unifying set of standards -- a common references for
setting objectives and assessing the value of action."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, a January 1998 policy document of the U.N.
Development Program (UNDP) was worth a warm welcome. It outlines
plans to integrate human rights into activities aimed at fighting
poverty, promoting the advancement of women, protecting the
environment and developing the capacity for good governance.
</P>
<P>
Through its work, the 185-member United Nations continues to
call the world's attention to the problems, and presents avenues
for answers. As a result, there is an emerging consensus that all
countries and all major international economic and financial
agencies should engage more seriously in efforts to formulate
better policies towards globalization to ensure that the gap
between the rich and poor stops growing.
</P>
<P>
To be more specific, poor countries must first rely on
themselves for development. In other words, they must invest in
human development.
</P>
<P>
However, they, on the other hand, also need special support
from the international community -- through concessional
assistance, debt relief, trade preferences, technical cooperation
and national capacity-building -- if they are to make their way in
the fiercely competitive global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the main theme of our times. The
global problem needs global solution. Therefore, developed
countries should bear their responsibility to help their
developing counterparts. By doing so, the world can do a lot to
prevent many conflicts based on poverty, discrimination and
exclusion that continue to plague humanity and destroy decades of
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance from the developed world, the vicious cycle
of human rights violations that lead to conflicts, which in turn
lead to more violations, can stand more chance to be broken. For
it has been vindicating that without the right to development by
the developing countries, there will be no peace and stability in
the world, which, characterized by greater inter-dependence among
countries, will surely have negative impact on the economic
expansion of the developed world.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T to Buy Network Business from IBM for $5 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. communications giant AT&AMP;T
and big computer maker IBM announced on Tuesday that AT&AMP;T will
acquire IBM's Global Network business for 5 billion U.S. dollars
in cash.
</P>
<P>
The move will enhance AT&AMP;T's ability to supply its customers
with high speed data services and Internet access and will
increase its revenue, with an estimated additional 2.5 billion
dollars in the first full year of operation.
</P>
<P>
The network enables users to link computers in different
places of the world to accept orders from customers and to connect
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will enable AT&AMP;T to compete more effectively
with strong rivals for the provision of global managed data
network services, said AT&AMP;T chairman and CEO Michael Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
IBM's network business has one million Internet users and
business customers in many countries.
</P>
<P>
IBM, which will focus on computer services, said this
transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on the
company's 1999 operational results.
</P>
<P>
The two companies expect the acquisition to be completed by
mid-1999, following clearance by U.S. regulators and certain
regulatory authorities abroad.
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed to another deal which allows IBM to manage
AT&AMP;T's computers in long-distance business customer services for 4
billion dollars over 10 years, and allows AT&AMP;T to run the network
enabling IBM customers to transmit data with a 5 billion dollars
revenue over five years.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Face Challenge: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries face
numerous constraints that threaten their survival as independent
nations, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his wide-ranging speech at the on-going eighth assembly of
the World Council of Churches (WCC) in Harare, Mugabe said one
such constraint was the unequal allocation of resources,
primarily land.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,000 white commercial farmers in Zimbabwe held
half of the arable land while about 11 million Zimbabweans were
in the other half.
</P>
<P>
It was not unusual to find individuals owning four to six big
farms amounting to several thousands of hectares when black
communal families toil on allotments of not more than five acres
each, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, it was not fair to label the
country unjust when it demanded land reform or accused him of
"larceny, tyranny, brutality and racism" because of the land
issue.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries also face the debt burden, unequal terms
of trade and depressed commodity prices...all these are wrecking
their economies, said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Africa, he said: "We face conflict situations in
Somalia, Guinea Bissau, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan,
Rwanda and Burundi. We have also an inter-state conflict
situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Zimbabwe will continue to work for peace on
this continent.

<HEADLINE> ADB Offers Loan to Nepal for Betterment of Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) Tuesday approved a loan of 20 million U.S. dollars to assist
the Nepali government in promoting the socio-economic status and
employment of rural women, the bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Rural Microfinance Project, for which the loan has been
approved, will provide a revolving line of credit of 16.5 million
dollars to finance viable farm and off-farm economic activities
for the rural population, the majority of them poor women, in some
26 of the 75 districts in Nepal, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The project will also support a program for assessing and
identifying local investment opportunities for women, mobilizing
women and improving their skills and capabilities, supporting
their access to markets and providing financial services," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that under the project, about 270,000 potential
borrowers, mostly women, will receive training on social
awareness, empowerment of women, selection of women's economic
activities, control by women over their financial resources and
basic bookkeeping and accounting.
</P>
<P>
It said that the loan of 20 million dollars is interest-free
and repayable within 40 years including a grace period of 10
years. The loan carries a service charge of one percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The project, which costs a total of 30.6 million dollars, is
expected to be implemented in early 1999 and completed by December
2004, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it has been providing some 205 million
dollars assistance to the Nepali government for developing the
rural finance sector since 1970 under various programs.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Coordinate OAU Mission to Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would
coordinate a fact-finding mission of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to the Comoros from December 9 to 11, the South
African Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was consistent with the mandate it received as
coordinator of the regional contact group on the Comoros at the
OAU summit in Burkina Faso in June this year, the ministry said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The OAU mission would include one representative each from the
governments of South Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Following the clashes by secessionists on the Comoro island of
Anjouan, which led to several deaths over the weekend, the
mission would visit Grande Comoros under the auspices of the
OAU's mechanism for conflict prevention, management and
resolution.
</P>
<P>
It would then make recommendations for consideration at the
summit of the organization's central organ in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, on December 17, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"Since the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared unilateral
independence from the Federal Islamic Republic of The Comoros in
August last year, the OAU has consistently urged all parties to
resolve their dispute peacefully and it has also reaffirmed the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Comoran
archipelago," it said.
</P>
<P>
A war broke out Saturday after supporters of self-styled
Anjouan "prime minister" Abdou Mohamed tried to assassinate
"president" Abdallah Ibraham, who reportedly wanted to rejoin the
federal Comoro state.
</P>
<P>
The OAU had a small military observer mission on the islands
of Grande Comoros and Moheli for the past year, the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks Truth Behind Hostages Death in Chechenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom government
pledged on Tuesday to find out what had happened to the three
British hostages reported dead in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We need to know... what is being done to bring to justice
those who committed such repugnant murders," Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Chechenya, a breakaway republic in Russia, had
said earlier that the three bodies found by a road near the
Chechen border were those of British hostages.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the British government was still seeking
confirmation. But he admitted at the same time it was almost
certain that they belong to the three British men who were
captured by unknown gunmen on October 3 in the Chechen capital
city of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, three Britons and one New Zealander, were working
for a British telecommunications firm when they were captured. The
firm issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that it had been in
contact with the kidnappers and had received confirmation last
week that the hostages were still alive.

<HEADLINE> New Talks on Sudan to Be Held in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A new round of talks between
the Sudanese government and the Sudanese People's Liberation
Movement (SPLM) is scheduled to be held in Nairobi, Kenya in
January next year, Sudanese Foreign Minister Gabriel Roric Jur
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Gabriel Roric Jur, who is attending the eighth World
Council of Churches Assembly in Harare, told a press conference
that the talks would be in line with the Addis Ababa ceasefire
agreement signed in early August.
</P>
<P>
The fragile ceasefire agreement, broken several times,
stipulated that the two parties meet after six months to iron out
any outstanding issues toward a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to meeting in January in Nairobi on
points that were not agreed on in Addis Ababa," said Roric Jur.
</P>
<P>
SPLM leader John Garang has been fighting the predominantly
Islamic government since 1955. The war has caused the death and
displacement of millions of people as successive governments fail
to reach a lasting solution with the SPLM.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Surprises and "black horses"
are the themes at the Hua Mark Sports Center shooting range when
unheralded shooters from central Asian nations won the day's two
individual titles.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's Dina Aspandiyarova took the women's air pistol
gold while Turkmenistan's Igor Pirekeev won the men's free rifle
prone.
</P>
<P>
"I am not satisfied with my result," said Aspandiyarova after

Wang Lina in Beijing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chinese shooters carried home the silver and bronze medals,
with Cai Yeqing notching 486.0 points and Ren Jie registering

their own Asian record of 1,138. Kazakhstan was second at 1,148
while South Korea third at 1,133.
</P>
<P>
In men's rifle prone, Pirekeev scored 104.2 points in the final
for a total of 697.2 points to grab his first international title.
</P>
<P>
Pirekeev, an Atlanta Olympian who registered 593 points to top
the qualification here, produced stable performance to lead all
the way to the title in the final.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Tavarit Majcharcheep won the silver medal with 693.3
points, followed by Japan's bronze medalist Naoki Kurita at 691.1.
</P>
<P>
In the team event, Majcharcheep, Nopparat Yavilaspradit and

Thailand its second shooting gold following Monday's victory in
women's air rifle.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan carried home the silver medal with 1,752 points,
only 1 point ahead of China, who won the bronze at 1,751.
</P>
<P>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The head of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Tuesday congratulated
the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) on winning
the 1998 Right Livelihood Award.
</P>
<P>
IBFAN is an international network of over 140 public
interest groups in 70 developing and industrialized nations. Its
members work closely with UNICEF and other United Nations
agencies to improve infant health and nutrition through the
promotion of breastfeeding and the elimination of inappropriate
marketing of infant food, bottles and teats.
</P>
<P>
The award was announced by the Right Livelihood Foundation
and the presentation will take place at a ceremony in the
Swedish Parliament in Stockholm on December 9, 1998.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's Executive Director, Carol Bellamy, said that
IBFAN's untiring efforts in the promotion, protection and
support of breastfeeding had been an important contribution to
infant and young child health and survival.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the organiztion's constant monitoring of
company compliance with the International Code of Marketing of
Breastmilk Substitutes indicated that much remained to be done
to protect parents and health professionals from commercial
pressures to feed infants artificially.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Sino-British Relation Getting Much </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Tuesday that Britain and China have established a new
relationship not only on economic but also on political level.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the remarks at the conference entitled "China and
Britain: Grasping The Opportunity" organized by China-Britain
Business Council.
</P>
<P>
On his successful visit to China in October, Blair said,
although he was only able to visit Beijing, Shanghai and Hongkong,
he was "tremendously impressed" by the visible evidence of China's
rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future of bilateral relationship, Blair said:
"Britain and China can both take satisfaction over the successful
handover of Hongkong. We can now build a new relationship
unhindered by the legacy of history."
</P>
<P>
As far as the economic and commercial relations are concerned,
Blair said, the prospects are "limitless". Britain remains by far
the largest European investor in China with over 12 billion U.S.
dollars and contracted investment so far and more than 2,000
British joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
However, he argued: "Britain can and should be doing better
with its exports. These grew by 25 percent in 1997, but have
slowed down this year, and Asia's recession is likely to make
things tougher still in future."
</P>
<P>
Blair expressed the hope that the improved relationship between
Britain and China and the combined efforts of the British
government and business circles can lead to a significant upsurge
in its exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Blair reiterated that Britain's aim is nothing less than to
make it China's number one business partner in Europe for both
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"This may be a demanding target, but it is not an impossible
one," he added.

WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair was "misleading,
even maddening" but did not warrant removing him from office, a
White House special counsel said Tuesday.

"Nothing in this case justifies this Congress overturning a
national election," Greg Craig told the House of Representatives
Judiciary Committee in the impeachment hearings which started
Tuesday morning. "There are no grounds for impeachment," he
said.

Craig promised to present a "powerful case" against impeachment
and urged legislators to draw "a sharp distinction between immoral
conduct and illegal acts."
</P>
<P>
The White House lawyer said that Clinton's testimony in the
Lewinsky case was "evasive, incomplete, misleading, even
maddening, but it was not perjury."

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Offers Constructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- India's biggest opposition,
the Congress, Tuesday offered constructive cooperation with the
central government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on
issues of vital interests to the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first general body meeting of the Congress Party
in Parliament (CPP), Congress president Sonia Gandhi gave no
indication that her party was eager to take over the central
government.
</P>
<P>
Following spectacular victories of the Congress in recent
assembly elections in four states, there have been speculations on
what the party's victories mean for the political situation at the
national level.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to offer the government constructive
cooperation on issues of vital interests to the nation but we
stand prepared to discharge our constitutional obligations as and
when the situation requires us to do so," Sonia said.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining that the current political and economic situation
continued to cause extreme worry, she said India was now governed
by "an unstable coalition in which policy making is at a premium
and even minimum consensus on national issues does not exist".
</P>
<P>
"There are deep divisions in the BJP itself which make it
impossible for the ruling coalition to deliver effective
governance," she said, adding that it could only compound miseries
of people who continue to be oppressed by high prices, lack of law
and order and deteriorating civic services.
</P>
<P>
The Congress leader said that there had been no evidence of
what the people expected of the coalition that "a government that
governs and an administration that administers" in the last eight
months since the BJP came to power in March.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sonia said, it was immature and irresponsible for the
government to blame others for its own shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
There were signs to suggest that the absence of governance, the
confusion and lack of decisiveness of the BJP-led coalition in the
past several months had brought the country close to an economic
crisis like the one in 1991, she said.
</P>
<P>
On the state assembly elections towards the end of last month,
she said it was an "encouraging sign" that Congress' traditional
support base among the poor, the Dalits, adivaisis and the
minorities was returning to the party fold.
</P>
<P>
She asked parliament members of the Congress to remain vigilant
as the current session of Parliament, which began Monday, was
"crucial" with the ruling BJP emerging as a divided house and its
allies speaking in different voices.

ATHENS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential envoy for
Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, will visit Greece next Monday as part
of his diplomatic efforts to break the impasse of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas on Tuesday described the strong interest showed by
the international community in resolving the Cyprus issue as "a
positive sign." This should move in the framework defined by the
United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will also visit Turkey and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south in 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
While blaming Turkey and northern Cyprus for being responsible
for the deadlock of the Cyprus problem, both Greece and Cyprus
have recently expressed their disappointment to the U.S. over the
lack of progress towards settlement of the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Blamed for S. Africa's Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve
Bank Tuesday attributed South Africa's stalled economic growth
this year to the Asian crisis, saying the crisis in Asia led to
speculative attacks on the local financial market which severely
hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa's macro-economic stability is not in
doubt and the financial system is fundamentally sound, the
country could not escape the spill-over effects of the Asian
crisis, the central bank said in its latest quarterly review.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic growth fell to a negative 2.3 percent
in the third quarter this year, down from the 0.5 percent growth
in the first quarter and 0.3 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons why Asia contagion affected monetary and
economic conditions in South Africa were the low domestic savings
ratio, the inability to attract sustained foreign direct
investment and the paucity of international reserves, South
African Press Association quoted the bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The high ratio of short-term external debt to international
reserves and falling commodity prices also worsened the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The bank said international speculators transmitted the Asian
crisis to South Africa by selling fixed-interest securities in
the local market. The country's financial market has tumbled
since the speculative attacks started in late May this year.
</P>
<P>
"The principal elements that transmitted the crisis to South
Africa were heavy selling of fixed-interest securities by
non-resident portfolio investors which caused an unavoidable rise
of 725 basis points from June to August in bank lending rates,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Lower business confidence in the face of the global financial
turmoil and shrinking export demand resulted from the recession
in Asia led to an abrupt decline in the real gross domestic
product (GDP) in the third quarter, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the telecommunications and financial services sectors
recorded positive growth in the third quarter, many other sectors
posted steep decline in output.
</P>
<P>
Production in the manufacturing sector, the biggest employer
in the country, declined sharply as domestic consumer demand for
durable goods declined and the international economy slowed down,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Mining output in the third quarter also contracted, partly
because of the weak export demand for commodities, whereas
agricultural output shrank as a result of a much smaller maize
crop, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the year-on-year GDP growth in the first three
quarters of this year was about 0.5 percent, and the growth for
the whole year was likely to be lower than that. The
lower-than-expected growth rate implied a sharp fall in the real
income per capita of South Africans this year.

<HEADLINE> Greenland Bank Defends Performance in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Greenland Bank (T)
Ltd, a major foreign bank in Tanzania, defended Tuesday that it
has a sound financial performance despite the fact that its
parent bank in Uganda has run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters at the bank in the downtown of Dar es
Salaam, Azad Dhomun, the chief executive, reassured that the bank
has sufficient cash to meet customers' demand. "I am so
confident," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dhomun noted that he was surprised at irresponsible media
reports that a panic withdrawing had happened in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Pointing at places outside his office window, he said, if
there was any panic the queue line would have extended hundreds
of meters into the street, because the bank has 10,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
Dhomun said 25 individuals or companies Monday deposited money
at the bank, which showed that they had confidence in its
performance. However, he declined to reveal the total amount of
their deposits. On average, the bank has 25 to 50 depositors a
day, he added.
</P>
<P>
Business in the bank, however, entered a second day with its
hall packed with hundreds of customers eager to withdraw money
from their accounts.
</P>
<P>
"Panic grips Greenland Bank (T) Limited customers in Dar," an
English-language newspaper headlined, saying that by 5:00 p.m. on
Monday more than 290 million Shillings (about 430,000 U.S.

Rashid Shehe, 27, an employee at the Food and Beverage

came to withdraw money after hearing from media reports and
fellow workers that the Greenland Bank (T) Ltd. may run into
trouble.

<P>
The Greenland Bank, the third largest bank in Uganda, also has
subsidiaries in Kenya and Tanzania's Zanzibar isles.
</P>

The spokesman for the Bank of Tanzania, the central bank and

far as we know, the bank is in good performance."

CAIRO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Here are major economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Arab Economic Unity Council endorsed Monday an
executive program to resume implementation of the rules of the
mini Arab common market within the framework of the Arab economic
unity agreement.
</P>
<P>
The mini common market embraces seven Arab states, namely,
Egypt, Syria, Libya, Jordan, Yemen, Iraq and Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement calls for simultaneous implementation by all
members, starting January 1, 2000, of a timetable that will
abolish customs and other related duties in three years time.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit starting
here Monday will mainly deal with economic issues, in the light of
the new world changes and globalization
</P>
<P>
Gulf sources said the economic issues to be discussed at the
summit will include the concept of Gulf citizenship and the flow
of labour force among member states.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The number of factories in the Gulf Cooperation
Council states stands at 422 in all productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia claims 180 of the factories, followed by the
United Arab Emirates which has 140.
</P>
<P>
As of the rest, 34 are in Bahrain, 32 in Kuwait, 26 in Oman,
and 10 in Qatar.
</P>

A finance ministry statement said spending in November
amounted to 491.88 million U.S. dollars while revenues stood at
243 million dollars.

move encouraged by the central bank advocating takeovers in the
banking sector.
</P>

approved by the central bank, was worth 10 million
U.S. dollars. The amount would be paid in installments over one
year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Adnan al-Kassar, Chairman of Fransabank, said that the deal
was aimed at expanding the bank's retail and commercial banking

<HEADLINE> U.S. Special Envoy in Ethiopia for Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Former United States
National Security Adviser and special presidential envoy Anthony
Lake returned here on Tuesday from Asmara to continue his
mediation between the two Horn of Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Lake, who is on his
third attempt to facilitate a peaceful solution to the
seven-month Ethio-Eritrean border dispute, is expected to meet
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. National Security Adviser met with Meles last
Saturday before leaving for Asmara, capital of Eritrea, for talks
with Eritrean officials.
</P>
<P>
Lake started his third mediation effort last week. His two
previous visits to Addis Ababa were on October 8 and November 11.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
mediation committee on Ethio-Eritrean border dispute, held in
Ouagadougou of Burkina Faso on November 7 and 8, came up with a
set of proposals on the peaceful solution to the border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has accepted the OAU proposals while Eritrea rejected
the key element of the peace plan which calls for the withdrawal
of its troops from the disputed Badme area.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be submitted to the summit of Central Organ
of OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution which is scheduled to be held in Ouagadougou on

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Clashes Continue in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Clashes between Palestinian
protesters and Israeli troops in the West Bank continued Tuesday,
but the demonstrations were scaled down compared with Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians were hurt when the Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated bullets at the Palestinian stone throwers near the
West Bank city of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Israeli girl was slightly injured there as the
Palestinian demonstrators hurled stones at the car she was
driving.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank town of Ram just north of Jerusalem,
Palestinian students of a high school also clashed with Israeli
soldiers. At least two students were injured as the soldiers fired
rubber bullets and tear gas at them.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were launched aimed at pressing the Israeli
government to release Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement signed in October between Israel and
the Palestinians, Israel will pull out its troops from another 13
percent of the West Bank and free 750 Palestinian prisoners by the
end January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 250 of them were released, but most were criminals,
not political prisoners demanded by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, more than 30 Palestinians and several Israeli
soldiers and civilians were wounded in the clashes spreading
throughout the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended the implementation of the peace accord last
week, vowing that it will not conduct further troops pullout until
the Palestinians make concessions over some issues, such as that
concerning prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
announcing the suspension was partially to court the hard-liners
in his coalition to rally more support for his government, which
merely enjoys a slim majority in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials inferred that the scale-down in the
demonstrations on Tuesday resulted from measures taken by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The PNA wants to create a peaceful atmosphere ahead of a tour
by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the region, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will pay a four-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas as of Saturday to push forward the implementation
of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for Clinton's visit, U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy
Dennis Ross arrived here Tuesday. He will meet separately with
Netanyahu and the PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat later in the day.
</P>
<P>
In related development, Jewish settlers from Kadim and Ganim
settlements met with Netanyahu Tuesday, pressing for more security.
</P>
<P>
They told Israeli Radio the prime minister promised that steps
will be taken to cement their security. But they noted that they
are not optimistic since Netanyahu had made such promises before
and nothing has been done.
</P>
<P>
Several Jewish settlements, including Kadim and Ganim, have
became isolated enclaves since Israel handed over 2 percent of the
West Bank to the PNA in its first-phase troops withdrawal last
month under the Wye agreement.

<HEADLINE> Zim Dollar Devalued by 68 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean currency unit
has fallen by 68 percent against the greenback since the
beginning of this year, the Foreign Exchange Traders Association
of Zimbabwe (FETAZ) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
FETAZ Chairman Charles Nyoka told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that the foreign exchange market has been fairly volatile during
the course of the year due to macro-economic instability.
</P>
<P>
Although the market had begun to stabilize a bit this month,
depressed prices of tobacco coupled with poor prices for other
commodities on the world market had resulted in loss of foreign
currency, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the continued fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar against major
currencies, he said the key factor to this was that the country
did not have enough capacity to meet its foreign currency
requirements.
</P>
<P>
"It's all a question of supply and demand, and we do not have
a strong base that generate foreign earnings except tobacco and
our manufacturing base is not strong," Nyoka added.

<HEADLINE> White House Begins Impeachment Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair was "misleading,
even maddening" but did not warrant removing him from office, a
White House special counsel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in this case justifies this Congress overturning a
national election," Greg Craig told the House of Representatives
Judiciary Committee in the impeachment hearings which started
Tuesday morning. "There are no grounds for impeachment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Craig promised to present a "powerful case" against impeachment
and urged legislators to draw "a sharp distinction between immoral
conduct and illegal acts."
</P>
<P>
The White House lawyer said that Clinton's testimony in the
Lewinsky case was "evasive, incomplete, misleading, even
maddening, but it was not perjury."
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed the president's "profound and powerful regret
for what he has done."
</P>
<P>
"The president wants everyone to know -- the committee, the
Congress and the country -- that he is genuinely sorry for the
pain and damage that he has caused," Craig said.
</P>
<P>
"The legal case against the president is, in my judgment, a
house of cards," said John Conyers, the committee's ranking
Democratic lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Monday that his panel had
made a "compelling case" for removing Clinton for office. But
Conyers rejected that notion, saying the evidence "wouldn't
satisfy any court of law and cannot possibly serve as the
evidentiary foundation" for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The committee's inquiry enters a final, crucial phase this week
with two days of presentations from Whited House witnesses and
attorneys on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the committee expected to vote on three or four articles
of impeachment related to perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power, Clinton's defenders were increasingly turning
their attention to a likely battle in the full House next week.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the White House has been given a list of
30 or so Republican lawmakers who officials believe could be
persuaded to oppose impeachment, either on the merits of the case
or on the basis of the political makeup of their districts.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party holds a 228-207 majority in the expiring
Congress. Only three Democrats are believed ready to support
impeachment, meaning that moderate Republicans hold the
balanceiary of power in determining whether Clintons case goes to
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
If the House votes for impeachment, it is highly unlikely at
this point that a two-thirds majority in the Senate would vote to
convict and remove Clinton from office, the sources added.

JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
predicted Tuesday that a solution may be in sight to the impasse
over the trial of two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie plane
bombing, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Mandela addressed a press conference in Abu Dhabi, where he
spoke at the opening session of the annual summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council.
</P>
<P>
He said he had spoken in the last few days to U.S. President
Bill Clinton and to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and
planned to speak to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi once he

</P>
<P>
"Things are moving in a satisfactory manner," Mandela said,
adding that Britain had agreed to remove the problem created by
the lack of Libyan diplomatic representation in London by
permitting the establishment of a Libyan office in Scotland,
where the two suspects will serve their sentences if they are
convicted at a trial set to take place in the Hague of the
Netherlands.

Libya has expressed concern about the possible treatment of
the two suspects in a Scottish prison.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Leaders Hold Closed-Door Sessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) held their second closed-door working
session here Tuesday to discuss issues on the agenda of their
19th summit.
</P>
<P>
Right after the opening ceremony Monday evening, the leaders
began their first working meeting which was expected to discuss
falling oil prices, joint security and economic cooperation, the
situation in Iraq, relations with Iran and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders will continue their closing session Wednesday
afternoon during which they will issue the final statement on a
number of issues they discussed at the summit, sources close to
the summit said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that how to curb the collapse of the oil
prices that has left Gulf Arab economies reeling is dominating the
summit which is being held when the crude oil fell to a historic
low of less than 10 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and leading power in
the GCC, was expected to call on the GCC states to adopt a united
and strong position on the world market and make their weight felt
in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
It was time to do something about the low oil prices, Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz told the heads of state from
bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates at the
annual summit.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf oil producers, whose economy depends heavily on oil
earnings, have been hit hard by the sharp drop in prices resulting
from oversupply and flagging demand.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC nations produce about 13.5 million barrel of oil
per day and control nearly half of the world's proven oil
reserves.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- At a European policy conference of
the Social democratic Party (SPD) in German Saarbruecken on
Tuesday, the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder warned Germany
would not go on paying the European Union (EU)'s bills.
</P>
<P>
"More than half of the money Europe throws around is paid by
Germany," said Schroeder, adding that Bonn could no longer bail
out the EU given its huge and continuing capital transfers to
eastern Germany.
</P>

EU states got by in the past with the motto: "The crisis will
be solved because the Germans will pay," he said, adding: "This
policy has come to an end."
</P>
<P>
Attacking agricultural spending, which devours half of the EU's
budget, Schroeder stressed EU member states should be paying the
bill for their farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Financing in Europe means... iron budget discipline must be
practiced... in the EU," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Taking his toughest tone on Europe since being elected,
Schroeder said Germany would oppose any moves to raise the annual
EU budget over its current level of 98 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Officials Should Be Sacked for Neglect of Duty: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary select
committee in Uganda on privatization has proposed that some
senior officials be sacked for their neglect of duty in the
privatization process of parastatals.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was contained in a report made by the committee
here Tuesday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Among them are the Minister of Justice Joash Mayanja Nkangi,
State Minister in charge of privatization Matthew Rukikaire and
Secretary to the Treasury Emannuel Tumusiime Metebile.
</P>
<P>
The committee's report accused these people of failing to
politically supervise the privatization of Uganda's key
parastatals like Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB).
</P>
<P>
The 49 percent of the UCB was originally bought by a Malaysian
company which in turn transferred them to Salim Saleh, President
Yoweri Museveni's brother and senior presidential advisor on
defense and security.
</P>
<P>
Saleh reportedly admitted buying UCB through Greenland Bank
secretly because according to the agreement, the Malaysian
company is not allowed to sell the shares to a third party.
</P>
<P>
The UCB scandal forced Saleh to resign on Saturday, a headline
story that drew attention from all people in the capital city.

<HEADLINE> Sony to Follow EU's Law in Licensing for Vedio Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Sony's licensing agreements
for vedio games are now compatible with European Economic Area
(EEA) competition law, the European Union said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following intervention of the European Commission, the European
Union (EU)'s executive body, the Sony has changed its developer
and publisher licensing agreements by assuring the EU of ending
any possible infringement in regard to the agreements and
following the EEA law.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the amendments were made after long
discussions between the EU and Sony's representatives. In the area
of vedio games, Sony is a leading supplier of vedio game consoles
and compatible games.
</P>
<P>
the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) is part of a
group of companies ultimately owned by Sony Corporation, Japan. In
order to allow independent software companies to develop and
publish games compatible with its console systems, Sony has set up
a licensing scheme, granting independent software companies access
to certain of Sony's intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The EU also said that it decided on its own initiative to
investigate Sony's licensing agreement following a report by
Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
After the investigation had been launched, Sony notified its
standard developer and publisher licensing agreements in December
1995, according to the EU commission.
</P>
<P>
Under the original version of the agreements in question,
developers and publishers were obliged to obtain Sony's prior
approval of the game project before they were allowed to develop
or launch their games. In the meantime, licensed developers and
publishers were not allowed to have their games developed or
published by a company not authorized by Sony.
</P>
<P>
Sony's licensees were also obliged to have their games
manufactured by Sony. In a Statement of Objections sent to Sony in
November 1996, the EU commission alleged that the agreements were
restrictive of competition and had an obvious effect on trade
between EU member states, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Subsides on Comoran Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Fighting on the Comoran
island of Anjouan subsided Tuesday after a militia faction loyal
to politician Chamassi Said Omar seized control of the Capital
Mutsamudu following three days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
The faction took control of Mutsamudu Monday night after
allegedly looting and burning houses and carrying out summary
executions of civilians on the streets, a local report reaching
here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, between 40 and 60 people had been
killed in machine gun and artillery battles along the narrow
streets of the tiny port capital Mutsamudu's old town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African government announced Tuesday that
a delegation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) led by
South Africa will begin a three-day fact finding mission to the
Archipelago's main island Grand Comore Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted on the Comoran island of Anjouan last
Saturday after a failed assassination attempt on the island's
self-declared President Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim -- the second in
just over a week. Ibrahim led Anjouan's secession from the Comoro
Islands in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Omar demanded Ibrahim's resignation. His forces took advantage
of a brief cease-fire which held through last Sunday night to
rally reinforcements from rural areas and soldiers willing to

<HEADLINE> Annan Shocked to Learn Killing of Foreign Hostages in Chechny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan "was shocked" to hear news reports Tuesday that four
foreign hostages were found decapitated in Chechnya, a region in
southern Russia, where "kidnappings have become common," U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The four men -- Britons Darren Hickey, Rudolf Petschi and Peter
Kennedy and New Zealander Stanley Shaw -- were captured by unknown
gunmen on October 3 in the Chechen capital, Grozny, where they
were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time foreign hostages had been murdered since
the end of Chechnya's 1994-1996 war with Russia for independence.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Annan met with the family of Vincent Cochetel,
a Frenchman, who headed the office of the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in North Ossetia, near Chechnya.
He was abducted about 313 days ago and a UNHCR spokesman said two
weeks ago he is believed to be alive and healthy.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to obtain his release has yielded no result so
far since January this year when Cochetel was held.
</P>
<P>
Annan told reporters in Paris that he would speak with Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov "as part of his ongoing efforts
and contacts with Russian officials to try to bring Cochetel
home," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya, a region within Russia, is not recognized as
independent by any country since Moscow withdrew its troops in
1996.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Speed up Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Tuesday urged members of the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) to redouble efforts toward the
economic integration of the region.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the new COMESA Center or COMESA Secretariat
building in Lusaka, Chiluba said all the member states should
continue moving forward and speed up the process of attaining a
free trade area by the year 2000, reported Zambia News Agency
ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The 21-member regional grouping which was established in 1994
to replace the former Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and
Southern Africa (PTA) also aims to achieve a customs union with a
single external tariff by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
A fragmented market system, said Chiluba, should be done away
with and member countries should work toward a stronger
sub-regional market in order to create investment and jobs.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed COMESA should strive for integration into the
global market by ensuring peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
No economies will grow independently without being integrated
into the world market, Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, called on member countries such as Angola,
Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and
Eritrea which are involved in conflicts to end their hostilities
and engage in more meaningful conflict resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During the inauguration, Zambia presented a check worth
400,000 U.S. Dollars as final payment of its obligations for the
purchase of the COMESA Center, which was centrally situated in
the Zambian capital and acquired from a defunct bank at a total
cost of nine million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The function was attended by senior government officials,
diplomats and COMESA officials.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania in Grave Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Most regions in Tanzania
are faced with severe shortages of food and the government has
sent expert teams to make assessment of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives say
that initial assessment by 15 regions indicates that some 523,247
tons of food are required between this month and next March.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that out of requirement, about 208,000 tons
are to be used for emergency supply and another 315,000 tons for
commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
By November 30, the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) had only
45,557 tons of food, less than 10 percent of the required supply.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the ministry, however, told reporters
Tuesday that the regions' estimates are too high and that the
actual requirement of food will be known upon completion of the
assessment in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The official said the expert teams with four members each
drawn from the Food Security Department, the Commission of
Agriculture and Livestock, the Disaster Department in the
minister's office and the Directorate of Meteorology are making
assessment in Lake Zone, Northern and Coastal zones as well as
the central Morogoro Region.
</P>
<P>
He said those were the areas which did not get short rains
this season and are suspected to be facing acute food shortages.
</P>
<P>
The official said that authorities concerned will thereafter
reconcile the assessment made by the regions and the experts and
come up with a situation report which will advise the government
on what should be done.
</P>
<P>
The official said the food security department has approved
distribution of 35,000 tons of food from the SGR for commercial
purposes and that each region has been allocated with a share.
</P>
<P>
Arusha has been allocated with 1,400 tons, Kilimanjaro 1,000
tons, Tanga 1,600 tons, Dodoma and Singida, 1000 tons each,
Tabora 500 tons, Dar es Salaam 6,400 tons and Coast 2,600 tons,
he said.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on Human Rights Held in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium on
human rights was held here Tuesday under the slogan "The
continuing unjust sanctions are an evident violation to human
rights."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to its opening session, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said "the unjust embargo aims at
diminishing Iraq's civilization history of more than seven
thousand years."
</P>
<P>
"As the international community exerts earnest and faithful
efforts for the welfare of mankind, human rights have become a
weapon in the hands of some countries to achieve their own
interests when they claim these rights through a double standard
policy," Sahhaf stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed hope that the symposium would shed
more light on the crimes committed against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said the U.N. sanctions is tantamount genocide to the
people of Iraq, citing that more than 1 million Iraqi children
and elderly people have died due to the acute shortages of food
and medicine caused by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister reminded the participants that Iraq was the
first country in the world that set laws and paid attention to
human rights since King Hammurabi 3,000 years ago." The Code of
Hammurabi is believed to be the first written law in the world.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Preparatory Committee of the symposium, Mohammed
al-Doury, expressed hope that participants in the symposium and
the international community should work seriously to lift the
sanctions imposed on Iraq and to stop this crime which contradicts
with the International Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
More than one hundred Arab and foreign figures from Britain,
France, Spain, Greece, India, Mali, Yemen, Bangladesh, Sudan, and
Jordan attended the symposium which will last three days.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will discuss 25 researches that deal with the
negative influences of economic sanctions on human rights in
the world in general and in Iraq in particular, said the
Iraqi News Agency.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Chirac Call for Binding EU-wide Job Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac sent Tuesday
together a letter to Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, appealing
this week's European Union (EU) summit in Vienna to approve a job
creation pact which would be mandatory across the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Klimais will be hosting the December 11 to 12
summit.
</P>
<P>
According to this letter published here today, the leaders of
Germany and France said: "The governments of all member states in
the EU should obligate themselves to binding verifialble targets
regarding employment policy guidelines...".
</P>
<P>
They stressed the jobs-creation would be in the center of the
european policy, and suggested the EU-summit of this weekend
regard the cuts in unemployment as a important subject under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The letter said stress should be on "cutting youth and
long-term unemployment but also discrimination aimed at women in
the job market".
</P>
<P>
Linked to a jobs pact would be setting common minimum standards
in environmental policy along with progress toward minimum taxes
and entitlements, said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter also indicated the EU will seek a new constitutional
congress in a bid to make the key institutional reform decisions
passed over by the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty. These include reducing
the size of the European Commission, shifting to majority voting
instead of the current national veto and re-weighting of votes
from different sized members.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Fresh Recruitment in Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
been angered by Amnesty International's report alleging that in
August and September it forced men and boys into the army,
Rwandan News Agency (RNA) reported in Kigali Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are a complete fabrication, lacking point,
truth and substance," the RNA quoted the Rwandan Defense Ministry
as saying in a statement Tuesday, which called the report a
campaign against the government army, the Rwandan Patriotic Army
(RPA).
</P>
<P>
The ministry of defense further claimed that "the RPA has
never had shortage of willing volunteers to join its ranks," and
described RPA as one of the best trained and motivated armies in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"It would therefore be a self-defeating exercise to recruit
men and boys against their will, as this would result in
desertion and serious problems of troops' morale," the statement,
broadcast on both state-run radio and television, stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan ministry of defense argued that it halted
recruitment a few months ago, due to budgetary constraints, and
that it has embarked on trimming down the size of its army. It is
in line with this policy that by the year 2,001 Rwanda will have
demobilized between 22,000 and 25,000 soldiers, from its
estimated 55,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
Since early August, Rwanda is engaged in the Congolese war
where it backs rebels fighting to oust embattled President
Laurent Kabila from power.
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread sayings that because of this war,
the Rwandan army has been coercing men and boys to join its ranks
in a bid to back up the war efforts in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
One Sunday, Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of Defense,
Major General Paul Kagame, said he will maintain his troops in
Congo as long as security along its borders will remain
threatened by Hutu extremists using Congo as a launching pad for
cross-borders raids on Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"If we are given cast-iron guarantees by the International
community that our security concerns would be addressed, and
Kabila demonstrated a genuine commitment to address our security
concerns, then we would have no further need to keep our troops
in Congo," Kagame underscored.
</P>
<P>
Kagame accused Kabila of having gorged an alliance with the
forces which committed genocide in Rwanda and which still have
plans to overthrow the regime in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
He advised Kabila and his allies to favor peace talks because
"they cannot defeat the rebels", now controlling about half of
the country's territory, especially in the east and the north.
</P>
<P>
"They also cannot wish away the problems they have created.
They need to sit down and talk to those fighting them," Kagame
said.

<HEADLINE> Aziz: Lift Sanctions or Kick out UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said here Tuesday that UNSCOM would be banned from working in
his country if the United States and Britain insist on keeping
economic sanctions against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told a press conference that a decision on continuing
Baghdad's cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq's
disarmament (UNSCOM) will depend on the results of the
comprehensive U.N. review of the Iraqi situation scheduled for
early January.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will make a decision on protecting Iraq's independence and
sovereignty in light of the review, said Aziz, who was here on a
four-day working visit to enlist Moscow's support for an end to
the crippling sanctions imposed by the U.N. following Baghdad's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He warned London and Washington that if they insist on keeping
economic sanctions, they should be ready for the UNSCOM being
banned from working in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Our patience is not endless," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Washington and London are intent on using their veto
power at the U.N. Security Council to derail the lifting of
economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He accused the UNSCOM of being dishonest and executing the will
of Washington which wants to have the Iraqi leadership replaced
rather than the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
The commission conducts extensive espionage in the interests of
the United States, Britain and Israel, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here Sunday and held meetings with Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
is scheduled to leave Moscow Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President's Brother Defends Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni's Brother Salim Saleh Tuesday defended his position in
the Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) saga.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in Radio Uganda's "Talk Show" program,
Saleh, also former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security, said he bought UCB from a Malaysian company in the
interests of average Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not want UCB to be controlled in foreigners'
hands.
</P>
<P>
Although the method of buying the 49 shares of UCB from the
Malaysian company through Greenland Bank is illegal, this move is
well-intentioned, he argued.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted allegations that he is doing business for the
president and said he regretted his resignation Saturday leaving
his brother alone.
</P>
<P>
"I had no other choice," the 38-year-old major general said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he went against his oath as reported, Saleh said
he did not give any oath at all.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said Saleh had denied, before parliament
under oath, any involvement in the UCB issue. But under mounting
press pressure, he admitted his purchase of the biggest
commercial bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
The major general said he had many businesses in Uganda, but
declining to give the exact number.
</P>
<P>
There are also some listeners who called to thank Saleh for
his purchase of the bank and encouraged him to continue the
doing.
</P>
<P>
Francis Kene, a member of the parliamentary committee on
privatization, told Xinhua in a telephone interview Tuesday
evening that many people involved in the issue are to be
investigated and that some would be punished for their mistakes.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Sudanese Ties Not Yet Normalized: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Foreign
Minister Tuesday said ties between Ethiopia and Sudan will
normalize only after Khartoum hands over to Addis Ababa the
terrorists who tried to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Seyoum Mesfin made the
remarks in response to questions posed by Ethiopian reporters on
relations between the two countries shortly before his departure
for Nigeria and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum described as "far from the truth" reports by the
Sudanese media and some diplomatic sources claiming that
relations between Ethiopia and Sudan are on the mend.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese media, in particular, are reporting that the two
countries are trying to launch cooperations, "but all these
(reports) are lies," said the Ethiopian minister.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said relations between the two countries soured after
evidences showed that the Sudanese government was directly
involved in the attempt on the life of president Mubarak here in
Addis Ababa in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Khartoum government has given shelter
to the terrorists who tried to assassinate the president.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian foreign minister said Sudan has repeatedly
refused calls on it by, among others, the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the United Nations Security Council, to extradite
to Ethiopia the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ethio-Sudanese ties will not normalize until
Khartoum extradites the culprits, adding that by refusing to hand
over the terrorists to Ethiopia, Sudan has given precedence to
its ties with terrorists over its relations with the people and
government of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian foreign minister will convey messages from Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi to the presidents of Nigeria and Ghana,
according to the report.

groups of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) made surprise visits to
copters to carry
out their activities.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler told reporters in New York on
Monday that the surprise visits that would be carried out in the
following days were to test Iraq's promise of resuming full
cooperation with weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional resumption of
cooperation with U.N. arms inspections that it suspended three
months ago. By doing that, Iraq narrowly escaped the U.S.-led
air strikes against it.

<HEADLINE> Donors to Release Promised Aid to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- After two weeks of talks held
here the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reached an
agreement with Zambia under which donors will release their
promised aid to the latter, a Zambian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi told a news briefing
here that the aid to be released will put her country's economy
back on track.
</P>
<P>
She said Zambia's economy is expected to grow next year if the
second phase of the enhanced structural adjustment facility
(ESAF) is implemented early next year.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government and the visiting IMF country director
Renoild Van Till held intense discussions on the next phase of
the structural adjustment program of the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi told the press that this year has been difficult for
Zambia's economy following the structural problems it has faced.
</P>
<P>
The major hustle for Zambia has been the slow race of
privatization of the copper mines which the donors advanced as a
precondition for receiving aid, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her optimism that the mines will be sold off
completely by early next year, a move which has pleased the
donors.
</P>
<P>
Van Till told the briefing that Zambia's economy will begin to
grow next year as inflation which is the current major problem
will be tackled thanks to assistance from IMF and other donors.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important that Zambia becomes a good partner
with the IMF so that the ESAF program expected to be in force
next year takes root.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Zambia's economy has performed poorly this
year for reasons he attributed to the failure of the government
to dispose of the mines and he hoped there will be growth next
year.
</P>
<P>
In May this year donors pledged to give Zambia an aid of 530
million Dollars at the Consultative Group meeting held Paris.
However, the donors have not released the pledged aid while
pressing for a quick completion of the privatization of the
Zambia Consolidated Cooper Mines (ZCCM), which earns more than 80
percent of Zambia's foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's two-thirds of government expenditure come from the
donors and the withholding of the aid has reduced inflow of
foreign exchange into the country.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says N. Ireland Peace Process in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) --- Sinn Fein's chief negotiator
Martin McGuinness said on Tuesday the Northern Ireland peace
process was in "crisis."
</P>
<P>
Emerging talks with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in
Dublin, McGuinness said he had no speculation on the IRA's
position on arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
He also made plain his determination that a ministry for
equality and a cross-border body dealing with the Irish language
be set up under the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness was quoted by BBC as saying: "Why should anyone be
afraid of a department of equality? Why should anyone be afraid of
a cross border implementation body into the Irish language?
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as British Prime Minister Tony Blair was
holding a new round of talks to overcome the impasse in
implementing the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said Blair will meet Ulster Unionist
deputy leader John Taylor later Tuesday and will hold talks with
nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) deputy leader
Seamus Mallon and McGuinness the following day.
</P>
<P>
There has been a considerable effort in Northern Ireland
recently to try to force an agreement before Thursday, when First
Minister David Trimble and SDLP leader John Hume receive the Nobel
peace prize.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein chief negotiator added: "I think it is vitally
and critically important at a time when there is considerable
demoralization about the non-implementation of this agreement that
the political leaders should get their act together.
</P>
<P>
The present impasse arose when Trimble found he was unable to
go along with the compromise after consulting his party.

ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada called on the Ethiopian people Tuesday to ensure
that development activities are undertaken uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the
Federal Constitution here, Negasso said one of the major
objectives of the nation's Constitution is to overcome economic
backwardness by mobilizing the people in development leading them
to sustainable and steady growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the Constitution, in addition to promoting a
democratic system in the country, has also made decisive
contributions for consolidating the unity of the people and
nurturing the spirit of Ethiopianness and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
The president described as "quite encouraging" the activities
undertaken during the past couple of years with regard to
familiarizing the populace with constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia was approved four years ago on December 8, 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A softer opening in the New York
market sent European bourses to a lower performances Tuesday with
London as an exception owing to hopes of an interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index ended moderately higher helped by
speculation that the Bank of England may deliver a sizable cut in
interest rates this week.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip share index finished 39 points or 0.7 percent
higher at 5,615.7.
</P>
<P>
However, many investors were still reluctant to trade and
dealers said the FTSE was still consolidating around the 5,600
level.
</P>
<P>
"People are keeping a pretty tight rein on things ahead of the
euro launch," said one observer. "No one wants to leave themselves
exposed to the unknown implications of the euro."
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt Xetra Dax index closed down 12.98 points at
4,708.19. Dealers said the hallmark of the session was inactivity
as many investors have already stopped trading in preparation for
the coming of the euro in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Tuesday is a holiday in a number of European
countries, further damping trading activity in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks ended a sluggish session almost flat Tuesday, amid
unwillingness among investors to take positions ahead of the euro
launch with the Cac 40 closing down 5.8 points at 3,765.41.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Talks With Turkey on Kurdish Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Tuesday denied that Iran and Turkey had
held talks on a trip of Turkish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Lastampa daily has reported that Ocalan, leader of
the Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), had disclosed that a
Turkish delegation had visited Tehran for his tour there.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the report as baseless, Asefi said that Iran so far
has not held any negotiation regarding Ocalan's trip to Iran and
is not going to do so.
</P>
<P>
"At present, a Turkish delegation is in Tehran to participate in
the two countries' high security commission, which is held every
six months regularly," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The visit of the Turkish delegation has nothing to do with the
Ocalan's issue," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan has been detained in Italy since arriving from Moscow on
November 12. Turkey, which considers him a terrorist responsible
for thousands of deaths, has demanded his extradition. But Italy
has refused because he can face death penalty when returning
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asefi also noted that, just as what Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said during his recent visit to Italy, Iran is ready to
play a mediatory role to defuse the tension between Turkey and
Italy if the two countries wished to do so.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves German Companies' Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Tuesday that it has approved a major merger of German
companies.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the
merger deals with the acquisition of the German state-owned
Autobahn Tank &AMP; Rast AG by a consortium of Allianz Capital
Partners GmbH, a german insurance company, LSG Lufthansa, the
national airway company, and three investment trusts.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the Tank &AMP; Rast owns most of the plots of
land on which the German motorway service areas are located. It
makes profits by leasing the vast majority of motorway service
areas along Germany's motorways.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the merger will not change market conditions given
that it consists only in a change of shareholders, therefore it
has decided not to oppose the notified operation and to declare
the merger compatible with the common market and with the European
Economic Area.
</P>
<P>
After completion of the merger, Lufthansa and Allianz will each
own 33.3 percent of the shares of the new company, Autobahn Tank &AMP;
Rast Holding GmbH. The remaining 33.3 percent of the shares will
be held by three Apax-fund companies who are also members of the
consortium but who have not the possibility to exercise control.

<HEADLINE> PLO Representative Doubts Netanyahu's Sincerity on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The chief Palestinian
representative on Tuesday expressed his doubt about Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's sincerity in carrying out the peace
process with the Palestinians in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Netanyahu does not view the Palestinians as his partners
in this process and he still vacillates on the issue of wanting to
make peace with the Palestinians," Hassan Abdel Rahman, head of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he is more interested in making peace with his own
coalition, rather than with the Palestinians," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rahman, who helped negotiate the Wye agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians in October, said a series of Israel's actions
indicated Israeli insincerity.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the Israelis failed to set up committees
to talk with the Palestinians on a Gaza seaport and on safe
passages between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, signed in Washington on October 23, said the
two sides would renew negotiations on the safe passage immediately
and would proceed "without delay" to conclude an agreement on
building the seaport.
</P>
<P>
Another example, and one of the biggest threats to the peace
process, is the Israel's position on political prisoners, Rahman
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed at Wye Mills, Maryland, where the pact was
negotiated, that it would set free 750 prisoners in three batches
of 250. The Palestinians understood that all of them would be
political prisoners, but the first batch of 250 contained 150
common criminals.
</P>
<P>
"This is inconsistent with the agreement and with the spirit
which is supposed to be emerging between the Palestinians and the
Israelis," Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
"Here we were talking about a partnership for peace, about
putting the peace process back on track... and the Israelis are
bargaining, in essence taking hostage those political prisoners,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
But Israel said there was no agreement at Wye on what type of
prisoner Israel would set free. The United States has appeared to
concur, saying the first prisoner release met the commitment which
Israel made in the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Mass Fish Death Triggers Disputes in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- There has been a mass fish
mortality in the coastal areas between Mogadishu and Warsheikh
district of Middle Shabelle region in southern Somalia since
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the capital got up early in the morning and found
dead fish everywhere as all the fish markets have been glutted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the super cheap price in the fish markets, strong
rumors circulated that the fish had been poisoned by toxic wastes
from Western nuclear plants and poured into Somalia's unguarded
sea waters. As the rumors increased, the people have gone in
streams to the sea shores to witness what was ostensibly seen as
a mere here-say.
</P>
<P>
The disputed administration of the capital has also sent a
committee consisting of senior officials and sea-life experts. As
the matter became pragmatic, two fish were taken for tests in
Mogadishu's limited laboratories, while extensive interviews were
made with veteran fishermen at Lido's beach in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen have declined the attribution of the dead fish
to toxic wastes poured into the sea since most of the dead fish
belonged only to what's known locally as Kakuna fish type, a fish
species not commonly eaten in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"The poison could have killed all fish types and other sea
creatures instead of Kakuna or another particular type alone,"
said Ali Mohamed Robleh, one of the seamen at Lido beach.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen said the most probable reason is the dumping of
the unwanted fish types by illegal foreign vessels fishing off
Somalia's coasts.
</P>
<P>
A Somali Seamen Organization based in Mogadishu said foreign
vessels from Japan, Italy, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines
and Thailand are exploiting Somalia's seas using illegal methods
and nets for fishing.
</P>
<P>
"As their nets are quite small, all kinds of fishes are caught
and the unwanted types are later on dumped into the sea," said
Robleh.
</P>
<P>
The organization has called on the international community to
help stop illegal fishing into the Somali waters by foreigners
taking advantage of the lawlessness and lack of central
government, to safeguard the economic exclusive zones of Somalia
in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The illegal fishing conspiracy in Somalia's sea waters seem to
have shifted to southern Somalia after sea pirates in the
northeastern regions increased in number and caught several of
those illegal fishing vessels.

</P>
<P>

attempt at the jerk, which is five kilos over the new world
standard set by the International Weightlifting Federation.
</P>
<P>
In the women's weightlifting, Chinese Chen Yanping snatched a

</P>
<P>
China won three of the five golds Wednesday, with Japan
taking the other two to lead 8-6 in the swimming medal table
after 15 events.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmer Chen Hua made the most of the absence of world
champion Chen Yan by winning the women's 400m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, who won the event along with the 400m medley at this
year's world championships in Perth, is ill with a stomach
ailment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Fu Yong, a bronze medalist in the 1994 Asian
Games, splashed home first in the men's 200m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
China's third swimming gold came from the women's 4x100
freestyle relay, in which the Chinese foursome of Chao Na, Han
Xue, Qian Min and Shan Ying timed 3:45.51.
</P>
<P>
The men's 100m freestyle event belonged to a Japanese twin.
</P>
<P>
Shunsuke Ito came into the world before twin brother Shusuke
and was in front of him again as they scored a 1-2 finish.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy to have a 1-2 finish with my brother," the
winning brother said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara grabbed the women's 100 backstroke,
beating compatriot Mai Nakamura and South Korean Choi Soo-Min.
</P>
<P>
China landed three gold medals in shooting as Xu Dan won the
men's air pistol title after leading his teammates to the team
victory, and Wang Xian snatched the women's sport rifle prone
title.
</P>
<P>
China showed their depth in gymnastics as Huang Xu led
teammate Yang Wei to a 1-2 placing in the men's all-around event.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaobo ended China's gold drought in judo as she
overwhelmed Japanese Kimoto Nami in the women's 63kg category
final.
</P>
<P>
China also struck gold in canoeing as Meng Guanliang
triumphed in the men's C-1 1,000m race.
</P>
<P>
China has nailed its No. 1 position in the medal tally with 25
golds, 22 silvers and 18 bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Japan came second with a 16-19-16 record and South Korea was
third with 15-6-12. Kazakhstan placed a distant fourth with a
6-5-9 haul.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes to Be Self-Sufficient in Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia would achieve
self-sufficiency in corn production by 2001 if the government
sticks to its program to intensify corn planting in dryland, a
senior researcher said.
</P>
<P>
Corn harvests from dryland are less than those from wetland,
head of the Agriculture Ministry's Food Crop and Horticultural
Research Center Sumarno was quoted by Antara News Agency Wednesday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Indonesia produces 9 million tons of corn per
annum but still has to import at least one million tons more every
year," Sumarno said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a hectare of dryland yields only 1.5-2.5 tons of
corn while a hectare of wetland produces 6-6.5 tons of corn.
</P>
<P>
Without tapping the country's dryland for corn production, the
government needs to open 200,000 new hectares of cornfields to
achieve self-sufficiency by 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
In support of the program to grow more corn in dryland, the
ministry will release new high-yielding varieties of corn, he
added.

The forum, broadcast live on radio and television, also
featured Finance Minister Tarin Nimmanahaeminda and other cabinet
members.
</P>
<P>
The opposition members of parliament boycotted the forum,
arguing that the bills, especially those covering investment from
overseas and bankruptcy, would hand over much of the economy to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"The government is trying to give more accurate information on
these bills to allow the public to understand them properly,"
Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the meeting, Chuan hit back at the criticism that
the bills and the 17.2-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund
(IMF) rescue package granted too much control of the economy to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
People should not "engage in unfounded allegations, sensational
allegations, for example, in charging that we in the government
want to sell off the country", Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
"Those charges are certainly unfounded," Tarin told the forum.
He said Thailand still faced an economic battle. "All these bills
are important factors for economic rehabilitation but it doesn't
mean that by passing the bills we will eradicate all the
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of high-profile senators, who are opposed to the bills
and have substantial business interests, have warned that the
measures could force them to hand over the control of their firms
to foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Asked To Save Trees By Sending Fewer Greeting Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Environmental
Protection Fund (CEPF), All-China Federation of Trade Unions,
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and
All-China Women's Federation started a "Fewer Cards To Save Trees"
action recently to make people more aware of environment
protection.
</P>
<P>
China's forests cover a mere 13.9 percent of the country, and
serious soil erosion is eating an area as large as Beijing every
eight years.
</P>
<P>
A CEPF study found that the people of Beijing send more than 30
million greeting cards between Christmas and the Spring Festival,
the traditional Chinese lunar New Year, equal to more than 10,000
trees and 300,000 kwh of electricity and 9,000 tons of polluted
water resulting from their production.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Council for Peace in Afghanistan Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Council of the
People of Afghanistan was launched here Wednesday with the avowed
purpose of freeing the Afghan people from the fire of "cruel civil
war" and restoring peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the launching of the council, Afghan religious
scholar Motasim Billah Mazhabi, president of the council, said
that the organization is not hostile to any faction, including the
Taliban, as its purpose is to secure unity and national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban are also from the Afghan nation and we are not
hostile to any faction, we do not reject anyone as we are for
unity," he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Mazhabi, who claimed the backing of Afghan scholars and
intellectuals and the masses as well, called for talks to resolve
the differences between various factions.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about the council's stand on self-exiled
Saudi Osama bin Laden's stay in Afghanistan, he said the council
"will not accept him if he is actually found involved in terrorist
activities."
</P>
<P>
Mazhabi stressed his opposition to "narrow vision" of the Islam
religion, saying "we are Muslims and Islam is not a narrow-vision
religion, the label of fundamentalism is an allegation and a
conspiracy to declare Afghans terrorists."
</P>
<P>
The charter of the council, made available to reporters, vows
to eliminate all differences and discrimination and secure social
justice in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
While asserting the council's opposition to terrorism, he
condemned terrorism all over the world.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign front, Mazhabi lauded Pakistan's role for the
restoration of peace in the war-battered country.
</P>
<P>
"I will hold talks during my stay in Pakistan with the
leadership of Pakistan because it is very sincere to play an
effective role for peace in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
On foreign interference in Afghanistan, he said peace in the
country can only be effective if the external interference is
stopped and the supply of arms to various factions is curtailed.
</P>
<P>
He also announced plans to hold rallies all over the world for
the cause of peace in Afghanistan, disclosing that first such
rally will be brought out in Islamabad in January.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Arabs Pledge to Extend Oil Output Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abu Dhabi, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Wednesday ended their 19th summit with
a pledge to extend existing oil output cuts until the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made in a joint communique issued at the end of
the three-day summit of the GCC which groups Bahrain, Kuwait,
Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The falling oil prices, which has had a negative impact
on the GCC economies, top the issues highlighted in the final
communique.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "urged other oil producers to take similar measures
in order to achieve stability in the market in the benefit of both
producing and consuming countries as well as for the safety and
stability of the world economy."
</P>
<P>
The communique said that if pledges on output cuts were
honored, the GCC member states would be ready to enter into proper
 arrangements with other oil exporting countries in order to bring
stability to the oil market.
</P>
<P>
"The council asserted the importance of oil producers to
abide by productions cuts they had pledged in June 1998 to
stabilize the oil market. Based on this, the Higher Council
agreed to extend work with production cuts pledged by its
states until the end of 1999," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
How to curb the falling oil prices that have left Gulf Arab
economies reeling dominated the summit held at a time when the
crude oil hit a historic low of less than 10 U.S. dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf oil producers, whose economies depends heavily on
oil earnings, have been hit hard by the sharp drop in prices
resulting from oversupply and flagging demand.
</P>
<P>
On internal economic aspects, a GCC long-term comprehensive
development strategy for the years 2000-2025 aimed at total
regional economic integration was one of the main points in the
comminique.

<HEADLINE> HK Secretary for Justice on Judicial Jurisdiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Justice Elsie
Leung clarified some basic principles of judicial jurisdiction in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in a motion
debate at the Legislative Council meeting here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting some people's concern that Hong Kong residents might be
tried in the mainland for offenses committed in Hong Kong or even
for acts which constitute offenses in the mainland but are not
unlawful in Hong Kong, Leung said: "There is no legal basis for
such concern."
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed two fundamental aspects of the principle of "one
country, two systems", saying that under Article 18 of the Basic
Law, the national laws of the People's Republic of China are not
applicable to the HKSAR, except for those listed in Annex III of
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Criminal Law is not so included and therefore does
not apply to the HKSAR, she said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Under Article 19 of the Basic Law, she said, the
courts of the HKSAR have jurisdiction over any person who is
alleged to have committed an offense under Hong Kong Law.
</P>
<P>
Neither of these two fundamental principles has been undermined
by the arrest and trial of Cheung Tze-Keung and his co-accused in
the mainland, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Leung noted that Cheung and co were tried not just for offenses
related to alleged kidnappings in Hong Kong, but also for offenses
involving the illegal sale and purchase of explosives and
smuggling of weapons and ammunition, which occurred in the
mainland where they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Although the kidnappings were allegedly perpetrated in Hong
Kong, they were planned in the mainland; the preparatory work,
including the purchase of vehicles, weapons and equipment for use
in the kidnappings, was carried out in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
She said it must clearly be understood that whereas Cheung
Tze-keung was sentenced to life imprisonment in respect of the
kidnapping offenses and the smuggling offense, it was only in
relation to the explosives offense that he received the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 6 of the Chinese Criminal Law, she said,
to plan an offense in the mainland which is to occur elsewhere is
treated as a criminal act justifiable in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
It is on the basis of these facts that the mainland judiciary
exercised jurisdiction over the case, she said.
</P>
<P>
Leung noted that how the Basic Law interfaces with the laws of
the People's Republic of China and the domestic law is an area of
uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
"One should adopt an open mind and explore into such sphere
zealously. Unjustifiable allegations that bring our legal system
into disrepute are not beneficial to the Special Administrative
Region," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> 53 Killed in Bus-Tanker Collision in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 53 people were
killed in one of the worst road accidents Wednesday when a
over-crowded bus collided head-on with an oil tanker in Bihar,
northeast India, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bus carrying supporters of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, or the
National People's Party, was returning from a rally in Patna,
capital of Bihar, when the tragedy occurred in Bhojpur district
of the state, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
While the district magistrate said the accident claimed at
least 53 lives, eyewitness said the toll would not be less than 75
as the bus was so over-crowded.
</P>
<P>
A PTI correspondent reported from the spot that five people,
who were standing near the bus door, could be rescued with 70
percent burns.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness said under the impact of the collision, the tanker
split into two and a blaze engulfed the vehicles immediately.
</P>
<P>
The blaze could only be put out by 15:30 local time, nine hours
after the tragedy occurred at 06:30, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the bus and the helper of the oil tanker, who
survived, said that people were seen traveling even on the
roof-top of the bus which had a seating capacity of 55.
</P>
<P>
A local police officer said five others suffered serious
injuries in the mishap which was followed by an explosion.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Universal Declaration of Human Rights: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- December 10, the World Human
Rights Day, will be marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration was one of the first
major achievements of the United Nations, and after half a century it
remains a powerful instrument which continues to exert an enormous
effect on people's lives worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in history that a document considered to
have universal value was adopted by an international organization. It
was also the first time that human rights and fundamental freedoms
were set forth in such detail. There was broad-based international
support for the Declaration when it was adopted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. document represented "a world milestone in the long
struggle for human rights," said a U.N. General Assembly
representative from France.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the Universal Declaration stems in large part from
the strong desire for peace in the aftermath of the World War II.
Although the 58 Member States which formed the United Nations at that
time varied in their ideologies, political systems and religious and
cultural backgrounds and had different patterns of socio-economic
development, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights represented a
common statement of goals and aspirations -- a vision of the world as
the international community would want it to become.
</P>
<P>
Since 1948, the Universal Declaration has been translated into
more than 200 languages and remains one of the best known and most
often cited human rights documents in the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Declaration has been used in the defense and
advancement of people's rights. Its principles have been enshrined in
and continue to inspire national legislation and the constitutions of
many newly independent states.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of this "Magna Carta for all
humanity." The theme of the 50th anniversary -- "All Human Rights for
All" -- highlights the universality, the indivisibility and the
interrelationship of all human rights.
</P>
<P>
It reinforces the idea that human rights -- civil, cultural,
economic, political and social -- should be taken in their totality
and not disassociated from one another.
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary is a time to promote public awareness of the
meaning of the Universal Declaration and its relevance to our daily
lives. Providing information about human rights in the languages
understood by peoples everywhere is one aspect of a global public
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Falling during the Decade of Human Rights Education (1995 -
2004), the anniversary also provides another focus for education and
action. In addition to the 200 language versions already available,
a number of other local language translations are to be released for
the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration is an opportunity
for people worldwide to commemorate the adoption of the landmark
document. It also represents an opportunity to mobilize all strata
of society in a reinvigorated and broad-based human rights movement.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of civil society and non-governmental
organizations in fighting for an demanding recognition of basic
rights has played a central role in the advancement and promotion of
human rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
National committees have already been set up in many countries,
with the aim of undertaking activities to mark the upcoming
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the recommendations made at the 1993 World
Conference on Human Rights for increased coordination within the U.N.
system, Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, said, "I will be a
champion of human rights and will ensure that human rights are fully
integrated in the action of the Organization of all other domains."
</P>
<P>
Human rights, indeed, cut across all the work of the United
Nations, from peacekeeping, child rights, health and development to
the rights of indigenous peoples to education, social development
and the eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Consultations have already taken place among all agencies and
programs of the United Nations, leading to strategies and campaigns
being devised.
</P>
<P>
CHALLENGES OF OUR ERA
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the United Nations, the promotion and
protection of human rights have been at its very core. Reference to
the promotion of and respect for human rights was made in Article 1
of the U.N. Charter and in the establishment of a commission for the
promotion of human rights, mentioned in Article 68 of the Charter.
</P>
<P>
During the past 50 years, the United Nations has created a wide
range of mechanisms for monitoring human rights violations.
Conventional mechanisms (treaty bodies) and extra-conventional
mechanisms (U.N. special rapporteurs, representatives, experts and
working groups) have been established in order to monitor compliance
of state parties with the various human rights abuse.
</P>
<P>
Challenges still lie ahead, despite many accomplishments in the
field of human rights. Many in the international community believe
the human rights, democracy and development are interwined.
Unless human rights are respected, the maintenance of
international peace and security and the promotion of economic and
social development cannot be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The world is still plagued with incidents of ethnic hatred and
acts of genocide. People are still victims of xenophobic attitudes,
are subjected to discrimination because of religion or gender and
suffer from exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Around the world, millions of people are still denied food,
shelter, access to medical care, education and work, and too many live
in extreme poverty. Their inherent humanity and dignity are not
recognized.
</P>
<P>
What's even worse, some Western countries, with an excuse of the
alleged protection of human rights, have repeatedly interfered in
internal affairs of the developing world. Therefore, the future of
human rights lies in our hands. We must act all in one to guard
against such human rights preachment.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India Fail to Reach Agreement on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India failed to
reach agreement Wednesday after two days of talks on trade issues
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
While Indian trade officials said that their market was open to
Bangladeshi exports, local businessmen here argued that the real
situation was quite different.
</P>
<P>
Tariff and non-tariff barriers, countervailing duties,
quantitative restrictions and canalization were some of the major
obstacles to increasing exports to India, they said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with visiting Indian Commerce Secretary P.P.
Prahbu Thursday, President of the Federation of Bangladeshi
Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) Abdul Mintoo claimed
that Bangladeshi exporters were not finding the Indian markets
accessible because of the barriers.
</P>
<P>
Flooding of local markets by Indian goods against a very poor
export of Bangladeshi items to India had widened the trade
imbalance between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Bangladesh imported goods
worth 937.69 million U.S. dollars from India against its exports
of only 65.58 million dollars during the 1997-98 fiscal year
ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed an imbalance of 872 million dollars against
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"Such a huge imbalance is not in the interest of sound trading
relationship and we fear that the situation may fast become
untenable," Mintoo told the Indian officials.
</P>
<P>
Referring to India's tariff cut and withdrawal of quantitative
restrictions on 2,000 items from export from SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) nations, the FBCCI chief
said, "These do not apply to Bangladesh in most cases."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that much remained for India to do in eliminating
non-tariff barriers for Bangladeshi products.
</P>
<P>
The Indian commerce secretary said that his country slashed
tariff under SAPTA (South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement)
negotiations by 50 percent across the board for goods coming from
SAARC countries, and in many cases, tariff concession was 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The maximum tariff concession under the SAPTA was given by
India," Prahbu said. "Access to Indian market is not the issue
today."
</P>
<P>
On trade imbalance, he said Indian exports to Bangladesh were
rising because it was offering goods at a competitive price. "It's
not true that we are deliberately trying to import less and export
more."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh mainly exports raw hides, leather, vegetable fat and
textile goods to India, and imports textile items, vegetable
products, mineral products, base metals, vehicles and consumer
items from India.

BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commissioner for
Foreign Affairs, Hans van den Broek, on Wednesday condemned the killing
of three Britons and a New Zealander in Chechnya was "senseless".

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Affairs Office Warns A Few Divisive Forces To Stop Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee's Taiwan Work Office and
the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office today warned a handful
of people in Taiwan to stop playing with fire in their attempts to
split the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted that a few of the Taiwan authorities have made
threatening remarks about separating Taiwan from the motherland by
holding a so-called referendum on the reunification issue and we
have also noticed that a few extreme separatists in favor
of 'Taiwan-Independence' in the city of Tainan recently held a
referendum on reunification and other issues," the spokesman said,
adding that the Taiwan Authorities have not taken effective steps
to stop this.
</P>
<P>
These is a dangerous example of "playing with fire" and a vain
attempt to use a referendum to stop the reunification of the
motherland and create "Taiwan independence," he said, "We firmly
oppose this and are issuing this stern warning to these divisive
forces."
</P>
<P>
There is only one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of
it. This is the common understanding of Taiwan compatriots and all
other Chinese, and recognized by the international community, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity are inseparable. That sovereignty includes Taiwan, the
Penghu, Chinmen and Matsu islands and these belong to all
Chinese, Taiwan compatriots included, and the reunification of the
motherland is the sacred historical mission of all Chinese people,
Taiwan compatriots included.
</P>
<P>
What Taiwan's divisive forces are doing is illegal, invalid,
and a futile attempt to oppose the reunification of China and to
change Taiwan's status as a part of China through a referendum, he
said.
</P>
<P>
These activities not only go against the will of the people on
both sides of the straits and seriously undermine the stability
and development of cross-straits relations, but will endanger the
safety of Taiwan compatriots as well as the peace and stability of
the Asia-Pacific Region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Taiwanese compatriots can tell the true nature of what
this divisiveness is supposedly doing in the name of democracy and
that with their patriotic tradition they will steadfastly guard
state sovereignty and territorial integrity and contribute to the
growth of cross-straits relations and push for the peaceful
reunification of the motherland," the spokesman concluded.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Invitation for European Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has rejected the
invitation of the European Union (EU) to European Conference,
Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Aracanli said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We won't participate in the European Conference because we
think the character and frame of this invitation is not
appropriate." Aracanli said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Turkey is opposed to the formation of the
European Conference from the very beginning, and to the EU stance
toward Turkey's request of a full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the EU decided in Luxembourg to reject Turkey as
a candidate for the EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"The EU summit decision, on certain point, was unfair,
sometimes biased and sometimes with the connotation of double
standards. Sometimes it was based on exaggerated allegations,"
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said.
</P>
<P>
The EU last year decided to invite Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus to start accession talks
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia were put on a
slower negotiating track by the 15-nation union, leaving Turkey, a
34-year applicant, completely in the cold.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Marks Human Rights Declaration Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi leaders Wednesday
issued separate messages to mark the 50th anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the
United Nations, which falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed said in his message that Bangladesh
aspires and strives to promote the global cause of freedom and
fulfill its obligations to create a more peaceful, tolerant,
secure and prosperous world for the succeeding generations.
</P>
<P>
The people of Bangladesh join the rest of the international
community to re-dedicate themselves to the universal goal of
protecting and upholding the fundamental freedom and basic human
rights, he stated.
</P>
<P>
He said that the achievements of international institutions,
states and the embryonic civil society in laying down precise
human rights norms and standards are commendable.
</P>
<P>
But there remains much for translating the declaration into
reality, he observed.
</P>
<P>
In her message, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called upon the
international community to come together on an integrated approach
 to the question of human rights so that every man, woman and
child can live in peace with fullest dignity and enjoy all their
freedom.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated Bangladesh's deep commitment and unequivocal
support to the principles and purposes of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"We remind ourselves that we had fought our liberation war of
independence for realization of the fundamental rights and freedom
for our people," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore an occasion "for us to take a renewed pledge
that the sacred ideals and goals set forth in the declaration are
translated into reality for every citizen of Bangladesh," and to
strive to secure those for the whole of mankind, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) announced here Wednesday that an OAU
military-security mission arrived in Moroni, capital of the
Comoros, in the day.
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release issued Wednesday said the
military-security team was sent urgently to the Federal Islamic
Republic of the Comoros following consultations between OAU

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Sweeps All-around Titles in Asiad Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China
captured both the men's and women's all-around titles in the
gymnastics competition of the Asian Games here on Wednesday,
sweeping all the four gold medals on offer so far in the teams'
and all-around contests.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Liu Yuan crowned as the all-around queen with a
total of 38.787 points by leading all the way through uneven bars,
beam, floor exercises and vault.
</P>
<P>
Irina Yevdokimova took the silver with 37.912 while Japan's
Risa Sugawara picked up the bronze in 37.300.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy because this is my first all-around title in
major international event," said Liu Xuan, the Chinese captain who
once considered her retirement after the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"So I really want to say thanks to my coach Lu Shanzhen because
it was him to encourage me to continue my carrer," said Liu, also
winner of the World Cup tournament early this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu single-handedly brought home the gold for China as her two
teammates, world floor champion Kui Yuanyuan and young talent Ling
Jie, both made big mistakes on their starting apparatuses and were
out of the gold contention after the first rotation.
</P>
<P>
"I saw their performances and I knew it was time for me to
stand out as the captain to do my duty," said Liu, whose flewless
display gave her an unbeatable 1.025 points lead after three
rotations.
</P>
<P>
"Liu Xuan is the only girl over 19 in our team," said Chinese
women's coach Lu Shanzhen, "She really save our team from an
empty-handed day with all her excellent performances. And I think
she has the potential to compete in next year's World
Championships or even the 2000 Olympics."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can still compete in 2000, but what I know
is that my desire to compete with all the world best gymnasts is
still there. That means even harder work after the Asian Games for
me," said Liu, who started gymnastics training at an age of five
in her hometown Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, Huang Xu surged ahead with a stable
performence on his last apparatus of the pommel horse to take the
men's top personal honor in 57.825 points.
</P>
<P>
China's Yang wei picked up the silver in 57.600 and Japan's
Tsukiahara brought the bronze with 57.375.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Huang Xu became the fourth Chinese gymnast to
win the men's all-around which China has been dominated since the
1978 Asian Game.
</P>
<P>
Huang, a member of China's 1997 world champion team,
established his lead from the first rotation where he started on
the rings and led all the way through four rotations before his
leading place was taken over by one-year younger Yang Wei after
five apparatuses.
</P>
<P>
Huang was 0.025 points behind Yang when he jumped on the pommel
horse. He received a good enough 9.575 points from a stable and
nearly flawless display to retain the lead to capture the Asiad
men's top honor.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Naoya Tsukahara, the bronze medalist in last year's
World Championship, followed closely the Chinese teenagers but
could not take over the lead with his low points of 9.350 and
9.400 on the horizontal bar and the floor.
</P>
<P>
China's has won both the men's and women's teams titles in
previous two-day competitions.

<HEADLINE> New Era For China's Rural Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organic Law on Village
Committees that took effect in early November is the result of 10
years of experimenting with the law and it means a new historic
period for China's rural democracy, according to Cao Zhi,
vice-chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The system of self-government created by villagers is now a
part of the country's legal system," Cao told a government forum
to promote on the law, and asked people to understand the
political significance of the law and the spirit of the Communist
Party's rural policies when implementing the law.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he said, the democratic elections of village
heads must be in strict accordance with the law, which is the key
to democratic policy making, self-government, and supervision.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who violates this and halts elections with violence or
other unfair means must be dealt with in accordance with the law,
Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Second, Cao acknowledged that, affairs that concern villagers'
interests must be made public.
</P>
<P>
What they worry most about is financial affairs, fees collected
by the town government and by village officials, profits,
collectively-owned businesses, the distribution of disaster relief
and aid in some places, and funds raised by villagers, Cao said.

<HEADLINE> 1/5 Households in Asia Receive Cable &AMP; Satellite TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- An estimated one in five
households in Asia subscribed to cable or satellite services in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Information and the Arts and Second
Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo made the announcement
Wednesday at the opening ceremony of the Cable &AMP; Satellite Asia
'98 and the Cable &AMP; Satellite Broadcasting Association of Asia
(CASBAA) Conference '98.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, CASBAA President S.K. Fung
confirmed that there are 90 million homes in Asia receiving cable
&AMP; satellite television and the number is expected to augment to
200 million homes, about 36 percent of households, by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
George Yeo said that the cable and satellite industries in Asia
have grown tremendously in the past years although this has been
moderated by the current economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Taking China for example, George Yeo said around 700 million
households in China are receiving cable services and this number
is expected to reach 100 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The cable penetration rate in major Chinese cities like
Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai is between 80 percent and 90
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said Singapore's Service of Cable Vision (SCV) would
have cabled 82 percent of all homes by the end of this year while
the current penetration rate for cable TV is about 17 percent of
all homes.
</P>
<P>
When SCV completes the wiring-up of the whole island by the end
of next year, George Yeo said, over 900,000 Singapore households
will have direct access not only to cable TV but to a whole range
of broadband services from fast Internet to electronic banking.
</P>
<P>
George Yeo said great demand offers tremendous opportunities
for the growth of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry
and digital technology, the convergence of broadcast and
communication, and the rapidly changing social, political and
economic landscape in Asia present huge challenges to the
industry.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold International Agriculture Exposition '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture will hold the China International Agricultural
Expo '99 in Beijing from September 23 to 28, 1999, Vice-minister
of Agriculture Wan Baorui said today, as part of the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
It will be a showcase of China's agricultural and rural
economic developments of the past 50 years, especially since
the reforms and opening-up began two decades ago. It will also
encourage exchanges and cooperation with other countries in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He says that the Asian financial crisis and the devastating
summer floods have had an impacts on China's economy, and
especially on agriculture, so the central government allocated
another 35 billion yuan (4.2 billion US dollars) this year for
agriculture, for seed breeding, poverty relief, irrigation, and
ecological protection projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's 860 million rural people are a vast market
with big potential and the Chinese government will further open up
the domestic market, improve the investment environment, and
create more favorable conditions for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
China had evolved 7,300 agricultural projects with contracts
worth 14 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment in the past
20 years. China's agricultural produce in 1997 was worth 24.7
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Upholds Palestinian Rights to Declare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua)-- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that Israel has no
right to stop the Palestinians from declaring an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
"They are telling us that we should not mention the
word 'state', but I told them we have said that word and have
declared it," Arafat was quoted by Israel Radio as telling
members of his Fatah movement in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also said that the date is drawing near
when Jerusalem becomes the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Arafat did not say, as before, that he
will unilaterally declare a state on May 4, 1999, when the interim
period stipulated by the Oslo accords terminates..
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have been engaged in a war of words in
the last few days over several issues concerning the
implementation of the Wye accord signed on October 23.
</P>
<P>
Israel threatened last week that it will not carry out the
second stage of redeployment stipulated in the accord, scheduled
next week, if the Palestinians fail to meet some conditions,
including a public pledge by Arafat that he will not unilaterally
declare Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Palestinians staged a general strike in
the West Bank to mark the 11th anniversary of the beginning of the
Intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), joined in the protest Wednesday by
starting a hunger strike at his home in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Several clashes broke out Wednesday in the West Bank and the
Arab East Jerusalem as Palestinian demonstrations aimed at
pressing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners continued but
scaled down.
</P>
<P>
At least one Israeli woman was injured by stones thrown by
Palestinian protesters, Israel Radio reported. Israeli soldiers
kept Israeli cars from driving on certain roads in the West Bank
to avoid possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, demanding the release of political prisoners,
are angry over Israel's inclusion of 150 common criminals in the
first group of 250 Palestinian prisoners freed in November
according to the new land-for-peace interim deal.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Israel had made a verbal promise
during the talks in the United States that all 750 prisoners to be
released will be political detainees, those who took part in
anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insisted that it had never agreed to release those
with "blood on their hands" or members of militant groups like
Hamas. Washington urged the two sides to resolve their difference
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The disputes, however, have sparked several days of protests
and clashes in the West Bank and Gaza strip, which were called by
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon as a "new intifada," during
which scores of people have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner issue is highly emotional because it touches
nearly all Palestinian families. Almost every family has had a
member or relative arrested at some point since 1967, when Israel
seized the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reports said Yassin was also protesting against
the PNA over their treatment of him and other Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
Yassin has been put under a house arrest and hundreds of Hamas
activists have been detained by the PNA since the signing of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, under which the Palestinians are
obligated to crack down militant groups in exchange for Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.

his extramarital affair was "sinful" and his sworn testimony
"maddening."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Three Games Records Fall as China Upstages Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Three Asian Games' records were
broken here on Wednesday when the Chinese swimmers upstaged their
Japanese rivals 3-2 in the gold hunt.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old teenager Chen Hua had a morale-boosting start
for China when she won the women's 400m freestyle in four minutes
and 12.31 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time also beat the former games mark of 4:13.55,
set by her Compatriot Yan Ming in Beijing eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Scachiko Yamada won the silver in 4:14.53, with Tsai Shu-Min
third in 4:15.66.
</P>
<P>
"I caught a fever before the match and I haven't expected to
win," Chen said. "I just wanted to do my best."
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal of Chen Yan put a lot of pressure upon me,
perhaps this helps me much in the match."
</P>
<P>
The gold of the following event went to Japan when 22-year-old
Shunsuke Ito clocked 51.29 to win the men's 100m freestyle,
beating China's Zhao Lifeng into the third place.
</P>
<P>
Shunsuke's younger twin brother Shusuke Ito was second in
52.07. Zhao came in third in 52.21.
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely happy to win the gold for Japan," said Shunsuke.
</P>
<P>
But Shusuke was as pleased. He quipped: "I'm always second to
my elder brother. I'm determined to beat him next time."
</P>
<P>
It was Tomoko Hagiwara who stole the limelight on Wednesday
when she beat favored Mai Nakamura to win the women's 100m
backstroke.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Japanese finished in 1:01.84 for the gold. Team
mate Nakamura, silver medallist in the World Championships in
Perth, Australia in January, had to settle for second in 1:02.11.
Choi Soo-Min of South Korea was third in 1:03.37.
</P>
<P>
"As everybody expected Nakamura to win, I was very surprised
when I found I have won the gold," said Hagiwara. "I just wanted
to do my best, never expect to beat Nakamura."
</P>
<P>
"When I touched home, I looked at the screen to see my time. I
saw I won, " She said. "It's really a surprise."
</P>
<P>
Fu Yong measured up to the pre-match tippings as he clinched
the gold of the men's 200m backstroke in style.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Chinese, whom head coach Zhang Xiong said would
be sure to win in this event, retook the lead from Malaysia's Lim
Keng-Liat in the 100-meter mark and never relinquished it.
</P>
<P>
His winning time of 1:59.30, the fourth best of the year, also
broke the old games record of 2:00.65, which was set by South
Korean Ji Sang-Joon in Hiroshima in 1994. Keng-Liat came in second
in 2:00.94, with Raymond Papa of the Philippines third in 2:01.80.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimmers put on the finish winning note by beating
their own games record to win the women's 4x100m freestyle relay
race in 3:45.51. The former mark of 3:46.39 was also set in
Beijing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Japan finished second in 3:47.65 and Chinese Taipei came in
third in 3:51.48.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiong was satisfied with his swimmers' performance. "Chen
Hua opened a good start for us, and her win greatly boosted our
morale."
</P>
<P>
"Our Chinese swimmers' performances moved up a step compared to
their medicore show yesterday," he added.
</P>
<P>
China only managed five silvers to Japan's four golds in five
swimming events on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Japanese WWII Chemical Weapons Still Injuring Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Chinese have
been hurt by chemical weapons left behind by Japanese troops from
their invasion in China half a century ago, and some have died as
a result, according to a 400-page report from the Heilongjiang
People's Publishing House, "History of Japan's Chemical War".
</P>
<P>
One of the people who helped prepare it says that the fact that
there are still bombs around affecting city construction work,
government work, classroom order.
</P>
<P>
Japan began its chemical weapons research in 1915 and used the
weapons on a large scale during the invasion of China from
1937-1945. Japanese troops used the weapons in 16 major battles
and in experiments with human beings as live targets.
</P>
<P>
After the end of World War II, many chemical weapons were left
behind and the Chinese government does not know their location or
number, the report says.
</P>
<P>
For the past four decades, chemical weapons have been
discovered in many places. Between 1990 and 1993, people in east
China's Zhejiang province discovered Japanese gas bombs while
draining a canal. In 1991, about 50 gas bombs that were unearthed
on a middle school campus in north China's Hebei province
injuried 20 students.
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, Li Chen, a sailor, has lived a painful
existence because of a Japanese bomb. Li and 34 others were
injuried by the bomb while draining a river in Heilongjiang
province in northeastern China in 1974. Li was burned over 90
percent of his body and even today occasionally has problems with
his skin. He says that sometimes he wants to kill himself just to
find relief from the pain.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the Chinese government has signed agreements
with the Japanese on ways to deal with the problem. But, because
of the silence of officers and soldiers from that time, the
location and number of the bombs remain a mystery.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Japan in Asiad Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Newly-crowned Asian champion
China overwhelmed its main rival Japan in the 13th Asian Games'
men's volleyball group match here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese received little resistance from the Japanese in the
first set which they won 15-3 with ease.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese came into life in the second set and
dominated the match in most of the time. Though the Chinese tried
to catch up, the Japanese took their revenge by winning the set
16-14.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, though still not recovered from the World
Championships last month, showed hundreds of enthusiastic Thai
fans that they are the real No. 1 in Asia by winning the following
two sets 15-9 and 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Wang Jiawei said after the match that he was
quite satisfied with the performance of the players.
</P>
<P>
"If we can take the second set, I will be 100 percent
satisfied," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said apart from the physical exhaustion, the Chinese
players were also under great psychological pressure from the
crown of Asian champion.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping the championship is more difficult than winning it.
You have to overpass yourself first," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy to see the Chinese young players showing
their best under such a circumstance.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, China won all the three group matches against
India, Pakistan and Japan in Pool B and will also meet Kazakhstan
in the same group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea and Chinese Taipei also won their
respective matches in straight sets in Group A which includes
Thailand, Indonesia and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Wang Xianbo Takes Dramatic Win for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Wang Xianbo scored a dramatic
win over Japanese Kimoto Nami in the women's 63 kilograms judo
category at the Asian Games here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, Olympic bronze medalist in 1996, dominated the less known
Kimoto from the start and looked sure to win.
</P>
<P>
But at the ringing of bell, Kimoto, cheered by a boisterous
crowd on the stand, used all her strength to throw the 22-year-old
Chinese onto the mat.
</P>
<P>
The referee immediately ruled Kimoto the winner. The Japanese
fans, coaches and athletes roared but all the Chinese were angered.
</P>
<P>
Wang's coach Wu Weifeng jumped to the mat and questioned the three
judges, while Wang appeared shocked, knees down with the head in
her hands.
</P>
<P>
"I only regret I should never slacken off in the final
seconds," the tearful Wang said. "But I heard the bell. I thought
the match had ended."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese officials submitted their protest to the
arbitration panel, which changed the original ruling and gave the
gold medal to Wang after 10 minutes of discussion.
</P>
<P>
"The gold medal should belong to me," Wang choked. "From the
start to the end, I was holding an andvantage."

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges NATO to Act With U.N. Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Wednesday warned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to resort to force only with the mandate of the United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov was stressing the necessity of using international law
as the basis for the alliance's new strategic concept at the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force should be based on the United Nations
Security Council resolutions and any (NATO) decision to use force
has to be taken within the framework of the United Nations Charter
Article Seven," said Ivanov, who was participating in the council
for the first time as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that he made clear to NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana Russia's views on some basic points that would form the new
strategic concept of the western military alliance, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the NATO strategy should not result in setting
up new divisions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov reiterated that Russia is strongly opposed to NATO
enlargement into the former Soviet republics in the Baltic region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia's approach to this issue was made well
known before the Madrid summit when NATO invited Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic to start accession talks.
</P>
<P>
"Our approach remains the same as before Madrid," said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia agreed on Wednesday that necessary steps should
be undertaken to complete the adaptation of the Treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) in accordance with the
declaration issued by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the work of the permanent joint council, Ivanov
said that the council had achieved "quite a lot" in the past year
though neither side was 100 percent satisfied.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the council was only "an institution for
consultation" and neither side had the right to veto.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Russia was still waiting for technical
problems to be redressed before it could confirm readiness to
participate in the aerial verification led by NATO in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> HK's Population Estimated to Rise to 7.54 Million in Mid-2008 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's population is
projected to increase from an estimate of 6.68 million in mid-1998
to 7.54 million in mid-2008, Katherine Fok, secretary for health
and welfare, said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This represents an average annual growth rate of around 1.2
percent or an overall increase in population of 863,000 over the
ten-year period, Fok said in a written reply to a question in the
Legislative Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
She said that natural increase accounts for around 28 percent
of the projected population growth while balance of arrivals over
departures accounts for the remaining 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fok said that the fertility rate of Hong Kong is already one of
the lowest in the world, having dropped from 1.37 per reproductive
age woman in 1986 to 1.19 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of births registered per year has decreased in the
past 10 years from 73,030 (13 per thousand population) in 1988 to
60,379 (9.3 per thousand population) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This suggested that the concept of family planning is well
accepted by the public, she said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey done in 1997 showed that the percentage of a
representative sample of 1,511 married women practicing
contraception has risen from 72 percent in 1977 to 86 percent in
1997.

CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The total insurance subscriptions in the Saudi market
last year nearly doubled the previous year's figure to reach 5.1 billion
rials (760 million dollars), the "Al Hayat" newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Company of Cooperative Insurance released the
statistics it gathered. The figures justified the growth of
insurance subscriptions in the market to the "distinguished
growth" in the car and medical insurances in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, subscriptions in all other insurance branches
had declined.
</P>
<P>
Insurance market sources attributed the insurance decline to
static insurance awareness in Saudi Arabia, on the one hand, and
to the concentration of promotion efforts and attention on the
part of government departments on car and medical insurances, on
the other other.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Secretary General of the Doha-based Gulf Industrial
Investment Organization Abdul Rahman Al Jifri has called for the

<P>
Jifri stated that industrial investments in the GCC states
increased from 28.5 billion dollars in 1988 to 80 billion dollars
in 1998, at an annual rate of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of industrial establishments in the
GCC states grew from 4,692 in 1988 to over 7,359 in 1998, outside
the petroleum sector. Likewise, the work force created by these
industries has increased in volume, from 253,000 workers to over
567,000 workers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jifri pointed out that total foreign investments in joint
industrial ventures in the GCC states by the end of 1998 would
reach 16 billion dollars, whereas local investments in these
projects stood at 23 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- The Gulf helicopter company, a Qatari joint stock
company with a paid capital of 66 million Qatari rials (about 18
million dollars) has been established, it was announced in Qatar.

percentage points higher than the government's prediction, the
semi-official Jordan Times quoted an unnamed official as saying.

The deficit now accounts for 9.3 percent of the gross domestic
product while the government's prediction a few weeks ago was

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A vaccine for the highly
contagious chicken pox disease will be available in Canada in
early January.
</P>
<P>
Merck Frosst Canada Inc., which developed the vaccine, said
Tuesday that it has been approved by the health
authorities for use on healthy people over one year old.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is expected to be about 62 Canadian dollars (40

Chicken pox, a member of the herpes family, afflicts 350,000
Canadians a year, said Stanley Read, chief of the infectious
diseases divisions at the Hospital for Sick Children, in Toronto.
</P>

danger, serious complications can arise from the viral infection,
which can sometimes result in death.

<HEADLINE> Luxury Cars Doing Well In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The new Mercedes-Benz S-model
went on sale in Beijing Monday for a fast-growing luxury car
market.
</P>
<P>
And, last week, Volvo put its lastest models on the China
market. Other luxury car makers like BMW and General Motors
released their models earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The president of Mercedes-Benz China Limited. says that
Mercedes sells more than 4,500 cars annually in China and that the
three S-Class models will probably be welcomed by Chinese
consumers.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to crisis-hit Southeast Asia, China's
Mercedes sales have continued to rise since the Daimler-Benz and
Chrysler merger, he says. Their marketing strategy in China is
long-term, he says, and a booming economy will no doubt help sales.
</P>
<P>
Companies and money-making individuals have been replacing
government institutions as luxury car buyers for the past several
years, after the ban on expensive purchase by government officials.
</P>
<P>
Volvo is targeting the individual consumer with a strong need
for self-development and exploration, says Leif Engstrom, Volvo's
chief representative in China. The company launched its S80 model
this June to increase its competitiveness. In the past ten years,
Volvo has gained quite a reputation in China, Engstrom says.
</P>
<P>
Volvo began selling cars for taxis in major Chinese cities in
the mid-1980s and has designated retailers in southern, central,
eastern and northeastern parts of the country. It is looking for
ways to produce cars in China.
</P>
<P>
The Benz S500 currently sells for 2.2 million yuan in China,
more than 10 times the price of sedans produced by joint ventures.

<P>
ABU DHABI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Leaders on Wednesday
ended their 19th summit with a call for actions to shore up the
falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a joint communique issued at the end of
the three-day summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council which groups
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the leaders of the six GCC states discussed
ways to prop up oil prices, joint security and economic
cooperation, the situation in Iraq, relations with Iran, the
Middle East peace process and other related issues.
</P>
<P>
How to curb the collapse of the oil prices that has left Gulf
Arab economies reeling dominated the summit which was held when
the crude oil fell to a historic low of less than 10 U.S. dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and leading power in
the GCC, urged its neighbors to adopt a united and strong position
on the world market and make their weight felt in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
It was time to do something about the low oil prices, Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz said at the annual summit.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf oil producers, whose economy depends heavily on oil
earnings, have been hit hard by the sharp drop in oil prices
resulting from oversupply and flagging demand.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Stage Mock Raids on Lebanese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli fighter-bombers
Wednesday buzzed several main cities of Lebanon, including the
capital of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli jet flew to Beirut at 9:10 a.m. (0710 GMT) and
crashed the sound barrier in two low-level flights. Sonic booms
shook many parts of the city where windows and doors of buildings
were severely jolted.
</P>
<P>
In the country's third largest city of Sidon, about 40
kilometers south of the capital, a thunderous mock raid at dawn
had forced thousands of residents out of bed to scurry to
basements as the Israeli jets howled overhead for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Similar mock air raids were also staged over south Lebanon's
densely populated market town of Nabatiyeh, the Orient radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli violent act is designed as a warning against
Lebanese government and the resistance movement after a wave of
deaths Israeli forces suffered last month, said foreign diplomats
here.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a total of seven Israeli soldiers were killed in
less than 10 days by Hezbollah guerrillas' bomb ambush inside the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Iran, is leading a
guerrilla war to oust Israeli forces from south Lebanon where
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The mounting casualties have rekindled heated debate in Israel
over whether it is wise to continue military presence in the
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
government insist that Israeli forces will not pull out from south
Lebanon unless Beirut agrees to guarantee security for Israel's
north.

<HEADLINE> Iraq-UNSCOM Dispute Occurs in Surprise Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A dispute occurred Wednesday
when an inspection team of the U.N. Special Commission on
disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) tried to enter one of the ruling Baath
Party headquarters "in a provocative way," said an Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, head of the Iraqi liaison U.N. arms
inspectors, said in a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency
that at 9 a.m. (0600 GMT) that one of the inspection teams tried,
without prior notice, to enter one of the party headquarters in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Ameen added that a party comrade there asked the inspection
team to write the materials or things that they intended to
inspect, but the team rejected the demand and left the site.
</P>
<P>
"Do UNSCOM elements need to search for materials pertaining to
the process of scrapping weapons of mass destruction in
headquarters of political parties?" Ameen asked.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official stressed that such provocative and
surprising style practiced by UNSCOM inspection teams was aimed at
fabricating crises and problems.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler said in New York Monday that
surprise inspections that would be carried out in this week and
early next week were to test Iraq's promise of full cooperation
with U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that he had renewed work in four areas, namely
access to document, monitoring, interviews and visits to
so-called "capable sites" which might have potential for use for
forbidden purposes.
</P>
<P>
The fifth area was investigation of sites where prohibited
weapons programs might exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional resumption of
cooperation with U.N. arms inspections it suspended three months
ago. By doing that, Iraq narrowly escaped the U.S.-led air
strikes against it.

<HEADLINE> Dow Corning Increase Presence in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Dow Corning, one of the world's
leading silicon products producers, is taking China as a key to
its development strategy for the 21st century, according to
Richard Hoover, president of the company's Asian operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the company has gone through some difficult times in
its Asian operations for the past two years, and is looking toward
a major expansion in the region in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Dow Corning invested several hundred million yuan in
the Songjiang Silicon Manufacturing Factory in Shanghai. It has
also opened a representative office in Chengdu in southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
At present, the company's products enjoy a remarkable share of
the market in textiles, construction, automobiles, rubber,
plastics and other manufacturing industries. Corning accounts for
over 90 percent of the sealing rubber market in the country's
construction industry.
</P>
<P>
It now has one solely owned company, two representative
offices, and one factory in China.
</P>
<P>
The company's silicon products have become major ingredients in
cosmetics and personal care products in China.
</P>
<P>
A senior technician from Procter and Gamble (P&AMP;G) said their
new shampoo uses Dow Corning silicon products to achieve better
moisturizing and protecting effects.
</P>
<P>
A P&AMP;G official noted that in the past, Dow Corning focused on
large customers and refused to accept small orders.
</P>
<P>
However, the company has apparently strengthened its services
for small- and medium-sized customers. It invited representatives
from more than 100 Chinese enterprises to a Beijing workshop
meeting with the theme of "serving customers in a changing Asian
market."
</P>
<P>
At the workshop meeting, Corning announced that it will offer
training and education programs to its customers' employees in
China. It also sponsors several doctoral-candidate graduate
students at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other Chinese
universities.
</P>
<P>
"We will take providing extraordinary service to our customers
in China, and in the rest of Asia, as a new key focus to enhance
our competitive edge," Hoover said.

HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong official said
here Wednesday that the average level of free chlorine residue of
Hong Kong's potable water complies with the World Health
Organization's (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (1993).
</P>
<P>
WHO required that the level should not exceed 5 mg per liter of
water while Hong Kong's level was about 1 mg, said Kwong Hon-sang,
Secretary for Works, in a written reply to a question in the
Legislative Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the level of trichloromethane in Hong
Kong's drinking water caused minimal health risk to human beings.
Trichloromethane is a substance formed when chlorine reacts with
other impurities in raw water.
</P>
<P>
"Records of the Water Supplies Department show that a
trichloromethane level below 50 micrograms per liter of water has
been maintained for many years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The requirement of WHO's guidelines is not to exceed 200
micrograms.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Protected by Basic Law in HK: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China said
here Wednesday that human rights are protected by the
constitutional document of Basic Law in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a long tradition of respecting and safeguarding
human rights, Tung said in a written statement Wednesday, the day
prior to the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The rights proclaimed in the declaration have been given legal
substance through the International Covenant of Civil and
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social, and Cultural Rights, both of which have applied to Hong
Kong for more than 20 years and are entrenched in the Basic Law,
Tung noted in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement will be included in a special publication to mark
the occasion, to be distributed by the Home Affairs Bureau of the
SAR to the public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Together, the declaration and the two covenants comprise the
International Bill of Rights, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was born into a world that had barely emerged
from the Second World War - a war in which there had been more
fatalities than in any human conflict before or since, a war that
had spawned new depths of inhumanity, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, the world desperately needed an affirmation of right
values and a reassurance that simple human decency still
prevailed: a covenant among the nations proclaiming their common
goal to do better by the peoples of the earth, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We salute the noble and laudable aims of those who formulated
the Universal Declaration," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
"We, in Hong Kong, are indeed fortunate to live in a society
where human rights - founded on the bedrock of the rule of law -
are woven into the very fabric of our lives," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the chief executive reminded people that every right
entails, as its natural concomitant, a corresponding duty.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains a robust and lively community where people
have no hesitation in speaking their minds, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything to protect and preserve these rights,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"But we should also be mindful of the vision of those who
drafted the Universal Declaration, that we also owe a duty to the
community which nurtures and forms us, and without which our lives
would be without substance," Tung concluded.

<HEADLINE> Russia Successfully Test Launches New ICBM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Russian strategic missile
force has successfully test launched a new Topol-M
intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk launching
center in northern Russia, Interfax reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The launch reaffirmed the main flight and technical
parameters of the missile, which are unique to the Topol-M, and
completed "a key stage in developing the missile complex of the
21st century", the force's press service said.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth test launch of the Topol-M missile.
</P>
<P>
Russia is counting on the Topol-M missile to equip its
strategic missile force for the next century as most of its
ballistic missiles currently in service have outlived their
service life.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Perminov, chief of the strategic missile force's
general staff, said late November that 58 percent of the missiles
have outlived their service life.
</P>
<P>
"The service life of almost 70 percent of space probes, 90
percent of ground services and one third of launch systems is also
over," Perminov said.
</P>
<P>
The first regiment equipped with 10 new Topol-M missiles in
Tatishchevo will come on duty this year, force commander
Colonel-General Vladimir Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who oversees the
country's military industry complex, said last Friday the
strategic missile force would acquire 10 more Topol-M missiles
next year. By the year 2000, Russia plans to have 40 Topol-M
missiles in service.

<HEADLINE> Railway Transport Business Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China's railway transport
business has been increasing since the Ministry of Railways
adopted several new measures including increased train speed and
improved services.
</P>
<P>
Trains carried a total of 77,200 cargo cars a day on average in
November, a monthly high for the year, according to ministry
statistics.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.4 million passengers traveled by train daily on
average last month, including 604,000 passengers whose one-way
journeys exceeded 500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Trains also transported 31,500 cars of coal and 298,200 TEUs
(twenty-foot equivalent units) of containers. The transport of
other key materials, such as oil, timber and cotton, all exceeded
their target amounts.
</P>
<P>
Many travelers have been turning to highways or air travel in
the past few years for faster and more comfortable service,
causing annual railway transport volume to plummet.
</P>
<P>
China will spend more than 40 billion yuan (4.83 billion US
dollars) to build railways this year, with an emphasis on railways
in southwestern China, such as the rail lines between Liupanshui
to the city of Zhuzhou, between Neijiang and Kunming, and between
Daxian county and Wanxian county.

<HEADLINE> Central Economic Conference (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conference called for attention to be paid to four major
issues for improving economic activities in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, while ensuring the continuation of an appropriately
paced economic growth, efforts should be focused on making the
best use of the existing economic structure while at the same time
improving the quality and efficiency of growth overall.
</P>
<P>
It is accepted that fairly fast growth can generate more jobs,
increase revenues, improve the living standards of people. It may
also contribute to solving problems arising from the current
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the prevailing conditions of a socialist
market economy, the speed of economic development should be
measured and set against agreed forecasts and should be market-led
rather than imposed in a mandatory manner. It should also be based
on reality, be well coordinated and highly efficient.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to improve domestic demand and expand the domestic
market will be a basic policy platform within a long-term economic
strategy.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to increase the central government's
investment, more measures will be taken to encourage the
investment portfolio of enterprises, collectives and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, further efforts will be made to expand urban and
rural markets and nurture new consumer hot spots to stimulate even
more consumption.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, active fiscal and monetary policies will be
implemented with the aim of encouraging and domestic demand and
expand domestic market. A key task is to make sure that increased
investment funds will be used for infrastructure construction in
an efficient way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts will be introduced to assist the improvement
of tax collection.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the conference declared that close attention should
be paid to guaranteeing social and political stability, while
deepening the reforms and promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
All Party members, especially leading Party officials at
different levels, should take economic work as the central issue
and firmly push forward the reform and opening drive, while
sticking to the Four Cardinal Principles.
</P>
<P>
The timing and extent of reform measures must always be well
thought out in accordance with the capacity of the public and with
due considerations on coordination between various
measures.

<HEADLINE> China Develops First Window-Cleaning Robot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Technology widely used on
aircraft propellors has been adapted by Chinese engineers to
develop a special robot for cleaning the outside windows of
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected to do away with human cleaners who have to hang
precariously on the outside of tall buildings and should greatly
increase efficiency," said Zhang Qixian, a professor with the
Robot Institute of Beijing University of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
"Technically it was difficult to develop such a robot. Foreign
engineers have tried by using suction pads but they restricted the
robots movements," explained Doctor Tang Shiming, one of the main
inventors of the new window-cleaning robot.
</P>
<P>
"We use a ducted fan, which works like a propeller, to produce
thrust at the direction of the wall which makes the robot adhere
to the structure," said Tang, adding that "with the help of four
wheels and a cable hoist, the robot can move horizontally and
vertically."
</P>
<P>
"Experiments have proved that it can also handle obstacles like
window frames," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the robot does not resemble a human -- it is a cuboid,
0.78 meters long, 0.53 meters wide and 0.25 meters high and
weighing 10 kilograms -- it can imitate a human's way of cleaning
windows.
</P>
<P>
In further experiments it demonstrated that it can clean an
area of 10 square meters every minute, nearly 10 times faster than
a human.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Qixian, the robot is still in the
experimental stage and now his engineering experts plan to equip
it with a remote control system and waste detergent recycling
device.
</P>
<P>
Apart from windows in skyscrapers, the robot can also clean
marble walls and ceramic tiles, Mr Zhang revealed.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Chinese Economy Expected To Enjoy Further Improvement (1) By Chen Xin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- All major economic indicators
show that China's economy is likely to maintain its current
momentum next year provided the world economic situation doesn't
deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy has enjoyed an accelerated pace of
development since the middle of the year, thanks to the central
government's series of overall economic control measures to offset
the negative influences of the Southeast Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The major economic indicators, especially fixed assets
investment and industrial output, have all bounced back up from
their previous low ebb. With the increase in demand, industrial
output nationwide has picked up in recent months.
</P>
<P>
As the year draws to a close, Chinese economic pundits are
examining and commenting on the country's year long performance.
Mainstream economists are already projecting that this year's
economic growth rate will fall within the range of 7.5 percent to
eight percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year the growth rate stood at seven
percent, only one percent short of the set target.
</P>
<P>
Fan Jianping, an expert from the State Development Planning
Commission's macro economic research institute, sounded a most
positive note about the economy's performance, which has seen it
stand firm against the huge pressures exerted in the export sector
as a result of the continuing Asian financial crisis. It also took
a hammering due to the severe floodings across the country this
summer.
</P>
<P>
Mr Fan said that China has made flexible adjustments to its
monetary and fiscal policies since the beginning of the year, when
the adverse influences of the world's economic problems were
gathering like storm clouds on the country's borders.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the central bank has lowered interest rates three
times within the year, an extreme rarity in the past, adding that
the government has also adopted more drastic fiscal measures since
the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
In view of poor domestic demand and a shrinking monetary
supply, the Chinese government issued 100 billion yuan in
long-term treasury bonds, along with a number of banks which
provided a further 100 billion yuan in loans, which are earmarked
for the expansion and construction of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"These measures have worked tangible miracles on the economy,"
Fan said.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review - Chinese Economy Expected To Enjoy Further Improvement (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The upturn in the Chinese economy in the second half of the
year is a result of the flexible interaction of policies to
increase domestic demand and counter the negative effects of the
current difficult world economic and financial situation," he
said. "That situation will continue to dominate next
year's economy." he added.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts agree that the country's measures to ignite
domestic demand have yet to make an impact on the coming year but
they are confident of the positive effects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, this year's severe floodings can also
be actually interpreted as good tidings for the national economy's
speedy growth because the rebuilding of homes and resumption of
production have created enormous demand for materials and services.
</P>
<P>
Predictions by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences indicate
that the growth rate for investment will likely remain above 15
percent, which contributes at least three to five percentage
points to the GDP growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, increased consumer demand will add about four to
four and a half percentage points, taking into account the effect
of increased investment next year. The academy pointed out that
changes in consumer demand lag behind by more than a year those
affecting investment in China.
</P>
<P>
And these calculations do not yet include the effects of the
central banks' interest rate reduction three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts believe that although it is difficult to
accurately assess the effects of the latest interest rate drop, it
is safe to assume that more ordinary people will divert their
savings into investments and consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
They play down the role of exports in propelling forward the
national economy, and declare that the country's import and export
levels will even out or end up in a slight surplus next year.
</P>
<P>
A cautious optimism on next year's national economic
performance therefore prevails within the ranks of most Chinese
economists.
</P>
<P>
They remain alert, though, to the influences of the Asian
financial crisis and possible changes in the economies of major
western industrial nations, because they can exert unpredictable
influences on China, especially as the world economy becomes more
integrated.

<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday called on former first lady Imelda Marcos to
produce documentary evidence for her family's ownership in more
than 100 blue-chip companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Without such solid proof, the president said, her claims would
remain as mere "hearsay."
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that Mrs. Marcos should be ready to make
all her assertions under oath.
</P>
<P>
He also down-played concerns that Mrs. Marcos' claims to stocks
in Philippine Airlines will affect ongoing negotiations for
capital infusion into the financially-burdened flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos had said the Marcoses own "in whole or in part"
over a hundred firms engaged in power retailing,
telecommunications, banking, tourism, shipping, insurance, real
estate and the print and broadcast media.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo Zamora, Secretary of Executive of the Philippines, said
Wednesday morning that the Estrada administration will adopt a
wait-and-see stance on Mrs. Marcos' claims to various
corporations.

<HEADLINE> Central Economic Conference (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conference called for attention to be paid to four major
issues for improving economic activities in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, while ensuring the continuation of an appropriately
paced economic growth, efforts should be focused on making the
best use of the existing economic structure while at the same time
improving the quality and efficiency of growth overall.
</P>
<P>
It is accepted that fairly fast growth can generate more jobs,
increase revenues, improve the living standards of people. It may
also contribute to solving problems arising from the current
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the prevailing conditions of a socialist
market economy, the speed of economic development should be
measured and set against agreed forecasts and should be market-led
rather than imposed in a mandatory manner. It should also be based
on reality, be well coordinated and highly efficient.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to improve domestic demand and expand the domestic
market will be a basic policy platform within a long-term economic
strategy.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to increase the central government's
investment, more measures will be taken to encourage the
investment portfolio of enterprises, collectives and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, further efforts will be made to expand urban and
rural markets and nurture new consumer hot spots to stimulate even
more consumption.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, active fiscal and monetary policies will be
implemented with the aim of encouraging and domestic demand and
expand domestic market. A key task is to make sure that increased
investment funds will be used for infrastructure construction in
an efficient way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts will be introduced to assist the improvement
of tax collection.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the conference declared that close attention should
be paid to guaranteeing social and political stability, while
deepening the reforms and promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
All Party members, especially leading Party officials at
different levels, should take economic work as the central issue
and firmly push forward the reform and opening drive, while
sticking to the Four Cardinal Principles.
</P>
<P>
The timing and extent of reform measures must always be well
thought out in accordance with the capacity of the public and with
due considerations on coordination between various
measures.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Central Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, is to publish an editorial Thursday on the
Central Conference on Economic Work which was held in Beijing from
December 7-9.
</P>
<P>
The conference summed up the country's economic work in 1998,
analysed the current international and domestic situation, and
outlined the requirements for next year's economic work.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Being Determined and Pressing Forward
Despite Difficulties to Win New Victories in Reform and
Construction," hails the conference as important for pushing
forward the current reform and opening and the country's
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The editorial praises the CPC Central Committee for its timely
and correct decision to tackle the difficult situation caused by
the financial turmoil in Asia and the devastating summer floods
through stimulating domestic demand and utilizing macroeconomic
means to achieve steady economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It attributes the remarkable achievements China has made in
1998 to the foundation laid by the 20-year-old reform and opening
drive, the timely and correct policy of the CPC Central Committee,
and the hard efforts made by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Next year will be of special importance to the current reform and
opening and modernization drive and the history of the Party and
the nation, the editorial says, adding that economic work in 1999
will be of great importance as well.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve sustained, speedy and healthy economic
development, the conference put forward some general requirements
for 1999. It called for enlarged domestic demand, stabilized and
reinforced agriculture, restructured state enterprises, increased
exports, and minimized financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urged recognition of both the favorable and
negative sides of the current international and domestical
situation, and a deeper understand of central economic policies.
</P>
<P>
It also called for relying on the masses in order to bring
their enthusiasm and creativity into full play and urged leading
officials at all levels to be concerned with the life of the
masses, especially factory layoffs in cities and people living in
disaster-stricken and poverty areas. The leaders should remain
forthright, go deep into the grassroot units, and work with the
masses, it stresses.
</P>
<P>
The Party's leadership in the area of economic work should be
strengthened and improved, the editorial said, noting that China
is carrying out its socialist modernization drive while the world
is tending toward multi-polarization and economic globalization.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Party Threatens to Pull out Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A major Nigerian political
party, the All People's Party (APP), has threatened to pull out
the transition to civil rule program if foul plays in the
just-concluded local government elections were not redressed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a party meeting in capital Abuja Tuesday, APP
Chairman Mahmud Waziri said that the election last Saturday is a
sham and that the party has lost total confidence in the
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"APP must reconsider its participation in the on-going
transition program if we can no longer be accommodated in the
system," he was quoted by Wednesday's New Nigerian newspaper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Waziri said that many APP candidates are now in hospitals
because of gunshots they received from security agents and thugs
employed by the People's Democratic Party (PDP), which emerged as
the winner of the elections.
</P>
<P>
"All known electoral guidelines were openly flouted, with
members of the APP harassed and brutalized by agents of
government masquerading as security chiefs," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to results so far released by the INEC, the PDP won
over 400 local council chairmanship seats, out of a total of 774,
the APP secured about 160 seats and another party, the Alliance
for Democracy, bagged about 95 seats.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the six provisionally registered parties won only
one or two seats each, and are almost sure to be scrapped by the
INEC according to guidelines released earlier.
</P>
<P>
The INEC is expected to address a press conference on the
election in Abuja Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Central Economic Conference Held in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China has made major economic
progress throughout 1998, delegates to a special conference held
in Beijing this week were told by President Jiang Zemin in his
keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also analyzed the current economic situation and raised
general requirements for next year's economic work.
</P>
<P>
During the three day conference, which was attended by other
top leaders including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao,
Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, Premier Zhu outlined the government's
plans for continued economic growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The conference pointed out that China has also enhanced its
image and status worldwide because of the positive manner in which
it has dealt with the effects of the current financial turmoil in
Asia, which has badly impacted on the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting revealed that China had been praised for the fast
and efficient way it tackled the summer floods which devastated
large areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The conference, staged from December 7-9, was a joint event
between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of the CPC Central Committee led by
President Jiang Zemin, China has maintained the fast pace of
economic growth, kept the yuan stable and continued a series of
vital reform programs. Linked to social stability and the ongoing
improvement in the standard of living, the conference emphasized
that the overall economic situation is sound.
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1998, China has made crucial yet orderly strides in
economic restructuring, in line with the laid down schedule. It
also achieved considerable progress within some admittedly
difficult sectors such as introducing necessary reforms to make
more efficient the grain circulation system, state-owned
enterprises and the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the housing system and introduction of a
medical insurance system have also been initiated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, plans to ban the army, police, other law-enforcement
departments and Party and government institutions from operating
in the business sector have moved full steam ahead. And the
institutional restructuring of the State Council has also
proceeded smoothly.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The NATO allies are divided over whether the military
alliance should unilaterally take actions to control
proliferation of arms of mass destruction and to deal with crisis
outside the territories of the member countries without mandates

<HEADLINE> Y2K Bug to Cost S. African Property Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The millennium bug
computer threat could cost South African property sector more
than 100 million Rand (16 million U.S. Dollars), the Business Day
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Gavin Douglas-Hamilton, a Y2K consultant, as
saying that the commercial and industrial property sectors may
have been caught unawares.
</P>
<P>
People tended to think of the "bug", the inability of some
computers to read the change of date to the new century, as some
thing which affected only computer systems, said the consultant.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Douglas-Hamilton said, date-dependent data was
embedded in any number of products or systems.
</P>
<P>
He said there were potential problems for building access
control systems, escalators, elevators, air-conditioning systems,
fire and security systems.
</P>
<P>
Property companies needed to take action to ensure that their
buildings were year 2000 compliant, instead of waiting for the
first working day in January 2000 to see what problems occurred,
he said.
</P>
<P>
South African Communications Minister Jay Naidoo, who is in
charge of the government's Y2K compliance program, also said
early this week that South African business was expected to spend
about 20 billion Rand (3.3 billion Dollars) on compliance,
compared with costs of 400 billion Rand (66 billion Dollars) in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The South African government set up Y2K operations center and
national assistance service last month. A free hot-line to deal
with the millennium bug is also open to the public.

<TEXT>
<P>
The conference attributes the year's remarkable achievements to
the powerful foundations laid by the now 20-year old reform and
opening-up drive, along with decisions made by the central
leadership to tackle key economic issues, and the widespread
implementation of central policies by local administrations at
different levels.
</P>
<P>
However, speakers called for vigilance over a series of
important issues including the drop in exports caused by a
shrinking in international demand, the slow-down of income growth
for urban and rural residents which has led to a sluggish domestic
market, and increasing economic pressure from the loss-making
state enterprises. Conference also debated the issues of
re-deployment for redundant state factory workers, certain
national financial problems, and the slow progress made in
readjusting the economic structure and improving the speed of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They must be dealt with in an active and appropriate manner,
the conference declared.
</P>
<P>
Delegates were also informed that the world generally is going
through profound changes due to political turbulence, the
globalization of the world economy, considerable progress in
science and technology, and the swift growth of the computer
industry and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The conference stressed that 1999 will be a significant point
in the history of the Party and the nation per se, during which
China will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic. It will also resume sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
It set out a series of general economic and political
requirements for next year: to maintain and continue the policies
of Deng Xiaoping, to implement the decisions of the Party's 15th
Congress and the Third Plenary Session, and to further push
forward the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
China intends to use increasing domestic demand as the main
springboard for boosting economic growth, while stabilizing and
reinforcing the agricultural sector, deepening state enterprise
reform, and readjusting the economic structure. It will also spare
no effort to increase exports and avoid general financial
pitfalls.

Agricultural infrastructure linked to key water-control
projects will be improved in an effort to make China able to fend
off natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to readjust and make maximum use of rural
industrial structures and the mixture of products; improve the
efficiency of management in the agriculture sector; develop
township-run enterprises; build new small towns; push forward the
drive to eliminate poverty; accelerate reforms in the grain
marketing system and boost sales of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, reforms of state-owned enterprises will be given
priority. Next year will be a crucial stage for sorting out the
problems of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises within
the targeted three years. Resolute measures will be taken to
separate the administration from actual enterprise management;
prevent the build up of duplicated projects and to set up a social
security system, thus creating a better environment for enterprise
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The conference was told that China will continue to move to the
direction for building a modern enterprise system; and will
combine enterprise reforms by introducing more management skills
through training and changing the existing operational
methods. The state will encourage the merging of enterprises,
standardize bankruptcy procedures, re-employ laid-off workers,
downsize staffing levels and encourage re-employment projects to
ensure the minimum standard of living for redundant workers.

<P>
The management of enterprises will be strengthened. Meanwhile
the traditional assessment of leaders' performance by workers'
representatives will be maintained. Conference delegates were told
that the reform of small state-owned enterprises should not be
dictated simply by sales figures. Firm measures will be taken to
prevent the loss of state assets as well as avoiding the
invalidation of financial bonds issued by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the main financial task for 1999 is to maintain the
stability of the yuan in order to support economic development and
avoid and minimize financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Financial reforms, especially those of state commercial banks
will be accelerated to assist in the setting up a financial
mechanism in line with development of a socialist market
economy. Stringent efforts will be made to rectify any financial
disorder, enhance regulation of the financial sector and formulate
efficient financial laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The conference recommended that the existing strategy for
revitalizing China through the development of science, technology
and education should continue. Enterprises should give top
priority to promoting the upgrading of technology, transforming
traditional industries with high technology and creating more
high-tech firms in the future.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country every possible means to increase exports
and raise the volume of trade should be tried. Foreign trade
departments are required to introduce a strategy for exploring all
possible markets, to adjust export mix to forge new markets while
consolidating exports in their traditional and existing markets.
</P>
<P>
The conference agreed that proper guidance is needed for foreign
investment which must be used efficiently and effectively.
</P>
<P>
The management of foreign exchanges will be improved to maintain
a basic balance in international payments.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Urges Correct Appraisal of U.N. Human Rights Declaration (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese human rights expert
today said that a correct knowledge and appraisal of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is conducive to wisely prophesying the
future trend of world human rights movement and promoting its
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Despite its unique and noteworthy role in the world history of
human rights protection, the Declaration is by no means an
independent document, said Dong Yunhu, Deputy Secretary-General of
the China Society for Human Rights Studies.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, it should be regarded as component part of
the whole U.N. documents on human rights. Therefore, in order to
correctly understand and evaluate the Declaration, one should
study it as a section of the U.N. document on human rights, while
paying enough attention to the development process of human rights
theory and practice.
</P>
<P>
To link the Declaration with the U.N. Charter is necessary for
better understanding the historical document. This is because, on
the one hand, it is actually an instrument for specifying and
interpreting the human rights provisions of the U.N. Charter, and
on the other hand, it was worked out on the basis of, and
according to the principles made by the Charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration requires that no U.N. principles should be
violated, while realizing the human rights enumerated by the
Declaration. While the U.N. Charter adopts human rights protection
to be one of the U.N. principles, it articulates that the way by
which the principle or goal is reached should be promotion of
international cooperation in accordance with the principle of
sovereign equality and no interference in other's internal
affairs, said Dong, also a professor of the Central Party School
of the Chinese Communist Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
This means that to realize and protect the human rights
enumerated by the Declaration, nations and people should cooperate
and abide by the principles of sovereign equality and
non-interference in other's internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, any approach to separate the Declaration from the
U.N. Charter, or create antagonism and interfere with other's
internal affairs by making use of the human rights listed in the
Declaration, should be regarded as violation of the basic spirit
and principle of the Declaration, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
To study the Declaration, one should also scrutinize every
major progress of the U.N. in protection of human rights in the
past 50 years. Since the Declaration was approved in 1948,
tremendous achievements have been made in maintaining and
protecting human rights by the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 countries have shaken off the yoke of colonialism,
resulting in a complete collapse of the colonial system existing
for centuries. This has enabled more nations and peoples to
maintain and safeguard their basic human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United Nations, promoted by Third World
countries and other progressive forces in the world, worked out
and ratified a series of covenants, declarations, protocols and
resolutions relating to human rights protection, which brought
about some new principles and concepts on human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
The important U.N. documents in this regard include the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
Optional Protocol passed by the U.N. General Assembly in 1966,
Proclamation of Teheran passed by International Human Rights
Convention in 1968, the Declaration on the New Concept about Human
Rights passed by the U.N. General Assembly in 1977, the
Declaration of the Right to Development passed by the United
Nations in 1986 and the Vienna Declaration and Working Program
passed by the World Human Rights Convention in 1993, Dong said.

<P>
It is due to these U.N. documents and joint actions that the
content and concept about human rights have been enriched and
developed to a great extent. They are also the instruments by
which the international community may explore the methods and ways
for protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms more
effectively and substantially, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, their realistic importance to guiding the progress
and development of international human rights cause is
indisputable. "In conclusion, we must study the Declaration by
linking it with other U.N. human rights documents," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
We should not just rest on the interpretation of human rights
by the Declaration and pay no attention to development of concepts
in the several decades afterwards. It is even worse to
discriminate against the recently-evolved concept of human rights
or purposely separate the new elements from those traditional ones
provided by the Declaration just based on pragmatic approach, or
political or ideological prejudice, he said.
</P>
<P>
The past 50 years since the Declaration was passed has seen
fundamental changes of the international relations, which featured
emergence of the Third World countries and the emergence and
decline of the Cold War, he said.
</P>
<P>
These have enormously changed the world, while exerting
influence on the development of the global human rights
cause. When the Declaration was being passed, the United Nations
consisted merely of 56 member states. But now 185 countries have
joined, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
At present, both the connotation and extension of the human
rights content have gone far beyond that defined by the
Declaration. Now the problems facing the international human
rights cause are extremely different from those 50 years ago, he
said.

<HEADLINE> First Human Rights Declaration Called Milestone (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese human-rights scholar
said today that the first international declaration of human
rights is an important milestone and has made an indelible
contribution to human rights progress.
</P>
<P>
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first
international document specially devoted to the cause and adopted
by the United Nations 50 years ago, reflected the common demand
and will of people throughout the world to eradicate fascism,
eliminate the cause of war and protect basic human rights, said
Dong Yunhu, deputy secretary-general of the China Society for
Human Rights Studies.
</P>
<P>
It expresses everyone's desire for world peace, democracy and
justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the world was shocked by the German,
Japanese and Italian fascists who willfully trampled on basic
human rights and brutally killed millions of human beings.
</P>
<P>
After the war, the people of the world jointly expressed their
demand that fascism be eradicated and basic human rights protected.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the United Nations was founded in 1945, it wrote
into the Charter of the United Nations the principle of "universal
respect for, and observance of human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or
religion," said Dong, also a professor of the Party School
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly ratified the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights on December 10, 1948, which is regarded as a
comprehensive and authoritative interpretation of the human rights
provisions contained in the Charter of the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The dclaration was also the direct result of the worldwide
anti-fascist war. Thus, its historic importance to human progress
is evident, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
The declaration was the first genuine human rights declaration
commonly accepted and affirmed by the international community and
not only by some people or some nations. In this document was
embedded a unique significance in the history of worldwide human
rights protection, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
As all may know, it was the Western capitalists who first
created the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by
means of issuing "declarations of human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The American Declaration of Independence and the French
Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen are such
documents, which elaborated several inalienable human rights, Dong
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, all these declarations share one thing in
common: they represented the social standards of one country and
were enunciated by the ruling class of the country during a period
dominated by egoistic Western ideology.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the so-called "human rights" declared in these documents
were not actually applicable to every country in the world, but
only to Western countries. Therefore, they by no means set out
genuine universal human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Declaration was worked out in the wake of two
disastrous world wars in quick succession, and a number of
socialist countries and newly independent nations were emerging as
active voices on the international stage, resulting in fundamental
changes in international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a genuine international document on human rights, the
declaration was drafted through negotiations and in accordance to
the principle of equal sovereignty by an international community
made up of nations with different social systems, cultural
traditions and levels of economic development, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
It was meant to proclaim a common standard of achievement for
all peoples and all nations. Hence, the "human rights" advocated
and elaborated in this document are in principle universal and
applicable to every country in the world, the professor
said.

<P>
The Declaration requires that each state undertake to respect
the rights recognized in the Declaration without distinction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This eventually led to the abandonment of the traditional
concept of human rights based merely on Western values, and
brought the issue into a broad international domain, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
Objectively, the progress of human-rights protection encouraged
the Third World countries and colonies in their fight against
imperialism, colonialism, hegemonism and racism, and consequently
ushered in a new era in which the oppressed nations and peoples could
strive for their human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
The basic human rights listed in the Declaration go beyond the
traditional Western concept. For example, the subject of human
rights was broadened according to the Declaration, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the issue of human rights was first put forward in the
West, both the American Declaration of Independence and the French
Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen used the term
"rights of man." This defined human rights as literally solely a
male preserve and, in addition, limited the enjoyment of human
rights to wealthy, white males, both legally and in practice, Dong
said.
</P>
<P>
It is the U.N. Declaration that uses the term "human rights" to
make these rights universal, and recognizes human rights as
applying to human beings "without distinction of any kind, such as
race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion,
national or social origin, property, birth or other status," as
the Declaration states in Article 2, he said.
</P>
<P>
This enables the concept of human rights to genuinely represent
the common value that everyone is born equal. In addition, the
Declaration was the first international human-rights document to
recognize people's economic, social and cultural rights, apart
from the civil and political rights as defined in traditional
Western understanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
This opened a new avenue for working people throughout the world
to strive for and maintain their natural and alienable rights, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Divers Not Perfect, Says Team Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese divers left much to be
kdesired in the Asian Games, though they looked set to bag the
other two golds, said team leader Xue Li here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Though we have the possibility to make a sweep of all the four
diving golds at stake, our divers' performances are not
impeccable, sometimes even flawed," said Xue. "If we want to
regain our supremacy in the world, we have to work hard after
going home."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yilin and Cai Yuyan, both from China, prevailed repectively
in the preliminaries of men's platform and women's springboard on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu amassed 700.140 points heading into the finals, as Cai got
a leading 188.610 points.
</P>
<P>
Divers from other countries were not to contend for gold
medalas for they were not in the same level against the two
Chinese, a judge, who asked for anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jingjing proved too good for her rivals in the women's
3-meter springboard event while Tian Liang outclassed his
opponents in the men's 10m platform battle on Tuesday, bringing
China the first two diving golds.
</P>
<P>
"Our divers seem to have put these two golds under safe lock,"
said Xue. "But this means nothing to us, for most of other Asian
countries lag behind the rest of the world in diving and we
Chinese divers mainly compete agaist ourselves in the games."
</P>
<P>
"But in the world major competitions such as the Olympics or
the World Championships, there will be a galaxy of high-echelon
divers. Even a small error can cost you the gold when you compete
against them," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese divers captured three golds in the 1996 Olympics. But
the winning form seemed to betray them in 1998 when they were
denied golds in the Olympics, the World Championships and the
Goodwill Games.

CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Affairs
Minister Alexander Downer will visit five South Pacific nations
starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Downer will visit Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Kiribati,

<HEADLINE> First Human Rights Declaration Called Milestone (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Declaration, as the first international human rights
document, sets forth the basic contents of human rights and common
goals that all the people in the world should strive together to
realize. Thus, it serves as a source from which people of later
generations can draw inspiration in human-rights theory and
practice, and it lays a foundation upon which the world cause of
human-rights protection can develop, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that the Declaration is not flawless. For
example, even though the document contains economic, social and
cultural rights, it evidently attaches much more importance to
civil and political rights than it does to economic, social and
cultural rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
The entire text of the document speaks about individual human
rights, but none of the paragraphs are devoted to collective human
rights, and it seems that it did not intend to do so. Even though
it mentions the social obligations of an individual, it fails to
pay enough attention to individual obligations and
responsibilities, as it should, so as to secure a balance between
rights and obligations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the value of the Declaration is still obvious,
despite deficiencies. It was the first international document to
systematically list the human rights and fundamental freedom that
should be recognized by the international community and realized
by every nation and people, thereby building up a benchmark
according to which people of later generations may further the
study of human rights theory and practice, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
After World War II, national liberation movements were launched,
and a great number of newly independent countries emerged to voice
their views on the international political stage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Given this situation, efforts to protect international human
rights, based on the Declaration, became closely related to the
just cause of fighting against imperialism, colonialism,
hegemonism and racism, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some collective human rights such as the right to
national self-determination, development and equality of
nationality and race were added. Affirmation of collective human
rights reflects an evolution from the concepts originally spelled
out in the Declaration, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
It now goes beyond the Western human-rights concept based on
individualism. This development, obviously, promotes the
international movement of human rights protection advancing in the
direction of the interests of the majority of the world's people,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Human Rights Faces Progress and Challenges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese human-rights scholar
said today that the international cause of human rights faces a
good opportunity to development as well as challenges.
</P>
<P>
The trend of multi-polar international relations and
international cooperation creates a good opportunity for the cause
of human rights to develop, said Dong Yunhu, deputy
secretary-general of the China Society for Human Rights Studies.
</P>
<P>
However, most developing countries are facing problems such as
poverty, food shortages and widespread malnutrition. These not
only hinder human progress and world development, but also pose
the most serious challenges to the development of the human rights
cause, he said.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the universal and the particular in
the concept of human rights must be correctly dealt with, Dong
said.
</P>
<P>
The values, ideas and goals of human rights protection are
universal. Everyone's right to all human rights is a common human
goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
But in reality, no country may proclaim that it has completely
reached this goal. Nevertheless, the universal principle of human
rights protection is realized in different countries through
various efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Various countries take different approaches to human rights
protection, and have different timetables because of their
different histories, cultural traditions, sense of values,
religions, economic development, and social and political systems,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, every country should respect the universal
principles of human rights protection, while the special
approaches of different countries in realizing human rights should
also be fully respected, Dong said.

All human rights should be regarded in a comprehensive and
balanced manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to have comprehensive and complete knowledge of
the U.N. human rights documents so as to give civil and political
rights equal status with economic, social and cultural rights, and
individual rights with collective rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons, developing countries give priority to
people's economic, social and cultural rights, the rights
closely related to their subsistence and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
This should be well understood by the international community
in order to guarantee that the world effort for human-rights
protection is non-discriminatory and non-differentiated, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to balance rights and obligations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Everyone has the right to demand that other people and the
state and society respect his or her human rights. At the same
time, everyone is obliged to respect the human rights of others,
as well as the interests of the state and society, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, we should remember and reemphasize
the inseparable relationship between rights and obligations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Third World countries' experiences of, and contributions to,
the development of human rights protection should be given full
attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for three-fourths of the world's population, the
Third World countries' human rights demands and views deserve
great attention, and their experiences in human rights protection
according to their actual conditions should be highly esteemed, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Human Rights Faces Progress and Challenges (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to promote full-dimension development of the human
rights cause, the international community have to take equal
account of experiences and contributions made by both the
developed and developing countries. More attention should be given
to the experiences of the developing countries and the efforts
they made in protecting human rights and fundamental freedom of
their people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dong also urged that special attention should be paid to
creating an international environment in favor of development of
the human rights cause.
</P>
<P>
Realization of human rights is closely linked with world peace
and development of the world. Peace and development are the two
top concerns of the world and the prerequisite for the realization
of universal human rights and fundamental freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
Without peace, a stable international environment, and a just
and reasonable economic order, realization of universal human
rights is impossible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, so long as the international community pays equal
attention to protecting human rights, maintaining world peace and
promoting development, genuine and gradual development of the
human rights protection would be realizable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The goals and principles set in the U.N. Charter should be well
kept up, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Charter holds correctly that the fundamental way for
promoting human rights protection is "promoting international
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Given the different histories and varied development condition,
it is normal that various countries make different approaches in
human rights protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
The only and correct solution in this regard is dialogue,
cooperation, seeking common ground while observing differences and
improving mutual understanding according to the principle of
equality and mutual respect.

<HEADLINE> Falling Commodity Prices Drive Australian Dollar Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tunneling commodity prices
caused the Australian dollar to churn lower Wednesday, but the
local currency closed off two-month lows recorded during the
session.
</P>
<P>
During the local session the Australian dollar reached a low of
61.00 U.S. cents, a level not recorded since October 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
After the early afternoon dip the Australian dollar recovered
some ground to finish at 61.43 U.S. cents from 61.85 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust's Geoff Bowmer said the fall in commodity prices
was responsible for the tumble in the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Once you had seen the CRB (Commodity Research Bureau Index)
move you knew that the Aussie was going to be softer," Bowmer
said.
</P>
<P>
"And it was going to be vulnerable to the downside in that
environment."
</P>
<P>
Bowmer said technical selling on the break of 61.20 U.S. cents
added to the Australian dollar's woes.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar lost ground against all major currencies
offshore Tuesday night and here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 72.96 Japanese yen from 74.35
and 1.0240 German marks from 1.0386.

<HEADLINE> World's First Huminid Fossil Remains Found in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at South
Africa's Witwatersrand University (Wits) have found the world's
first-ever entire ape-man skull and its skeleton, the university
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The almost complete remains of one of humanity's early
ancestors was discovered by Ron Clarke of the Wits
Paleo-Anthropology Research Group at Sterkfontein, some 40
kilometers northwest of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The fossil, which is believed to be 3.22 to 3.58 million years
old, is considered the most important South African
archaeological and anthropological discovery since 1924 when the
Taung skull was unearthed.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said at a news conference that the fossil was "the most
dramatic discovery ever made" because of its entirety.
</P>
<P>
Past finds of Australopithecus have been either a partial
skull or a partial skeleton, but never both of the same creature.
</P>
<P>
Clarke believed that the skeleton was well preserved because
the creature fell 15 meters down into a shaft and died there.
</P>
<P>
For the first time paleontologists will know what kind of
skull goes with what kind of limbs for one species of ape man and
how they moved around more than three million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is full of world "firsts": the skull is
complete with both its lower and upper jaws, even its teeth are
in contact - and the skull is with its skeleton.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time that such a complete ancient tibia
with fibula (lower leg) has been found - or such a complete
ape-man foot, and radius (outer forearm).
</P>
<P>
The fossil will answer many of the questions concerning human
evolution that continue to mystify scientists, said a Wits news
release.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the fact that the skull and some bones are still
embedded in the rock, it is impossible to say anything about its
exact taxonomic status or whether it is male or female, said
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
But analysis of its foot bones indicates that it was an
upright walker but was still a tree climber.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who has been working at Sterkfontein for the past
seven years, made the discovery by following his uncanny
"paleo-detective" instincts after his initial finding in 1994 of
four fossil foot bones.
</P>
<P>
More findings in 1997 led him to assume that there must be a
whole skeleton at Sterkfontein.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Environmental
Affairs and Tourism Minister, Pallo Jordan, were present at the
news briefing.

<HEADLINE> China's Wang Xian Wins Women's Sport Rifle Prone Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Shooting powerhouse China took
three of the four gold medals at stake at the Asian Games here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shaking off a luckwarm performance at the previous two days,
China claimed both the team and the individual titles in the men's
air pistol in addition to Wang Xian's gold in the women's sport
rifle prone.
</P>
<P>
The only gold that eluded China was that of the team event in
the women's sport rifle prone, which was claimed by Japan with a
very narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
"We had competed to our normal standard today," said Chinese
coach Zhang Heng. "Although we lost one rifle team title, the
pistol shooters performed superbly in the final."
</P>
<P>
Chinese marksmen Xu Dan and Tan Zongliang had a one-two finish
in the air pistol event, with Xu producing a remarkable 103.0
points in the final to bring the total score to a winning 685.0.
</P>
<P>
Tan, who scored 102.0 points in the final for a total of 683.6,
grabbed the silver while Kazakhstan's Vladimir Guchsha won the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
"It was also the victory for the whole Chinese team," said
29-year-old National Games champion Xu, who is from the
northeastern city of Changchun.
</P>
<P>
In the team event, world championship gold medalist China,
formed by Xu, Tan plus world champion Wang Yifu, produced a
record-breaking 1,742 points to improve the previous Asian Games
record by one point.
</P>
<P>
Japan won the silver with 1,723, two points ahead of bronze
medalist South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, world championships runner-up Wang Xian scored 589
points for her gold, followed by Japanese Yoko Minamoto and Noriko
Ojima at second and third places.
</P>
<P>
"I was unsatisfied with my results here," said Wang. "But I
know now I have seen my form improved."
</P>
<P>
Japan beat China to second place for the team title, where the
countries scored the same total of 1,754.
</P>
<P>
Japan was ruled the winner as the trio of Minamoto, Ojima and
Mari Onoe registered better points in the last twenty shots in
this 60-shot non-Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
China won the silver while Thailand was third at 1,745.
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect a gold medal," said Japan's Minamoto, a
31-year-old veteran making a comeback after two years of absence
from international competition.
</P>
<P>
"I was also surprised that I had won the individual silver,"
she added.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Huang Xu of China surged ahead
with a stable performence on his last apparatus of the pommel
horse, scoring 57.825 points to win the man's all around title in

since the 1978 Asian Game in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Central Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, published an editorial today on the Central
Conference on Economic Work which was held in Beijing from
December 7-9.
</P>
<P>
The conference summed up the country's economic work in 1998,
analysed the current international and domestic situation, and
outlined the requirements for next year's economic work.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Being Determined and Pressing Forward
Despite Difficulties to Win New Victories in Reform and
Construction," hails the conference as important for pushing
forward the current reform and opening and the country's
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The editorial praises the CPC Central Committee for its timely
and correct decision to tackle the difficult situation caused by
the financial turmoil in Asia and the devastating summer floods
through stimulating domestic demand and utilizing macroeconomic
means to achieve steady economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It attributes the remarkable achievements China has made in
1998 to the foundation laid by the 20-year-old reform and opening
drive, the timely and correct policy of the CPC Central Committee,
and the hard efforts made by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Next year will be of special importance to the current reform and
opening and modernization drive and the history of the Party and
the nation, the editorial says, adding that economic work in 1999
will be of great importance as well.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve sustained, speedy and healthy economic
development, the conference put forward some general requirements
for 1999. It called for enlarged domestic demand, stabilized and
reinforced agriculture, restructured state enterprises, increased
exports, and minimized financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urged recognition of both the favorable and
negative sides of the current international and domestical
situation, and a deeper understand of central economic policies.
</P>
<P>
It also called for relying on the masses in order to bring
their enthusiasm and creativity into full play and urged leading
officials at all levels to be concerned with the life of the
masses, especially factory layoffs in cities and people living in
disaster-stricken and poverty areas. The leaders should remain
forthright, go deep into the grassroot units, and work with the
masses, it stresses.
</P>
<P>
The Party's leadership in the area of economic work should be
strengthened and improved, the editorial said, noting that China
is carrying out its socialist modernization drive while the world
is tending toward multi-polarization and economic globalization.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Provide 800M Dollars to Pakistan in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) Wednesday indicated fresh commitments of 800 million U.S.
dollars for Pakistan during the next six months ending June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among the total commitment of 800 million dollars by ADB, 400
million dollars could be immediately made available, Director of
Programs Department (West) of ADB Van der Linden told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Linden, who is here as the head of a three-member ADB
delegation, said that the 800 million dollars would be available
under three major loans including loans for power sector, trade
and export promotion and industrial development and loan for the
capital market reforms, besides certain smaller projects.
</P>
<P>
Expressing strong hope for Pakistan reaching an agreement with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next month, Linden said, the
fresh commitments, however, will be subjected to the approval of
the program.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no fresh commitment during the first six
months of the current fiscal year (July 1-June 30), although the
disbursement for the ongoing projects continued unfettered.
</P>
<P>
ADB Resident Director M. F.W. Zijsvelt said on the occasion
that the disbursement by November 30 had totaled 487 million
dollars, exceeding the target of 454 million dollars for the
calendar year 1998.
</P>
<P>
Besides the three major loans, Linden said, the future lending
for other small projects loans will include the Women Health
Program, the Malakand Rural Development Project, the non-formal
education for women and the irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is also providing 80 million dollars for Pakistan's
judicial reforms, for which the negotiations between the ADB and
the Pakistani government is continuing.
</P>
<P>
The ADB director said that the purpose of his recent visit was
to assess the ongoing program funded by the ADB and discuss the
future lendings.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to review the post-sanctions economic situation
and meet the new economic team of the government spearheaded by
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the current economic situation in Pakistan is
serious, Linden said, the present government initiated very
important measures to restore confidence in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The bank will, in its moderate role, address the problems
arising as a result of social imbalances created by the
sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB director said, though currently Pakistan's major
concern is on short-term issues, the ADB would continue to focus
on the long-term development strategies like the 2010 program for
the sustainable transformation of the entire economic and social
fabric.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the bank's lending for different important
projects identified by the government, including agriculture and
industrial master plans, good governance and civil services
reforms, he said, the negotiations are in the preliminary stage.
</P>
<P>
The problem relating to restructuring of the civil service is
very difficult and needs a strong political commitment, the
project is in the pipeline but the bank needs to ensure that the
ground for such funding is there, he added.
</P>
<P>
Linden hoped that sanctions imposed against Pakistan will be
lifted soon. However, he said, it is a political decision.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Pushes for Cathay-PAL Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Wednesday that his administration is trying its
best to convince Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways to buy
into the financially-troubled Philippine Airlines (PAL).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Estrada said that he remains
hopeful that both sides could strike an agreement soon.
</P>
<P>
"Well, we're trying our best to settle an agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a settlement can be hammered out soon, Estrada
said: "You know, this is a negotiation, you cannot set the time
when they will agree. Maybe they will not agree, maybe they will
agree."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Cathay feels
concerned about the constitutional restrictions for foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
While Cathay wants to manage PAL's day-to-day operations, it is
wary of the constitutional provision limiting foreign investors to
own a maximum of 40 percent of any local company, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cathay appears amenable to honoring PAL
management's proposal to preserve the jobs of PAL employees, which
the employees approved overwhelmingly in a referendum last
September.
</P>
<P>
PAL has been incurring losses in most of the past 15 years. It
posted a loss of 8.08 billion pesos (200 million U.S. dollars) in
its fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, the biggest loss so far in
its 57-year history.
</P>
<P>
The airline temporarily shut down operations in September due
to a protracted labor conflict and huge financial losses.
</P>
<P>
But it resumed operations in early October after President
Estrada persuaded PAL's biggest labor union to accept the
management's offer of a 20 percent equity in exchange for a
10-year freeze on strikes and labor bargaining.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Questioned Over Alleged Corrupt Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto was asked 43 questions on his alleged corrupt, collusive
and nepotistic practices during his rule, spokesman of the
Attorney General's Office Barman Jahir told reporters here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 43 questions, 16 were about the foundations he once
led, 18 about the national car (project), and nine about other
issues that have damaged the economy," Barman said after four
hours of questioning of the former president at Jakarta's Higher
Prosecutor's Office in South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The investigating team is led by Junior Attorney General for
Special Crimes Anton Suyatna.
</P>
<P>
Barman said that during the questioning, which started at 07:20
a.m. local time and ended at 11:30 a.m., Soeharto explained how
the foundations were set up, their aims, their financial
mechanisms, and their deposits.
</P>
<P>
On November 25, Soeharto handed over to the government the
funds from seven charity foundations he chaired, a total of about
4 trillion rupiah (530 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Barman said Soeharto also told about the chronology of the
issuance of Presidential Decree No. 42/1996 on the Timor national
car project.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, a company controlled by Soeharto's youngest
son Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra was given huge tax exemptions and
a multi-million-U.S.-dollar soft loan from a consortium of 16
banks, including state banks, to produce the Timor national car.
The project had caused the country losses of 1.55 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Barman told reporters that the former president has funds
deposited at the state Bank Bumi Daya, Bank Negara Indonesia and
Bank Tabungan Negara as well as in some private banks, including
Bank Central Asia and Bank Muamalat.
</P>
<P>
"All of Soeharto's testimonies will be evaluated. The attorney
general will decide whether there are irregularities in them or
not," Barman said.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the questioning, Soeharto told reporters that he
has given all his explanations to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
"As a citizen who has to abide by the law, I would be ready to
come every time I am needed by the prosecutor's office," he said
in a soft voice.
</P>
<P>
He said he considers Indonesia as a country based on the law
where everybody stands equal before the law.
</P>
<P>
"I have answered all questions and this is still an
investigating process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Senate Approves Motion Calling for IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Dewan Negara
(Senate) Wednesday passed a motion calling on IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus to resign for failing to take suitable
measures to tackle Asia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The house approved the motion after a two-day debate, with all
the senators who spoke supporting it, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
The IMF (International Monetary Fund)'s failure to help
overcome the economic crisis in Asian countries was prompted by
its policy of giving priority to Western banking institutions, a
senator said during the debate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Senator Mohd Zuki Kamaluddin said this was clear from the
conditions imposed by the IMF on these countries requiring them to
use loans approved by the agency to first settle foreign bank
debts.
</P>
<P>
Due to the IMF's refusal to compromise on such loan conditions,
borrowing nations like Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea found
it hard to revive their economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The senator called for IMF to be restructured and for the
agency to ensure that measures taken were in line with the global
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Senator Tee Thiong Hock said Camdessus as the managing director
of a large financial body should have played an important role in
restoring the economies of affected countries.
</P>
<P>
"According to the principles of management, if a manager failed
to carry out his duties he should be fired," Tee said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Abdul Majid Baba said Malaysia had proven that it did
not require IMF's assistance to recover from the economic
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Senator Christina Tibok Vanhouten said Malaysians should be
proud of the government's decision not to borrow from the agency.

BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen met with Mathole Motshekga, premier of South Africa's
Gauteng Province, and his party here today.
</P>
<P>
Motshekga is here to sign an agreement on the establishment of
friendly ties between his province and Beijing municipality.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the two sides will work in
cooperation in the fields of economy, science, trade, culture and
other activities.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian said that the agreement signed in
Beijing three day ago will serve to promote cooperation in a
variety of areas between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Motshekga told Qian that the signing is a concrete achievement
in the growth of bilateral relations and that China is the number
one friend of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During Motshekga's stay here, he met with local officials and
visited several communities. He said he believes that exchanges
between the youths and women of the two countries play a very
important role in promoting communication on a people-to-people
basis.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that both South Africa and China
will continue their efforts in related areas.
</P>
<P>
Qian called this a good idea, saying that although China and
South Africa forged diplomatic ties no more than one year ago, the
people of the two countries enjoy a long-standing friendship.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will continue to promote the traditional
friendship between the two peoples," he added.
</P>
<P>
South African ambassador to China, Chris Dlamini, who attended
today's meeting, told Xinhua that he hopes that exchanges between
the two peoples and local governments will be further
increased. The coming year will be even better than this year for
the growth of Sino-South African relations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sending Fewer Greeting Cards to Protect Trees, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Four national non-governmental
organizations have asked everyone to send fewer New Year's cards
this year, beginning with Christmas, as a way to help protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
In a written proposal to all Chinese citizens, the China
Environmental Protection Fund, the Communist Youth League of
China, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China
Women's Federation, said that China has serious ecological
problems and everyone should try their best to preserve natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Fully one-third of China is suffering from soil erosion and
more than a quarter of the country's area has desertification
problems which are swallowing the equivalent of a county each
year, and a Beijing city every eight years.
</P>
<P>
"The serious floods in China last summer were warnings from
nature," the proposal said.
</P>
<P>
China consumes huge volumes of greeting cards every year,
especially around Christmas and New Year. A survey revealed that
Beijingers alone sent over 30 million greetings cards during 1997,
using up over 10,000 ten-year-old trees.
</P>
<P>
The production of these cards also produced more than 9,000
tons of waste water and consumed more than 300,000 kwh of
electricity.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Firemen Leads to Fire Tragedy in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The reason behind the recent
tragedy of fire that killed 28 at an orphanage in Manila is the
lack of personnel in the Bureau of Fire Protection, a senior
Philippine official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo Puno, Undersecretary of Interior and Local Governments,
admitted that the country as a whole faces a problem like this,
disclosing that the ratio is one fireman for every 2,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
Puno admitted the Bureau of Fire Protection also has a problem
of availability of supplies and equipment. At present, there are
only 227 fire trucks nationwide, but only 94 are functioning,
while 18 are used in special cases.
</P>
<P>
A Manila orphanage was razed by fire last Thursday in which 23
infants and five adults were killed.
</P>
<P>
Puno added that his department is about to transfer the
leadership of the bureau's sub-stations to the local government
units.
</P>
<P>
This would improve the bureau's services as the local
government units are expected to allot a budget for the stations'
maintenance and the personnel's sufficient salary.

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Khor al-Zubair free zone
has received many inquiries from Arab and foreign companies, said
an Iraqi official on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bastam Aboud Al Janaby, director of the free zone, was quoted
by AL Elam weekly as saying that those companies are very much
interested in investing in the area, located in the southern Iraqi
province of Basra.
</P>
<P>
Those foreign companies are from Italy, Russia and some others,
said Bastam. However, he did not mention the names of the Arab
companies.
</P>
<P>
"Many favorable conditions, including the facilities offered by
the General Commission of the free zone are the reason behind so
many inquiries," said Bastam, adding another reason is the
favorable geographical location of the zone.
</P>
<P>
The free zone, inaugurated in the middle of last April, has
attracted 60 Arab and foreign investors during the last seven
months.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Crises Affect Electronic Equipment Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economic crises
have created downward pressures throughout the "electronic food
chain" causing the industry to consolidate further, an expert said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Asian market conditions have caused decreased global
demand, trade imbalances and severe currency fluctuations in the
otherwise very robust electronics industry, which the world's
systems and infrastructure were totally dependent on, Ron Daniels,
publisher and editor-in-chief of Circuits Assembly and Circuits
Assembly Asia, said Wednesday at the PCB (printed circuit board)
Asia '98 Conference in the northern state of Pulau Pinang.
</P>
<P>
"The enormous consumer pressure has since resulted in the
increasing functionality, complexity, portability and
miniaturization of consumer products, and the performance of such
products being faster, denser and cheaper," he was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
This trend is expected to continue to result in new markets as
technology increases electronic content of capital goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
He however said the world electronic equipment markets would be
far from being saturated due to the demand for new products by the
mobile consumer, leading to a convergence of personal computers,
communication devices, TVs and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
He said it is also possible that this factor is causing
technology migration from technologically advanced labor
countries to cheaper and labor intensive nations.
</P>
<P>
Daniels said research by Electronic Trends Publications from
San Jose, California, showed that the worldwide electronics market
had been projected to grow from estimated 1.020 trillion U.S.
dollars in 1997 to 1.382 trillion U.S. dollars by 2001.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Yeltsin Capable of Serving Out Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has said here that President Boris Yeltsin "can perfectly
perform" his duties and will "work until the end of his term" in
2000.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta
on Wednesday, Primakov reaffirmed that he does not have
presidential ambitions and will try to be as remote as possible
from the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Yeltsin moved out of the Central Clinical
Hospital where he was being treated for pneumonia and arrived at
his Rus country residence, some 100 kilometers outside of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, was hospitalized on November 22 with a temperature
of 38.9 degrees in Celsius and diagnosed to be suffering pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Poor health has forced Yeltsin to cancel several foreign trips
this year and sparked calls for his resignation and doubts over
his ability to complete his term of office.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he intended to continue energetic contacts with
all factions in the State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
because "the political impartiality of the government is crucial
to pursuing a more effective policy."

<P>
ULAN BATOR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Great Hural of Mongolia,
or parliament, on Wednesday approved the nomination of Janlaviin
Narantsatsralt as the country's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
With 36 votes for and 21 against, the parliament passed the
nomination, which was submitted by President Nachagyn Bagabandy
after he accepted it earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural's approval has ended a five-month political
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Narantsatsralt, 41, was nominated by the ruling union -- the
Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP) and the Social
Democratic Party -- in a letter to the president on Wednesday, a
presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the MNDP, Narantsatsralt graduated from a Moscow
university in 1981 and became the mayor of Ulan Bator in November
1996.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Tsakhya Elbegdorj was dismissed on July
24. It was blamed for worsening the country's banking crisis by

Golomt Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president and the parliament had turned down
several nominations made by the ruling union.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reaffirms Commitment to Deregulating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
reaffirmed its commitment to deregulating the telecommunications
sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifth anniversary of the Nigerian
Communications Commission Monday in capital Abuja, Nigeria's
number two leader, Mike Akhigbe said the government will continue
with the deregulation of the sector and the privatization of the
Nigeria Telecommunications Corporation (NITEL), according to
media repots Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe, who is Chief of General Staff of the Nigerian armed
forces, said the government will give due consideration to the
request of giving "pioneer status" to the industry so that
operators would be able to enjoy tax relief and import duty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the preparations for the appointment of a
second national carrier has reached the advanced stage, adding
that this is the most effective strategy to achieve sustainable
telecommunications development.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to deregulating the sector, the Nigerian
government has in the last few years granted licenses to about
161 private firms to provide various telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the price of a telephone line in Nigeria is
still one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
A report by the International Telecommunications Union puts
the cost of acquiring a phone line in Nigeria now at 1,300 U.S.
Dollars, which is more than twice the average costs in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now boasts a telephone line for every 150 citizens.
The government plans to boost the level to a line for every 50
persons by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> WFP Resumes Food Aid to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) said Wednesday it has resumed food aid to tens of thousands
of hungry Sudanese in the Western Upper Nile province since
four-month suspension due to the war.
</P>
<P>
Immediately following a lull in fighting and a guarantee by
the warring factions of security for aid workers, WFP
successfully airdropped 375 tons of food to the area Tuesday,
said the WFP in a news release issued by its regional office here.
</P>
<P>
"The food's arrived just in time," said David Fletcher, the Acting
WFP Representative, "Over the past months thousands of people
have fled without food or belongings. Their own villages have
been burned down and their grain stores looted."
</P>
<P>
WFP and other relief agencies have not had access to people in
the towns of Leer and Mankien in the province since the middle of
July when insecurity there was further aggravated in the continued
fighting between militia factions.
</P>
<P>
Leer, once a hub for food and health services, is now a ghost
town, said the WFP field staff, adding that militia factions have
raided Leer three times since June, looting and burning homes and
destroying schools.
</P>
<P>
WFP aid workers in Leer estimated a total of 24,000 heads of
cattle have been stolen by the fighting forces. Many families
lost their crops and seeds in the raids and have had
little success in producing a harvest for next year.
</P>
<P>
The current ceasefire between the Sudanese government and the
rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) which covers only
the southern Bahr el Ghazal Province is due to expire on January
15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely difficult and dangerous for aid organizations
to work in areas not governed by the current ceasefire," said
Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this break in fighting marks the beginning of
continued access to Western Upper Nile," he added.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Sudan erupted in 1983 when the SPLA restarted
fighting against the Moslem-led Khartoum for a secular state and
more autonomy in the animist and Christian-dominated south.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Economy on Track for Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' economy, forecast to
grow by 4.7 percent in 1998, remained on course in the first nine
months of the year due to an expansion in tourism and a revival in
domestic demand, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Activity in the vital construction sector also continued to
pick up in the January-August period, a report by Cypriot Finance
Ministry's Department of Statistics and Research showed.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing remained at last year's levels, while agriculture
showed an improvement after last year's sharp decline, it added.
</P>
<P>
Citing a provisional estimate by the Cyprus Tourism
Organization (CTO), the report said that tourist earnings in the
first six months of 1998 totaled 324.6 million Cyprus pound (about
649.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tourism, netting about 1 billion Cyprus' pound (about 2 billion
dollars) a year, accounts for about 20 percent of the GDP and is
the largest single employer in the island.
</P>
<P>
Inflation fell to 2.5 percent in the first nine months of the
year, one percentage point lower than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Overall unemployment dropped in the January-August period while
the number of construction-related workers out of job increased,
with 1,556 jobless registered in the sector by the end of August
compared to 1,255 at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing remained stuck at last year's levels during the
first eight months of the year due to loss of competitiveness as
productivity promotion lags behind real wage increases.

<HEADLINE> S. African Building Industry Faces Slump: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's building
industry could face a worse year in 1999 than it experienced this
year, said Reg Hurry, Chairman of the property investment
company--Kirchmann Hurry.
</P>
<P>
The outlook is "grim' as the industry has been hit by high
interest rates, the Business Day newspaper Wednesday quoted
Reg Hurry as saying.
</P>
<P>
According statistics released by the department concerned,
about 20,000 jobs have already been lost this year, and a further
25,000 are expected to be lost next year, along with about 400
company liquidations.
</P>
<P>
About 225 projects, amounting to about 1.6 billion Rand (250
million U.S. Dollars), planned for 1998/99 have been put on hold,
and residential projects worth just less than one billion Rand
(160 million Dollars) were postponed, meaning about 55 percent of
total project value has been held back.
</P>
<P>
Investment in non-residential buildings dropped five percent
in real terms to 5.5 billion Rand (nearly one billion Dollars)
during the first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residential investment dropped two percent to five
billion Rand (830 million Dollars). The declining trend is
expected to continue for the next six to eight quarters, the
industry sources said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Higher Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a higher
trade surplus in October this year, the 12th consecutive month
since November 1997 when the country managed to record a trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in October this year amounted to 6.6 billion
ringgit (about 1.736 billion U.S. dollars), up by 0.4 billion
ringgit (about 105.263 million U.S. dollars) compared with the
surplus in September 1998, according to the Statistics Department
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus was in contrast to a deficit of 0.2 billion ringgit
(about 52.631 million U.S. dollars) in the same month last year,
the department said in a statement when releasing the "Malaysian
External Trade statistics" for January-October 1998.
</P>
<P>
The department said the higher trade surplus in October was due
to the effects of an 18.5 percent increase in exports to 25.534
billion ringgit (about 6.719 billion U.S. dollars) against a 12.8
percent decline in imports to 18.912 billion ringgit (about 4.976
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the January-October period this year, Malaysia posted a
surplus of 44.5 billion ringgit (about 11.71 billion U.S. dollars)
in contrast to a deficit of 1.7 billion ringgit (about 447.368
million U.S. dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
For the January-October period this year, exports grew by a
faster rate of 34.3 percent to 236.9 billion ringgit (about
62.342 billion U.S. dollars) compared with imports which grew 8.0
percent to 192.4 billion ringgit (about 50.631 billion U.S.
dollars).

ULAN BATOR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia President Nachagyn

Bulent Ecevit to form the 56th government by Democratic Left Party
(DSP), the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the DYP.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)

<HEADLINE> Swimming Tickets Price Costly, Thais Complain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The prices of the Asian Games
swimming tickets are too high, some local lookers-on complained
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The price of a swimming ticket for the morning competition is
200 bahts, and 300 for the afternoon. Children pay 70 bahts for
each ticket, regardless of morning or afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The price is too high, even before the Asian financial
crisis," said 35-year-old Ma Wen-Cai. "We can hardly afford it. I
think 100 baht per ticket is acceptable."
</P>
<P>
He spent 810 bahts buying five tickets for his wife, himself
and their three daughters.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for my family to come to watch the
competitions," said Ma, who just came back from a travel to
Beijing with his family. "Whether we will come to see the matches
again, it depends on if they will slash the price."
</P>
<P>
But some zealous spectators showed no dithers before the high
price tag.
</P>
<P>
"Really it is too costly, but I still will come to see the
matches," said Krerchai Genpanit, a university student. "For this
may be the only time for me in my life to see a big games."
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the swimming pool at the Thammasat University
witnessed sell-out crowds every evening since the swimming
competition started on Monday. The organisers even had to ask the
parents to put their children on their laps to prevent crushes.
</P>
<P>
The notorious Asian financial crisis left thousands of Thais
jobless after it breaking out on July 2nd, last year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Leaves Hospital for Country Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Wednesday morning moved out of the Central Clinical Hospital where
he was being treated for pneumonia and arrived at his country
residence, some 100 kilometers outside of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin quoted doctors as
saying that the hospital stage of Yeltsin's pneumonia treatment
was over.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, was hospitalized on November 22 with a
temperature of 38.9 degrees and diagnosed to be suffering
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
He returned briefly to the Kremlin on Monday, firing Valentin
Yumashev, head of the presidential administration, and named
Nikolai Bordyuzha, secretary of the Russian Security Council, to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
Three of Yumashev's deputies were also dismissed during
Yeltsin's three-hour blitz to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin was unhappy with the way the
presidential administration had been handling the fight against
extremism, separatism and corruption, especially during his
two-week absence at a time of deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Everything that has been going on recently undermines the
trust in presidential authority and authority in general, and
that is inadmissible," Yakushkin quoted Yeltsin as saying on
Monday. "In the present conditions, power should be concentrated
in one hand."
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said doctors had advised Yeltsin "to take a
convalescence period" which could be organized at his residence
"with regular check-ups at the hospital."
</P>
<P>
"Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's
condition," Interfax quoted Yakushkin as saying.

<HEADLINE> Dos Santos Re-elected As Angolan Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos has been re-elected as the Chairman of the ruling
People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA).
</P>
<P>
At the on-going 4th National Assembly of the MPLA Tuesday
night, 56-year-old Dos Santos, as the sole candidate, was
re-elected chairman of the ruling MPLA.
</P>
<P>
In September 1979, he succeeded Antonio Agostinho Neto as the
MPLA chairman, president of the republic and the chief of the
armed forces. In December 1985 and December 1990, Dos Santos was
elected twice as the party chief.
</P>
<P>
Also at the MPLA national assembly Tuesday night, 97 members
were elected into the new central committee, 90 of them from the
candidates selected by MPLA's provincial organs while seven
others chosen from the local governments.
</P>
<P>
Now the number of the central committee members has increased
to 251 from the previous 179.
</P>
<P>
At the later meetings, 154 central committee members will be
gradually elected.
</P>
<P>
The on-going assembly began last Saturday and is scheduled to
close this Thursday at the 42 anniversary of the founding
of the MPLA.
</P>
<P>
At the national assembly, the current tense situation
and the national reform program will be discussed and some
important decisions will be made.
</P>
<P>
The MPLA was founded on December 10, 1956. It was the main
force in the military struggle for the Angolan independence from
the Portuguese colonialists.
</P>
<P>
The party has been ruling since Angola won its independence in
1975. Now, it has nearly two million members under its banner.

<HEADLINE> Australian Mineral Resources Exports Rise Slightly: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's minerals and
energy sector continued to withstand the Asian crisis in the three
months to September, by increasing about one percent, despite weak
demand caused by slower world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) said Wednesday the country's mineral and energy exports
for the third quarter of this year increased by one percent over
the previous quarter, worth 10.84 billion Australian dollars (6.82
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
ABARE, the Australian government's chief commodities
forecaster, said export earnings in the minerals and energy sector
rose by 62 million U.S. dollars in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
ABARE Director Brian Fisher said the figures were strong given
the current trading conditions.
</P>
<P>
"This strong performance reflected mixed results for minerals
and energy commodities in difficult trading conditions, with
strong increases in earnings in some commodities offsetting
significant falls in other commodities," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But he did not provide figures on the volume of export for
specific markets, which is the job of the Australian Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Asia has been the major market for Australian minerals and
energy. Japan and South Korea, Australia's two largest export
markets, have recorded negative economic growth so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the devaluation of the Australian currency against
the U.S. dollar means that prices by Australian exporters will be
mostly higher as most exports to Asia are valued in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The biggest rise in export earnings came for crude oil, up 17
percent to 598 million Australian dollars (360 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Export earnings also rose for iron ore, aluminum, liquefied
natural gas, refined gold, zinc, and gems.
</P>
<P>
"In a majority of cases both export volumes and unit returns
increased," ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
But export earnings fell for iron and steel, nickel, copper,
uranium oxide, petroleum refinery products and lead.
</P>
<P>
"Lower export volumes and unit returns contributed to most of
the falls," it said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Youths Shut Down Shell's Oil Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Protesting youths from the
Ogulagha Community in Nigeria's Delta State have shut down
Shell's Forcados oil export terminal over dispute with Mobil
Producing Nigeria Unlimited.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Nigeria, which exports about two million barrels
of crude oil a day, is losing 400,000 barrels per day of oil
exports from the shut terminal, the Daily Times newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Jibrila Ayinla,
Tuesday announced the plans of the Nigerian navy to establish a
special security force to protect all oil installations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that it became necessary to check the threat to
security by restive youths in the oil producing communities when
he met with the Rivers State Administrator Group Captain Sam
Ewang in Port Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
Shell officials said Tuesday that its workers had been
directed to evacuate the terminal invaded by the protesting
youths Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Delta State Administrator Walter Feghabor implored the
traditional rulers in the community to prevail on the youths to
vacate the terminal immediately, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Olgan Hard, head of Public Affairs Unit of Shell, was quoted
as saying that the community had been negotiating with Mobil over
compensation for its oil spill last year.
</P>
<P>
Mobil was believed to have promised to pay the community 60
million Naira (about 750,000 Dollars) as compensation, but the
community rejected it on the ground that it was inadequate.

<HEADLINE> S. Asia Faces Challenge in Educating Children: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South Asia and the
Sub-Saharan Africa are the regions facing the greatest challenges
in enrolling all their children in primary school by the year
2000, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
Net primary enrollment was 68 percent and 57 percent around
1995 respectively in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, compared
with 96 percent for East Asia and Pacific and 92 percent for Latin
America and Caribbean, the U.N. agency said in the State of the
World's Children 1999 available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual report, which focuses on education this year, noted
that though primary enrollment in South Asia has climbed from
under 60 percent in 1970 to nearly 70 percent, over 50 million
children of primary school age are not in school.
</P>
<P>
"About 40 percent of children entering primary school drop out
before reaching grade five, the highest regional rate," the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
It observed that nearly half the population in South Asia lives
in severe poverty, earning less than one U.S. dollar a day. "Child
labor is a persistent problem, a cause and consequence of low
enrollment and high drop-out rates," it said.
</P>
<P>
An additional annual expenditure of 1.6 billion dollars is
needed in South Asia for the next decade to educate all children,
it said.
</P>
<P>
On the constraints facing the region, the report said that
pupil-teacher ratios are high in some countries (greater than 60
to 1 in India), particularly in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
Besides, teacher education and training need upgrading, and
rural schools are often remote and poor in quality, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly two thirds of women in the region are illiterate,
compared with about one third of men," the report said. "The gap
between girls' and boys' primary enrollment rates is over 10
percentage points."

JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday in Jerusalem, U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy
Dennis Ross said that the differences between Israel and the
Palestinians should be bridged through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat urged Ross in the West Bank city of Ramallah to use his
influence to convince Israelis of the importance in releasing more
political Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian National Authority is hoping that next
week's visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton will solve the
current crisis in the peace process as well as significantly
improve American-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said on Tuesday that Clinton will end up
pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to implement
its agreement with the Palestinians signed in October.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Most Israeli ministers were not in favor of next week's
visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the area. They argued that
Clinton's visit to Gaza will boost the Palestinians' claims for an
independent state.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's defenders
forcefully pleaded his case before the House of Representatives
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, saying that the president's
conduct was "misleading, even maddening" but did not warrant
removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
"As surely as we know that what he did was sinful, we also know
it is not impeachable," White House lawyer Gregory Craig told a
committee bristling with skeptical Republicans. Other witnesses,
including former lawmakers who sat in judgment of former President
Richard Nixon a quarter-century ago, argued that Clinton's conduct
in the Monica Lewinsky affair was no Watergate, and thus not
worthy of impeachment. (US-Clinton-Hearings)

JAKARTA -- Indonesian former president Soeharto began to be
questioned at Jakarta's Higher Prosecutors Office on Wednesday
morning over alleged corruption, collusion and nepotistic
practices during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Thursday ordered Attorney
General Andi M. Ghalib to speed up the investigation into
Soeharto's alleged ill-gotten wealth. According to a summons send
by Ghalib to Soeharto on December 4, the questioning by the
Attorney General's Office will focus on the funds held by several
foundations that Soeharto chaired and on the tax exemptions
granted to his son's company under the Timor national car program.

The Munja newspaper on Tuesday quoted Kosovo Albanian chief
negotiator Fehmi Agani as saying, "It cannot serve as the basis
for negotiations." Agani said on Monday in Pristina that Kosovo
Albanians would submit their own proposals to resolve the Kosovo

the political representative of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army,
was very angry with the U.S. plan. He told reporters in Pristina
on Tuesday that he asked the U.S. government to dismiss Hill as
U.S. special envoy. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo)

<HEADLINE> New Way to Forecast Hurricanes: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist say that
calamities such as hurricane Mitch can be forecast.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ren Zhenqiu of the China Academy of Meteorological
Sciences said, "It was the huge rainstorm brought by Mitch
that caused the great disaster in Central America. Such disastrous
weather can be forecast through comprehensive research into the
atmosphere, lithosphere and the the Earth's weather system."
</P>
<P>
The meteorologist found, after researching over 100 cases of
typhoons and rainstorms, that tide-generating force can bring
sudden changes to the speed and route of tropical cyclones and
aggravate rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
Ren also found that the influence of tide-generating force on
weather changes is strictly determined by the distribution of the
force when the earth, another celestial body, and the moon or the
sun are aligned.
</P>
<P>
"The huge rainstorm in Central America on October 30 was
triggered by two tide-generating forces with ready atmospheric
conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch this year brought the most serious natural
disaster ever to Central America, leaving more than 10,000 people
dead and over 4.5 million residents afflicted. The economic losses
in the region are expected to exceed six billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ren said that research on tide-generating force has
significance for forecasting disastrous rainstorms. "We
successfully forecast two huge rainstorms brought by a typhoon in
1996 in north China's Hebei Province and south China's Hainan
Province. And the forecast of the big storms this summer in the
Yangtze River Valley was also quite successful."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiangong, also a meteorologist with the academy, said
that Ren's latest research is on the frontier of science, and
provides new methods for forecasting extraordinary weather.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Agreement to New War Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
against Congo (K)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM#,December 9 (Xinhua) - Tanzania denied Wednesday the

reports which claimed that it has agreed to open a new war front on

Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Defense and National Service Edgar Maokola

Majogo said in a news release that Tanzania has been avoiding being

involved in the war in DRC ever since its breakout in early August.
</P>
<P>
"Our intelligence and security reports don't warn us of any such

threats on our fronts... the story looks like a fairy-tale," Majogo

said.
</P>
<P>
The Defence Minister said that Tanzania has been striving to make

sure that all the forces in the mineral rich central African country

sign a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Majogo made these remarks in reaction to reports by a newly

established wire news service, the Great Lakes Press, which claimed

that a new battle front will be opened in Tanzania by the Tutsi

dominated Burundian army in the pretext of pursuit for Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The Burundian army would later be backed by a coalition of Rwanda

and Uganda army," the news agency reported from Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
It said that the underlying army of opening new front is to divert

the military muscle of President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"Such reports are aimed at disturbing the neutral position of

Tanzania," Majogo said. "As far as Tanzania is concerned, it has no

hostility with any of its' neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Trying to be neutral in the DRC conflict, Tanzania recalled its

military advisors from DRC almost immediately after the conflict broke

out while other neighboring countries rushed their troops to either

side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war has so far already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Chad, Libya,

Sudan and Zimbabwe on Kabila's side while the Tutsi-led rebels are

backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Talks Its Way Into Modern World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Modern new words are transforming
the language in China's Tibet Autonomous Region reflecting the
huge changes that have taken place there.
</P>
<P>
Previously seldom heard expressions and words such as
'personal computer' 'taxi', 'boss' and 'hi-fi set' are now in
everyday use.
</P>
<P>
Yi Xi, a sociologist specializing in ethnic affairs with the
Tibet Academy of Social Sciences, believes that fast economic
development and closer contact with other ethnic peoples from all
over China are two of the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
He explained: "Since China introduced reform and opening
policies in 1978, and with increasing numbers of commercial
enterprises moving into the area, a lot of young Tibetans are now
able to study in higher educational institutions throughout China."
</P>
<P>
As a result, Yi noted, most of the newly-introduced expressions
are mainly in the fields of science, technology and service trades.
</P>
<P>
"The now common use of words such
as 'refrigerator','biology', 'cassette tape' and 'aerial' are
evidence of the swift pace of scientific and economic development
while there are also flourishing cultural activities." he added.
</P>
<P>
New words were first introduced into Tibet over 1,300 years ago
during the Tang Dynasty when the Han princess Wencheng married a
Tibetan prince.
</P>
<P>
Today, a group of new words such
as 'manager', 'salesman', 'lawyer', and 'insurance company' have
made the daily conversational style of Tibetans much more up to
date.
</P>
<P>
Although they pronounce most of the words like the Han people
it is also quite common to hear such words in their own particular
dialect.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Components of China's
oldest stone arch bridge, which were collected in a display hall
in north China's Hebei Province, were partly damaged when the hall
was recently destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
The display hall was located beside the Zhaozhou Bridge over
the Xiaohe River in Zhaoxian County, north China's Hebei
Province. The bridge was built more than 1,400 years ago and is
known as the oldest open-spandrel arch bridge in the world.
</P>
<P>
The fire started at 9:30 pm on November 27 and spread quickly
because the exhibition rooms were made of bricks and wood. Soon after,
the building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
According to the curator of the display hall, stone bridge
components, collected after several renovations of the bridge
itself, or salvaged from the Xiaohe River, were damaged, along
with a group of other cultural relics on display.
</P>
<P>
Local firemen spent nearly three hours putting the fire out.
The cause of the blaze was later discovered to be a short circuit
in the building's wiring.

<HEADLINE> Modern Experience of One Member of the Gelao Ethnic Group (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: This is the
tenth in a series of stories featuring the fast-changing life and
culture of the Zhuang, Yi, Miao, Yao and seven other main ethnic
groups in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which
will mark its 40th founding anniversary on December 11.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight-year-old Wei Shaoting, a member of the Gelao ethnic
group, says, "Our ancestors were citizens of the Yelang Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, the Yelang Kingdom was one of the strongest
states in southwest China in ancient times. Later, the kingdom was
split and divided into three tribes. Several hundred of year ago,
some of these tribe members came to present-day Guangxi, fleeing
some calamity, it is believed.
</P>
<P>
This is generally in line with the views of some historians.
However, scholars also believe the Gelao ethnic group was formed
after the non-native people mixed together with the aboriginal
people of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, we Gelao ethnic people have lived deep in the
mountains and have seldom had contact with the outside world,"
said Wei.
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that the people of the Yelang Kingdom were
renowned for conceit and arrogance -- one main reason behind their
failures. But Wei Shaoting, who is now chairman of the Longlin
Multi-National Autonomous County Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), looks more like a
modest and amiable scholar.
</P>
<P>
The Gelao is the smallest ethnic group in Guangxi, with a
population of about 4,000, and Wei is the highest official among
the Gelaos. He was also once the deputy county magistrate of
Longlin.
</P>
<P>
"Previously, neither I nor my people would have thought I could
become a government official, as the Gelaos do not have a strong
ambition to become leaders, and they are also afraid of being
identified as 'people of ludicrous conceit.'" said Wei, "But now,
an increasing number of young Gelao people want to seek government
posts or become civil servants."
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that villages with greater contact with the
outside world will have faster economic growth, Wei believes.

<HEADLINE> Gelao Ethnic Group (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gelao people first got their own school when New China was
founded on October 1, 1949, and Wei was one of the first group
lucky enough to receive a primary and middle school education.
</P>
<P>
Wei joined the air force after attending an aerospace school in
1960 and was assigned to work in the ground crew at an airport in
north China's Hebei Province after he graduated.
</P>
<P>
"I am probably the first Gelao who had the chance to study
aircraft," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Wei recalled that when he applied to join the air force from a
teachers training school where he was studying, he did not dare
tell his parents for fear of their disapproval. There were 150
applicants form the teachers school and only five of them were
enrolled in the aerospace school.
</P>
<P>
"One benefit of going out into the world is that my vision has
been widened," said Wei. He even broke off a marriage engagement
arranged by his parents in accordance with Gelao customs, to marry
a girl of the Zhuang ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
After leaving his hometown, Wei met many people of other ethnic
groups, which made him time and again consider the question: Why
have other ethnic groups become stronger while the Gelao people
remain backward?
</P>
<P>
He found that the answer was partially because of historical
factors and partly because of the people themselves. Therefore,
when he returned to Longlin after being demobilized from the air
force, he worked in education for quite some time, and later was
promoted to deputy county magistrate of Longlin.
</P>
<P>
According to China's law on regional national autonomy,
leaders of an autonomous county are people chosen from the ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the Gelao people have seen a
steady increase of its population, an improvement in the
cultural quality and living standards of the people, and a
growing awareness of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
In everyday life, the Gelao people no longer wear their unique
ethnic costumes, donning them now only for traditional festivals.
But the language and some customs unique to the Gelao are still
practiced.
</P>
<P>
The most important Gelao festivals are the "tree-worshiping"
fest in January according to lunar calendar, and "worshiping
ancestors with the heart of cattle" fest on August 15.
</P>
<P>
"Without the care of the Party and the government, I and my
people might still be living a backward life deep in the
mountains, not to mention that I would not be in a position to
help run the county," Wei said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Become World's Largest Rubber Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is expected to become
the world's largest natural rubber producer by 2005 with an
estimated production of 2.7 million tons per annum, chairman of
the Indonesian Association of Rubber Industries Daud Husni Bastari
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such an estimate on the Indonesian natural rubber production
is based on the increasing annual production and expansion of
rubber plantation acreage at an average of about 1.5 to 2.0
percent per annum", he told reporters on Tuesday while attending a
seminar on the prospect of natural rubber in the 21st century in
Medan, capital of North Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's rubber plantation covers 2.5 million
hectares which enables it to produce some 1.7 million tons of
natural rubber this year, or an increase by 200,000 tons compared
with that of the previous year's 1.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
When entering the year 2005 Indonesia is expected to be able to
produce some 2.7 million tons of natural rubber shifting the
position of Thailand, which by that time is to produce some 2.5
million tons of natural rubber, he was quoted by Antara News
Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which at present is the world's second largest
producer of natural rubber after Thailand by producing some 2.0
million tons per annum, has an opportunity to increase its
production of the commodity by intensifying its production growth,
Bastari said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bastari, the increasing production of the
commodity will be in line with the increasing rubber consumption
in the world at an average of 2.0 percent per annum up to the year
2000 and increase to 2.5 percent per annum up to the year 2020.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a large depot
for central government grain reserves began recently in the city
of Maoming, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
This facility, which will have the capacity to store 100 million
kilograms of grain, is one of 14 state grain reserve depots,
with a combined capacity of 1.75 billion kilograms, to be built in
Guangdong this year.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the severe grain-depot shortage, the central
government has decided to build new grain depots across the
country, with a total capacity of 25 billion kilograms. The new
facilities are scheduled to be completed before the autumn of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is a major grain consumer, and has long been
suffering from a shortage of grain warehouses. Most of the state
grain-reserve depots to be built in the province will be located
near ports and railways in major grain-consuming cities.
</P>
<P>
The Maoming State Grain Reserve Depot is near the port of
Maoming.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Stock Market Index Goes up Marginally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE) 20-share index edged up 11.14 points or 0.43 percent
Tuesday to close at 2621.38 points.
</P>
<P>
Turnover fell to 7.95 million Shillings (about 132,500 U.S.
Dollars) from 219,000 shares, compared to 16 million Shillings
(some 266,666 Dollars) from 215,000 shares Monday, the East
African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Central Bank Treasury Bond issue 1/98 worth 1.55
million Shillings (25,000 Dollars) was dealt at between rates of
103.1 percent and 103.3 percent. Foreign investors sold 1,500
shares of Diamond Trust at 21.75 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Commercial and services sector moved the highest number of
shares accounting for 35 percent of the day's volume. The sector
traded 77,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's trading is in contrast to the favorable second week
running which saw the NSE maintain its upward movement as the
index closed last week at 2595.4.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it is still difficult to predict the
performance of the stock market as the holiday moods start and
the year comes to a close.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that banks and other financial institutions
that rely heavily on the treasury bill market could find
themselves in a tight spot as the margins and yields in the
market continue to shrink.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist of the central bank, J.P. Kanga, said Tuesday
that the Shilling weakened against the U.S. Dollar and the Pound
Sterling in the week ending Tuesday, with the average exchange
rate for the week against the Dollar falling to 60.94 Shillings
from 59.89 Shillings last week.
</P>
<P>
The Pound Sterling average exchange rate for the week moved to
101.08 Shillings from 98.99 Shillings in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Kanga said the 91-day treasury bill average rate fell to 14.35
percent in the Monday auction from 15.79 percent in the previous
deals. Commercial banks' average base lending rate fell further
to 26.01 percent from 26.20 percent last week.

<HEADLINE> Thumbs Down for Television Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 percent of Chinese
consumers are not interested in shopping by TV, according to a
survey by the China Business Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Within that number as many as 42 percent say they are put off
by the high prices of the goods on sale despite the surge of
advertising at peak broadcast times on many television channels..
</P>
<P>
Over 1,200 people took part in the poll in six major Chinese
cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Although it revealed that 85 percent of those questioned
watched TV advertisements, and are familiar with this convenient
way of shopping, only 18 percent think it is likely to become a
popular method.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some people are suspicious of the exaggerated claims
made for a lot of products while others say they are simply luxury
items.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the survey it seems that high-income
earners are more enthusiastic about television style retailing
while poorer viewers are content merely to watch the programs.
</P>
<P>
It also highlighted that women and young people in the age group
of 15-24 are the bulk of purchasers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top sprinter Li Xuemei
said upon her arrival here on Wednesday that she was confident of
beating Sri Lanka's world silver medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe to
become the fastest woman in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Li, 21, Asian record holder in the 100 and 200m, said she had
been training hard in the past two months and everything goes
right for her.
</P>
<P>
"I have no injury problems now, and it's not as hot as expected
here, " said Li, who arrived at the Bangkok international airport
with the 50-strong Chinese track and field team.
</P>
<P>
Jaysinghe, who got here last Saturday, said that she believed
she can win the two gold medals of the women's 100 and 200m.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan was banned for failing a doping test early this
year but later was allowed to run in the Asian Games, got here
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Li broke Asia's 100 and 200m record with two stunning
performances of 10.79 and 22.01 seconds in last year's Chinese
National Games in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
She crashed at hometown Chengdu last May in the world fastest
woman race which also drew world sprint queen Marion Jones of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind what Jayasinghe said," Li said. "I have been
ready to beat all the rivals."
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the main rival this time was Jayasinghe, Li's
coach Zhang Rongwei said that other Sri Lankans might emerge as
the unexpected winners.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of Jayasinghe," he said. "We only fear that
other little known runners to cause a surprise."
</P>
<P>
Zhang predicted that Li can run inside 11.20 in the 100m and
22.33 in the 200.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to win the gold medal. No one can scare us," Zhang
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city of Beijing
has announced plans to increase its grassy parklands in a bid to
win the Olympic Games in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The city's Greening Committee said today that more than one
million square meters of new grass will be planted every year in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
And to mark the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of
China next year, as much as 1.5 million square meters will be
planted, according to a spokesman for the committee.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Most Beijingers are keen to have more green areas
in the city, especially now that they are becoming more
environmentally aware.
</P>
<P>
"In recent times this has become a major topic of interest for
increasing numbers of people."
</P>
<P>
Even in winter, officials intend Beijing to enjoy lush, grass
lawns by planting special ever-green seeds and plants.
</P>
<P>
Gardening experts at Beijing Municipal Administration of
Forestry have developed a strain of grass that can last throughout
most of the year, the spokesman revealed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Lawn Development Center of the Beijing
Municipal Forestry Administration in Beijing's suburb of Daxing
County, 70 hectares of the experimental grass has survived even
two heavy snow falls this winter.
</P>
<P>
"It is as green as it was in the spring," said Zhang Yunchang,
the Center's head who said he hoped that in the near future
Beijingers could enjoy grassy areas all over the city.

<HEADLINE> Economists Urge Service Industry Liberalization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China must adopt an
enthusiastic, but nonetheless cautious attitude in its efforts
to liberalize its service sector, including the
telecommunications and financial industries.
</P>
<P>
"China must draw lessons from the financial crisis in Mexico
and the ongoing crisis engulfing Southeast Asia," according to
Professor Liu Guoguang, an adviser to the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks during the International Trade Industry
Symposium -- China and the World -- held in Beijing, the Chinese
capital, on December 8-9. The symposium was sponsored by the
U.S.-based Ford Foundation, the Institute of Finance and Trade
under the CASS and the Center for American Studies at Fudan
University.
</P>
<P>
China must fully consider the underdevelopment of its fledgling
service industry and gradually proceed in line with the capacity
of the national economy to withstand strains, according to Liu..
</P>
<P>
He noted that China faces a dilemma in terms of liberalizing
its service industry.
</P>
<P>
Countries negotiating China's membership in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have urged the nation to immediately open most
areas of its service industry. However, the underdeveloped
industry is burdened with the substantial impact associated with
sudden liberalization, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that liberalization will involve challenges,
potential risk and various other adverse factors, but will
nonetheless be highly beneficial to further promoting the nation's
foreign trade and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) show that the service industry
accounts for close to 30 percent of China's GDP. However, the
industry's 1995 turnover of 44.3 billion US dollars accounted for
a mere 1.8 percent of the international total and only 20 percent
of the country's total trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Juventus coach Marcello
Lippi said he would announce his plan for next season within 10
days in Turin, Italy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His five-year contract will expire in June.
</P>
<P>
Lippi is expected to join either Lazio or Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
Before he decides, he will coach Juventus to take on Norway's
Rosenborg at Wednesday's European Champions League and leader
Fiorentina at Italian Division First League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lippi led the team to win two Italian League titles in a row.
However, Juventus, which has been winless since November 1, has
plummeted to fifth place in the league standings this season.

Liu said China must follow nondiscriminatory principles related
to preferential treatment, by granting equal status to domestic and
foreign enterprises, eliminating disparities between sectors,
ensuring balanced regional development and moderate protective
measures.
</P>
<P>
"China's ability to carry out the nondiscriminatory principle
depends on the nation gaining the same status as WTO members,"
according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government should pay close attention
to opening markets to domestic service enterprises, especially in
terms of improving the international competitiveness of
private companies.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization should be introduced gradually and inland
enterprises should have the same opportunities as their coastal
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
China should take full advantage of the cushion effect
accompanying the grace period, and the government should avoid
adopting protective measures which seriously impact
domestic service enterprises.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC official Zheng Li noted that China initiated its bid for
memberships in both the WTO and GATT some 12 years ago. Issues
surrounding the service industry, especially the
telecommunications and financial sectors, have gradually emerged
as the main obstacles in the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
Zheng pointed to the urgent need to do a better study on the
development of various service sectors throughout the world, as
well as related international practices and regulations.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 experts, scholars and officials from China, the
United States, Japan, Australia, Germany and the WTO attended the
symposium. Participants focused on a number of issues, including
the development of China's service industry and related trade
activities, as well as international trade involving
telecommunications, finance, insurance and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Buddhist University Inaugurates in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- An international Buddhist
missionary university, the first permanent center of higher
learning of the Theravada (Little Vehicle) Buddhism in various

organizations as well as invited guests from 14 countries --
China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Republic of
Korea, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Russia, Britain and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the International Theravada Buddhist
Missionary University (ITBMU) is aimed at promoting the

world, and studying and comprehending the canonical texts of the
Buddhism which eventually lead to purification, perpetuation and
propagation of the Buddha teachings in the world.

different language teachings covering English, Chinese, French,
Japanese, German, Hindu and Arabic. The medium of instruction will

allowed for further studies for Bachelor, Master and Doctor
degrees of Philosophy in Buddha teaching.
</P>
<P>
As a country with the majority of its population (about 89.4
percent) believing in Buddhism, Myanmar had established Buddhist
scripture learning centers and other monastic education schools
long ago.
</P>
<P>
There are two other state Buddhist universities in the country,
one in Yangon and the other in Mandalay.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Microsoft
Corporation said Tuesday that the corporation is making a revision
to Windows 98 aimed to fix an error related with the Y2K problem,
the Washington Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Windows 98 operating system was released this summer and is
used in most personal computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
Don Jones, a Microsoft product manager in charge of features
related to the Y2K problem, said that none of the problems poses
any risk of data loss or damage to computers. The problems caused
by the millennium bug were found during company tests, and none
were reported by customers.
</P>
<P>
The company will help its customers fix the problems free of
charge on its Windows Update site on the World Wide Web. Users
can also receive a "patch" by ordering a special CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
The problems include the roll-over of dates, leap-year dates
and phone dialing.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 glitch can cause computers to read the year 2000
as "1900" because most old computers were programmed to read only
a double-digit date. As a result, affected computers might
transmit flawed information, or crash completely.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Urges Investors to Set up Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has called upon the local and foreign investors to set up
industries in the rural areas for balanced development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
She made this call while inaugurating a detergent industry in
the private sector in the country's northwest district of
Manikganj Tuesday, The Independent daily newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Do not locate your industries in the cities or suburbs only,
build those in the rural areas and become a part of balanced
development at progress," she said.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities have been created following the expansion of
infrastructure network all over the country especially the opening
of the multi-purpose Jamuna Bridge in last June, which has linked
the east and northwest parts of the country, Hasina noted.
</P>
<P>
She assured more facilities to the entrepreneurs who would set
industrial plants mainly agro-based industries in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This would create employment opportunities in the rural areas
and reduce the tendency of the people going to urban areas to
great extent, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister urged the investors to remain
vigilant so that environment of their areas were not polluted with
the industrial wastes.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is an agriculture-based country with more than 80
percent of its 127 million people living in the rural areas, and
among them, over 50 percent people are still living under the
poverty-line. The government has adopted a series of measures to
encourage local and foreign investors to set up industries in the
rural areas in a bid to alleviate poverty there.

<HEADLINE> Regional Cooperation for Flood Management Needed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Global warming, deforestation in
the upper riparian regions and human interventions in the natural
functioning of ecosystem are the causes of floods in Bangladesh,
speakers pointed out at a seminar held here Tuesday, a daily
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Flood management in Bangladesh demands an integrated approach
involving regional cooperation with the co-basin countries like
India, Nepal and Bhutan, as the primary cause of floods in
Bangladesh is the excessive rainfall in basins of three mighty
rivers -- the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna, The
Bangladesh Observer quoted the speakers as saying at the seminar
on "Flood 1998 and Management of Floods in Future".
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister A.M.S. Kabria said that short, medium and
long-term solutions to the frequent floods in the country should
be worked out in dealing with different dimensions of floods, and
regional cooperation would require in planning long-term flood
control programs.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning various steps which were taken by the government to
check the flood fury, Kabria said the nation has shown the prowess
as it happened in 1971 during the flood period of 1998 by facing
the century's worst ever natural calamity.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation with India, Nepal, Bhutan and China could
be helpful in reducing the severity and duration of floods,
Professor A.K. Azad Chowdhury stressed.
</P>
<P>
This was evident from the fact that the area inundated by major
floods increased gradually from 37,000 square kilometers in 1962
to 89,900 square kilometers in 1988 and one million square
kilometers in 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was hit by devastating floods from mid-July to
mid-September this year, which affected two-thirds of the country
and over 30 million people, inflicting a preliminary estimated
loss of about 4.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Lawyers See Lack of Evidence to Back Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's defenders forcefully pleaded his case before the House
of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, saying that the
president's conduct was "misleading, even maddening" but did not
warrant removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
"As surely as we know that what he did was sinful, we also know
it is not impeachable," White House lawyer Gregory Craig told a
committee bristling with skeptical Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses, including former lawmakers who sat in judgment
of former President Richard Nixon a quarter-century ago, argued
that Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair was no
Watergate, and thus not worthy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Republicans flashed frustration as the session dragged
on for 11 hours. "It has been very disappointing that we've had
very little discussion of the actual facts of the case after over
eight hours of testimony without a break," said Republican
lawmaker Charles Canady. "I think the facts are very troubling."
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of the committee's chairman, Republican
lawmaker Henry Hyde, the Judiciary Committee's staff has begun
drafting articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power. Committee votes are
expected to begin Friday.
</P>
<P>
Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they felt confident an article of impeachment alleging perjury
would garner support from all 21 committee Republicans, thus
assuring its approval.
</P>
<P>
In a 184-page written rebuttal of the charges released Tuesday
night, the White House argued that contrary to Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's claims, the president made no agreement with
Lewinsky to lie under oath and did not attempt to influence the
testimony of presidential secretary Betty Currie.

<HEADLINE> EU Sees New Era of Cooperation with SAARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
confident that its relations with South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will see a new era of cooperation
under the chairpersonship of Sri Lankan President Kumaratunga, the
official Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Sri Lanka is quite strong in its advocacy on
SAARC issues," Carlos Camino Munoz, head of external relations
(SAARC) of the EU, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Munoz told the paper that he believes President
Kumaratrunga will do her best to cooperate and motivate SAARC
nations to achieve the region's economic goals during her
chairpersonship.
</P>
<P>
In the SAARC region, Sri Lanka is known as a highly literate
nation. It is also known as a country producing quality goods
which play a major role in trade specially with the EU, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the EU has shown a keen interest in strengthening
ties with Asian groupings such as SAARC and ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations). As the EU expands its activities in the
global scene, its importance to countries like Sri Lanka grows
correspondingly, Munoz said.
</P>
<P>
In this context the EU and SAARC had signed a Memorandum of
Understanding, under which SAARC will benefit in the areas of
exchange of information, external relations and trade and training
for officials of SAARC institutions.

BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics show that the
ratio of sterility in China has jumped by three percent to one in
eight couples over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing Morning Post quoted experts as saying that the
causes of sterility are directly associated with the contemporary
environment and living habits.
</P>
<P>
Heavy smoking and liquor consumption, venereal diseases,
premarital sex and electromagnetic waves from household appliances
and telecommunications equipment are so-called "invisible
killers", factors contributing to a couple's weakening ability to
bear children.

<P>
Air and water pollution, as well as various diseases have also
been listed as causes of sterility.

Tyson and Francois Botha has been set on January 16, it was

</P>

View.
</P>
<P>

know no one believe that Botha is going to beat me."
</P>
<P>
Asked what round he'd stop Botha, Tyson replied:" Come to the

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Estimated to Grow By 0.8 Percent Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy will grow by
0.8 percent next year and inflation by 5.3 percent, according to
latest estimates from the National Economic and Social Development
Board (NESDB).
</P>
<P>
The figures contrast with those made in Thailand's updated
commitments to the International Monetary Fund of 1 percent growth
and 2.5-3 percent inflation.
</P>
<P>
Wirat Wattanasiritham, the board's secretary-general, was
quoted Wednesday by the Bangkok Post as saying that the NESDB's
forecasts were preliminary and would be reviewed later this month.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts would be as far ahead as 2001 and help the
government plan its budget for 2000. Figures would be submitted to
senior economic ministers on December 28.
</P>
<P>
This year, the economy was expected to contract by 7-8 percent,
according the NESDB. It also predicted inflation of 8.5 percent
this year, while the IMF forecast 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Turning to export value, the NESDB predicted a decline of 6.4
percent this year and 5 percent next year. Imports are forecast to
decline by 35.5 percent this year and 5.6 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB forecast a surplus of 13.5 billion U.S. dollars in
the trade balance this year and 14 billion U.S. dollars next year.
It also expected a current account surplus of 16 billion U.S.
dollars this year and 16.3 billion U.S. dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
Wirat claimed the economy would start to recover next year as
Thailand had been able to maintain exports and tourism. This was
mainly because the government had run a budget deficit of 3
percent of gross domestic product instead of 1 percent, freeing
100 billion baht (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) for investment.
</P>
<P>
However, the recovery would be slight as private investment
would improve only marginally. After declining by 45.8 percent
this year, private investment would grow by only 1 percent next
year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Right to Development, A Must in Globalization Age (Part I) By Gu Zhenqiu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- As the world is marking
the 50th anniversary this week of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, it should be further stressed once again that the
right to development should remain fundamental in realizing all
other human rights, especially in the current age of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"The right to development is the measure of the respect of all
other human rights. That should be our aim: a situation in which
all individuals are enabled to maximize their potential, and to
contribute to the evolution of society as a whole," U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said.
</P>
<P>
The right to development was first proclaimed as an inalienable
human right by the international community in 1986, following
years of debate. The Declaration on the Right to Development,
adopted that year by the United Nations General Assembly,
represented a new approach to the pursuit of the ideals of the
world body.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration says, "The human person is the central subject
of development and should be the participant and beneficiary of
the right to development." It further states that "The full
realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of
economic, social and cultural right is impossible."
</P>
<P>
Although everyone agrees that the goal of development is
economic progress and the creation of conditions to ensure a life
of dignity, debate continues on how to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
This is especially true in today's world of rapid globalization
where levels of official development assistance (ODA) are dropping
and private capital flows are increasing to certain parts of the
world to the exclusion of others.
</P>
<P>
While the globalization of the world economy has provided new
opportunities for development, it has also created new risks.
There is a risk of marginalization of countries, groups and
individuals that are unable to compete, as well as the increased
possibility of economic or financial instability and social
discontent.
</P>
<P>
At the July 1998 session of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council, Alioune Sene, former chairman of the Working Group on the
Right to Development which was set up by the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights in 1981, called for emergency measures to prevent the
exclusion of developing countries, especially least-developed
countries, from the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that each country needed to elaborate a policy
of development that was centered around the human rights.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics show that the greatest benefits of
globalization have been garnered by a fortunate few. The world's
least developed countries, with 10 percent of the world's people,
have only 0.3 percent of world trade -- half their share of two
decades ago.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Right to Development, A Must in Globalization Age (Part II) By Gu Zhenqiu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Further worse, the terms of trade are not favorable. Average
tariffs on industrial country imports from the least-developed
countries are 30 percent higher than the global average.
</P>
<P>
Overall, developing countries lose about 60 billion U.S.
dollars a year from agricultural subsidies and barriers to textile
exports in industrial nations. Also, more than half of all
developing countries have been bypassed by foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. figures, 1.5 billion people must get by on
less than one U.S. dollar a day. In South Asia, half of all
children under 5 are malnourished. Only a third of the people in
sub-Saharan Africa are likely to live past 40.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the time has come to move from a theoretical
debate to practical measures aimed at the realization of the right
to development. Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for
human rights, has said, "Human rights bring to the development
discussion a unifying set of standards -- a common references for
setting objectives and assessing the value of action."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, a January 1998 policy document of the U.N.
Development Program (UNDP) was worth a warm welcome. It outlines
plans to integrate human rights into activities aimed at fighting
poverty, promoting the advancement of women, protecting the
environment and developing the capacity for good governance.
</P>
<P>
Through its work, the 185-member United Nations continues to
call the world's attention to the problems, and presents avenues
for answers. As a result, there is an emerging consensus that all
countries and all major international economic and financial
agencies should engage more seriously in efforts to formulate
better policies towards globalization to ensure that the gap
between the rich and poor stops growing.
</P>
<P>
To be more specific, poor countries must first rely on
themselves for development. In other words, they must invest in
human development.
</P>
<P>
However, they, on the other hand, also need special support
from the international community -- through concessional
assistance, debt relief, trade preferences, technical cooperation
and national capacity-building -- if they are to make their way in
the fiercely competitive global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the main theme of our times. The
global problem needs global solution. Therefore, developed
countries should bear their responsibility to help their
developing counterparts. By doing so, the world can do a lot to
prevent many conflicts related to poverty, discrimination and
exclusion that contine to plague humanity and destroy decades of
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance from the developed world, the vicious cycle
of human rights violations that lead to conflicts, which in turn
lead to more violations, can stand more chance to be broken. For
it has been vindicating that without the right to development by
the developing countries, there will be no peace and stability in
the world, which, characterized by greater inter-dependence among
countries, will surely have negative impact on the economic
expansion of the developed world.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Urges Rebels to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Colombian
President Andres Pastrana on Tuesday called on the largest
guerrilla group in his country to return to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for a peaceful gesture from the guerrillas," Pastrana
said here on the last day of his official visit to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand why they have not" resumed the talks, he
said, noting that his government had met all the demands set by
the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) to discuss peace.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana and the leader of the FARC reached an agreement on
July 9 on setting up buffer zones. But in November a dispute
about buffer zones stalled the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana also condemned Monday's attack by a paramilitary group
on the community of La Guajira, which left between 10 and 20
people dead. Local paramilitary groups are involved in armed
fighting against the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president praised Mexico for its offer to be a
mediator in the peace talks, adding that the intermediaries would
be chosen through a consensus between the government and the
FARC.

<P>
BELGRADE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo Albanian negotiators
have rejected the latest U.S. draft accord for the Serbian
province, according to Yugoslav newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Munja newspaper on Tuesday quoted Kosovo Albanian chief
negotiator Fehmi Agani as saying, "It cannot serve as the basis
for negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Agani said on Monday in Pristina that Kosovo Albanians would
submit their own proposals to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo Albanians are not refusing to talk, but they will not
take part in talks before they submit their own proposals," Agani
said.
</P>
<P>
Adem Demaci, the political representative of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), holds the "same position" regarding
U.S. special envoy to the Balkans Christopher Hill's latest peace
plan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper Vecernje Novosti reported Demaci was very
angry with the U.S. plan. He told reporters in Pristina on
Tuesday that he asked the U.S. government to dismiss Hill as
U.S. special envoy.
</P>
<P>
Demaci said Hill's plan failed to mention the KLA, nor did it
discuss the future of Kosovo after the three-year transitional
period expires.
</P>

The Yugoslav news media has not yet revealed the details of the
latest U.S. draft.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Investments Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Investments soared this
year in the Panama canal zone after the United States honored its
treaty to return the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999, the
port authorities said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They cited China's Taiwanese company Evergreen, Hong Kong-based
Hutchinson plant and U.S. General Motors, which have projected
transporting at least one million containers a year through the
canal.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. company based in Kansas City has said it would rebuild
the trans-isthmian railway to boost maritime and port activities.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-U.S. company Alireza-Mobil has planned to invest 25
million U.S. dollars from 1998 to 2001 in a storage area in the
canal zone conceded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 326-hectare area includes 36 underground tanks with a total
storage capacity of 1.1 million barrels of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The port authorities also noted that the Petroport company
received in 1990 a 20-year renewable concession on 10 hectares
where it built 12 storage tanks with a capacity of 120,000 gallons
each.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Soeharto Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto began to be questioned at Jakarta's Higher Prosecutors
Office on Wednesday morning over alleged corruption, collusion and
nepotistic practices during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, accompanied by nine lawyers, arrived at the
Prosecutors Office at 07:20 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Thursday order Attorney
General Andi M. Ghalib to speed up the investigation into
Soeharto's alleged ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
According to a summons send by Ghalib to Soeharto on December
4, the questioning by the Attorney General's Office will focus on
the funds held by several foundations that Soeharto chaired and on
the tax exemptions granted to his son's company under the Timor
national car program.
</P>
<P>
On November 25, Soeharto handed over to the government the
funds from seven charity foundations he chaired, a total of about
4 trillion rupiah (530 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A document issued by Ghalib on Monday said that the 1996
presidential decree Soeharto issued to authorize the Timor
national car project was designed solely to promote family
interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, a company controlled by Soeharto's youngest
son Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra was given huge tax exemptions and
a multi-million U.S. dollar soft loan from a consortium of 16
banks, including state banks, to produce the Timor national car.
The project had caused the country losses of 1.55 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
He said he was ready to face any probe into his wealth as well
as allegations of corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he had 22 billion rupiah (3 million U.S.
dollars) deposited in three banks, and that his personal property
includes two houses in Jakarta and five hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, key associates of Soeharto were questioned at the
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Former industry and trade minister Tunku Ariwibowo was
questioned for more than five hours over the Timor national car
project. Also questioned was Hadiyanto, treasurer of the Dharmais
Foundation, one of the seven foundations handed over to the
government by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mohamad "Bob" Hasan, Tunky's immediate
successor as minister of industry and trade, would be questioned
on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office Barman Zahir said
Hasan, a close friend of Soeharto, would be questioned over
Soeharto's foundations.

<HEADLINE> WTO Praises Hong Kong for Continued Trade Openness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite the present economic
difficulties, China's Hong Kong has maintained its traditional
openness to both trade and investment and has not taken any
measures directly affecting imports or foreign investment, the
World Trade Organization (WTO) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its report on Hong Kong's trade policies and practices, the
WTO underlined two main events which put Hong Kong in the
spotlight since the last trade policy review in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The first is Hong Kong's return to the People's Republic of
China on July 1, 1997, and its designation as a Special
Administrative Region under the "one country, two systems"
framework. The second event is related to the economic crisis in
Southeast Asia, the WTO said after a two-day discussion with its
Trade Policy Review Body.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the first, the report noted that there is "no
indication that Hong Kong's traditional openness to trade and
foreign investment has been affected."
</P>
<P>
In regard to the second, the report found that even in the wake
of the crisis, "The government does not appear to have attempted
to influence the long-term structural evolution of Hong Kong's
economy."
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis which began in Thailand in July 1997
and then spread to other countries in Southeast Asia, seriously
impaired Hong Kong's economic performance and caused a dramatic
slowdown in economic activity, according to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Real GDP is expected to decline by four percent in 1998
compared to robust growth of 5.3 percent in 1997," said the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities in Hong Kong believe that competition is best
nurtured and sustained by allowing the free play of market forces
and keeping intervention to a minimum," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Hong Kong government has recently established
a body to handle complaints about anti-competitive private
practices while certain sectors, particularly telecommunications
and legal services, have been subjected to increased competition.
Hong Kong is also studying the possibility of increasing
competition in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
In its conclusions, the WTO report predicted that Hong Kong's
trade deficit is expected to narrow considerably in 1998,
suggesting that domestic product and factor markets may be
adjusting to reverse Hong Kong's recent decline in export
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"The recent fall in the value of the U.S. dollar, especially
relative to the Japanese yen, and cuts in U.S. interest rates,
will also help improve Hong Kong's growth prospects," it said.
</P>
<P>
"This, together with its traditional adherence to a free and
open market system, should facilitate Hong Kong's emergence from
the current economic crisis and contribute to a resumption of its
strong economic performance," the report concluded.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Stocks Soar After Chavez's No-devaluation Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- After Venezuelan president-elect
Hugo Chavez's announcement of not devaluing the currency or
imposing exchange controls, stock index of Caracas market on
Tuesday closed at a historic high of 4,757.78 points.
</P>
<P>
The Caracas stock exchange index recovered 835.50 points, or
21.39 percent, over last Friday's close, reflecting investors'
confidence toward Chavez.
</P>
<P>
"The president-elect's first steps have been positive and have
given back confidence to the country," an official stock exchange
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Chavez declared that he would favor and guarantee foreign
investments, slash the budget deficit, and respect all
international commitments.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Venezuelan currency, the Bolivar, against
the U.S. dollar also rose to 571.50 Bolivars against one dollar
over Friday's 576.50.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the financial enthusiasm could end up
soon due to expectation of currency devaluation under intense
pressure and possibility of a new banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
The economy is also expected to shrink one percent after
growing more than five percent in 1997, with the budget deficit
reaching 3.5 billion dollars this year and possibly five billion
dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has vowed to increase minimum wages and revamp health
and education systems. He said the money will come from
eliminating corruption and collecting more taxes.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Chilean senate
Andres Zaldivar has called on British Prime Minister Tony Blair to
promptly send back Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Blair and published on Tuesday by the local
press, Zaldivar said that British Home Secretary Jack Straw's
imminent decision on Pinochet's extradition to Spain would play a
crucial role in the country's fragile transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chile had carried out a difficult transition since
1990, and that the process had been made "tense" by Pinochet's
house arrest in London.
</P>
<P>
Zaldivar said that Chile's hard-won democracy needed more
justice and truth in human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are in one of these very sensitive moments, which
is why I ask you to forward this message to Secretary Straw so he
can adequately appreciate our thoughts when he makes decision," he
said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Zaldivar said that Pinochet's return to Chile would not affect
trials by local courts of human rights abuses in the country.

<HEADLINE> NBA Cancels All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The All-Star Game is the
latest casualty of the NBA lockout that is in its 161st day.
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern announced today that the labor
stalemate has forced the league to cancel the showcase event,
which was scheduled for February 14 in Philadelphia. It marks the
first time the league has canceled the All-Star Game, which had
been held every year since 1951.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the entire season is in such jeopardy at this
late date because of the labor dispute prevents us from having an
All-Star Game," said Stern.
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfair for us to ask the city of Philadelphia and
all our business partners to move forward with any more
commitments, plans or expenditures when there is so much
uncertainly surrounding the season. In light of the continuing
labor dispute, we really are left with no choice other than to
cancel the game."
</P>
<P>
Stern refused to set any "drop dead" date today, but again
acknowledged the possibility of canceling the entire season. "We
don't want to lose the season, but the season will run out and
cancel itself," said Stern.
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement will "cheat millions of fans and the city
of Philaelphia out of a wonderful sepctacle," said union
executive director Billy Hunter.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately for the owners, their effort to further
intimidate the players will not succeed," he continued. "We
already have offered unprecedented concessions and willing to
negotiate even further, but we will only accept a deal that is
fair to both sides."
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the cancelation of the
All-Star Game would cost the city an estimated $35 million in
revenue. The city's hotels, which set aside 5.300 rooms for the
NBA, had expected to take in more than $6 million.
</P>
<P>
The "Jam Session", a four-day event of displays and
interactive events that was expected to draw as many as 100,000
people to the Philadelphia Convention Center, had already been
called off.
</P>
<P>
"We apologize to everyone in Philadelphia, but we promise to
bring the All-Star Weekend back as soon as possible," Stern
assured.
</P>
<P>
No new negotiations are scheduled between owners and the
union. On Thursday, the two sides met for 10 1/2 hours in New
York but made little progress.
</P>
<P>
Stern again said he would not accept a union offer to send the
talks to mediation.
</P>
<P>
"We have had plenty of dialogue," said Stern. "What we have is
an absolutely different view of the situation."
</P>
<P>
A total of 250 games already have been lost to the lockout
through today and with a month needed to sign players and hold
training camps, an additional 200 will be canceled before even an
abbreviated season can begin.
</P>
<P>
"There is still enough to make up for the damage caused to our
sport, but only if the owners turn constructive rather than
destructive," Hunter said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Private Banks Expected to Fall to 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has said the number of private banks is expected to fall
to 50 from the current 150 as a result of the ongoing
recapitalization program.
</P>
<P>
"Currently there are about 150 banks and most of them need
recapitalization which will cost a lot of money. I have told
bankers these must be consolidated to become 50 banks," Habibie
said when opening the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Congress here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government recently launched a banking
recapitalization program in a bid to revive the country's ailing
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Bank recapitalization is one of the four measures in the
government's bank restructuring program. The others are cleaning
up bad credits, the liquidation of insolvent banks, merging state
banks and recovery of liquidity support.
</P>
<P>
All commercial banks are required to have a minimum capital
adequacy ratio of 4 percent by the end of this year, 8 percent by
the end of 1999, and 10 percent by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Capital adequacy ratio is the ratio between equity capital and
risk-weighted assets.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the government will provide 80 percent of
the required funding, while the remainder has to be provided by
the banks' owners. In return, the government will get a non-voting
equity stake in the banks.
</P>
<P>
Banks whose capital ratios are below minus 25 percent were
given one month from the end of September to inject fresh capital
in order to qualify for the government recapitalization program.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to close some banks that don't meet
the required standards while others are set to be merged.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he expects the country's inflation will
slow to between 35 and 40 percent in the current fiscal year
ending in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation in the fiscal year 1998-99 is expected to be around
35-40 percent, in 1999-2000 around 10-20 percent and if we are
consistent with our policy, we hope in the year 2001, inflation
will be below 10 percent", he was quoted by national newspapers
Tuesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Pioneer Back as New Village Leader by Popular Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Yan Hongchang, who was one of 18
farmers to begin China's rural reforms 20 years, made a come-back
when he was elected to office in the village of Xiaogang's first
democratic elections recently.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old farmer got 137 of the 258 votes cast, beating
out his only competitor, 29-year-old Wu Guangde, as the new
chairman of the villagers' committee.
</P>
<P>
"I must live up to my fellow villagers' trust," Yan said after
winning the elections, "I hope all the villagers will support and
supervise me."
</P>
<P>
In late 1978, Yan and 17 other farmers signed an agreement to
secretly carved some People's Commune-owned farmlands up into
smaller plots for each family in Xiaogang to manage on their own,
an act that was regarded capitalistic at the time, one that could
conceivably result in a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
In the "counterrevolutionary" document, which is now on display
at Beijing's Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the 18 men swore
that if any one of them was persecuted by the authorities for this
act of putting their lives on the line, his children would be
supported by the rest of the signatories until the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
Xiaogang is in Anhui Province's Fengyang County, which used to
have thousands of beggars. "We had no choice but to reform at the
time, because starvation would kill us all," Yan recalled. Almost
everyone in the village went begging for some time before 1978,
Yan said.
</P>
<P>
But, the farmers were lucky when it turned out that their bold
move coincided with the CPC's Third Plenary Session of the
Eleventh Central Committee in December 1978, the landmark start of
China's reforms that were the brainchild of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In just one year, the pilot reforms of the Xiaogang villagers
turned them from starving beggars into people with food and
clothing. And, farmers in other parts of the country followed
their example the following year and later.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Xiaogang is seen by many as the cradle of China's
rural reforms.
</P>
<P>
For many years, Yan has never stopped his effort to help his
fellow villagers be better-off. He lives with his wife and four
children and last year made a good income from raising ducks.
</P>
<P>
He concluded, "I want to set an example for my fellow villagers
by doing so, and I want to tell them that if you work harder and
get wiser, you may become as rich as others."

scheduled, or there could be no action toward a possible
revocation of probation taken until sentencing in Maryland."
</P>
<P>
Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges in
Maryland last week, and that could be used as evidence by the
judge to throw him to jail.
</P>
<P>
"Until I've received the report and made a decision, it would
be inappropriate to comment on possible action," Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is expected early next year.
</P>
<P>
Tyson came out from prision in 1995 after Gifford added four
years of probation, meaning Tyson could be sent back to jail for
any further violation. He has violated terms of his probation as
a result of his no-contest plea.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's no-contest plea stemmed from a minor traffic accident
in August in which two motorists claimed Tyson kicked and punched
them.

<HEADLINE> Clubs from France, Italy and Spain Dominate UEFA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Clubs from France, Spain and
Italy had a domination of the quater-final berths at the UEFA
soccer competitions on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
AS Roma, Bologna and Parma of Italy will go into next
Wednesday's draw in Geneva along with Olympique Marseille,
Bordeaux and Olympique Lyon of France.
</P>
<P>
Celta Vigo of Spain are also through, joined by Atletico
Madrid who beat fellow-Spaniards Real Sociedad 5-3 on aggregate
after extra time.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the history of the competition that
all clubs from northern Europe have been eliminated by this stage.
</P>
<P>
Parma set the tone for the day when they came from behind to
beat Rangers of Scotland 3-1 in an afternoon kickoff for a 4-2
aggregate win.
</P>
<P>
Parma's Seria A rivals Bologna and Roma also reached the last
eight even though neither team won their second leg matches.
</P>
<P>
Bologna lost 1-0 at Real Betis in Spain but came through 4-2
on aggregate while Roma drew 2-2 at FC Zurich to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
No French team has ever won the UEFA Cup but Lyon, Marseille
and Bordeaux will all try to put that right next spring.
</P>
<P>
Alain Caveglia scored a hat-trick as Olympique Lyon reached
the quarter-finals of a European competition for the first time
since the 1967-68 season when they won an outstanding match 4-3
at Club Bruges.
</P>
<P>
Bordeaux came through after a 0-0 draw with Grasshoppers saw
them qualify on the away goals rule after drawing 3-3 in the
first leg two weeks ago. Grasshoppers had Mihai Tararache sent
off after 78 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A fierce battle between Marseille and Monaco ended in a 1-0
win for the home side who won with a 71st minute goal from Titi
Camara which put Marseille 3-2 ahead over the two legs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Celta Vigo of Spain completed a double of victories
over English teams with a comprehensively stylish win over
Liverpool at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Although they only won 1-0 on the night thanks to a fine 57th
minute individual strike from Israeli international Haim Revivo,
Vigo won 4-1 on aggregate for their second victory over an E
nglish side following their second round win over Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of drama in Spain where Atletico Madrid beat
Real Sociedad 5-3 on aggregate thanks to two goals in two minutes
midway through the first period of extra time.
</P>
<P>
Two goals from Yugoslav international Vladimir Jugovic -- one
from the penalty spot -- had put Atletico 3-2 ahead on aggregate
before Javier Gracia pulled it back to 2-1 after 53 minutes to
level the aggregate scores.
</P>
<P>
Extra time goals from Santi and Jose Mari Romero, who is 20 on
Thursday, gave Arrigo Sacchi's Atletico victory and completed the
Latin domination of the competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government on
Tuesday set up a crisis center to deal swiftly and comprehensively
with law, order and security, national newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With an official title of the "Council for Security and Law
Enforcement", the center is headed by President B.J. Habibie, with
Defense Minister/Commander of the Armed Forces General Wiranto as
the executive chief (operations), and Justice Minister Muladi as
deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tanjung told reporters that the
center was tasked with controlling and coordinating efforts to
tackle the crisis swiftly and comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
The crisis continues to threaten national stability and law
enforcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the resignation of former president Soeharto on May
21 this year, the country has been plagued by a series of violent
demonstrations and mass riots.
</P>
<P>
The latest riots have taken place in Ketapang, central Jakarta
and in Kupang, capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, have
undertones of religious conflict.
</P>

ministers, while the other include Police chief Roesmanhadi,
Attorney General Andi Ghalib, Chief of the Intelligence
Coordinating Board BAKIN Zacky Makarim, newly elected Chairman of

<HEADLINE> Koloskov Reelected Head of Russian Soccer Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Vyacheslav Koloskov was
reelected president of the Russian Soccer Union on Tuesday,
ending two months of a sometimes nasty race for the position.
</P>
<P>
Koloskov netted 52 votes in secret balloting. His strongest
rival, Russian Soccer League President Nikolai Tolstykh, got only
eight votes.
</P>
<P>
The victory will add five more years to Koloskov's 20-year
reign at the top of Russian soccer.
</P>
<P>
Death threats, corruption and millions of dollars had been the
hot topics for the fierce election for the most enticing position
in Russian sport.
</P>
<P>
The campaign had seen mud fly from the contenders.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Koloskov accused Tolstykh of making death threats
through a third person.
</P>
<P>
Tolstykh denied the accusation but he did blame Koloskov for
the misuse of funds and said last week that millions of dollars
were not put into Russian soccer but hidden abroad, The Moscow
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Another candidate was Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the
Russian republic of Kalmykia. Ilymzhinov, incumbent president of
the World Chess Federation, guaranteed that Russia would win the
World Cup in 2002 if he was elected. He also offered to spend 6
million dollars to help Russian soccer.
</P>
<P>
Russian soccer is now at an all-time low. It failed to qualify
for the World Cup for the first time in 20 years this year.
</P>
<P>
The national team's recent defeat to tiny Iceland has put its
chance of qualifying for the European championships at almost
zero.

<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- David Batty completed signing
of a transfer from Newcastle United to his former club Leeds on
Monday after the two clubs agreed on a 4.4 million pounds (about
7.25 million U.S. dollars) fee.
</P>
<P>
The England midfielder returns to Leeds -- where he won the
championship in 1992 -- five years after being sold to Blackburn
to reduce debts at the club.
</P>
<P>
A smiling Batty signed a deal that will keep him at Elland
Road for four-and-a-half year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Peter Risdale said: "David is a one-off...his heart
is here and we are delighted to have him back."
</P>
<P>
Batty said he had never wanted to leave Leeds in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old has been in limbo for nearly two weeks as
Newcastle and Leeds haggled over his value. Leeds reportedly
offered 4 million pounds while Newcastle wanted 6 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Batty said on Monday: "I am pleased the deadlock has been
broken and I am grateful to Ruud (Gullit) for his reasonable
attitude throughout."

<HEADLINE> White House Releases New Defense of Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The White House released a
184-page detailed defense of President Bill Clinton on Tuesday,
saying that his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter was sinful
but did not warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
"We believe a careful and fair review of the real record of
this case -- not the political attacks but the real record --
cannot justify the impeachment of the president," Clinton's
lawyers wrote in the document.
</P>
<P>
"We rely on the judgment of the House... to separate fact from
myth, the record from the rhetoric, and the sinful from the
impeachable," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The White House submitted the document to the House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee, which is holding hearings on
whether to impeach Clinton for his efforts to conceal his affair
with former White House intern Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time Clinton's lawyers released documents to
counter Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's allegations that
Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power in trying to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
The document specifically denied those three allegations and
argued that Starr was biased in conducting his investigation.
</P>
<P>
The document argued that Clinton's conduct did not meet the
standard of "high crimes and misdemeanors" set for impeachment in
the Constitution. It also argued that impeachment was intended
only for political offenses against the state, not for private
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Judge McDonald Fails to Get U.N. Into Rebuking Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia, Judge
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, Tuesday failed to get a Security Council
statement rebuking Belgrade for what she said its failure to
extradite three suspects accused of the 1991 massacre of 260
civilians in the Croatian city of Vukovar.
</P>
<P>
Judge McDoald's failure came after the Russian permanent
representative to the United Nations, Sergei Lavrov, prevented the
15-member Security Council from again rebuking the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia on the issue of Vukovar.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was prepared to issue a press statement,
but Lavrov refused to agree on the council's proposed action,
diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
McDonald Tuesday briefed the Security Council on what she
described as Belgrade's non-compliance with relevant U.N.
resolutions and international obligations.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement read by her spokeswoman to the press
here, McDonald was falbbergasted that not only did Belgrade refuse
to extradite the three but had now asked the international
tribunal for its record, so it could conduct its own
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Thus not only is (Belgrade) failing to abide by the explicit
requirements of Security Council resolutions, it is taking action
in direct contravention," she said.
</P>
<P>
At issue are three suspects, Mile Mrksic, Miroslav Radic and
Veselin Slijvancanin, indicted by the Hague-based tribunal in
November 1995 for their involvement in the killing of 260 people,
many of whom were said to be unarmed men forcibly removed from a
Vukovar hospital at the start of the Balkan war in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Decides to Deploy Civilian Monitors in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Tuesday decided to deploy civilian monitors in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council met on U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's latest report on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In the report submitted to the council last week, Annan
recommended establishment of a Civilian Affairs Unit within the
United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with the primary
objective of monitoring the situation and seeking to promote the
respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive
and systematic violation of human rights and humanitarian law in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the Security Council demanded Taliban, as
well as other Afghan factions, stop fighting, conclude a
cease-fire and resume negotiations without delay and preconditions
under Untied Nations auspices, and cooperate with the aim of
creating a broad-based and fully representative government.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the progress made by the Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General in his efforts to reduce tensions in the
region and towards improving the human rights and humanitarian
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its call upon all states to take
resolute measures to prohibit their military personnel from
planning and participating in military operations in the country
and immediately to end the supply of arms and ammunition to all
parties to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
It urged all Afghan factions, and in particular the Taliban, to
demonstrate their full commitment to the safety and security of
all international and humanitarian personnel, which is a
prerequisite for their activities in Afghanistan, to facilitate
their work and to ensure unimpeded access and adequate conditions
for the delivery of aid to all in need of it.

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK Extend Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to extend
their talks on a U.S. demand for access to a DPRK underground
working site, the State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side alleged that the site could be part of a renewed
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will meet again Thursday in New York, where the
talks started last Friday, State Department spokesman James Foley
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any progress in the talks held in Washington
Monday and Tuesday, Foley said, "I have nothing to report on the
meeting, either positively or negatively. It's not something that
we do -- report on an ongoing negotiation."
</P>
<P>
The United States has said its aim attending the talks is to
secure access to the building site at the village of Kumchang-ri,
where the United States alleged there was an underground building
site that could be connected with a revived nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has denied that the building work was nuclear-related
and has asked the United States to promise 300 million dollars in
compensation if a search proved negative, which, however, was
rejected by Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks coincided with a trip to Asia by President Bill
Clinton's newly appointed coordinator of policy toward the DPRK,
former Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
Perry was traveling "strictly in listening mode" to collect
information for his policy review, Foley told the reporters at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States had no plans for the moment to
ease any of its sanctions against the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to see changes in North Korean attitudes on other
issues on concern including the missile area where we have
separate talks, we would be willing to look at an improved
relationship between the United States and North Korea in which
those kinds of issues, including sanctions, would be on the
table," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we don't have plans to take any further steps on easing
sanctions at this time," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals to Angolan Combatants for Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
appealed to Angolan rebels and the Angolan government to avoid
escalation of fighting and reach a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
"We recall our calls on both UNITA and the government of Angola
to avoid further escalation of the war in Angola. A political
settlement offers the best hope for lasting peace," State
Department spokesman James Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government forces and UNITA forces are engaged in heavy
fighting outside the strategic town of Cuito, while government war
planes have raided UNITA strongholds, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The United States used to back UNITA against the government led
by the formerly Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
(MPLA). But in 1994 it supported an agreement which ended 20 years
of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has not been implemented in full because of deep
suspicion between the MPLA and UNITA.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Israel, Palestine Talk on Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy
Dennis Ross Tuesday called on the Palestinians and Israel to
bridge their differences through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here earlier in the day, made the call at a
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ross said U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region,
which will start Saturday, will help solve the dispute between
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Ross stressed that as the person who was instrumental in
reaching the Wye peace agreement between Israel and the PNA,
Clinton can also help when there is trouble in implementing the
deal.
</P>
<P>
With the mediation of the U.S., Israel and the PNA signed the
Wye accord on October 23, under which Israel will pull out from
a further 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for tougher
Palestinian actions against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel is supposed to free 750 Palestinian prisoners
by the end of January, 1999. Last month, 250 of them were
released, but most were criminals, not the political prisoners
demanded by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations staged Monday by Palestinians in the West Bank
to press for more release of prisoners are continuing and have
repeatedly erupted into violent street clashes.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended the implementation of the peace accord last
week, saying that it will further pull out from the West Bank
until the PNA made concessions over such issues as prisoners and
statehood.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have threatened to declare an independent state
in May next year no matter whether a peace deal with Israel is
reached or not.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Ross, Netanyahu stressed that Israel is
serious in asking the PNA to accept these conditions.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the region, Clinton will take part in the
meeting of the Palestinian National Council (PNC) Monday on the
repeal of anti-Israeli clauses in the Palestinian national charter.
</P>
<P>
Ross said it will be clear for all to see that during the PNC's
meeting the clauses calling for the destruction of Israel will be
revoked.
</P>
<P>
Ross will also meet the PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat Tuesday
night.

<HEADLINE> Earth at Its Warmest in Past 12 Centuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. climate scientist said
that the warming of the Earth in this century is without precedent
in at least 1200 years and this cannot be fully explained by any
known combination of natural forces, the Washington Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A new research, presented at the American Geophysical Union in
San Francisco Monday, suggests that this century's warmer
temperatures are appearing more anomalous as scientists improve
their understanding of climate change in the past. Not only the
20th century produced the hottest years on record, but the
magnitude of change appears to be without parallel since at least
800 A.D.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about
1 degree Fahrenheit since 1880s, with many of the century's
warmest years occurring in the past decade. Scientists predict
1998 will surpass 1997 as the warmest year since record-keeping
began.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Jonathan Overpeck, head of the
paleoclimatology program for the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said that climate change as far back
as the Holy Roman Empire is strengthening the argument that humans
are partly responsible for the rising temperatures.
</P>
<P>
"Twentieth century global warming is a reality and should be
taken seriously," he said.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Back Human Embryo Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British scientists advised
Tuesday that the British government should allow the cloning of
human embryos for research into new treatments that could
transform medicine into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The joint report, from the British Human Genetics Advisory
Commission (HGAC) and the Human Fertilization and Embryology
Authority (HFEA), is seen as a major vote of support for
development of human cells to replace those damaged by disease.
</P>
<P>
The joint HGAC/HFEA Cloning Working Group report advised that
while cloning of grown human beings should remain outlawed,
early-stage embryos are a legitimate subject for research, and the
rigid rules should be relaxed in this case.
</P>
<P>
The British government should introduce legislation explicitly
banning human reproductive cloning, which would effectively
separate the issue of reproductive cloning from cloning as part of
the search for new therapies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that British Health Secretary Frank Dobson
should consider changing the regulations so that the HFEA can
issue licenses for the "development of therapeutic treatments for
diseased or damaged tissues or organs."
</P>
<P>
The recommendation followed new development by American
scientists who have succeeded in isolating and growing cultures of
human embryonic stem cells, the undeveloped parents of all the
tissues in the body.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that this could ultimately lead to the growth of
replacement tissue in laboratories, which would avoid all the
usual transplant problems of rejection.
</P>
<P>
Scientists forecast a day when brain cells are harvested to
replace those lost through degenerative disorders such as
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and muscle tissue and perhaps
even whole organs are grown from scratch.
</P>
<P>
But the key to such breakthroughs is cloning copies of
early-stage embryos from which stem cells can be taken.
</P>
<P>
However, critics have said that the move would be ill-advised,
and have suggested that the motivation may be more to prevent
Britain from falling behind the United States in research
techniques than for genuine advancement of human welfare.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says U.S. Late to Remove It From Drug List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Tuesday that the United States was extremely
late in removing Tehran from a U.S. list of Main drug-producing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"No country can deny the significant role of the Islamic
Republic of Iran in campaign against narcotics," Kharrazi was
quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has been waging a war against drug
traffickers and so far 2,350 Iranian anti-drug fighters have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has been very late in admitting this reality,"
Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
The U. S. announced on Monday that it has removed Iran and
Malaysia from the list of countries considered to be major drug
producers or transit nations.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts said the U.S. decision did not
mean any change in Washington's hostile attitude towards Tehran.
</P>
<P>
A commentary on Iranian radio Tuesday said the U.S. decision is
meaningless. "whether the name of Iran is included or not included
in the annual list of the American government will not remove
anything or add anything to the reality of Iran's campaign against
international drug trafficking," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran started its campaign against drug trafficking in 1989
after the Iranian Majlis pass a strict anti-drug law, which
allows death penalty on those caught with more than 30 grams of
heroin or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been used as a transit route by drug traffickers who
had been smuggling drugs from border areas of Afghanistan and
Pakistan into Iran and onto Europe.
</P>
<P>
Iran has confiscated 110 tonnes of various narcotics since
the beginning of this Iranian calendar year (to end March 20,
1999), senior Iranian officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Tehran has frequently blasted Washington
for keeping it on the list of drug states, ignoring Iran's efforts
in fighting narcotics.

<HEADLINE> EU Finances Industry Upgrading in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
grant 250 million ECUs (300 million U.S. dollars) to Egypt to
finance the country's industry upgrading.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by EU representative office in Cairo on
Tuesday said Egypt's program to modernize its industries is one of
the most important projects in its economic liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
The grant was finalized in last month's talks on a partnership
agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU also agreed to supply Egypt with a loan of 402 million
ECUs (482.4 million dollars) in the coming three years for the
industry modernization program.
</P>
<P>
The grant is the largest of its kind that the 15-nation
EU has so far extended to Egypt, the Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of the Egyptian government to promote industries are
aimed at forming a solid economic basis that can enable Egypt to
play a key role in the proposed Euro-Mediterranean free trade
zone, which is planned to be set up in 2010, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The free trade zone is one of the results achieved in the
conference held in Barcelona, Spain, in 1995, between the EU
members and 12 countries, including Egypt, along the southern and
western coast of the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The countries participating in the Barcelona process, or
Euro-Med partnership, have pledged join efforts to boost
regional security, economic integration and social development,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Must Be Equipped to Respond: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that the Western military
alliance must be better equipped to respond to outside crises as
well.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the NATO foreign ministers council meeting,
Albright said that the threats NATO allies face today and tomorrow
could come from a number of different sources, including from
areas beyond NATO's immediate borders.
</P>
<P>
If the threats are not addressed early and effectively, the
U.S. secretary of state asserted, they could grow into Article V
threats.
</P>
<P>
Article Five of the NATO Washington Treaty gives the alliance
the right for collective self-defense against invasion.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers gathered here for a final formal
discussion on the formulation of the future strategic concept of
the alliance that is to be unveiled at next April's NATO summit at
heads of state and government level.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the new strategic concept must be "fully
consistent with the alliance's new security environment" and
should reaffirm the alliance's commitment to collective defense
and the transatlantic link.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the council meeting said that the new
strategic concept should render NATO an alliance ready and with a
full range of capabilities to enhance security and stability for
countries in the Euro-Atlantic area in the next century and to
implement non-Article V crisis response operations outside the
NATO geographical area.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state described the new strategic concept
as an updated one that has to find the right balance between
affirming the centrality of Article V collective defense missions
and ensuring that the fundamental tasks of the alliance are
intimately related to the broader defense of the allies' common
interests.
</P>
<P>
"Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal with
instability when it is still at arm's length than to wait until it
is at the doorstep," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
Some European allies, led by France, are opposed to the United
States' stance concerning non-Article V missions. They argue that
the military missions outside the NATO geographical area should be
enshrined by United Nations mandates.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its European allies had opposing views
when they prepared for the crisis-management mission in Kosovo.
The United States said that NATO did not need a U.N. mandate to
act whereas several of its European allies argued that NATO
missions outside its traditional geographical area had to be based
on a legality in the form of United Nations mandates.
