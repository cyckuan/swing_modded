<HEADLINE> Canada Lauds De Beer Policy Shift on Angolan Diamond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada Thursday applauded
the decision by De Beers, the world's largest diamond marketer, to
place an embargo on the purchase of all diamonds from Angola by
its buying offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
De Beers has undertaken this action in support of U.N.
sanctions intended to deny sources of funding to the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which
has been waging a war of insurgency for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with this policy announcement by De Beers
Consolidated Mines Limited," Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Canadian Mission to the United Nations here,
the foreign minister said, "Canada, as Chair of the U.N. Security
Council Angola Sanctions Committee, is seeking to bring about
adherence to U.N. sanctions against UNITA in order to create the
conditions for a resumption of negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"Cooperative efforts such as this one, when carried through,
will have a significant impact on making the U.N. sanctions
effective," he said. "I hope that others in the diamond industry
will follow the lead of De Beers in offering support to the work
of the Sanctions Committee."
</P>
<P>
Robert Fowler, the Canadian permanent representative to the
United Nations, has paid visits to Central and Southern Africa and
Europe to increase awareness of, and compliance with, the
sanctions regime.
</P>
<P>
Under Canada's leadership, the Sanctions Committee has also
established two expert panels at the U.N. to collect information
on the sources and methods of violations of sanctions regimes, and
to recommend measures both to end those violations and to improve
the implementation of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of sanctions is the raison d'etre of the
Sanctions Committee," the foreign minister said. "It is Canada's
aim to develop tougher measures to constrain the trade in arms,
diamonds and other resources, thereby making it more difficult for
UNITA to wage war."
</P>
<P>
"It is time to tackle the new war economy, where a direct
relationship exists between certain illicit businesses, corrupt
officials, mercenaries and warlords," he said. "In Angola, that
relationship perpetuates misery, conflict and the victimization of
innocent people."
</P>
<P>
De Beers said Tuesday that it will stop buying diamonds
originating from Angola, except for those it has already
contracted to purchase.

<HEADLINE> Newly Formed Somali Party Demonstrate Muscles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A newly founded Somali Party,
United Somali Republic Party, held a big rally for the first time
to demonstrate its muscles in a stadium of the war-torn capital
city on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people from the Ayr subclan of Habar Gidir, the
main supporters of the party, and dignitaries from other clans
have attended the rally. Dozens of battle wagons and hundreds of
militiamen surrounded the stadium to guard against any incidents.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators carrying flags and slogans backing the new party
marched in the street leading to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
The new party, founded a year ago and headed by Somali-American
Abdinur Ahmed Darman, sent out vehicles with loud speakers
distributed leaflets in the streets of south Mogadishu on
Wednesday night .
</P>
<P>
One of the Somali leading warlords, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, had
threatened earlier that no demonstrations could be held within his
controlled area without his approval.
</P>
<P>
Aidid's faction has accused the newly formed party for being
foreign manipulated elements that are dividing the community of
the Habar Gidir clan.
</P>
<P>
However, no incidents were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The party's spokesman Bashir Nur Gedi said that the party aims
to build a government through meaningful reconciliation, encourage
freedom of speech and realize mutual respect and co-existence with
neighboring countries including Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, the party demanded the United Nations and the
United States to pay the Somalis compensation for the death,
injuries and loss of properties caused by the fighting on October
3, 1993.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Somalis are believed to have killed in the bloody
armed confrontation, which was the most serious battle that ever
took place between Aidid's militiamen and the multinational forces
led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The formation and the show of power by the United Somali
Republic Party signals serious fragmentation among the various
subclans earlier united under the leadership of Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Aidid succeeded his late father in late 1996, the
main Habar Gidir clan has been having trouble in its leadership.

<HEADLINE> New Flow of Displaced to Harm Angola's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- New flow of displaced people
caused by fierce fightings in Angola's central plateau will
prejudice the government's agricultural campaign, a report by the
U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the tension continues till the next crop, the people in the
area will suffer hunger, according to the report which reflects
the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Angola since September
20.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the military situation in central
plateau, traditional base of the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola, Angola has seen a great tide of displaced
persons fleeing from the warring areas.
</P>
<P>
By September 20, the food reserve of the World Food Program in
Angola has reached 76,448 tons, but this amount is utterly
inadequate for the increasing number of the displaced, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the delay of available seeds and agricultural
utensils, mainly caused by the current difficult transportation in
rural areas under the control of the rebels, has impeded the
agricultural campaign from the beginning.

<HEADLINE> Former SPD Chairman Criticizes German Gov't for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Oscar Lafontaine, former German
finance minister and chairman of the ruling Social Democratic
Party (SPD), lashed out at the cabinet led by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder for its participation in the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder had betrayed the peaceful foreign policy of the
SPD, he said.
</P>
<P>
In part of his memoirs disclosed in Thursday's Die Welt
newspaper, Lafontaine said, "At the very beginning I have found it
hard to support Schroeder's Kosovo policy." The memoirs, titled
"The Heart Beats At The Left," are due to be fully published in
coming days.
</P>
<P>
On March 13, Lafontaine surprisingly announced his resignation,
both as the finance minister and as the party chairman, after a
bitter quarrel with Schroeder over the economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Twelve days later NATO launched the war, in which the German
government took part actively by sending 14 Tornado jet fighters
and thousands of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"As we have known today, the NATO had achieved none of its
goals," said Lafontaine in his book, "neither to prevent the
humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, nor to avoid the heavy loss of
Serb people."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the war, at which the economy and infrastructure of
Serbia had been severely damaged, was directed against the Serb
people," the memoirs said.
</P>
<P>
"During the war the question hit me, whether it was a right
choice to have quitted simultaneously as finance minister and as
party chairman," said Lafontaine, since he might have prevented
Germany's participation as party chairman.
</P>
<P>
"The peaceful and conciliatory policy of Willy Brandt (the late
German chancellor and SPD chairman) was, for me and for many other
people, what attracted us to the SPD," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine insisted the war should have been avoided if NATO
and the German cabinet had done more negotiating work. "The
political and military procedure of NATO was irresponsible," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the Kosovo war NATO has thrown overboard all the
obligations. It deployed force without a mandate of the UN. And
the military missions violated the human rights and the NATO
charter," said Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
As the real designer of Germany's governing red-green coalition
that won the federal election in last autumn, Lafontaine also
critcized Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister and leader of the
Greens party, saying the latter should have defended the authority
of the United Nations at that time.
</P>
<P>
"It was unforgivable to follow the Americans and to push the
U.N. aside," Lafontaine said.
</P>
<P>
"The war has changed Germany, and I hope now we have drawn
right lessons from it," the memoirs said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cancels Scheduled Release of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel announced Thursday
that it would not release 151 Palestinian prisoners Friday as
scheduled in the latest Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement,
saying new dispute has arisen in the negotiations over the terms
of the release.
</P>
<P>
"We were planning to release (prisoners) tomorrow ... there
will not be a release of Palestinian prisoners," Israeli Internal
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said on Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said the Palestinians had raised objections to the
list of prisoners Israel is prepared to release and Israel would
try to understand the Palestinian position.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed one month
ago, Israel is obligated to release 150 Palestinian prisoners
Friday in the second batch of a total of 350 prisoners to be
freed. Israel released the first group of 199 prisoners on
September 9.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute centered on Israel's inclusion of some
prisoners whose sentence terms would be finished in a few
months. The Palestinians demand that those to be release should
have at least five years of sentence term left.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said, however, that Israel has the right to decide the
list alone under the agreement, although it would consult with the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
The dispute emerged in spite that the Israeli security cabinet
agreed Wednesday to relax the criteria for the release, approving
the inclusion of 12 prisoners who are members of the Islamic
militant groups Hamas and Jihad but did not kill Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said earlier that it would not set free those who
had killed Israelis or belong to Hamas and Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the prisoner release came two days after
Israel and the Palestinians clinched a deal on the opening of a
safe passage route linking Gaza and the West Bank. The deal was
signed after the two sides overcoming their difference which has
prevented the route from being opened Sunday as scheduled in the
Sharm el-Sheikh agreement.

<HEADLINE> FBI Faces Challenge in Battling Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) is facing a serious challenge in fighting
against computer-savvy terrorists and hackers, an FBI official
said.
</P>
<P>
The FBI is training agents across the country to investigate
threats posed by terrorists and hackers trying to break into the
nation's most sensitive data networks, but the training has been
confined to only a handful of its biggest field offices, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
That shortfall comes during a time of growing recognition
within the federal government that even some of the nation's most
critical computer networks are inadequately protected, Michael
Vatis, head of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection
Center, disclosed in congressional testimony Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Vatis told the Senate Judiciary technology and
terrorism subcommittee that the FBI has trained teams of at least
seven cyber-agents in field offices in Washington, New York, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and four other cities.
</P>
<P>
But "because of resource constraints, the other field offices
have only one to five agents dedicated to working on... (computer
intrusion) matters," Vatis said.
</P>
<P>
The FBI's case load for computer hacking and intrusion
investigations continues to grow dramatically, Vatis said. The
agency has 800 pending cases, and the number of those
investigations is doubling every year for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, released a report earlier this week warning that
computer systems at the Defense Department, law enforcement and
private industries are at risk because of poor management and lax
oversight.

<HEADLINE> Third Beirut International Film Festival Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The third Beirut international
film festival opened here on Thursday with the participation of 30
feature films from around the world.
</P>
<P>
This is the third such event since 1997. The 30 feature films
will be shown during the festival, which will last through October
14.
</P>
<P>
The films to be shown include the Emperor And The Assassin
directed by Chinese cinema heavyweight Chen Kaige, The Wind Will
Carry Us by Iranian Abbas Kiarostami which was voted best film at
this year's Venice festival, and West Beyrouth by Lebanese
director Ziad Doueiri which is currently drawing crowds in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Culture Minister Mohammed Youssef Beydoun has said
the festival aimed at promoting the weak local film industry and
gaining national financial support for the cinema.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, competitions in the categories of
short film, documentary and final-year projects by students, will
also be held for Lebanese directors during the festival, and
juries will be made up of local and international artists.
</P>
<P>
The festival will also host workshops to provide maximum
interaction among regional and international directors, actors and
producers with their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 15,000 people, three times the number in 1997,
visited the festival with movie fans having to line up to watch
screened films.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses Senate to OK Nuke Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday urged again the Senate to pass a global nuclear test-ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before leaving for New York for a fund-raising event,
Clinton said the treaty is "tools to strengthen our security" and
"to throw away these tools will ensure more testing and more
development of more sophisticated and more dangerous nuclear
weapons."
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral responsibility for future generations. Future
generations won't forgive us if we fail that responsibility,"
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats in Congress are seeking a
postponement of the vote scheduled for Tuesday on the treaty. Both
parties believe the treaty will almost certainly be defeated in
the vote.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats have 45 seats in the Senate and it still needs 22
more votes even if all of them voted for the treaty. But few of
the Republicans backed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Senate to give more time to consider the
subject. "We ought to have a regular, orderly, substantive process
that gives all the people the necessary time to consider this on
the merit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is bigger than personal politics. This is about America's
future and the future of our children and the world. We have a
chance to reduce the likelihood that more countries will obtain
nuclear weapons," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has been signed by 154 countries and ratified by
only 26 of them. It takes effect only after the ratification of
all the 44 member countries of the Geneva-based Conference on
Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the U.S. Senate will be the first failure of an
arms control treaty to be approved in the United States. It will
also be an embarrassment for the U.S. government that has pressed
others to stop testing nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Rejects Patient Protection Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Thursday
rejected a patient protection bill backed by the Republican Party
by a vote of 238-193.
</P>
<P>
The rejection has set the stage for a showdown vote on a White
House-endorsed plan giving Americans broad new rights to file
lawsuits against their health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders had worked hard in recent days to rally
support for their version, which offered patients a limited right
to file lawsuits, but only in federal court and with limits on how
much money plaintiffs could collect.
</P>
<P>
The rejection cleared the way for a vote on the White
House-backed bill, sponsored by Representatives John Dingell and
Charlie Norwood.
</P>
<P>
Even if this bill passes, it must be reconciled with a
considerably more limited version already approved by the Senate.
The Senate bill has no new rights to sue and excludes many
Americans from other patient protections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the House rejected, 284-145, the most modest
of four competing patient-protection bills.
</P>
<P>
The bill rejected earlier, backed by Republican Representative
John Boehner, would have given patients new rights to file
lawsuits. It was the first choice of conservative Republicans and
their allies in the business and insurance industries.
</P>
<P>
Federal law now effectively bans such lawsuits for millions of
Americans, even if they are injured or die because of the decision
of a Health Managed Organization (HMO).
</P>
<P>
Managed care has dominated the health debate on Capitol Hill all
year, as Congress responds to voters' frustration over cost cutting
and fears they may be denied needed care.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hoping to keep Democrats united, President Bill
Clinton Thursday sent a letter to Capitol Hill restating his
strong support for a broad bill that would give patients a host of
new rights, including broad new rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
"I endorse this legislation without reservation," Clinton said
in a letter to House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Launches Navigation Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force Thursday
launched a 42 million U.S. dollars navigation satellite aboard a
Delta rocket in Cape Canaveral of Florida State in southeast
United States.
</P>
<P>
The 12-story Boeing-built rocket lifted off at 8:51 a.m. local
time after two weeks of delays caused by Hurricane Floyd and
persistent bad weather at the Florida launch site.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's successful launch brought the number of operational
Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites in orbit to 28.
</P>
<P>
The rocket should have lifted off earlier this year with
another GPS satellite. But that satellite was damaged on the
launch pad in May when rain leaked onto it.
</P>
<P>
This was the Air Force's first launch from Cape Canaveral since
a Titan rocket dumped a military communication satellite into the
wrong orbit back in April.
</P>
<P>
The GPS satellite, built by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space,
will join the U.S. military's orbiting constellation of navigation
satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Global Positioning System, originally designed for the
military to pinpoint locations, is booming in the commercial
market, too. Many luxury cars have GPS devices to help drivers
find a route, and they are also used by aviators, boaters and even
hikers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Borrowing Increases in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve said
Thursday that consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage
debt, rose at a 9.6 percent annual rate in August to a seasonally
adjusted 1.367 trillion dollars, the largest monthly increase in
seven months.
</P>
<P>
Consumers borrowed 10.8 billion dollars more in August than
during the month before, the Fed said. It was the biggest monthly
increase since January when it rose by 15.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase for August was the highest since May when
consumer borrowing rose at 9.7 percent rate, and follows a 7.9
percent rate gain in July.
</P>
<P>
Demand for non-revolving loans led the overall increase. Those
loans jumped at a 10.1 percent rate in August. That category
includes loans for autos, mobile homes, boats, trailers, education
and vacations. In July, non-revolving credit advanced at an annual
rate of 4.7 percent, a tad less than the Fed previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
Also in August, revolving credit, primarily credit cards
revolving loans, grew at an annual rate of 8.9 percent, the
fastest pace since May when revolving credit increased by 4.4
percent. In July, revolving credit rose at a rate of 12.1 percent,
the same as the Fed originally estimated.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Thursday accused the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of suspending 7 billion U.S. dollars
worth of contracts Iraq has signed with foreign companies under
the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said in a statement
that Iraq has received 5.15 billion dollars worth of contracted
items under previous phases of the oil-for-food deal, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saleh stressed that the U.N. has extracted some 5 billion
dollars from Iraq's oil proceeds to fund its activities and
programs in Iraq, which is almost equal to the funds used for the
humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to export limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the contracted items according to the
allocated funds for different sectors will arrive in Iraq in low
percentages because of the aggressive attitude adopted by the
U.S. and British representatives at the Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that in the new distribution plan, Iraqi government
decides to give priority to contracts on purchasing construction
materials to build houses for Iraqi citizens, adding that housing
must be given priority after food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. and British representatives at the
Sanctions Committee had put on hold 750 million dollars worth of
contracts for purchasing sewage equipment, adding that the lack of
sewage equipment has led to the rise of mortalities among Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Saleh called upon the international community to condemn the
aggressive position of the U.S. and Britain which aims at
prolonging the sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The violations of
international humanitarian law cannot be stopped by action
contradicting the United Nations Charter, Russia said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the General Assembly meeting reviewing "Report of
the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization," Russia's
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Sergey Lavrov said
lawlessness can be suppressed only by lawful methods, and it is
only in this way that the civilized countries resolve their
domestic problems at national level.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Charter provides for basic criteria and
mechanisms of responding to threats to peace and security, and
these mechanisms are also fully applicable to man-made
humanitarian catastrophes, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
As the last resort, the international community may employ
coercive measures, including use of military force, but this can
be done only in strict conformity with the United Nations Charter
and following a decision by the Security Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We fully share the conclusion by the Secretary-General that
the enforcement actions without Security Council authorization and
in contempt of its Charter-stipulated prerogatives tend to result
in undermining the entire current international security system,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The experience of Kosovo already starts teaching us lessons
and the international community should well digest in order not to
repeat the errors which may become incorrigible in future," Lavrov
added.

<HEADLINE> 36 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 36 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in recent
military operations in southeastern Turkey, an official statement
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the office of the Emergency Rule
Region, said Turkish security forces had wiped out 28 PKK
militants in armed clashes at Kocyatagi Tepe region in Tatvan town
of Bitlis province.
</P>
<P>
In the clashes, one soldier of the Turkish security forces was
also killed, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the statement added that the security
forces had killed four PKK militants, in Besiri town of Batman
province, two at Gokcek village in Tunceli province and two in
Gevas town of Van province.
</P>
<P>
It said that the security forces captured two PKK rebels in Van
province bordering neighboring Iran.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes U.S. Charge Over Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday categorically
rejected an accusation made by the U.S. State Department over its
religious freedom situation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi called the
accusation "vain and baseless," saying followers of divine
religions in Iran enjoy full freedom in performing their religious
rituals and ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin on Wednesday
leveled charges against Iran and some other countries over what he
called "violations of religious freedom," and threatened
diplomatic and economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the U.S. accusation, Asefi said that Iran's
religious followers are also active in the country's social
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran guarantees freedom of all official religions under the
instructions of Islam and the country's institution, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. accusation was made as a result of the double
standard and biased policies Washington has been practicing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. society itself is continuously suffering from
injustice, the spokesman pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Russia: U.N.'s Central Role in Peacekeeping Irreplaceable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
central role in peacekeeping is irreplaceable, Russia stressed
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the General Assembly meeting reviewing the "Report
of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization,"
Russia's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Sergey Lavrov said
peacekeeping operations, which become more and more
multi-component by nature, are a time-tested and effective tool
for creating favorable conditions for the political settlement of
crises and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Bringing the settlement of the Kosovo crisis back into the
legal United Nations framework, under the control of the Security
Council, and planned deployment and expansion of a number of
peacekeeping operations in Africa demonstrate clearly that the
central role of the United Nations in peacekeeping is
irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
Successful completion of the current work on improving the
United Nations peacekeeping potential, first of all from the point
of view of higher quality of operation and prompt deployment of
peacekeeping operations, is the pledge of preservation of such a
role, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
Strict Security Council political control over peacekeeping
operations, first of all with regard to the indispensability of
the Council's decisions concerning any operations with elements of
enforcement, remains to be a formative principle of and criterion
for the international peacekeeping, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no alternative to a further development of cooperation
between the United Nations and regional organizations in the
sphere of peacekeeping in accordance with relevant articles of the
U.N. Charter, and such an interaction covering the whole spectrum
of the peacekeeping activity should be based upon a reasonable
division of labor, but in no case should it lead to a dilution of
the central role of the United Nations in this most important
sphere, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Slave Labor Victims Not Satisfied With German Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The German government and
industries have offered 3.3 billion U.S. dollars to compensate for
World War II atrocities, attorneys for the labor slave victims
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the attorneys said they were not satisfied with the
compensation and requested more. The offer is far less than the
20 billion U.S. dollars the Holocaust survivors are seeking.
</P>
<P>
"I told the German delegation they have done more harm to the
German government and German people than they can ever imagine,"
said Mel Weiss, an attorney for survivors in class-action suits in
U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to reporters in front of the State
Department after hearing the proposal made to a meeting of
international negotiators by the chief German envoy to the talks,
Otto Lambsdorff.
</P>
<P>
"These companies are the real-life, modern-day scrooges of the
next millennium.... This is disgusting and there is enormous
disappointment on our side of the table," Weiss told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The compensation from German companies and the government would
be shared between about 250,000 slave laborers, half of them
Jewish, and at least 480,000 "forced" laborers, most of them from
Eastern Europe.

HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Thursday warned
villagers who are occupying commercial farms to force the
government for resettlement that they might risk facing the wrath
of the law.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 Nyamandlovu villagers invaded the Imvana farm in
western Zimbabwe at the weekend to protest the government's
failure to honor its pledge to resettle them by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Land Acquisition Committee Chairman Joseph Msika
called the action as illegal and said "we as the government will
not tolerate such lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government announced to compulsorily acquire
more than five million hectares of land from white farmers for the
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
At least 62,000 families have been resettled since independence
in 1980 but another 100,000 still wait for the land which the
government has been promising for the 19 years.

<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Conservative leader William Hague
Thursday pledged to defend Britain's national independence in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the opposition party's annual conference in
Blackpool, Hague highlighted pledges in his "Commonsense
Revolution."
</P>
<P>
"When the government of Britain is the most two-faced,
interfering, over-regulating, bossy, intolerant, arrogant and
crony-run in our history, there is no doubt Britain needs a Common
Sense Revolution," Reuters quoted Hague as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hague accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of trying to abolish
the UK currency and wipe out Britain's national independence but
stopped short of any pledge to withdraw from the European Union,
as party hardliners have been seeking.
</P>
<P>
Instead he threatened to block any further political
integration in Europe unless the European Union member states had
the right to opt out.

<HEADLINE> UK Firms Ordered to Upgrade Safety Systems After Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government vowed
Thursday to make private rail firms pay to upgrade safety systems
after the country's worst train crash in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Police said that there were 127 people still missing or dead
after this week's train crash near London's Paddington station.
</P>
<P>
Thirty of that total have been confirmed as dead and the death
toll has so far been put at around 70.
</P>
<P>
The rest of those missing are either dead or people who have
not yet informed police that they survived Tuesday's collision
between two trains, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who is also transport
minister, placed the burden of funding safety upgrades on private
industry, saying rail companies would have to come up with the 1
billion pounds (1.65 billion U.S. dollars) it is estimated an
automatic train protection system (ATP) would cost.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that a key danger signal at the fatal
intersection was difficult for drivers to see and allegations that
safety recommendations were ignored.
</P>
<P>
Railway companies said the smaller of the two trains involved
in Tuesday morning's rush-hour crash may have gone through a red
light seconds before hitting a high-speed train.
</P>
<P>
Experts also said drivers had ignored red lights eight times in
the past six years at that intersection. Tuesday's crash was the
second in two years on the same stretch of line.
</P>
<P>
Angry rail workers have threatened to strike unless rail
companies agree within a week to discuss plans for the
introduction of more advanced safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government has ordered an independent review of
safety and a public inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were continuing their search through the mangled
wreckage. Police said 28 intact bodies had been removed and two
more were visible.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's crash was Britain's worst train disaster since 1957
when 90 people were killed in a two-train collision in Lewisham,
southeast London.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The fighter planes of
Britain and the United States patrolling the so-called no-fly
zones is an aggression on Iraq's sovereignty, Iraq said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations Saeed Hasan said the
aggression should be immediately stopped.
</P>
<P>
Hasan was responding to a report in The New York Times which
said that U.S. fighter planes patrolling northern Iraq have begun
filling bombs with concrete instead of explosives to minimize
civilian casualties when they target military installations sites
near populated areas.
</P>
<P>
The Times said the concrete bombs were useful in hitting
military targets that Iraq has located in residential
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies set up the no-fly zones to
protect Iraqi Kurds in the north and Shiite Moslems in the south
after the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq has never accepted the zones.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatly urged the United Nations to intervene with
the United States, Britain and the countries that provide the
facilities for these acts of aggression, with a view to bringing
a halt to the actions.

SHENZHEN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Lucent Technologies unveiled
what it describes as the largest wideband network research and

</P>
<P>
 The center is in Shenzhen's New and High Technology

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Attacked for Non-Payment of U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The international
community was once again outraged by the repeated U.S. move for
late or non-payment of the United Nations, demanding the world's
richest country honor legal obligations under the U.N. Charter,
and pay its U.N. back dues in full, on time and without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the speakers, who took the floor Tuesday at the
General Assembly to consider the U.N. financial situation, lashed
out at the U.S. policy on its back dues, saying that the primary
cause of the chronic financial difficulties is the U.S. failure to
pay what it owed in full and on time, which has exercised negative
impact on the very existence of the world body.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, U.N. under-secretary-general for management,
told the Fifth Committee, which is in charge of administrative and
budgetary affairs, that "at September 30, 1999, unpaid assessments
totaled 2510 million U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
With a U.S. debt of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, "the United
Nations is running on empty with many miles left to travel," he
said, adding that this has affected the U.N. peace operations in
Kosovo, the Serbian province, East Timor, Sierra Leone and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. dues are composed of regular budget, peacekeeping and
Tribunal assessments.
</P>
<P>
"At September 30, 1999, the United States owed 81 percent of
the regular budget aggregate," he said, adding that the most
advanced industrial country also owed 60 percent of the total
unpaid peacekeeping assessments.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, the United Nations had a cash deficit of 40
million U.S. dollars for the regular budget, he said. "A negative
regular budget cash balance of 60 million U.S. dollars was likely
at October 31 and that would increase to 162 million U.S. dollars
for November."
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of unpaid assessments effectively eliminated the
financial base of the Organization," he said. "Financial
flexibility had been lost, which endangered the Organization's
very existence, as the Organization did not have predictable,
assured financial support of its Members."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has held up payment of 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars for two years, demanding that the United Nations
streamline its organization and institute a zero-growth budget.
Legislation that would have paid off the bulk of the bills was
vetoed last year by President Bill Clinton because it contained
unrelated restrictions on U.S. spending for overseas family
planning organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly three years later, it was fair to say that good and
determined progress had been made," he said. "Coordination among
the far-flung entities had improved, and cabinet-style management
was now the norm," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said of the
U.N. reform. "Budget and staff had been subjected to new and
rigorous discipline."

He predicted that, because most countries will continue to
loosen controls, airlines will tend to provide more non-stop
regional and trans-continental flights, and, as a result, more
long-distance planes will be needed.

China had 331 Boeing planes by September 1, accounting for 67

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China will need 1,600 new
commercial aircraft over the next two decades, worth 120 billion U.
S. dollars, a Boeing executive said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country's aviation market is expected to have annual
growth of 9.3 percent and in 20 years to be the world's second
biggest market after the United States, Randolph S. Baseler,
Boeing's vice-president for marketing told the 8th China
International Aviation Exposition here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of commercial airplanes in the world
will double to 28,425 by 2018 and that 20,150 planes will be
delivered over the next 20 years, with regional jets accounting
for 20 percent, single-aisle jets for 53 percent, intermediate
twin-aisle jets for 22 percent, and Boeing 747s and larger jets
for a mere 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that growth in the aviation market is different
in different parts of the world. In North America, for example,
the biggest and most mature market in the world, growth is less
than 3 percent. The Asian-Pacific region, which has suffered from
the economic crisis over the past two years, will maintain yearly
a growth rate of 6.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1997, the United Nations, under the leadership of Annan who
is the first Black African to head the world body, embarked on a
major program of reorganization and revitalization aimed at
transforming the Organization -- its leadership, its structure and
its performance.
</P>
<P>
On the current financial crisis, Annan said, "Over the long
term, the only solution was that all Member States must honor
their legal and moral obligations under the Charter and pay their
dues in full, on time and without conditions."
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, said at the meeting that "a strong and stable
financial basis was the basic condition for the United Nations to
fulfill its mandates and complete its task."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had been stuck in a quagmire of severe
financial problems, Shen said, stressing, "The major cause was
non-payment of assessed contributors."
</P>
<P>
"Shunning legal obligations was not acceptable," he said. "Nor
was the imposition of pressures on the United Nations and its
Member States by not paying assessed contributions."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries, the
representative of Guyana, Samuel Insanally, said, "The primary
cause of the financial problems continued to be the failure of
certain Member States, in particular the United States, to pay
what they owed.
</P>
<P>
"Payments were a legal obligation," he said.
</P>
<P>
His statement was echoed by Felipe Mabilangan, representative
of the Philippines, who delivered his speech on behalf the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN was concerned that the financial crisis within the
United Nations was undermining its ability to implement fully,
efficiently and effectively the programs and activities mandated
by Member States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Inam Ul Haque, representative of Pakistan, said "it
was disturbing that the situation had not improved despite major
reform undertaken at the 52nd Assembly session" and
"cross-borrowing of peacekeeping funds for temporary relief of
financial problems was no longer feasible."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations' role in maintaining peace and security
is in jeopardy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy on arrears even invited harsh words from U.S.
allies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the European Union, and 13 associate
countries, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and
Iceland, Anna-Maija Korpi, representative of Finland, said, "As a
permanent member of the Security Council, the United States had a
special responsibility toward the Organization."
</P>
<P>
"It was also the sole beneficiary of the 25 percent ceiling on
contributions," she said. "The principle of capacity to pay must
be the cornerstone of the scale of assessments."
</P>
<P>
The remaining days in this year are very critical to the United
States. Under Article 19 of the U.N. Charter, if it fails to pay
at least 350 million U.S. dollars by the end of this year, it will
sure lose its vote at the General Assembly next year.

<HEADLINE> Around 3,700 International Troops Deployed in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of the
U.N.-authorized multinational force in East Timor has reached
around 3,700, according to the force's first 14-day periodic
report released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the force, known as the International Force,
East Timor (INTERFET) began on September 20 following the
endorsement on September 15 by the U.N. Security Council of its
establishment to restore peace and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The countries which have committed forces or liaison teams to
the INTERFET are Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, the Republic of
Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Contingents of some other countries are conducting training
while Ireland and Kenya and others have indicated their intention
to contribute forces to the INTERFET in due course, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET's commander is Major General Peter Cosgrove of the
Australian Defense Force and its deputy commander is Major General
Songkitti Jaggabattara of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The report said the force has developed a four-phase concept of
operations, namely the establishment of the preconditions for
deployment, its insertion into East Timor, the implementation of
its mandate to restore peace and security and its transfer to a
U.N. peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
The first two phases have completed and the force is in the
process of preparing for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is planning for the
establishment of a two-to-three-year U.N. transitional
administration in East Timor for its transition to independence,
has envisioned a 9,100 man U.N. peacekeeping operation to replace
the INTERFET projected to total 8,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The report, sent by the Australian permanent representative to
Annan on September 29 and distributed later to Security Council
members who meet Thursday on East Timor, said that apart from
security improvements in Dili, East Timor's capital, the general
security situation in the territory "remains poor."
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET has expressed satisfaction with the cooperation of
the Indonesian armed forces in facilitating its orderly
deployment, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Two Rwandan Ministers Resign on Corruption Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Two cabinet ministers of the
Rwandan government were forced to resign following a vote of
no-confidence in parliament Wednesday night for their involvement
in a corruption scandal, Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Charles Ntakirutinka, Minister of Social Affairs but formerly
Minister of Public Works, and Anastase Gasana, Minister in the
President's Office but formerly Foreign Minister, were found
guilty by an ad hoc parliamentary probe commission of having
involved in a business scandal which made the government lose
about one million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another minister, Mark Rugenera of Commerce, who was then
Minister of Finance, was also found to be a key player in the
scandal but he narrowly survived being censured with only one vote
margin.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers were implicated in the dirty business
involving the government on one side and two businessmen of a
local procurement firm on the other.
</P>
<P>
The affair, which dates back to 1996, is related to the supply
of vehicles and motorcycles to the Internal Security Organization
in the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was first signed by a businessman named Jean de
Dieu Nsengiyumva, but later the tender was paid to his colleague
Augustin Uzabumwana after the former was illegally arrested by the
Criminal Investigation Department and detained for six months.
</P>
<P>
Nsengiyumva sued the government in the Court of Appeals which
ruled in his favor and ordered the state to pay him 350 million
Frw (about one million dollars).
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary probe commission was set up to investigate the
case last he

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Gets Foreign Donations in Boosting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa received 17
million rand (2.83 million U.S. dollars) from foreign sources on
Thursday to beef up its criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
At separate events in Pretoria, the Swedish government
presented the SA Police Service with 15 million rand (2.5 million
dollars), while the office of the National Director of Public
Prosecutions received 2 million (330,000 dollars) from car
manufacturer Rolls Royce, the South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete said the Swedish
grant would focus on technical assistance to the police human
resource management division.
</P>
<P>
The three-year agreement would focus, among other things, on
career path planning, human rights training, affirmative action
programs, and job training.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will certainly go a long way to bolster South
African human resources development strategy in the judicial
system, Tshwete said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major contribution towards the realization of a
professional and highly competent police service," he said.
</P>
<P>
Swedish ambassador Bo Heineback said the agreement would also
benefit the Swedish police, which he said had a lot to learn from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the grant was aimed at contributing to the creation of
a stable environment in South Africa and an effective police
service.
</P>
<P>
The Rolls Royce contribution, according to Justice Minister
Penuell Maduna, would be paid into a fund to help the office of
the National Director of Public Prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
The money would mainly be used to strengthen the legal team and
to overcome the shortage of skilled staff in the criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
The fund, called the Merlin Trust, was set up by business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed great news, because the government on its own
cannot beat crime. We need the support and cooperation of all our
citizens," Maduna said.
</P>
<P>
It was envisaged that the money would enable the state to hire
top advocates to work with prosecutors in serious economic fraud
cases.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, criminals are able to hire top senior counsel
to get the best legal brains on their side," Maduna said.
</P>
<P>
"The trust will help us to match them and to beat them at their
own game, " he said.

exclusive exhibition in Tehran on November 14-19, the director of

</P>
<P>

Saudi products to third countries via Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to the Saudi official, 70 large Saudi firms are to
take part in the fair, in which various products such as
agricultural and industrial goods as well as foodstuffs are to be
on display.
</P>

since the election of Iranian moderate President Mohammad Khatami
in 1997. Several high-level exchange of visits have been
conducted.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FAO Urges Young Angolans to Consider How to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, October 7 (xinhua) -- United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) urged here on Thursday the young
Angolans to take the problem of famine into account and consider
what they can do for ending the hunger.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Vicente, an official with FAO, was quoted by the official
news agency Angop as saying that "the young people should learn
what the problem of famine is and what they can do for ending it."
</P>
<P>
The official of FAO, meanwhile, announced Angola as one of the
countries suffering most from famine, with its 10 million
population as part of the 800 million people in the world in dire
poverty, according to Angop.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Vicente made the statement on the eve of the World Food
Day, October 16, with "youth against hunger" as the theme,
considering the young Angolans as addressees of the message.
</P>
<P>
Angola, with the youth as the main part of its population, has
encountered a lot of social problems in relation to the young
population.
</P>
<P>
Vicente said that if the young people can get support and
necessary means of production, it will be easier to resolve the
problem on the security of the food and the agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Hunger is possibly a moral and political problem confronting
the youth," said the official, adding that "the youth should know
what they can do, as citizens of their community, for ending the
famine."

<HEADLINE> S.African Rand Moves off Earlier Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South African rand became
positive again thursday afternoon following a slight recovery in
the gold price.
</P>
<P>
A decision by the Bank of England and the European Union
Central Bank not to raise interest rates also played a stabilizing
role in the rand market.
</P>
<P>
The market was a bit nervous Thursday and most players ran long
dollar positions on Wednesday and early Thursday. But this
afternoon there were players moving out of those positions, market
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The rand was last at a firmer 6.0370 per dollar from a previous
close of 6.0490.
</P>
<P>
The slight recovery in the gold price also added impetus into
the rand market, which tested an intraday worst level of 6.0824
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gold price was last at 323 dollars an ounce after touching
315.50 dollars earlier Thursday. Bullion closed at 324.25 dollars
in new york on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Against sterling, the local currency managed to dip below the
technical 10.00 rand to sterling level, and was last at 9.9909
from a previous close of 10.0174.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they expect the rand to find resistance at 6.03 to
the dollar, but 6.07 is expected to offer support for the
currency.

Minister Costas Simitis and his visiting Maltese counterpart,
Edward F. Adami.
</P>

taken at the EU summit in Helsinki in December.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Adami thanked Greece for its support in Malta's
efforts to join the EU, saying that his country's desire to join
the EU would strengthen the Mediterranean dimension of the EU.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Rwandan Hutu
rebels were killed in a joint major swoop mounted by the Rwandan
Patriotic Army (RPA) and the rebels of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD), which started a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan News Agency reported on Thursday, that some 100 other
Hutu rebels were captured in the operations in the border between
Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
It is said that about 4,000 Hutu rebels had massed in bases
between Nyamuragira and Nyiragongo volcanoes and were preparing a
decisive simultaneous attack against RCD which in based in Goma of
DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan army officials as well as RCD commanders claim that
they had captured parachutes in the rebel bases which leads to
believe that the Hutu rebels were getting air-drops of equipment
from the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, the RCD rebels on Wednesday killed seven
Rwandan Hutu militiamen, and captured two others and a lot of Mai
Mai tribal warriors in the Ruzizi planes, about 150 km south of

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Preservation of Cultural Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Education,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has underscored the
importance of supporting and promoting cultural heritage of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
The preservation of cultural heritage was important as it
reflected on past human existence to the coming generations,
UNESCO regional cultural representative Lupwishi Mbuyamba told
delegates attending a constituency assembly of the International
Council of African Museums in Lusaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day constituency assembly has the theme of building
together with the community: A Challenge for African Museums
organized by the International Council of Museums.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the over 80 participants from 40 countries, mostly
the African countries, the UNESCO official expressed his hope that
the African continent which had been afflicted by wars and
conflicts would be convinced that by destroying its heritage, it
was destroying its memory, identity and its real existence.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Threats World Culture, Says Hillary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Hillary Clinton said in Italian
central city of Florence Thursday that globalization is a threat
to culture and launched proposals for safeguarding the cultural
identities of peoples.
</P>
<P>
At the close of a conference entitled "Culture Counts:
Financing, Resources and Economy of Culture in Sustainable
Development", the wife of U.S. President Bill Clinton said
globalization itself "is neither good nor bad" and noted that the
internet and satellite communications have made the world smaller,
provided a higher level of awareness and given people an ability
to live better lives.
</P>
<P>
But, she continued, "globalization can threaten traditions and
culture and create consumers rather than citizens," at the final
session of the conference opened in famous Palazzo Vecchio of
Florence Monday by Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and
World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
After referring to globalization as a "thin coat of paint on
human identity which can create many problems," Mrs. Clinton noted
how "our young people are so alike, eating the same hamburgers,
wearing the same T-shirts, and their fantasies are inspired by the
same television characters."
</P>
<P>
Much money is spent on products thought to be cultural in a
"disposable world in which the culture of globalization gets into
competition with the treasures of the world," she argued.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of her many travels since she and her husband moved
into the White House more than six years ago, the U.S. First Lady
said she has witnessed a desire to rebel against globalization, a
desire of people seeking to confirm their own identity against
mass culture.
</P>
<P>
On the side of remedies, Mrs. Clinton spoke of the Bank of
Culture installed in Mali by volunteers of a non-governmental
organization for providing loans to people who bring in objects of
cultural significance rather than selling them to tourists.
</P>
<P>
Another instrument in practice in Palermo, Naples and some
parts of the United States is "making young people responsible for
safeguarding their own culture" by adopting historic sites or
monuments.
</P>
<P>
"These children know all about the monument they have adopted;
it gives them pride, also a sense of cultural belonging to firm up
a spirit of identity which will last into adulthood," she said.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation in general, Mrs. Clinton insisted that these
projects "must always respect the traditions of the people
involved."
</P>
<P>
"It's useless, and has been shown to be a failure, giving
developing people aid they are not expecting, giving them machines
they have not asked for and building roads where no need is felt
for them," she concluded.

<HEADLINE> Dehaene Becomes Business Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Belgian prime minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene has agreed as chairman of the board of director
of S.AI.L. Trust, the corporate's CEO Paul Behest said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The S.AI.L Trust is the new name of Flanders Language Valley
Foundation. Behets said the former prime minister represents
significant added value for Flanders Language Valley and his
international links will help to ensure that the high-tech concept
Valley reaps success beyond Belgium. "In addition, Jean-Luc
Dehaene will help to determine and optimize strategy policy
options," he added.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the company's news release, the former prime minister
sees his new position as a true challenge. "It is a wonderful
challenge to be involved in an ambitious project that can achieve
success well beyond national borders. I am convinced that
high-tech speech and language applications are the sector of the
future in the information society," Dehaene said.
</P>
<P>
S.AI.L. Trust supports companies located on the campus and
active in the field of speech and language technology and
artificial intelligence. The Flanders Language Valley concept,
which has the investment of 100 million U.S. dollars, consists of
two separate pillars: it coordinates all non-profit-making
activities on one hand, and focus on companies developing speech,
artificial intelligence and language technology applications on
the other hand.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene and his cabinet resigned in June this year after losing

KAMPALA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged foreign investors to invest in Uganda and
assured the potential investors of strong government support.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call in capital Kampala Thursday when
officially opening the 7th Uganda International Trade Fair
organized by Uganda Manufacturers' Association.
</P>
<P>
Supporting foreign factories here is supporting Uganda's
national economy, Museveni noted.
</P>
<P>
At the function attended by hundreds of diplomats, local and
foreign manufacturers, the 55-year-old president thanked those
investors, saying that without their help, Uganda's economy would
not have been in its present form.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's economy is developing very fast in Africa, with its
growth registering seven percent in the past fiscal year. Foreign
investment has played a big role in the economic recovery and
development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said he was "happy to see new products
on display manufactured by Ugandan manufacturers here including
coffee, milk products, leather, cosmetics and food-processing
equipment."
</P>
<P>
Sources at the trade fair said that a total of more than 450
exhibitors including those foreign manufacturers from 25 countries
have displayed their goods at the fair.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Postpones PKK Leader's Appeal Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish appeals court has
decided to adjourn for two weeks a hearing of the appeal of the
death sentence for outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The 9th Criminal Chamber of the High Court Appeals approved the
defense lawyers' motion to postpone the appeal at Thursday's
hearing, which will continue on October 21.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's lawyer Ercan Kanar said that "we had requested more
time because we needed time to prepare a careful, detailed
defense."
</P>
<P>
Tavil's decision to hold up the hearing drew angry shouts from
relatives of the Turkish soldiers slain in the 15-year-old fight
against the PKK led by Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war
for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The
conflicts have claimed 37,000 lives so far.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was captured in mid-February, was sentenced to
death on June 29 for treason and separatism by the Ankara State
Security Court on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
If the appeals court upholds the death sentence, the verdict
will go to the parliament for debate and then to President
Suleyman Demirel for final approval.
</P>
<P>
If the verdict is overturned, the Supreme Court will call for a
retrial by the Ankara State Security Court.
</P>
<P>
There is strong opposition to the death penalty in Europe and
European leaders are expected to pressure Turkey not to hang
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 people have been sentenced to death over the past
15 years, but the parliament has not approved any of the
sentences.

QUITO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Guagua Pichincha volcano, west

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Manufacturing Sector Develops Fast: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing sector is
becoming one of the main pillars of Uganda's national economy and
it has recorded a very high increase in the past fiscal year, an
industrial official said.
</P>
<P>
"The manufacturing sector has grown by 11 percent in the past
fiscal year," James Mulwana, Chairman of the Uganda Manufacturers'
Association, said at the opening ceremony of the 7th International
Trade Fair in capital Kampala Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the manufacturing sector is only second to that
of agriculture which records an increase rate of 14 percent,
Mulwana said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the high growth in manufacturing to the increased
private investment.
</P>
<P>
"The private investment expanded in real terms by 13 percent in
the same period, ensuring a big increase in the current fiscal
year," he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to make sustainable development possible, the official
said that his association has tried to promote human resources
development and develop vocational training programs.
</P>
<P>
With the continued improvement of the investment environment
and government policies, the manufacturing sector would contribute
more to the further development of the country's recovering
economy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Angered by Polish Politicians' Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday expressed
concern over what it described as unfounded attacks made by Polish
officials in accusing Moscow of "unpredictability and nostalgia
for the imperial past".
</P>
<P>
Russia is surprised by public statements made by "certain
Polish politicians, including the foreign minister, and their
unfounded attacks on Russia," Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
These statements are combined with rhetoric about "plans to
broaden good-neighborly relations with our country," the Interfax
news agency quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
All of these statements are being made at a time when the
"Russian state is waging a resolute struggle against international
terrorist gangs in the North Caucasus," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia would like to hear words of clear and unambiguous
support for the Russian state bodies' legitimate actions from
Warsaw," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has "to state with regret that Poland is giving refuge
to representatives of the Republic of Ichkeria (Chechnya), to the
so-called Poland-Chechnya committees and similar organizations
that are given an opportunity to remind the international and
Polish public of themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow finds it necessary to highlight these circumstances, he
said, noting that "these circumstances can only be qualified as
unfriendly."
</P>
<P>
"External connivance at the anti-constitutional forces in the
North Caucasus may entail the most serious consequences for
relations with the countries where these forces are finding
refuge," Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Sign Antitrust Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
on Thursday signed an agreement to increase their cooperation in
investigating corporate mergers and price-fixing that affect both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno and U.S. Federal Trade Commission
Chairman Robert Pitofsky signed the agreement on behalf of the
United States, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Pitofsky said the agreement "emerges out of an astonishing
increase in global trade and global competition. Almost 50 percent
of the mergers we investigate thoroughly affect consumers in two
or more countries, sometimes consumers in 10 or 12 countries."
</P>
<P>
Japan enacted its anti-monopoly law in 1947 and is now
participating in the 21st annual antitrust consultation with U.S.
counterparts. But Hideaki Kobayashi, charge d'affairs ad interim
of Japan, said officials "felt an increasing need for an agreement
on anti-competitive policies so we can cooperate further."
</P>
<P>
"Certain differences do exist in the legal framework of our
countries, which rendered our joint work a challenge," said
Kobayashi, who signed for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Modeled on pacts the United States reached in 1991 with the
European Union and in 1995 with Canada, the agreement provides
that each country will notify the other of enforcement actions
that might affect it, that they will consider coordinating
enforcement actions and that each will consider acting against
domestic behavior that harms the other country.
</P>
<P>
While it calls for the exchange of information, the pact does
not permit the sharing of nonpublic information or evidence
gathered in a law enforcement investigation.
</P>
<P>
The United States also has antitrust cooperation agreements
with Australia, Germany and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil's Fall Gathers Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil's fall from recent
highs picked up pace on Thursday, as international benchmark Brent
for November delivery ended 68 cents lower at 22.08 U.S.dollars a
barrel, extending to more than two dollars a sharp slide from
33-month highs struck just last week.
</P>
<P>
Falls have accelerated since a survey found that export cartel
OPEC's adherence to export limits slackened again in September as
high prices drew extra supplies from core Gulf producers, a
Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
The export group raised wellhead output in September by 180,000
barrels a day to 26.68 million bpd from a revised 26.50 million in
August, according to the survey of OPEC and industry officials and
consultants.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that compliance by the 10 OPEC members
participating in supply restrictions fell to 81 percent in
September from 84 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices had more than doubled to the 33-month peak of
24.30 U.S.dollars a barrel thanks to good compliance by OPEC and
some non-OPEC producers with output limits imposed to rescue the
market from historic lows touched earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
The curbs are aimed at shrinking a big global surplus of stored
oil that drove 1998 prices to levels which sliced billions of
dollars off the incomes of oil-dependent OPEC states.
</P>
<P>
OPEC last month agreed to keep the curbs in place until March
2000 at least at it seeks to bolster market faith in its
collective supply discipline.
</P>
<P>
But muddling data this week on pre-winter changes to petroleum
stockpiles in the United States, key indicators for the
international oil market, has little to stem the recent price
losses, a Reuters analysis said.
</P>
<P>
A weekly report from the U.S.Department of Energy report said
crude stocks had fallen by 400,000 barrels in the latest week.
Gasoline stocks rose 1.2 million barrels, while distillate
inventories fell one million barrels.
</P>
<P>
But figures from the American Petroleum Institute (API), an
industry group, showed a surprise weekly increase in U.S. crude
stocks of around one million barrels in the latest week.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Remove Immunity for Former Coup Leaders </HEADLINE>

<P>
ANKARA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said Thursday that his coalition government will try to
lift immunity for former coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who is also chairman of the Democratic Left Party, made
the remarks when addressing his followers at the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said he and leaders of the Nationalist Movement Party
and the Motherland Party have agreed to amend provisional Article
15 of the military-scissored 1982 Constitution that envisages
across-the-board judicial immunity for former coup leaders for
their decisions and practices in the 1980-1983 military
administration of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that they agreed that the time has come "to get rid of"
provisional Article 15 of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that a consensus had been established in society
that the provisional immunity to the former coup leaders should be
removed.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the past 16 years that there has been
a substantive move for annulment of the controversial article
since there were concerns that such a move could upset the
military.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that he and his partners have also agreed to amend
Articles 83 and 100 of the constitution that provides for judicial
immunity to parliamentarians and the executives.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday appealed the
international community for practical steps to reinforce the
treaty on disarmament and for elimination of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for
Legal and International Affairs Javad Zarif in Vienna, according
to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
As long as nuclear arsenal exists in the world, the
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) will not succeed, said the minister
who was attending a three-day conference on Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which opened in Vienna on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT is a prerequisite for the NPT and the international
community should take actions in safeguarding the peaceful use of
nuclear technology, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The NPT should be used to reinforce disarmament and the
peaceful use of nuclear technology as well, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has long been accused by the U.S. of trying to gain
nuclear capability, a charge repeatedly denied by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it was pursuing peaceful use of nuclear energy in
different fields, which is an inalienable right of any country in
the world.

LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain must stay outside the
euro if it is to get the maximum benefit from the "global
revolution" in e-commerce, according to a report made public on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A report by a commission of Conservative economic experts,
appointed by party leader William Hague, has predicted dire
economic consequences if Britain signs up to the European single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Former defense minister Sir John Nott, who chaired the
Commission on the Pound, told the on-going Conservative conference
that economic and monetary union was the "greatest single issue of
our time."
</P>
<P>
Warning that if the party lost its fight to preserve the pound
"all is lost for our nation", he accused the government of being
stuck in a "post-war timewarp" in its economic thinking.
</P>
<P>
Labor failed to appreciate how the euro would hold Britain back
from making the most of its natural advantages in the new era of
Internet shopping, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet and the coming revolution in e-commerce are
making trading and currency blocks redundant," he said. "To
survive in this new global world Great Britain must remain
independent, flexible, liberalized and adaptable, all the things
that the present European Union is not."

LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will start
a child labor survey throughout the country next week with the
support from the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Finance and Economic Development, Godfrey
Simasiku, announced this Thursday when opening an enumerators
training workshop for data collection for the end of decade and
child labor survey in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Simasiku said that this survey should give a clear picture of
what is happening on the ground to formulate policies that can
reduce child exploitation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Zambian government is concerned with the
emergency and growth of child labor engaged in paid work in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the survey will enable the government to see
whether programs on the ground are addressing these negative
aspects and will therefore provide the bench mark information for
a critical analysis of child exploitation and vices that impede
the quality of life of a child.
</P>
<P>
The survey is being carried out in the nine provinces of Zambia
and the enumerators will cover 8,000 households selected from all
provinces and districts throughout the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Education Ministry, about 85
percent of Zambian children of school-going age are out of school
or do not attend any type of formal education.

"The staff of the bank have appraised and undertaken to provide
 consultancy support for the Nigeria Airways," Obasanjo said when
welcoming World Bank President James Wolfensohn who arrived in
Nigeria Thursday on his first visit to the most populous African
country on economic reforms and debt relief.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the engagement contract agreement will be signed

<P>
Economic reforms and strategy to relieve the country's huge
external debt burden of about 30 billion U.S. dollars are believed
to be the focus of the talks between the bank chief and Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Relations between oil-producing Nigeria of 108 million people
and bodies such as the World Bank, which soured under late
dictator General Sani Abacha, revived after Obasanjo took office
in May as elected president ending 15 years of corrupt military
rule. Obasanjo has sought the assistance of the World Bank in
reviewing the country's notoriously corrupt public procurement
system and economic restructuring toward liberalizing the power
and telecommunications sectors.

MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said Thursday that Moscow is willing to work with all forces
in Chechnya determined on a constructive dialogue and the
restoration of normal life.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will"be developing relations with the
(Chechen) parliament in exile and with other groups and
individuals who can exert a constructive influence on the
situation," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I would not want to create the impression that Moscow is
staking on anyone specific. We are staking on the Chechen people
being tired of the gangsters," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a separate matter how the people will form their
government bodies and build their future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has launched an offensive against rebels in the
breakaway republic and Putin announced earlier this week that
federal troops are now in control of one-third of Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for African Museum Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Thursday urged African
museums to provide a product that is African both in nature and
character and would meet the demands of their clientele.
</P>
<P>
Many African museums are still proto-types of European museums,
Zambian Tourism Minister Enosh Chipawa complained at the
constituent assembly of the International Council of African
Museums (AFRICOM).
</P>
<P>
"Too many of our museums are still foreign institutions,
displaying their culture for the benefit of the outsiders," said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that "our museum professionals have continued to
present our societies through the same eyes as those of the
settlers of more than 50 years ago."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that museums are about people, their
achievements, their aspirations, their innovations, their survival
and development.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the AFRICOM is a welcome move, he said, adding
that it should present both an opportunity and a challenge to
establish an institution which would endeavor to enhance the
development of African museums and museum organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa urged the upcoming board of directors of the museum
council to undertake a vigorous fund-raising campaign to ensure
not only the sustenance of the organization but also the
successful execution of the program of activities.
</P>
<P>
The AFRICOM's sphere of activity is centered around museum
development, protection of heritage, and access to culture
throughout the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Museum professionals from more than 40 countries, mainly
African ones, are attending the seven-day constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
The participants are assessing the various activities that the
AFRICOM has carried out since its creation in 1991 and examining
the present situation of African museums in order to study
innovative ways of strengthening museum impact on community
development.
</P>
<P>
They will adopt the statutes of the new organization, choose a
country for the headquarters and vote the activities program for
2000-2002.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Ex-President Nyerere's Health Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- There is a heartening
improvement of Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere's health,
according to physicians attending him at St. Thomas Hospital in
London.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere experienced no fever or chest complications Thursday, a
 statement issued by the Tanzanian State House quoted the
physicians as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the medical team said that the 77-year-old African
statesman will continue to use the respirator.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the jaundice problem is disappearing slowly
and his liver is functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, suffering from leukemia, was admitted to the hospital
13 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union with Zanzibar isles in 1964 to
form Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs.
</P>
<P>
He has tirelessly mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.

<HEADLINE> EU Not to Mediate Between Moscow, Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has not
offered to mediate between Russia and its breakaway republic of
Chechnya, Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen of Finland, which
currently chairs the EU, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EU does not feel that its mediation is required, the
Interfax news agency quoted Halonen as saying.
</P>
<P>
Holonen said she, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and EU
commissioner Christopher Patten, the so-called EU troika, voiced
concern over the situation in the North Caucasus during their
talks with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the EU regards Chechnya as an integral part
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, for his part, said Russian leaders are prepared to
negotiate with any group in Chechnya also prepared to do so.
</P>
<P>
No mediation is needed for such talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russia seeks a political solution in Chechnya, but
such a solution is obstructed by extremist groups there.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chechen issue must not be oversimplified or reduced
to one-dimensional formulations. "This problem has historical
roots and today's peculiarities."
</P>
<P>
Before a long-term solution can be found, the "terrorists who
obstruct political dialogue and the search for a political
settlement must be eliminated," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Halonen called on Moscow to look for opportunities for dialogue
with responsible leaders in the North Caucasus. The European Union
is prepared to provide humanitarian aid to the population of that
area, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU's aid to Russia does not signify support for
the military operation, Patten said, adding that aid is contingent
on certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
The European Union does not draw parallels between Kosovo and
Chechnya, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the situation in the North Caucasus, the EU troika and
Ivanov also discussed capital flight from Russia and the financial
scandal surrounding alleged Russian money laundering, Gama, the
Portuguese foreign and defense minister, said.
</P>
<P>
These problems were discussed with a view to creating
conditions in Russia for investments and a workable banking system
and, in the long run, to integrate it into the world economy, Gama
said.

<HEADLINE> Chile Trusts in Pinochet's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Juan
Gabried Valdez said Thursday that Britain would concede freedom
under humanitarian grounds to ex military chief Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
If the judge in London rules this Friday in favor of Pinochet's
extradition to Spain, British Interior Minister Jack Straw has the
faculty to invalidate the resolution under humanitarian grounds,
affirmed Valdes.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister said he has spoken out on three occasions
to his British counterpart Robin Cook, Chilean government's worry
of the ever greater deteriorating of the 83-year Pinochet's
health.
</P>
<P>
If British judge Ronald Bartle authorizes Pinochet's
extradition, the final decision will fall in hands of United
Kingdom's Interior Minister, Valdes said at the start of a special
session of the Senate regarding Pinochet's case.
</P>
<P>
If the outcome isn't favorable for any of the two parties,
Pinochet's defense will have 14 days to appeal while judge Juan
Baltasar Garzon will have to do so right away, explained the
Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
Under request of Spanish justice, Pinochet was captured last
October in London while he was recovering from an operation on his
spinal column.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Minister Submits Resignation on Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Social Affairs Minister
Charles Ntakirutinka offered his resignation from cabinet Thursday
following a vote of no-confidence by the parliament late Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Minister in the President's Office Patrick Mazimhaka confirmed
Friday that Ntakirutinka has written a letter of resignation to
President Pasteur Bizimungu, but he declined to make any further
comments, Rwandan News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The impeached minister said, "I have even met the President of
the Republic this morning. I bid him farewell."
</P>
<P>
Ntakirutinka, also President of the Social Democrate Party
(PSD), said that his party will convene an extraordinary meeting
within a week to discuss his problem.
</P>
<P>
Ntakirutinka, together with Anastase Gasana, formerly a
minister in charge of foreign relations, but currently the
minister in the President's Office in charge of Institutional
Relations, were asked to resign Wednesday by the parliament
because of their alleged involvement in business scandal which
made the government lose about 1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gasana refused to make any comment about whether he has
tendered his resignation or not. But well-informed sources close
to the parliament and his Republican Democratic Party (MDR) told
RNA that he may have decided to challenge the parliament's
decision as he claimed that the latter was unfair.

CHENGDU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, recently
visited Sichuan Province where he had a look at the workings of
justice.
</P>
<P>
In the company of provincial leaders, he visited Chengdu,
Leshan, and Mianyang from Oct. 5 to 8.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Chengdu, the provincial capital, on October 8,
Li solicited suggestions and comments on a draft of rules on
judicial supervision from the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, whose purpose is to ensure justice in trials and
procuratorial work.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting agreed that rules are important for
achieving the goal of rule by law, and made suggestions for
revision.
</P>
<P>
Li said at the meeting that, in addition to making efforts to
improve legislation, the People's Congress and its standing
committee should supervise the government, the courts, and the
procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Li visited several state-owned enterprises and
discussed the reforms and development of China's state-owned
sector with local leaders.
</P>
<P>
After visiting several state-owned enterprises, Li said that
the state-owned sector needs to be strengthened and that state-
owned enterprises should take the lead in major industries. Only
when the state-owned enterprises are operating soundly, he said,
can China have a strong base for socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, Li visited the Chinese Academy of Engineering
Physics, one of the major national defense research centers, where
he praised the scientists for having contributed much for the
nation's international status.

<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International Plc.
(THAI) has successfully passed its Y2K test, making it the first
Asian airline to cross the millennium bug threshold, THAI
announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 747-400 of THAI took a test flight Friday by altering

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Union Leader Says Unions Need To Do More For Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, the president of
All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), says that Chinese
trade unions need to help promote the restructuring of state-owned
enterprises and to safeguard the rights and interest of workers.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also member of the Standing Committee of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, told an ACFTU meeting in Beijing
on Friday that the unions should cooperate with government at all
levels in helping implement the policies and measures that were
designed to restructure state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that there have been major policy decisions recently of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee to promote the
restructuring. State enterprises employ about 100 million people.
</P>
<P>
These decisions Wei described as an action agenda for reforming
and developing the state enterprises, including the strategic
readjustment of the state-run economy and strategic restructuring
of enterprises and reforming the management of each enterprise.
</P>
<P>
He said that unions should improve themselves by reforming
their operations and management in the light of these decisions to
better serve China's working people.
</P>
<P>
They should also help local governments do a better job in
streamlining the over-staffed state enterprises, seeing to it that
the basic needs of laid-off workers are met and that they find
employment, he said, adding that an effort needs to be made to see
to it that workers are represented on the boards of directors or
supervisory councils of enterprises that are solely owned or
controlled by the state.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Should Turn Dialogue Into Actions: Prodi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Top business leaders of the
European Union (EU) and Japan have agreed to enhance their overall
cooperation with joint actions in the 21st century when they met
here Thursday and Friday for a meeting of the EU-Japan Business
Dialogue Roundtable.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Romano Prodi told 45 leading
corporate Chief Executive Officers from Europe and Japan that EU-
Japan relations are soundly based and are developing steadily, if
slowly.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to them becoming deeper and broader as we enter
the 21st century. Europe and Japan can work fruitfully together in
many ways. I was honored to receive an invitation from my friend
Prime Minister Obuchi to visit Japan, and I accept with pleasure.
I want us to forge closer links by turning dialogue into joint
actions and projects," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the EU is an economic giant comparable to the United
States or Japan, Prodi said the 15-nation bloc and its world
partners have yet to fully embrace information technology. "We
must waste no time in taking that step, in making the transition
to a knowledge-based society," the president said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, five different working groups discussed
their future cooperation. The Europeans and Japanese drafted
policy outlines for the fields of deregulation, distribution,
competition; regulatory and standards issues including telecom;
taxation; mutual recognition agreement and electronic commerce.

WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States will face
Zimbabwe in the first round of the Davis Cup tennis championship
on February 4-6.
</P>
<P>
With John McEnroe in charge of the team and Andre Agassis back,
the Americans are heavily favored to win the cup this time.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough travel trip, but I like our chance," McEnroe, the
new team leader, said at a news conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
The United States was drawn Thursday to play at Harare,
Zimbabwe, in a potentially tricky first-round World Group match.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which upset Australia away from home two years ago,
has a strong veteran team led by brothers Byron and Wayne Black.
And the Americans will have to cope with a long trip to an
unfamiliar country.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said he recently talked to Pete Sampras about playing.
He also noted that Todd Martin has indicated a desire to play and
said he would like Jim Courier to consider playing doubles.
</P>
<P>
The matches will be played on an indoor hard court. If the
Americans beat Zimbabwe, they will face either Britain or the
Czech Republic in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The other leading countries in America's top half of the draw
are Spain, which entertain Italy, and Russia, which play at home
against Belgium.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- India's High Commission in Dhaka
on Friday denied reports in some Bangladeshi newspapers about
deployment of Indian troops on the India-Bangladesh border, the
official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commission in a statement termed the reports as
"entirely baseless" and clarified that there was no deployment of
Indian troops along the India-Bangladesh border.
</P>
<P>
The high commission said the Indian government has noted "with
concern the unfortunate border incidents" which have taken place
over the past few weeks and explained that "those involved with
the management of the border are under instructions to keep in
touch with their counterparts to ensure that such incidents do not
occur and that the letter and spirit of the 1975 border guidelines
are maintained."
</P>
<P>
The Indian government also suggested a joint press statement or
briefings after border meetings in order to provide an accurate
and objective picture, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The Independent daily newspaper reported on Friday that the
Indian authorities have deployed thousands of Border Security
Force members and army personnel with heavy artillery along the
300-kilometer land borders of Assam and West Bengal and that the
Indian forces have dug numerous bunkers and took position along
the barbed fences.

The Conference Board, a U.S. prominent business research group,
said in an analysis that government policy actions, a rebound in
consumer spending and higher exports are fueling a comeback in
China.
</P>
<P>
"The (Chinese) government is intent on establishing a cyclical
policy stance -- through infrastructure spending and monetary
policy -- that will bring China's growth back to 8 percent to 10
percent," said Gail D. Fosler, senior vice president and chief
economist of the Conference Board, in the latest issue of
StraightTalk, her newsletter prepared exclusively for Conference
Board associates.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending has picked up recently and the past two
months of exports suggest a substantial rebound," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fosler said, "It is fashionable to be pessimistic about China,
but the facts support significant optimism."
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said that with the domestic economy
showing improvement, interest rates coming down, continued
economic growth in the U.S. and Europe, a recovery in Japan, and
an even stronger recovery in the rest of Asia, the consensus
forecasts for slower Chinese growth seem highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending in China, which did not grow at all in the 12
months ended in January 1999, has picked up, and industrial
activity, which reached a low last year, is also holding up,
despite uncertain inventory level, the research group said, adding
that it is another boost that the Bank of China's cut in interest
rates reduced the loan rate for fixed assets down to 5.58 percent,
its lowest level this decade.
</P>
<P>
The board said that despite the recent cut in Chinese interest
rates, the devaluation of the renminbi is unlikely and the reasons
include the high value of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar,
the euro and the Japanese yen, which is almost the same today as
it was in 1994, the competitiveness in the majority of the Chinese
export products and the big foreign exchange reserves in China.
</P>
<P>
While the present slowdown in China's economic growth in the
result of structural policy realignment in the mid-1990s, it was
the policy shift that reversed the trade deficit, restored foreign
exchange reserves, balanced the government budget and provided the
fiscal resources for China to engage in countercyclical measures,
the group said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Burundi Parties to End Attacks on Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has called on the government and rebel forces involved
in the conflict in Burundi to stop attacks on innocent civilians
and abide by international law and principles, U.N. officials said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan said that he
"calls on all parties involved in the conflict, both government
and rebel forces, to end all attacks on the civilian population
and to abide by international humanitarian law and principles."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was "extremely concerned by the massive forced
displacement of the population" around Bujumbura, the capital of
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. system in Burundi and its humanitarian partners are
making every effort to provide urgent life-saving assistance to
the most vulnerable among the displaced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in the statement, also "calls upon the government and
all other parties whose actions have given rise to this situation
to end the armed conflict and take all measure that those affected
can return to their homes as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The Burundi army has forcibly resettled nearly 260,000
civilians into camps in the hills around the capital city in a
classic counter-insurgency tactic to deny ethnic Hutu rebels and
support from the local population.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people have died since October 1993 in a
series of massacres of civilians and a war between Burundi's
Tutsi-run army and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies have blamed both sides for abuses against
civilians. At least 600,000 people have been driven from their
homes by the fighting.

ROME, October 8 (Xinhua) -- MIchael Schumacher will go to Asia
to take part in the last two races of this year's Formula One
Grand Prix in Malaysia and Japan, it was announced by Ferrari on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"After three days of intensive testing at Mugello and Fiorano,
Michael saw there had been a big improvement in his physical
condition and therefore he has decided to take part in the two
final races of the season." Ferrari team spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The final two races of the season will be held in Malaysia on
October 17 and in Japan on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, a two-time world champion, had said that he would
not compete in those events because he didn't feel back in top
from following his leg fracture at the british Grand Prix in July.
</P>
<P>
But he completed 58 laps at the Fiorano track where he broke an
track record set by his teammate Eddie Irvine.
</P>
<P>
Suhumacher's comeback will be a boost to Irvine who is now two
points behind Hakkinen in the drivers' standings.

<HEADLINE> NetAid Shows Internet as Engine for Development, U.N. Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
teaming up with the private sector in an "historic partnership" to
launch an Internet project involving the public directly in the
fight to eradicate poverty, a senior U.N. official said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project, known as NetAid, "will demonstrate that the
Internet can act as an engine for development," Zephirin Diabre,
associate director of the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), made
the statement at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
NetAid will be launched Saturday at three star-studded concerts
to be held simultaneously in New Jersey, London and Geneva and
carried live on television, radio and the Internet, the main
electronic medium in the wake of the rapid development of today's
information technology.
</P>
<P>
The web site was created by Cisco Systems, the giant Internet
networking company, and its technology partners, and will be
managed by the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
By logging onto "www.netaid.org," people can go on "their own
cyber journey of discovery" and find out ways to help eradicate
poverty and contribute to other humanitarian causes, Diabre said,
adding that the site, currently the world's largest, is designed
to take 60 million hits an hour during the three concerts.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of France, Britain
and Germany Friday called on the U.S. Senate to ratify a global
nuclear-test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made the call in an
opinion article on The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that failure to ratify the treaty will be a
"failure in our struggle against proliferation. Disarmament
negotiations would suffer."
</P>
<P>
"Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the
pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to
ratify it," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also said that rejection of the treaty would also
give great encouragement to proliferators and "expose a
fundamental divergence" within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
They also argue that the treaty is "effectively verifiable."
"We need have no fear of the risk of cheating. We will not be
relying on the good will of a rogue state to allow inspectors onto
its territory."
</P>
<P>
"The United States and its allies have worked side by side
for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since the days of President
Eisenhower. This goal is now within our grasp. Our security is
involved, as well as America's," they noted.
</P>
<P>
"For the security of the world we will leave to our children,
we urge the United States Senate to ratify the treaty," the
article said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Intensify Its Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma has called on his country to expand and
intensify efforts in fighting HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday on South African Broadcasting Corporation
Television in commemoration of the first anniversary of the
country's campaign on the Partnership against AIDS, Zuma called
for increased commitment and sustained action to combat AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The deputy president stressed that preventing HIV infection
needs more than lip service, piecemeal approaches and once-off
activities, adding that "we must continue to share resources and
build new partnerships."
</P>
<P>
He said the government has played a major role in fighting the
disease by introducing new laws and amending others to incorporate
HIV/AIDS issues.
</P>
<P>
"Both provincial and national government departments have
prioritized HIV/AIDS in their day-to-day activities, and
government ministers and political leaders across the spectrum
have focused their attentions on this disease," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the pandemic is changing and many of those who
have become infected are becoming ill and need care.
</P>
<P>
"We need to support their families and loved ones. It is not
difficult to understand that not only there is a dire need for
action, but also there are many opportunities for action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma noted that over the past year, millions of South Africans
had committed themselves to AIDS action to provide counselling,
care and support to those living with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"In our workplaces and our institutions of higher learning,
there has been increased focus on preventing infections through
awareness programs, through increased access to condoms and
through providing treatment for sexually transmitted diseases," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Announces Internal Revenue Hike in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Friday announced a 26-percent increase in the Internal
Revenue Allotment (IRA) in next year's budget, Philippine News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the announcement in a speech before some 1,500

billion pesos (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999 to 121.8 billion
pesos (3 billion dollars) in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the IRA accounts for about 94 percent of the
allocation for local government units of 130.2 billion pesos (3.2
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He told the mayors that the increase in IRA is in recognition
that the local communities are essential to national development.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Ex-President Nyerere's Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian former president
Julius Nyerere's condition deteriorated from Thursday with most
vital parts of his body failing to work properly, an official
statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors attending the 77-year-old African statesman who is
under round- the-clock medical treatment at the Intensive Care
Unit in the St. Thomas' Hospital in London said his kidney does
not function well with jaundice complications making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago, is
also running a fever, according to a bulletin released by the
State House.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by press secretary to Tanzanian
President, said that medical specialists are trying their best to
save his life.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, physicians attending Nyerere, revered as the founding
father of Tanzania, said there is a heartening improvement of his
health but soon the situation reversed.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes U.S. Claims to Avoid Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Friday dismissed as
lies U.S. claims that its warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in
Iraq were trying to minimize civilian casualties by dropping
concrete bombs rather than bombs filled with explosives on Iraqi
targets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claims "are designed to mislead the world public
opinion," an Iraqi military spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Whatsoever the American officials went far in lying and
misleading and in uttering bogus claims, they are unable to hide
facts of their crimes in killing Iraqi children, women and the
elderly..." said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. laser-guided bombs and missiles destroyed
several civilian installations and houses in northern and southern
Iraq, adding scores of citizens were killed and hundreds wounded
in U.S. and British bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"We have certain evidence that they used guided bombs of type
16, 15, 14 and 12 GBU and guided missiles 154 and cluster bombs,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its Western allies imposed two no-fly zones in
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Remains at 4.2 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
remained unchanged at 4.2 percent in September while the number of
payroll jobs actually fell, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that September's rate matched August's
rate at 4.2 percent, the lowest rate in nearly three decades. The
nation's jobless rate has been below 4.4 percent since March.
</P>
<P>
U.S. employers cut payroll jobs in September by 8,000, the
first decline since January 1996 when a winter blizzard disrupted
hiring plans. The Department's report said that while the growth
in payroll jobs would have been extremely weak in September
compared with the robust gains reported for most of this year, the
hurricane cut growth by 50,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Even with the weak job growth, wage pressures accelerated in
September. Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation
pressures, rose by 0.5 percent to 13.37 dollars in September, much
sharper than the 0.2 percent increase in August.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that although strong wage growth is a good news
for workers, it could be a recipe for sparking inflation. They
worry that employers foraging for qualified workers woo them with
higher wages and benefits, costs likely to drive up consumer
prices if not constrained by other forces.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Fed policy-makers decided not to raise interest
rates for now, but expressing concerns that the tight labor market
could lead to inflation down the road, they left open the
possibility of a third rate increase later this year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, another 21,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, but
government analysts noted that the average monthly decline in
manufacturing slowed to 15,000 per month from June through
September, less than half the 36,000 monthly average in the first
six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products
rebound somewhat from a global financial crisis which began in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, normally the driving force of job creation
in the United States, suffered a decline of 9,000 in September,
reflecting a drop of 49,000 jobs at retail businesses. Government
analysts said that job loss was particularly heavy where
businesses were forced to close because of Hurricane Floyd, which
raked the East Coast in September.
</P>
<P>
But even without the hurricane, there was widespread weakness
as department stores cut 17,000 jobs, the fifth consecutive
monthly loss.
</P>
<P>
In September, there was also a drop of 23,000 government jobs
while business services added only 39,000 jobs, well below their
average monthly gain of 126,000.

MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Trade Ministry said
Friday that it would continue talks later this month in Geneva on
its admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Russia will also attend an expanded WTO meeting in Seattle as
an observer on November 29 - December 1, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, the Russian delegation is expected to discuss its
proposals on the terms of access of foreign countries to its
markets, in particular in the fields of banking, insurance, trade,
construction, telecommunications and legal services.
</P>
<P>
Almost completely excluded from the list of the most
accessible services prepared for the Geneva talks are
transportation, environmental protection and some types of
communications, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Russia also wants to restrict or ban foreign access to its
labor market, privatization, operations with land, natural
resources, and natural monopolies.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also tackle Russia's customs duty rates and the
size of government subsidy for farming.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched admission negotiations in 1995. The WTO now
groups 136 countries and about 40 other countries and regions are
negotiating membership, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Launch War Against Illegal Drug Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Manila has planned to form a team
of prosecution lawyers to crack down on illegal drug trade,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted Manila Mayor Lito Atienza as saying the move
would hasten the filing of criminal charges against those involved
in the such trade, especially those considered as "untouchables"
because they reportedly enjoy protection from high-ranking
law-enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
Atienza said the primary task of the team would be to gather
evidence against drug lords and their protectors, which in turn,
could serve as a basis for the filing of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
He said the special team of prosecutors, who will report
directly to him, will monitor all arrests, gather and organize
evidence, file charges in court and participate in the prosecution
of drug-related cases.
</P>
<P>
Atienza noted that in the past, crooked cops involved in
illegal drug trade were able to evade arrest and prosecution
because they were being protected by their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that it is possible that some policemen let
the suspects go in exchange for the confiscated drugs and a large
amount of money.
</P>
<P>
"If there is an arrest but no police report, then we now have
strong reason to believe that money changed hands," he added.

measures to prevent the anti-Chinese articles in the law from
damaging the improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations,

terrorism activities in Pakistan," Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed
was quoted as saying by reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Thursday said there were
solid evidences of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and
people trained there were involved in the recent sectarian
terrorism in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he had sent a delegation led by a senior
intelligence official to Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters, to
urge the Islamic militia to eradicate the camps.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that no terrorist training was being given in
Afghanistan, we want to make it clear to Pakistani Mujahideen
(holy war fighters) in our country that we will not allow our soil
to be used against any one," Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official spokesman said he did not see any
"negative impact" on the relations between the militia and
Pakistan, one of the only three countries which recognize the
Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Two Suspects Arrested for U.S. Embassy Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The American Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) and the South African police are believed
to have arrested people in connection with last year's blasts at
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the South African Press
Association reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were apparently made in Cape Town this week but the
U.S. embassy in Pretoria, asked to respond to the development,
said on Thursday it had "no comment."
</P>
<P>
 The blasts in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, which exploded
minutes apart, killed 116 people and injured 4,274.
</P>
<P>
After persistent enquiries, a spokesperson for the United
States said later that a directive had been issued under which
they were barred from commenting, without permission from the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
South African authorities were similarly tightlipped.
</P>
<P>
However, highly placed U.S. sources said arrests had been made,
with more to follow, adding that those arrested were not South
African citizens.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the FBI was closely involved in investigations
in and around Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
On August 7 last year, a powerful car bomb exploded outside
the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, killing at least 108 people and
injuring 4,200.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, another car bomb next to the U.S. embassy in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, exploded killing eight and injuring 74.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen days later, U.S. forces attacked suspected terrorist
camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said the targeted facilities were
linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire which U.S.
officials have described as a "major sponsor of terrorism".
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the U.S. attacks, three men were arrested in
Kenya and allegedly confessed to having links with bin Laden.

<HEADLINE> Rios, Chang Cruise into Semis of Shanghai Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Marcelo Rios of Chile
disposed of Australian doubles specialist Todd Woodbridge 6-3, 6-3
to advance into the semifianls of the Heineken Open here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Former world No. 1 Rios is on his first vsit to China and so
far it's bringing him good fortune. The semifinal appearance is
his best effort on the ATP Tour since winning the tournament in St.
Polten in May.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Michael Chang also made it to the final four
when he beat another American Michael Gambill 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Rios will take on Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden while Chang is to
play another Swede Magnus Norman.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman was given a very tough time by his up-and-coming
countryman Andreas Vinciguerra before he finally triumphed 6-3, 3-
6, 6-3. And Norman, the second seed, stopped the run of Paradorn
Srichaphan of Thailand 7-6 (7-4), 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Rios felt he was moving better on the court, in fact that
aspect of his game has picked up even from the early part of the
week. He said his leg injury is okay but feels he "still can't run
as before, but I am trying to do my best".
</P>
<P>
The world number seven was forced to miss tournaments,
including Wimbledon, this year because of his leg problems. He
said it was not that he is fresher for missing weeks of the Tour,
instead he is just looking forward to playing better.
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge acknowledged that Rios played far too well for him
and his serve was a big factor in the win.
</P>
<P>
"He never allowed me to put on any pressure in the match," said
the Australian. "I played okay for me, but overall for me to get
to that stage of the tournament (quarterfinals) is very good - it'
s my first quarterfinal of the year and I competed well."
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge has been struggling with his singles game but feels
his week at the Heineken Open, Shanghai will be a big boost for
his confidence.
</P>
<P>
"If you can hang in, it turns around and I will use this as a
springboard," he said. "I won tight matches which I have not done
for a long time."
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman said he could just see the headlines back in Sweden if
Vinceguerra had beaten him in what was a high level and very
entertaining match between one of the present dynasty of Swedes
and the future of Swedish tennis.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play bad, pretty good in fact but I could have made
more returns," said Bjorkman, who last reached a semifinal at
Tokyo in April. "It would have been his biggest win if he had
beaten me but I avoided that. This year I have lost too many early
round matches and I didn't want to lose to him today, maybe I will
in the future."
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman said playing Rios will not be easy because he is "
looking sharper than in the last couple of months, but I have a
good record against left-handers".
</P>
<P>
Chang said this was the best feeling he has had with his tennis
for some time - it's his first semifinal since San Diego in
February.
</P>
<P>
He said: "That's been the difficult thing, getting out and
playing tough tennis and fighting for matches. I have kept my
errors down this week and I am happy things are heading in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough match for sure against Michael Gambill,
fighting through the points and long rallies. He hits hard off the
ground and is not an easy player to play against so I am pleased
to get through this match."
</P>
<P>
Norman started very slowly and allowed Schriphan to open up a 5-
1 lead in the first set, but when the Swede got used to the
conditions he managed to claw his way back in.
</P>
<P>
"I had a hard, tough match the day before and it took me a bit
of time to get used to the night conditions, but I was pleased
with the way it turned out," said Norman. "Now I have to play
Chang - he's playing great and he's very difficult to beat in Asia.
..I've been told. But, he's going to have to play very well to
beat me."

<HEADLINE> London Train Crash Blamed on Missed Red Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The first official report on
Britain's worst train crash in recent 40 years has blamed the rail
disaster on one of the trains passing a red light signal.
</P>
<P>
The signaling equipment was unlikely at fault when the two
crowded commuter trains collided outside London's Paddington
Station Tuesday morning, the government-run Health and Safety
Executive's (HSE) said in its interim report on the accident
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the immediate cause of the accident,
thought to have claimed more than 100 lives, appears to be that
one of the trains passed a signal on red some 700 meters before
the collision point.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons why the train passed the red light are likely to
be complex," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Inspector of Railways Vic Coleman, who headed the report
team, said evidence suggests that the accident "would have been
prevented by the installation and correct operation of a Train
Protection Warning System."
</P>
<P>
He warned the report was "very much an interim report" and
other tests were needed, though he had a "very high confidence" in
what was being presented in it.
</P>
<P>
Coleman said both trains involved in the accident were fitted
with the "automatic warning system" which sounds a horn to the
driver as he approaches a signal at anything other than green.
</P>
<P>
When hearing it, the driver has to cancel it within three
seconds, or the brakes will automatically apply.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that not enough pieces of the system could be
recovered intact from the wreckage of the train passing the red
signal to determine whether it was actually working on the day.

<HEADLINE> Transport Strike Cripples North Mindanao, Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A region-wide transport strike
held Friday for a wage hike crippled 90 percent of the
transportation industry in North Mindanao, the Philippines, the
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The strike started early Friday morning and is expected to
culminate at midnight, said Librador Olango, head of the Traffic
Federation of Cagayan de Oro, capital city of Misamis Oriental
province.
</P>
<P>
Olango said the transport strike affected nearby regional
cities as protesters vowed to barricade strategic places along the
national highways leading to Cagayan de Oro City.
</P>
<P>
Police Director Cesar Ouano said buses will be made available
only upon request.
</P>
<P>
At 8:00 a.m., protesters marched through the streets of the
city, brandishing placards demanding a wage hike.
</P>
<P>
Classes were suspended in all schools in Cagayan de Oro City
but government offices were opened on time as workers and
employees reportedly went to work either by walking or by driving.
</P>
<P>
Cresencio Castanos, assistant regional director of the
Department of Education, Culture and Sports, however directed
school authorities to make up classes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Belen, president of the Cagayan de Oro City Chamber of
Commerce, said the strike surely affected the business community
since a number of opportunities were lost.
</P>
<P>
"Although businessmen do not agree to the strikers' demand of
wage increase, the Chamber of Commerce sympathized with the
protesters," Belen added.
</P>
<P>
So far, no untoward incident has been reported but police have
orders to be on full alert until the strike is over at midnight
Friday, Ouano said.

<P>
LGAOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Attorney-General and
Minister of Justice Kanu Agabi said more prisoners will be
released as part of the country's prison reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Friday quoted him
as saying at a meeting in Abuja that a total of 8,000 prisoners
have been released on the recommendations of the National
(Presidential) Task Force on Prison Congestion and Reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is committed to prison reforms with a
view to reforming and rehabilitating the inmates, stressing that
this is a part of the government's efforts towards a full rebirth
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
There is urgent need today not only for reform of the prison
system, but also for total reformation of the nation as a whole,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said the government would by no means
slacken its efforts in dispensing justice against crime.
</P>
<P>
"We will invoke the law against all those who violate it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Minister of State for Internal Affairs

<HEADLINE> WHO Expert Warns of Hypertension Prevalence in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China faces a problem "on an unimaginable scale" with its
growing burden of heart disease and strokes, and by 2020 may
report nearly a doubling of deaths due to these causes, Dr. John
Chalmers, chairman of WHO-ISH (International Society of
Hypertension) Liaison Committee told an international seminar
today, China's National Hypertension Day.
</P>
<P>
Another WHO health warning released at the seminar showed that
non-infectious illnesses such as cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases would be responsible for 79 percent of
deaths in China by 2020.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to prevent some millions of unnecessary but
preventable deaths due to stroke and heart disease, we must act
now on the two major risks - hypertension and smoking - in the 1.2
billion people of China," said Dr. Chalmers.
</P>
<P>
National Hypertension Day is initiated by the Ministry of
Health to raise public awareness of hypertension control and
prevention in China, where one out of every 12 people have high
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
"New research suggests the hypertension prevalence remains
serious in China, since blood pressure levels of about half of the
adult outpatients were found to be above the safety level," said
Prof. Liu Lisheng, chairwoman of the China Hypertension League, a
non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
The national study, conducted among 9,400 outpatients over age
35, found the prevalence rate climbing as the age increases,
reaching 65 percent among the people over 65.
</P>
<P>
The increase was also found to be closely associated with
excessive intake of meat and salt, lack of physical exercise and
being overweight, she said, adding that many young adults were
unaware of the need for regular blood pressure checks.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Health Yin Dakui has pledged that the
government and all of society will work with medical professionals
to decrease prevalence of hypertension.

backwardness to the country, but also ensured that the basic

<HEADLINE> Putin Says Treaty Publication First Step to Union With Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The publication of the draft
treaty on the formation of the Russia-Belarus union is the first
step to their true unification, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The unification of Russia and Belarus is a complicated matter.
We will not be rushing it, but neither will we remain in one place,
" he said before departure for a meeting of the Commonwealth of
Independent States prime ministers in Yalta, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which envisages the creation of a confederative
state in which both countries retain sovereignty and independence,
was offered to the general public Friday simultaneously in Russia
and Belarus for a period of consideration that will last till
November 1.
</P>
<P>
"I think history is giving the two nations a chance to be
together and we should not lose it," he said, stressing that
Russia and Belarus have the closest relations in the CIS.
</P>
<P>
"This is an indication of special ethnic closeness, special
cultural closeness and a great potential for developing these
relations," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the view that Russia should not be uniting with
Belarus because the latter "is a poor country."
</P>
<P>
"Belarussians do not differ from us in any way and it is
unfair to speak of different development standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we lose this chance, we will separate very far from one
another," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks Safe Passage of Aid for Displaced Afghans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is to
negotiate with the warring Afghan factions for a safe passage to
supply humanitarian assistance for the people affected in the
recent fighting, a U.N. official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Because of the continuous fighting, "we face serious problems
to have access to the displaced people," Erick de Mul, U.N.
coordinator for Afghanistan, told a news briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He stated that some 195,000 people have been displaced in the
factional fighting erupted at the advent of summer.
</P>
<P>
Around 60,000 people took shelter in the Taliban-controlled
capital Kabul, another 60,000 are in the Panjsher valley, the
strongholds of anti-Taliban commander Ahmad Shah Masood, 35,000 in
the Dara Suf area in northern Afghanistan, 25,000 in Hazarajat in
the central part and another 16,000 displaced from Talogan,
capital of the northern Takhar province, according to Mul's
estimates.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that civilians were the main victim of the
factional fighting in Afghanistan. "If you must fight, please
spare the civilians," he told the rival Afghan groups.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, the official said the United Nations
would need 100 to 150 million U.S. dollars for the humanitarian
assistance to the displaced Afghan people.

OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's population has grown
over the 30.5-million mark, but with a slowest rate for the past
28 years, according to Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, the population was 30,568,000, an increase of
only 0.9 percent over the same period of last year, the official
agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth was the slowest since 1971 because of a decline of
about 21,000 immigrants, a small drop in the birth rate and an
increase in death rate.
</P>
<P>
Alberta saw the greatest increase of all provinces with a rate
of 2 percent, while Newfoundland recorded a drop of 0.8 percent,

FUJIAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Top Victory Electronics Co.
Ltd., a local electronics company in east China's Fujian Province,
was listed today in the stock markets of Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The company is selling 300 million shares in the overseas stock
markets to raise 357 million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The funds are expected to be used for the company's research
projects in Taiwan and mainland China, and to procure equipment
and molds to expand the company's computer assembly lines,
according to General Manager Xuan Jiansheng.
</P>
<P>
The company, which is headquartered in Fuqing City, is the
largest manufacturer of computer monitors in the mainland and the
fourth largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
It has five monitor production lines in Fuqing, assembling six
million units a year, and four production lines that turn out 1.5
million scanners annually.

With the opening this May of a new production line in Beijing,
the firm has increased its manufacturing capacity of monitors by 1.
5 million.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes for Asian Peacekeepers in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government hoped
Friday that the incoming U.N. Peacekeeping Force (UNPKF) for East
Timor will mostly consist of Asian troops, especially those from
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Asian forces, especially from ASEAN, as the
largest contributor to UNPKF, would be easily accepted because of
their similarities in stature and cultural values, Indonesian
Defense Minister/Armed Forces Chief General Wiranto said here when
he met with his Filipino counterpart, General A.T. Reyes.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, there has been a sense of dislike of Caucasians
among East Timorese as UNAMET (U.N. Mission in East Timor) was
deemed unfair in conducting the ballot," Wiranto was quoted by a
spokesman of the Indonesian Armed Forces as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also said the proportion of security force in East
Timor should thoroughly be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said in the meeting that at this stage his country could
not send more personnel to East Timor as its armed forces have a
lot of tasks to carry out. Besides, the dispatch of a large
military contingent was hampered by a limited military budget.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines contributes 247 personnel to the International
Force in East Timor (INTERFET) who are non-combatant troops to
perform humanitarian duties, including medical doctors and
paramedics.
</P>
<P>
To restore security in East Timor, the United Nations has
deployed around 3,700 INTERFET troops from various countries since
September 20.
</P>
<P>
Reyes, however, promised to send a much larger contingent to
UNPKF in East Timor as this blue-beret contingent will be financed
by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week announced that
INTERFET will be replaced by a 9,000-strong UNPKF starting
February 2000.
</P>
<P>
Reyes is on a working visit to Jakarta accompanied by some
high-ranking officers.

<HEADLINE> Over 110,000 Chechen Refugees Flee to Neighboring Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 110,000 people have fled
Chechnya to the neighboring republic of Ingushetia, Russian
Federal Migration Service head Vladimir Kalamanov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said assistance is extended to all the refugees regardless
of whether they were registered, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The federal government decided Thursday to transfer 147
million dollars (5.72 million U.S. dollars) to the Federal
Migration Service from its Reserve Fund for "one-time financial
assistance to individuals, private sector rent, temporary
settlement and transportation to Russia or abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is under control although difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ten regions' authorities confirmed that they would accommodate
Chechnya's refugees.
</P>
<P>
The federal service will ask the government to extend more
allocations in about two weeks, he said, "The next sum would
amount to 250-300 million rubles (9.7-11.7 million dollars) for
three months."
</P>
<P>
The government is likely to adopt a resolution soon which
would introduce a new status for people forced to leave their
residences, he said. Some 300,000 to 400,000 will be provided
with "temporary shelter" under the new status, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said Friday that his
tiny republic is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe due to
the influx of Chechen refugees whose number exceeds 133,000.
</P>
<P>
He said a record number of refugees -- 14,000 -- arrived in
the past 24 hours, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the local authorities are unable to cope with the
influx. "The republic is simply suffocating. We experience an
acute shortage of food, baby food, warm clothes, blankets and even
more important -- tents, trailers and stoves."
</P>
<P>
"If the situation does not change, people will have to spend
the winter out in the open," Aushev warned.

<HEADLINE> Artistic Gymnastics World Championships Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The 34th world gymnastics
championships kicks off Friday here with a total of 651 athletes
from 73 countries and regions participating in this event which
made its debut in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese president Jiang Zemin declared open the championships.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Grandi, president of the Federation of the International
Gymnastics, hailed the competition as "a very special
championships" which is also the qualifier for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The hosts have set their eyes on winning the fourth straight
men's team title and snatch the first top honor in women's
competition.
</P>
<P>
But the road to the champions is expected to be quite long and
tough as a pack of favorites are posing stern challenges and aims
for more than a ticket for the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
Russia will be the biggest hurdle for China to overcome
although the history is on the side of the hosts who snatched
three straight men's team titles with only one slipping to Russia
since the disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Such teams as Japan, Belarus and France are also the threats
for the medals with Australia, Canada, Germany all within the shot
at one of the 12 berths for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The women's team title will be contested among the top three
teams including Romania, Russia and the hosts, with Ukraine and
the United States also having a chance for the medals.
</P>
<P>
The prospect for Chinese women's team is less certain as the
hosts only field a team of mostly inexperienced girls with some
veterans like Bi Wenjing and Qui Yuanyuan absent for injuries or
bad shape.
</P>
<P>
The Individual event will see a would-be dramatic competition
as some luminaries are eying for making history of their own.
</P>
<P>
Russian Svetlana Khorkina will defend her title to be the first
back-to-back women's world champion since Shannon Miller did it in
1993 and 1994 while Ivan Ivankov of Belarus are poised to become
the first man to ever win three world all-around titles.
</P>
<P>
With one gold in the beam event, Liu Xuan, the only veteran in
the women's line-up for the championships, will become the first
Chinese women gymnast to garner two world titles since Ma Yanhong
achieved such feat in 1984 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the later stage the Extraordinary Congress 1999 of the 72nd
FIG General Assembly will also be held from 13-14 with a medical
symposium slated in the following two days.
</P>
<P>
More voices calling for gymnastics reform have become bigger as
the new Code of Points have incurred great controversy in the
gymnastics field.
</P>
<P>
Grandi, however, put the dispute as a "natural form of progress
" as he made clear that the reform will go on for the "evolution (
of gymnastics) is quicker than that of our rules and regulations".
</P>
<P>
"One of our task is to create a shorter format of gymnastics
competitions in order to satisfy Television's and audience
particular requirements,"said the president at the opening press
conference for the championships on Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese
psychologists and other experts are working together to better
understand children's psychological health, educate society about
the subject, and find ways to correct kids' behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 experts gathered here today at the fourth Sino-
Japanese seminar on children's psychological health, which was
organized by the Experts Committee of the China Working Committee
on Care for Children, the Sino-Japanese society on the study of
children's education and the Shanghai women's federation.
</P>
<P>
Yan Renying, director of the Experts Committee of the China
Working Committee on Care for Children, said at today's opening
ceremony that many parents today are more interested in providing
material objects for their children than in paying attention to
their children's psychological health.
</P>
<P>
Experts and others who work with children should share
responsibility to promote children's psychological health in the
next century, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
Jushiro Naito, a famous pediatrics expert in Japan, said that
it is very important to foster children's sense of independence,
let them take on social responsibilities, and tap their potential
to develop their abilities.
</P>
<P>
It also is wise to help children become warm-hearted and
creative, Naito said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from China and Japan also agreed that children's
psychological health has become a worldwide issue, and families,
society and schools should work together in this regard.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day seminar, participants will discuss
psychological health education in schools, the environment and
psychological condition for children in difficulty, and ways to
build a favorable relationship between parents and their children.
</P>
<P>
The three previous seminars focused on breast feeding, the
study of children's development and the relationship between
children's development and their social environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, October 8 (Xinhua) -- German General Klaus Reinhardt
formally took his new post Friday as commander of the 40,000
international peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, replacing Lieutenant
General Michael Jackson of Britain.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a German officer has taken command
of NATO mission outside his country since Germany became a member
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1955. European
observers regarded it as a strong sign of acceptance of a country
slowly shedding its image as instigator of two world wars in this
century.
</P>
<P>
In fact, German participation in NATO mission abroad, including
that in Bosnia, sparked a heated parliamentary debate at home in
view of the nation's history as well as concerns among neighbors
about Germany's growing role.
</P>
<P>
However, the NATO's choice of Reinhardt to lead the Kosovo
peacekeeping force, known as KFOR, has been widely seen as the
natural outgrowth of Germany's resuming a central role in world
affairs.
</P>
<P>
When recalling important changes within NATO, Javier Solana
said earlier this week: "The changes have come incredibly fast."
</P>
<P>
"Just look at Germany," Solana said at the NATO headquarters
here just before the day he formally left his office as the NATO
Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
"For years, the Germans believed they would never again send
troops abroad because of their history. But today, we have a
German general who will soon take command over all of NATO's
soldiers in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt studied history and political science at Freiburg
University in southern Germany and received a doctorate of
philosophy in 1972. In 1975, He also took part in the U.S.
military's Command and General Staff Officer course at Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1998, the German officer has been NATO commander of
Allied Land Forces Central Europe in Heidelberg, Germany.

<HEADLINE> UK Court Rules Pinochet Should be Extradited to Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A British court said here on
Friday that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet should be
extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture charges dating from
his rule.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Ronald Bartle made the rule at 1020 GMT in Bow
Street Magistrates Court in central London. He said Pinochet has
been committed to extradition to Spain to face the charges.
</P>
<P>
The ruling does not mean Pinochet will be sent to Spain
immediately. His lawyers would have 15 days to appeal and, in any
case, Home Secretary Jack Straw must sign all extradition orders
and can overrule the magistrate.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in London nearly a year ago at the
request of Spain, which wants to try him on torture charges dating
from the latter part of his 1973-90 rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
The retired general, who is under house arrest in the suburb of
south-west London, was not in the court to hear the verdict as
British law required. He is excused from attending the verdict on
grounds of ill health. His doctors say he has not yet overcome the
effects of two apparent strokes last month.
</P>
<P>
Bartle's decision is the high water mark of the case so far,
the first time there has been a court decision on whether Pinochet
should be extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Other court rulings to date have focused on the legality of
Pinochet's arrest last October 16 while recovering in a London
hospital from a back operation.
</P>
<P>
His detention was upheld by Britain's top court in March,
although it reduced the charges against him to those dated after
December 1988, when Britain incorporated an international torture
convention into law.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet denies the allegations, telling one newspaper that he
"didn't have time to control what others were doing".

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks for More Cyber Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday urged local
law experts to write more books on cyber laws to educate the
people and entrepreneurs on the do's and don'ts in the field of
information technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
Energy, Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said
this would also benefit the people and entrepreneurs in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also urged people involved in the IT-based industry to
emphasize ethics in all their dealings to ensure that what they
were doing was in keeping with the cyber laws.
</P>
<P>
The existing cyber laws would not fully succeed in preventing
cyber offenses if the people concerned did not have moral and
ethical values, he told reporters after addressing the one-day
Cyberlaw '99 conference here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has enacted several cyber laws in the last few years,
which are advanced and unique as they were done simultaneously
with, and even ahead of, the needs of the industry, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of these soft infrastructures
such as the Computer Crimes Act 1997, the Digital Signatures Act
1997 and the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 had provided
some legal certainty to organizations planning to embark on
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, because they were written and passed ahead of
the actual ground experience, it might be useful to re-look at
them in the light of current requirements and the present state of
convergence.

<HEADLINE> S. African Environment Minister WARNS ON GLOBAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Global warming climate
leading to a rise in incidence of malaria was a matter of grave
concern for the southern African region, Environment Minister
Valli Moosa said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in Cape Town of ministers and officials
from Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, he
said that in the past year South Africa had experienced the
highest average temperatures since its recording began.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental questions have, particularly over the last two
years, begun to occupy centre stage in international affairs,"
Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
"From a South African point of view we see cooperation with
our SADC neighbors in a particularly serious light.
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons is that within the past year South Africa
has experienced the warmest climate since the history of recording
started in this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said global warming and climate change was not
simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
"It is more and more a matter which is impacting on all people."
</P>
<P>
One of the results of this had been a rise in the incidence of
malaria, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter which is of grave concern to us," he added.
</P>
<P>
 The SADC meeting aims to formulate regional policies on
matters such as desertification, climate change and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Countries attending the meeting, hosted by South Africa,
include Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM: People Want Stable polity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said on Friday that the clear message of the verdict in
the just concluded Lok Sabha polls was that people were looking
forward to a stable polity and it was now the responsibility of
government as well as opposition to honor it.
</P>
<P>
"The clear message of the verdict of 1999 is that people are
looking forward to a stable polity to ensure rapid socio-economic
development," the prime minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Now that the elections are over, he said, "we should forget the
acrimony generated during the campaign."
</P>
<P>
It has been a long campaign and now it is time to settle down
so that we can return to addressing crucial issues facing the
nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thanking the people for reposing their faith in the National
Democratic Alliance and "our friendly parties", Vajpayee said,
"the mandate of 1999 reflects the maturity and wisdom of the
voters: For the first time since 1984, a clear majority has been
given to a contender."
</P>
<P>
As of Friday morning, the BJP-led alliance already pocketed 295
out of 543 Lok Sabha seats and was leading in one more seat.
</P>
<P>
The Congress and its alliance bagged 132 seats and were leading
in two more seats while the left alliance won 42 seats and other
parties obtained 65 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BJP alone won 182 seats, the same as in 1998
elections, while the Congress won 110 seats as against 141
recorded last year.

<HEADLINE> EU Strongly Deplores Renewed Outbreak of Violence in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Friday strongly deplores the renewed outbreak of violence and
internal conflict over the past few weeks in Burundi, according to
a recent Finnish presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which is disturbed by the renewed rebel attacks against
civilians, is particularly concerned about the recent forced
removals by the Burundi army of some 260,000 civilians in the
countryside round the country's capital of Bujumbura, said the
statement. Finland is currently holding the EU's rotating
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The EU also deplores the violation of human rights, the loss of
human livies and destruction of property which have been the
hallmark of this operation.
</P>
<P>
"The EU calls upon the Burundi government to call a halt to the
policy of forced removals and to allow the people to return to
their property as quickly as possible," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the EU also asks the Burundi authorities to
continue to afford the Office of the High Commissioner for Human
Rights in Burundi and its observers the free access to all of the
camps to enable them to provide humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The EU hopes that all Burundi rebel movements will join the
peace process and that all the parties in the Burundi conflict
will choose the path of negotiation rather than that of violence
and conflict, the statement added.

<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian-led West African
peace-keeping forces (ECOMOG) will become the backbone of the
proposed United Nations forces in Sierra Leone, source from the
Nigerian Defence Headquarters was quoted as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Director of Defence Information Colonel Gadwin Ugbo said that
ECOMOG was in firm control of the situation in the war-torn west
African country, according to the Post Express.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently maintains some 7,500 troops in Sierra Leone
while Ghana, Guinea and Mali deploy only a handful of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has recommended 6,000 U.N.
peace- keepers be deployed in Sierra Leone to enforce the peace
accord signed in July in Togolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
Major Sierra Leone rebel leaders Foday Sankoh and Johnny Paul
Koroma returned to the capital Freetown last Sunday to help
implement the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh and Koroma have reportedly joined the National Committee
for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR) charged
with disarming some 45,000 ex-fighters.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting chaired by President Tejan Kabbah on Wednesday,
Koroma, who ousted the elected President Kabbah and led a military
junta between May 1997 and February 1998, pledged to ask the
rebels to be ready for disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Three-Time Champions China Face Tough Challenge By Sportswriter Liu Guang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The hosts want to make history
as the men's side aims to make the fourth straight title and the
women's side like to snatch first top honors as the world
gymnastics championships made its debut at China.
</P>
<P>
It, however, is confronted with stiff challenges from a pack of
favorites of the tournament which will also be the qualifier for
the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Russian men's team, which savored the championships victory
only once since the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, has
been set to break the winning momentum of China which has entered
the competition with a three-peat of titles to their credit.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Alexei Nemov and Svetlana Khorkina, the
traditional gymnastics powerhouse has showed their card in the
build-up to the competition which feature 651 gymnasts from a
total of 73 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
They spared little time for rest as they thrown themselves into
the warm-up exercises on their arrival at Tianjin and their
intense training has underlined their well-preparation for the
competition which will kick off here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best training which I have seen so far," exclaimed
an unidentified official with the technical committee of the
Federation of the International Gymnastics(FIG), who was well
impressed by a series of routines with high difficulty degree by
the Russian men's squad.
</P>
<P>
The blue-ribbon men's team title is also coveted by the France
who upsurged from the 12th at the Worlds' 1997 to beat the
Olympics Champions Russia for European title at the St. Petersburg
last year.
</P>
<P>
"What we tried more than ten years ago has begun to pay off.
Now we have so many elite gymnasts courtesy of the long-term plan
we worked out and a large depth we possessed,"said Touchais Marc,
head coach of the French squad.
</P>
<P>
Though the road to the title is long and rough, China are still
most favored for the men's title as they feature a line-up mixing
experience and drive.
</P>
<P>
Qian Kui, a coach and team leader with the Chinese national
squad for the past three decades, hailed the team as the "best
ever" .
</P>
<P>
"This is the best Chinese team I have ever seen. Their average
age is less than 20, and they all are free from injury and
complete in their technics," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The other teams who have a shot at the team title are Japan,
Belarus and the United States which will make a would-be dramatic
competition in sight.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very special championships, because of the high
number of the participants. We are expecting to witness a contest
of the highest level," said FIG president Bruno Grandi at the pre-
event press conference on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the prospect for the Chinese male gymnasts, the
women's side is more uncertain for China who fielded a majority of
inexperienced girls to compete with such powers like Romania,
Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Romanian team have seen a good transition as a new generation
of gymnasts have stood up to fill the gap vacated by the world
champion Gina Gogean who has begun her coaching career after
retirement.
</P>
<P>
"We have Maria Olaru, Simona Amanar, Andreea Raducan and Corina
Ungureanu. All of them are very good," said Grecu Danut, Romanian
coach and judge for the championships. "We will be among the top
three."
</P>
<P>
Ukraine needs not worry for the vacancy left by Lilia
Podkopayeva, who now retired to coach in the United States, as
Victoriya Karpenko has become the trumpet card for the
championship bid.

Obasanjo appealed the World Bank to help relieve its 30 billion
U.S. dollar foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Opening a National Congressional Conference on Economic and
Development Issues on Thursday in Abuja, attended by the visiting
World Bank President James Wolfensohn, President Obasanjo warned
that the debt burden could jeopardize the new democracy.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the bank for restoring its support to the
country, which was suspended in 1994 as part of the international
sanctions on the country's military dictatorship, reported the
Guardian newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
He thanks the Word Bank's efforts in helping fashioning
programs on poverty alleviation, health and educational
development during the last four months of the new civilian
administration.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the world organization would have more
involvement in privatizing the country's troubled state owned
enterprises such as the Nigeria Airlines, and Railways.
</P>
<P>
An agreement is expected to be signed soon in this respect,
said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the bank to make more efforts to help
retrieve the huge amount of money stolen and stashed in foreign
banks by former Nigerian corruptive officials.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wolfensohn pledged the bank would assist the
country in securing debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The bank had faith in the new civilian government and would
help it promote national stability and development, said the World
Bank Chief.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn arrived in capital Abujia Thursday and would also
visit the country's commercial center Lagos and northern city Cano
on his three-day trip.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Solicits Support for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, October 8 (xinhua) -- United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has appealed in
Luanda to the international community to confirm support for
teachers, official news agency Angop reported here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The message, which was issued on the occasion of World Teacher
Day and later written into documents by UNESCO and other UN
organizations, pointed out that the reform of education can not be
well directed if teachers are not active partners.
</P>
<P>
The appeal of UNESCO made in Luanda, capital of Angola,
stressed the exceptional role of the teacher in society and
expressed solidarity with teachers, saying that teachers "need
comprehension and cooperation among the peoples in the world."
</P>
<P>
As a powerful agent in evolution of the society, the teacher is
charged with the task of helping the children bring their
potentialities into full play, develop their critical spirit and
promote their desire for knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"Despite bad working condition, limited resources and
insufficient remuneration, teachers' dedication has been
contributing to the progress of the world," said the document.

<HEADLINE> Share prices Dip on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower on
Singapore Stock Market Friday as market attention turned to new
listings and the interest rate outlook for the U.S. still weighed
on the market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dipped 5.48 points to
end at 2,114.49 points in modest dealings.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover contracted to 203.21 million units worth
391.37 million Singapore dollars (about 232.85 million U.S.
dollars). Falls led rises by 203 to 97 with 150 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 14.95 million parcel by TPV, a Hong
Kong computer monitor maker, which was transacted at 1.19 Hong
Kong dollars per share. It was followed by PanpacMed that had
13.03 million units done. AFP was the next with 10.71 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
GE Life led the ascent of the day surging up 110 cents to close
at 18.00 Singapore dollars. TIBS w00 picked up 31 cents to finish
at 1.79 Singapore dollars. SPH moved up 30 cents to end at 30.00
Singapore dollars.

cents to finish at 6.15 Singapore dollars. DelGro 500 retreated 25
cents to close at 5.30 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed today's fall to profit taking after three
consecutive days of gains.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the market looked out for new listings and sized
up the interest rate outlook for the United States.
</P>
<P>
They noted that market focus was on the debut of the Hong Kong
computer monitor maker TPV holdings whose share rose to a high of
1.38 Hong Kong dollars before easing back to finish at 1.19 Hong
Kong dollars, compared to its IPO prices of 1.2019 Hong Kong

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Court Ruling Not End of Pinochet's Extradition Proceeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A British court on Friday ruled
that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet can be extradited to
Spain to face charges of torture and other human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling does not mean Pinochet will be sent to
Spain immediately. Pinochet's laywers are expected to appeal the
ruling. They have 15 days to file an appeal, and Pinochet cannot
be extradited while an appeal is pending.
</P>
<P>
Before the ruling, Pinochet's lawyers had confirmed that they
would appeal to the higher court if Friday's ruling is against the
retired general. They said they would try their most to fight
against the extradition proceeding on any step till the House of
Lords, Britain's Highest Court.
</P>
<P>
And in any case, British Interior Minister (Home Secretary)
Jack Straw must sign all extradition orders and can overrule the
magistrate.
</P>
<P>
Even if the House of Lords ruled against Pinochet, the
extradition must be approved by Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has
the last say on Pinochet's fate. At the final step, Pinochet's
lawyers are expected to ask Jack Straw to block extradition on
grounds of the general's ill health.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested nearly a year ago in a London
hospital where he was recovering from a minor back operation. The
detention was made at the request of a Spanish judge, who accused
that Pinochet was responsible for the deaths and disappearances of
3,000 people during his 17-year rule which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since the detention, a series of hearings had been held in
almost all levels of British courts to decide on whether Pinochet
was liable to the charges.
</P>
<P>
All the previous court rulings to date have focused on the
legality of Pinochet's arrest. The detention was upheld by
Britain's top court in March, although it reduced the charges
against him to those dated after December 1988, when Britain
incorporated an international torture convention into law.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who is currently under house arrest in the southwest
suburb of London, repeatedly denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
He declared on Friday that he was not guilty of allegations of
torture and conspiracy to torture made by Spain.
</P>
<P>
"I declare that I am not guilty of the crimes for which I am
accused," Pinochet said in a statement read by his lawyer Clive
Nicholls in a London court.
</P>
<P>
He was not in the court on Friday to hear the verdict as
British law required. He is excused from attending the verdict on
grounds of ill health. His doctors say he has not yet overcome
the effects of two apparent strokes last month.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Considers Raising Diesel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC)
officials hinted at possible hike in diesel price in the wake of
diesel price rise in India, the Kathmandu Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government on Tuesday increased the diesel price by
35 percent, to Rs 23.15 (0.34 U.S. dollars) per liter. It is the
eighth time since 1997 that India has revised the price of diesel.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of NOC Yuba Raj Sharma said Thursday that
diesel price in Nepal is lower than the international market
price, adding that the international price has increased by 64
percent since April and now stands at 195 U.S. dollars per metric
ton.
</P>
<P>
The price of diesel in the Nepalese market is Rs 15.50 (0.22
U.S. dollars) per liter.
</P>
<P>
But whether and when to increase price will depend on the
ministry level decision, said Sharma.
</P>
<P>
Another NOC high-ranking official said it will be difficult for
Nepal to stick to its old price thereby bearing financial loss in
the context of increasing diesel price in the global market.
</P>
<P>
In the past, NOC has always followed the petroleum price rise
in India, citing the possibility of cross-border smuggling of oil
out to India.
</P>
<P>
NOC presently imports a total of 330,000 metric tons of diesel
annually.

<P>
-- French judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere has decided to launch a
law suit against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for his involvement
in the 1989 bombing attack on a French passenger aircraft in
Africa. The decision was made when France and Libya are about to
have a rapprochement of their relations.
</P>
<P>
-- After the railway disaster on Wednesday in London which
killed 127 people, the British are questioning the privatization

company was carved into about 100 companies.

Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- From 10 to 50 percent of the outcomes of scientific
researches in French universities are stolen each year, resulting

called on students to be more vigilant against scientific spying.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Syria Rejects U.S. Formula for Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Syria has turned down a
recent U.S. formula designed to bypass the current Israeli-Syrian
deadlock on the territorial question hindering the resumption of
peace talks, a local daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton made a direct appeal last week to
Syria that Damascus accept a "hypothetical equation" whereby to
satisfactorily address five key issues raised by Israel in return
for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
The five key issues presented to Damascus included security
arrangements, normalization of relations, and terms for an
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, where Syria is a main power
broker.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Sharaa, who was unexpectedly
invited to a meeting with Clinton during the annual United Nations
General Assembly session at that time, rejected the U.S. formula,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal
from the Golan, a strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East War, as the precondition for the restart of the talks,
which broke off in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Damascus said former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had
made a promise, through then U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, to fully withdraw from the Golan in 1995. It insisted
that the talks be resumed from that point.
</P>
<P>
But Israel claimed that Syria misunderstood Rabin's position,
saying he only raised a hypothetical question on a full Israeli
withdrawal to see what Syria would offer.
</P>
<P>
Following the election victory of Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
July, there has been high hopes that the talks will be resumed
very soon. But the mood of disappointment has been rising in the
last few weeks since the two sides are at odds over how the talks
should be started.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told a joint news
conference with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine, who is on
a visit to the region, Wednesday that Israel is waiting for Syria
to go back to the negotiating table, but it won't accept any
preconditions.

development in Asia.

expansion of understanding and friendship between China and both
their countries, and to create more non-governmental exchanges and

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Stays Committed to UN Peacekeeping Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Friday it
would continue to participate in U.N. peacekeeping missions even
though the United Nations owes the country 60 million ringgit
(about 15.789 million U.S. dollars) for past peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia agrees to participate in such missions because it has
the capacity, Foreign Minister Hamid Albar said here, adding that
Malaysia was aware of the financial problems facing the United
Nations and its inability to provide advance payments for each
mission.
</P>
<P>
"We have operated always on the basis of reimbursement. Once we
commit ourselves to participating in any peacekeeping operation,
we make the necessary financial arrangements," Bernama news agency
quoted him as saying after meeting a youth delegation of a local
political party here.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations faced financial problems because some member
nations had failed to settle their subscriptions to the world
body, the foreign minister said, expressing confidence that the
world body's financial problems could be resolved if the
defaulting countries abided by the formula set by the
organization.

HARARE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has called on Zimbabwe to
normalize the relations between the two countries fighting each
other in conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
since August last year.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by new Rwandan ambassador to Zimbabwe
Joseph Karemera when he presented his credentials to Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Karemera said that he had discussed with President Mugabe the
way "to get out of the problem" in the DRC, the daily Herald
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda sent troops to support rebels in the DRC,
trying to topple DRC President Laurent Kabila, whose government
received assistance from troops of Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and
Chad.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire accord to end the hostilities was signed in the
Zambian capital Lusaka on july 10 by the warring countries.
</P>
<P>
Karemera said his country was committed to ending the war in
the DRC, adding: "We want to make sure that the war stops...
Zimbabwe was doing a lot for Rwanda, training its police and army
and developing economic relations."
</P>
<P>
He said his deployment to Southern Africa was aimed at
normalizing relations between Rwanda and some countries in the
region.

<HEADLINE> SOE Reform Targets Will Be Met, Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
has said that the state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform targets set
by the Party at its recent Central Committee plenary meeting will
be met as planned.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the belief in an interview with "Study Times," a
newspaper launched recently by the Party School of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee. The interview was also
carried in today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
SOE reforms and developments face many challenges, but also
will have many advantages, notably a series of new measures and
policies adopted by the recent CPC Central Committee decision on
major issues concerning the reform and development of SOEs, the
vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the Party unites as one and works in a down-to-
earth manner, the three-year target to become profitable and ten-
year medium-term development objectives set by the decision are
sure to be realized," said Wu, who is also a member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, the SOE reforms and
developments have shown positive development, said the vice-
premier, who is in charge of the country's industries.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, the industrial output by state-owned
and state-holding enterprises rose 7.7 percent over the same
period of last year, and their profits in the first seven months
were 208 percent over the same period of last year. This was
higher than at any time in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The state sector in 24 of the country's 31 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities reported better performance
than last year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Most trades recorded better economic returns, with
petrochemical, machinery and light industrial sectors reporting
sharp rises in profits.
</P>
<P>
People have gained hope from the events and their confidence
has been strengthened, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we unite around the Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at its core, faithfully carry out the spirit of the
Party's Decision, we will achieve new victories in the reform and
development of SOEs," he noted.

<P>
It was learned that companies invested in the zones, either
local or foreign, are entitled to a 10-year free of corporation
tax , 10-year withholding tax holiday, stamp duty exemption and a
100-percent tax deduction on initial investment which can be

<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Airbus and China Aviation
Industry Corporation I (AVIC I) signed an agreement today at the
China International Aviation Exposition to further develop their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to an AVIC I official, today's deal signals another
step in the development of an industrial cooperation program that
was launched in June.
</P>
<P>
Building on a successful history of more than 10 years, the
new program will help to increase both the scale and variety of
the companies' ties, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Chinese engineers will participate in the
development phase of the newly-launched A318. Meanwhile, various
job packages will be provided incrementally by Airbus to give
China the capability to produce wings for A320 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement allows for these job packages, valued at 15
million U.S. dollars, to be offered by Airbus' partner company,
British Aerospace, to the Xi'an Aircraft Industry Group under the
AVIC I, revealed the official.
</P>
<P>
Airbus' cooperation with the Chinese aviation industry began
in the mid-1980s. So far, four Chinese manufacturers in Chengdu,
Guizhou, Shenyang and Xi'an have been involved in making aircraft
parts and maintenance tools for Airbus.

<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 23
others were wounded when a homemade bomb exploded inside a bus
express in a town in the southern Philippines Friday morning, the
Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bus, belonging to the Mindanao Rural Transit Company, was
on its way to the city of Zamboanga from Cagayan de Oro city when
the time bomb went off at 7:40 a.m., the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb with its timing device disguised as one of the cargoes
was placed in the baggage compartment of the bus.
</P>
<P>
Those in serious condition were presently undergoing emergency
treatment at the Zamboanga del Sur Provincial Hospital.

<P>
This was the second bus bombing incident only 17 days after a
powerful home-made bomb exploded on September 21 inside a bus
express killing four members of a family and wounding 41 others.

blockades and embargoes from hostile forces, and China also stood
still when facing various dangers, disasters and wars as well as
challenges during the process of reform and opening up," the
leading newspaper said in the front-page article paying homage to
a half century of China's achievements.
</P>
<P>
It hailed the great accomplishments in the vast country, which
still had some primitive regions just after the founding of the
People's Republic on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
The birth of New China profoundly changed the world's political
pattern as well as the historical trends, the article said.
</P>
<P>
However, the feudal regime left the nation with negligible
economic strength, which was repeatedly diminished by world and
civil wars and also natural disasters, it said.
</P>
<P>
At that time, 70 percent of the total output value was from
agriculture, and only 30 percent came from its fragile industry.
</P>
<P>
The average grain yield was only 1,027.5 kilograms per hectare,
the article said.

Many Western China-watchers predicted that New China would not
survive for long with such a small industrial power, it said. But
after 50 years of painstaking efforts, incredible changes took
place in the world's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
The output of steel in 1998 was 731 times that of 1949, crude
oil 1,341 times, coal 39 times, electric power 271 times, cement
812 times, grain four times, cotton 10 times, oil crops nine times
and aquatic products 87 times.
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998 reached 7.96
trillion yuan (about 959 billion U.S. dollars), 117 times that of
1952. The per capita GDP in 1998 reached 6,404 yuan (about 772 U.S.
dollars), 54 times that of 1952.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, China had ranked seventh in the world in total
economic output, first in the output of major industrial and
agricultural products, tenth in import and export volume, second
in foreign exchange reserve, eighth in the tourism industry and
second in inputting foreign investment, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article underscored the goals reached, especially in the
past 20 years, when China has been carrying out the policy of
reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The GDP leapt to 7.96 trillion yuan from 362.4 billion yuan (43.
7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1979, with an average annual growth
rate of 9.8 percent, allowing for inflation.

While sticking to public ownership as the backbone of the
national economy, China encourages various kinds of economic
elements to work together, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the article hailed the revolutionary heroes, model
workers, scientists, doctors and other people who have made
outstanding contributions in the 50 years' development of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
They represent all the Chinese people for achieving so many
goals, it said.
</P>
<P>
"China's long history and unique culture are the spiritual
foundation for the nation's advancement," it added.
</P>
<P>
The basic explanation for the monumental changes is that the
country is under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (
CPC).
</P>
<P>
After 50 years of exploration and reviewing experiences, the
CPC has established its principled theories and basic lines for
the preliminary stage of socialism, the article said.
</P>
<P>
China's achievements also illustrate the victory of socialism
in the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has made a breakthrough in socialist theory by
combining socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of socialism is to develop productive forces
in order to achieve a good life for all, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The past 50 years of successes only reveal a beginning of even
greater achievements of the Chinese people, it concluded.

<HEADLINE> Food Consumption Drops in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Per capita consumption of almost
all food- stuffs including the staple food maize in Zambia has
drastically fallen over the years, Zambian newspaper, The Post,
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A latest report on "Overcoming Barriers to Zambia's
Development" presented by the United Nations Children's Fund shows
that per capita consumption of maize, the most significant
component in a Zambian meal, had declined "drastically from 153.2
in 1990-1991 to 123.3 kilograms in 1996- 1997.
</P>
<P>
This followed the continued high incidence of poverty and the
population' s general declined incomes, Alex Muyebe, director of
economic and social development project for Jesuit Center for
Theological Reflection (JCTR), was quoted as saying by the paper.
</P>
<P>
He said that the majority of the families were forced to go
without their "habitual" foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The decline had also extended to other food products such as
cereal, vegetable, dairy and meat products, which implied that
dietary intake of calories had reduced and people's nutritional
status also become worse, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Concrete Efforts to Promote SOE Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
has said that concrete steps should be taken to carry out the
policies aimed at reforming State-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Wu made the call in an interview with "Study Times," a
newspaper launched recently by the Party School of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee. The interview was also
carried in today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier pointed to five areas that should be
emphasized in the SOE reform, which represented the central theme
of a recent plenum of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
First, the SOEs should speed up their restructuring and
reorganization so that they can optimize the deposition of and
better manage their resources, which is the prescribed path for
the SOEs' reform and development, said Wu, also member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Second, it is imperative for the SOEs to introduce standard
corporate systems so that they can be transformed into independent
economic entities, having full authority for management and full
responsibility for their own profits or losses.
</P>
<P>
Third, some outstanding problems facing the SOEs should be
solved as soon as possible, Wu said. Some SOEs are overburdened by
heavy liabilities and excess staff, outmoded technology and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, more should be done to promote SOEs' progress and
upgrading of industries, noted the vice-premier, who is in charge
of the country's industries.
</P>
<P>
Key SOEs should establish their own technology development
centers, which would create still more useful technologies and
speed up the transition from high-tech achievements to productive
forces, and;
</P>
<P>
Fifth, a further improved social security system is required so
as to ensure the basic living conditions of those laid-off or
retired SOE workers. This is vital to the country's social
stability and success of SOE reforms, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Tongan King (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today offered
his congratulations on Tonga's representation in the United
Nations, which started in September, and said he hoped that China
and Tonga would cooperate closely in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Tongan King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, Zhu
said that China and Tonga should work together to set up a new
world political and economic order which would safeguard the
interests of developing countries as well as world peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
The king arrived here Wednesday on a state visit at the
invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The king paid an
informal visit to China in 1997. Diplomatic ties were forged
between the two nations on November 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he appreciated the important contribution to bilateral
ties made by the king, who decided to normalize relations. He also
thanked the other members of the royal family for their assistance
in this effort.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, Zhu noted,
bilateral ties have steadily progressed, and cooperation in
economic, trade, and cultural sectors have made a good beginning.
The trade agreement signed between the two governments during this
visit would undoubtedly push forward such a cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The king said Tonga and China share similar histories of
upheaval, and Tonga is happy about China's great achievements in
the past years through the united efforts of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan is a province of China, and no foreign
force should interfere in the issue, which is totally a domestic
affair of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he appreciated Tonga's "one China" position and its
decision not to have any official contact with Taiwan. He also
thanked the king for Tonga's support to China on Taiwan-related
issues at the South Pacific Forum.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Blamed for Drop in Lebanese-Syrian Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese and Syrian businessmen
are complaining that rampant smuggling across the border has
caused the sharp drop in trade between the two countries, the
Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which normally sells goods worth more than 270 million
U.S. dollars to Lebanon each year, saw export drop by 30.8
percent in the first eight months this year.
</P>
<P>
In August alone, Syria's export to Lebanon fell by 25.5
percent to 17.8 million dollars from 23.9 million dollars in the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's export to Syria in the first eight months this year
fell to 17.2 million dollars compared with 20 million dollars in
the same period last year, a drop of 17.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nasri Khoury, secretary-general of the Lebanese-Syrian Trade
Committee, admitted that smuggling is still one of the problems
facing both countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that foreign-made goods are also being smuggled from
Lebanon to Syria in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
Feras Shammas, a Syrian trader and industrialist, said that
some 100,000 people cross the border each day and that many of
them smuggle goods in their cars.
</P>
<P>
Khoury predicted that Lebanon and Syria will come up with a
formula to combat smuggling.
</P>
<P>
A free-trade deal between Lebanon and Syria, excluding
agricultural goods, went into effect in January.

<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda has predicted that his United National Independence party
(UNIP) will emerge a formidable and rejuvenated opposition ready
to take on the ruling Movement for Multi-Democracy (MMD) in the
2001 polls.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia quoted him as saying on Thursday in central
city Kabwe that UNIP National Council, which started meeting in
the city on Friday, would make every endeavor to iron out its
internal squabbles.
</P>
<P>
On the call by some party members for the disbanding of the
UNIP Central Committee, Kaunda said those were simply expressing
their opinions.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional amendments adopted in 1996 do not allow
those with foreign parentage and those who have already served two
five-year terms of the presidency to stand for elections any more.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 elections, Kaunda was barred from contesting
because he was born of Malawian parents and ruled the country for
27 years from Zambia's independence in 1964 to 1991, when he was
defeated by the current President Frederick Chiluba.

<HEADLINE> New Stars to Shine in Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, China, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The younger gymnasts will
take the limelight at the 1999 Gymnastics World Championships, a
Ukraine team official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Be prepared to hear new names and to see new stars," said
Ludmila Tourischevfa, president of the National Gymnastics
Federation of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The host China names a line-up for the event with an average
age of 20 for the men and 16 for the women while other leading
gymnastics countries, like the women's defending team champion
Romania, also sent their inexperienced debutants.
</P>
<P>
The United States had a women's team stronger than many people
expected for an 18-year-old averaging age.
</P>
<P>
"The competition will be very tough for all participants. I
feel that the younger gymnasts will challenge the medals and
titles," said Tourischevfa, also a former Olympic and world all-
around champions.
</P>
<P>
As veteran Claudia Presecan absent for a shoulder injury, the
championship favorites Romania came to Tianjin with many news and
yang faces. Apart from Simona Amanar and Corinna Ungureanu who
have competed in previous world championships, the other Romanians
have never taken part in any senior major event.
</P>
<P>
However, Adrian Stan, the Britain national coach, still
predicted that Romania and China will joined Russia to be the hot
contenders for the women's team title as well.
</P>
<P>
"I think that Romania, Russia and China are the ones who will
be on the podium," Stan said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Top University Admits 4,000 Above Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Makerere University, the best
and largest university in Uganda, has admitted 12,000 students for
private sponsorship in the current academic year, 4000 above the
limit, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
An official at the administration said Thursday that he did
not expect all the admitted students to take up their places. The
actual number would be determined after the registration exercise
at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
The university's Vice Chancellor John Sebuwufu recently
revealed that the 77-year-old university had reached saturation
stage and could not admit more than 8,000 private students as the
university faces acute space shortage.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government only sponsors 2,000 students in its
biggest sponsorship reform ever in the history of the institution.
</P>
<P>
Makerere University is one of the best university in east
Africa. Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and incumbent
President Benjamin Mkapa both studied in the university.

<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to proceed
with the opening of the formal peace talks scheduled for October
25, the Philippine News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MILF announced withdrawing from the planned formal
peace talks following series of encounters with the military in
the southern Philippine province of Maguindanao starting September
26.
</P>
<P>
The gunbattle had prompted the government and the MILF to hold
an emergency meeting in Maguindanao Tuesday, during which they
came up with an immediate implementation of the cessation of
hostilities by both the military and the MILF forces and a
proposed punishment to their respective forces who violated the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the two sides signed a second joint
acknowledgment of the five MILF camps to fully implement the
cessation of hostilities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Those acknowledged were Camps Bilal based in Lanao del Sur and
Lanao del Norte; Camp Rajamuda in Cotabato; Camps Darapanan in
Omar and Badir, all of which are in Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
The conditions which the acknowledgment was subject to were:
first, the size and position of the camps shall be limited to the
areas where the MILF rebels are actually situated; second, the
acknowledgment shall be effective only on the duration of the
peace talks; third, concerned government agencies will be
consulted in the verification of the said areas; finally,
government agencies and the MILF should work to avoid any further
armed confrontations.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis incidences have
been rising in Russia's Far Eastern Primorye region at an annual
rate of about 10 percent with mortality there twice as high as the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the region warned Friday that the spread of the
infectious disease is approaching epidemics, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported in a dispatch from Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
According to the press service of the regional administration,
the annual growth of new tuberculosis cases has been 8-10 percent,
exceeding the national level by 1.4 times this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of tuberculosis cases among teenagers has jumped 47

children will be commissioned this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Riots Continue in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The week-long riots in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, have spread to Haruku and
Saparua Islands on Friday, leaving one killed and six others
injured, according to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were shot by security personnel and others
were injured by hand-made bombs and sharp weapons.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out early this week after a civilian was shot
dead by an unidentified person.
</P>
<P>
One day later, some security personnel led the mass to torch
civilian houses in Batu Merah Dalam in Ambon, which prompted
further riots in the region.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, Antara reported, the widespread rioting in the
eastern Indonesian province has claimed 27 lives and wounded 101
others.
</P>
<P>
Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina has urged Maluku chief of
police Col. Bugis Saman and Chief of the Military Command Brig.
Gen. Max Tamaela to determine which security personnel used their
guns to shoot civilians.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslims and Christian groups
since mid-January this year.
</P>
<P>
Local religious figures, along with the military, had tried to
reconcile the warring camps but clashes broke out again in
mid-July, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims, but Maluku
is a predominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> ADB Focuses on Poverty Alleviation in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has worked out a new strategy for Nepal identifying
sustainable reduction of poverty as its overarching goal,
according to a news release issued here Friday by the ADB's Nepal
Resident Mission.
</P>
<P>
The news release presented the ADB's New Country Operational
Strategy (COS) for Nepal, which will guide the bank's future
development assistance to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
According to the new strategy, the goal of poverty alleviation
is to be realized through creating employment opportunities,
particularly in the rural areas, and through improving basic
social services to enhance human development.
</P>
<P>
Protecting and improving he environment to sustain benefits
from development is also an important aspect for achieving the
goal under the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's allocation of resources to Nepal in 1999 will be 50
million U.S. dollars, compared with 105 million dollars in 1998,
27 million in 1997 and 250 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement is fluctuated, because it depended on the
implementation of the ADB's plans by the country, said Richard
Vokes, ADB resident representative in Nepal, who issued the press
release.
</P>
<P>
Vokes said the implementation of the plan in Nepal is not
satisfactory because of weak governance, as reflected by the lack
of efficiency, predictability, transparency and accountability in
key public and market institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government should boost revenues and use the assistance in
the most effective way, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the news release, Nepal's human development and
overall socio-economic development has been limited and lags well
behind that in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is reflected in the low per capita income, widespread and
persistent poverty and low socio-economic indicators," said the
news release.
</P>
<P>
"Development progress achieved so far has not been commensurate
with past investments," it said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, building effective institutions for effecting
socio-economic development is the core of the new strategy, it
added.
</P>
<P>
"The new strategy emphasizes that institutional capacity
building to maximize and sustain development impact of investments
must take preference over levels of assistance," said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
To ensure more effective utilization of the bank's limited
resources, the new COS calls for a sharper focus on fewer key
sectors of assistance.
</P>
<P>
It has identified the following 10 sectors for its support:
agriculture, irrigation, roads, power, finance, basic education,
health, water supply and sanitation, environment improvement and
natural resources management.
</P>
<P>
As one of the poorest countries in the world, Nepal relies
heavily on foreign aid. About 60 percent of its development funds
come from donors. With per capita annual income at 200 dollars,
about 42 percent of the country's 22 million population live below
the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Most Americans Dissatisfied with Healthcare System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 7 (Xinhua) -- One out of three Americans
says the U.S. healthcare system is "either critically or
terminally ill," and about one-half say the system is "somewhat
ill," according to a survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
When asked to grade the current system, almost half of the 1,
500 adults surveyed give it a D or an F for failure to control the
costs. The public also gives the system low marks -- 39 percent, D
or F -- on putting the needs of patients before the economic
interests of the health industry.
</P>
<P>
The study was commissioned by Community Voice, a five-year
initiative launched by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, a non-profit
organization.
</P>
<P>
The public holds the insurance industry responsible for driving
up the costs. Eighty-five percent agree that "much of the expense
of healthcare in this country is created by insurance bureaucracy.
" One out of four says their insurance company has refused to pay
for services they felt were needed.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of those surveyed say that managed care programs
have decreased the quality of healthcare. Half say managed care
plans have blocked access to preventive care, such as
immunizations and routine exams.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau released new figures on Monday revealing
that 44.3 million Americans or 16.3 percent of the U.S. population,
are uninsured. In fact, according to Community Voice, over 70
million people in the United States have no health insurance or
receive inadequate health and dental care. "The underserved
include working poor, individuals or families who receive public
assistance and those who lack any adequate health insurance,"
Community Voice said. "The hardest to reach populations include
those living in poor urban and rural areas, immigrants, Native
Americans and the homeless."
</P>
<P>
The survey makes it clear that there is a serious public
discontent with the status quo of healthcare in the country,
especially for low-income families and individuals, Community
Voice said. Almost half give the system a D or an F for providing
access to care to low-income individuals and families.
</P>
<P>
Two out of three support establishing a new department in the
federal government to provide health insurance for unemployed and
low-income working people, according to the survey.

</P>
<P>
"We will seek the Prime Minister's approval before taking steps
towards preparing the campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Bangkok Metropolitan agreed to bid for the
Olympics 2008, but according to the Olympic Charter, a city which
wants to hold the Games must conduct a public hearing and get
government approval before launching its campaign.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Metropolitan would conduct the public hearing after
securing the prime minister's backing.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study would be prepared afterwards, Chettha said.
</P>
<P>
OCT is required to submit a letter of intent to the
International Olympic Committee before February 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said a budget of about 100 billion baht (2.5 billion U.
S.dollars) is needed to stage the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I think the government should not be concerned about the
financial side of it because the budget allocated by the
government will be mainly spent on constructing infrastructure,
such as roads, expressways and the athletes' village," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped it will not seriously affect the government,
because the OCT has a clear-cut policy on the budget issue and a
private public company will be set up to take responsibility of
budget matters.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Sign Forward Willis, General Manager Grunwald </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- On the same day he signed a
four-year contract extension, Toronto Raptors general manager Glen
Grunwald re-signed Kvwin Willis to a two-year deal today.
</P>
<P>
A 37-year-old veteran who plays forward and center, Willis
today inked a deal that is believed to be worth $6.1 million.
</P>
<P>
Toronto's general manager since November, Grunwald will remain
in that role through the new season with his new pact.
</P>
<P>
All the time Grunwald and Willis spent trying to imporve this
youthful squad paid off last season as Toronto was on the verge of
reaching the playoffs for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Raptors ended the abbreviated 50-game season with a 23-27
record and
finished just four games back of the postseason berth in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
Willis led the team in rebounding last season at 8.3 per game,
and was third in scoring with 12.0 points per contest. He also
became just the 17th player in NBA history to surpass 15,000
points and 10,000 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
In 15 NBA seasons, Willis has averaged 14.2 points and 9.6
boards in 1,063 games with Atlanta, Miami, Golden State, Houston
and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Grunwald joined the Raptors as vice president of legal affairs
and assistant general manager in November, nearly one year before
the team played its first NBA game.
</P>
<P>
He became the general manager on the same day the team
announced Isiah Thomas resigned as the team's executive vice
president and sold his nine percent ownership stake to majority
owner Allan Slaight.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Expected to Rise 7.6 Percent this Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of China's
economy is projected to surpass the a 7-percent target set early
this year, with the gross domestic product (GDP) rising about 7.6
percent for the year, according to today's China Securities.
</P>
<P>
The economy is also expected to maintain a growth rate between
7.5-8 percent in 2000, the paper said, quoting a recent report
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The report says that in 1999, agriculture is expected to grow
some 3.5 percent, industry about nine percent and the service
sector slightly above seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Total fixed-asset investment is projected to reach 3,130
billion yuan this year and 3,410 billion yuan next year, growing
10.3 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, social retails sales are expected to
grow 10 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, in 1999 and 2000
while imports are forecast to outgrow exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile it still sees a positive growth momentum in export,
saying that there would still be trade surplus in the two years
under review.
</P>
<P>
The report based the optimistic forecast on the Chinese
government's policies to stimulate domestic demand that it says
has helped effectively maintain the economic growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for efforts to properly settle the relations
between income and distribution, and between production and supply,
as well as other issues that need comprehensive measures to
strengthen the government's macro-economic control.

<HEADLINE> Refugees, Migration, Anti-Racism Top in Agenda at EU Meeting: Finnish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Finnish Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen told the press here Thursday that the most
important topics for discussion at the European Union summit
meeting will be the coordination of the EU refugee policy,
migration and anti-racism.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting, which will be held by Finland, the EU
rotating Presidency, in Tampere October 15-16, will also discuss
the temporary reception of refugees, organized crime and the
coordination of legal systems, Lipponen said at a press conference
after meeting Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima.
</P>
<P>
He said anti-racism observation posts will supervise EU member
states to a certain degree.
</P>
<P>
Regarding intense responses by some countries to the Austrian
Freedom Party's success in the national election, Lipponen said
the EU will not comment on the composition of the Austrian
government. It is an Austrian internal affair.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the Austrian election demonstrates that
the EU must make greater efforts to deal with migration and
refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Klima severely criticized Israeli
Prime Minister David Levy's accusations.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal President Thomas Klestil also refuted some
foreign countries' charges regarding the results of the Austrian
national election.
</P>
<P>
Israel warned Wednesday that it would re-assess its relations
with Vienna if a far-right party, which emerged victoriously in
the national election, was included in the new coalition.

<HEADLINE> Europe Should Establish Its Own Forces: Italian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Europe should build up its own
military capabilities and create a professional force, so the bloc
can carry out peace missions and humanitarian intervention without
relying on the U.S., Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a meeting for his newly-published book on
the Kosovo War, which was attended by Wesley Clark, the NATO's
supreme commander in Europe and Bernard Kouchner, the United
Nations special representative for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema criticized Europe's military capabilities for being
under-developed. Building up Europe's own military force would not
affect the strong ties between Europe and the U.S., he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo War highlighted the "superiority of American
military technology," noting that "at the moment, Europe is
incapable of conducting operations like that in Kosovo without the
help and support of the U.S."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's book, entitled "Kosovo, The Italians and the War," is
based on an Italian journalist's interview with the premier.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who was also present at
the launch of the book, said later that "Serbia is the most
important part of the Balkans and therefore must be included in
the Stability Pact."

<HEADLINE> Italian KGB Spy Scandal Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A scandal over allegations that a
number of high-ranking Italians acted as spies for the KGB during
the Cold War widened Thursday, after a former defense minister
said that he had known about the existence of the spy ring while
in office.
</P>
<P>
Beniamino Andreatta said in a radio interview: "It's completely
obvious that a defense minister is informed about important
documents that are in the hands of the intelligence service."
</P>
<P>
The ex-minister was referring to the so-called Mitrokhin file
containing numerous documents detailing KGB activity in Britain,
Italy, France and other European countries and transcribed by
former KGB agent Vasil Mitrokhin, who smuggled the file out of
Moscow when he defected to the West and handed it over to British
intelligence in 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, while Andreatta was
defense minister in the previous government headed by Romano Prodi
(1996-1998), the British gave a copy of the file to their Italian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
But Andreatta's words raised doubts about repeated statements
from Prodi, including one released Thursday night, that he knew
nothing about the matter whilst premier.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said that "I don't know anything about the premier.
All I can say is that when the material arrived, it was examined
by myself and General Siracusa (then the head of the military
intelligence service Sismi)."
</P>
<P>
"We concluded that the material had little validity in terms of
the security of the facts alleged," he said.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta refused to say whether he had informed Prodi or not
but many observers here charged that it was impossible for the
head of government not to have known if the defense minister knew.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's statement from Prodi, now the European
Commission President, said that: "Given the growing debate and
controversy about the list of presumed KGB spies contained in the
so-called Mitrokhin archive, Romano Prodi and Enrico Micheli (then
undersecretary to the premier's office) confirm what they said
some days ago, that they knew nothing about any Mitrokhin
documents either directly or indirectly."
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has come under increasing pressure to
reveal what it knows about KGB activities in Italy, since it was
revealed that 261 Italians allegedly worked for the KGB, including
top state officials, unionists and journalists.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the hard-right National Alliance demanded
Thursday that Premier Massimo D'Alema resign over the scandal and
that the high-ranking Italians on the KGB spy list be tried for
treason.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Foreign Office said Thursday that it
could not reveal the exact date when the Mitrokhin file was handed
over to the Italian secret services.
</P>
<P>
Details from the archive were published last month in The
Mitrokhin Archive, a book written by Mitrokhin and British
journalist Christopher Andrew, and have triggered scandals in a
number of other countries, starting with Britain.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Teak Export Sharply Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported 130,000
cubic-meters of teak in the first four months of this year,
earning 68.75 million U.S. dollars, according to the latest
figures published by the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The export volume and earnings respectively increased by 158.8
percent and 121 percent compared with the same period of last
year, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar also exported 149,565.5 cubic-meters of
hardwood in the first four months of this year, earning 10.4
million dollars of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also indicate that Myanmar exported 133,717.5
cubic-meters of teak in 1998, earning 94.65 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures of the Myanmar Ministry of Forestry show that the
country's forest area is reducing year by year. The percentage of
coverage by forest in the country dropped to 50 percent at the end
of 1998, falling by 7 percent compared with 36 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The cause of forest depletion was attributed to indiscriminate
felling and cutting of trees including firewood plantations for
fuel and burning of charcoal.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out projects for greening the arid
districts, under which revival of firewood plantations is among
the measures taken.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and the European
Union (EU) began the eighth and possibly last phase of talks on a
free trade treaty here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hoped to settle unresolved issues regarding taxes
and rules of origin at the seven-day meeting, so the accord could
be signed at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, Mexico's media suspects that it may become necessary
to call for a new round of talks at the beginning of next year, so
the treaty may not go into effect until the spring of next year.
</P>
<P>
Highly sensitive Mexican product sectors, such as cars,
textiles and shoes, and metal-mechanical sectors, have indicated
the possibility of ruling out the document in case the European
delegation doesn't satisfy their expectations.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU is Mexico's second largest trading partner,
while the United States is still the destination of 85 percent of
Mexico's exports.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's two-way trade with the EU in the first five months of
this year reached 7.73 billion U.S. dollars, while trade with the
United States is expected to reach 200 billion dollars by the end
of this year.

<P>
QUITO, October 7 (Xinhua)-- The Guagua Pichincha Volcano,
located some 10 kilometers west of Quito, Ecuador, has entered a
state of open eruption, Ecuadorian volcanologist Hugo Yepez said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Early signs of the eruption were observed on September 30 when
the surface dome of the volcano started to move and collapse, said
Yepez, director of the Geophysical Institute of the National
Polytechnic of Ecuador (IGPN).
</P>
<P>
The full eruption of the volcano occurred at 7:06 a.m. Thursday
when a huge mushroom cloud formed. Volcanic ash soared to the
height of some 20,000 meters. Many Quito residents came to the
streets to enjoy this rare and magnificent sight, Yepez said.
</P>
<P>
According to an IGPN observation report, the smoke column
lasted about ten minutes before it was dispersed by the strong
wind, and the remaining volcanic ash started to float eastward at
a speed of more than 50 kilometers per hour.
</P>

Located in the northern part of Ecuador, the Guagua Pichincha
Volcano is 4,794 meters in elevation and erupts once every 360

<HEADLINE> Breathing Fresh Air into Traditional Chinese Music (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese folk music is like many
other traditional arts in China that it has been affected by
modern civilization and has become less popular among the younger
generation. A recent survey shows that 84 percent of Chinese
teenagers prefer pop music.
</P>
<P>
But, some young people are still interested in Chinese folk
music and in bringing new ideas to the field. Hu Yiying is one of
them.
</P>
<P>
Hu organized a band using traditional instruments called "Voice
of the Phoenix" with four other girls. She says she's looking for
a way to combine Chinese folk music with pop music to form her own
style.
</P>
<P>
She took first prize for pop songs at this year's Competition
for Promising Singers. A judge there said that he was impressed
with the synthesis.
</P>
<P>
Hu lives in the '90s but she grew up with traditional music.
She got her first erhu, a traditional stringed instrument, from
her father at the age of five. Now, 20 years later she's an erhu
player at a time when most Chinese youth like pop music and
consider Chinese folk music somewhat hard to understand.

Hu was born in Wenzhou, a city in the coastal Zhejiang Province,
and was enrolled in the Chinese Music Academy's preparatory school
in Beijing at the age of 14. Her parents were both in the field of
music and hoped that she could realize their dreams.
</P>
<P>
She decided to start "Voice of the Phoenix" right after
graduating from the Academy, while working as a solo erhu player
with the National Song and Dance Ensemble, a major ensemble. Then,
when her band "Voice of the Phoenix" got its first chance to
perform publicly her mother came to Beijing and gave her great
support and courage, Hu says.
</P>
<P>
They did have a great deal of financial difficulty at the
beginning, she points out, but still refused to perform in hotels
or restaurants and hoped to keep their pure sound and quality.
</P>
<P>
"Voice of the Phoenix" has held several concerts over the past
two years, and soon distinguished themselves from other art groups
in Beijing. Hu says that she and the members of the group regard
music as a major part of their lives and see the media as a way to
show themselves and communicate with others.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Wireless location services
will be a big business in the United States in a few years, said a
report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. market research firm "Strategis Group" predicted in the
report that revenues from location-based wireless consumer
services are expected to rise more than 100-fold, from less than
30 million U.S. dollars this year to 3.9 billion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, key commercial services enabled by
wireless location technology include emergency roadside assistance,
traffic and navigation information, location-sensitive billing,
and "enhanced 411" information services which provide phone
numbers and addresses, business telephone numbers and locations,
even movie locations and show time.
</P>
<P>
The Strategis Group's survey revealed that U.S. consumers are
not only interested in location-based wireless services, but also
willing to pay for these services.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
mandated that wireless carriers must deploy technologies that can
locate wireless users who call the emergency 911 by October 2001.
Strategis said that the commission's five-year mandate will result
in a dramatic deployment of location technologies, far faster than
the market would achieve without regulatory intervention.
</P>
<P>
Once these technologies are deployed, the report said, location-
specific wireless services will represent a significant revenue
opportunity for wireless carriers.

<HEADLINE> West Ham Cleared by UEFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club West Ham United have been cleared to carry on playing in the
UEFA Cup despite fielding Igor Stimac, who was ineligible, against
Osijek during their first-round win.
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary board of European football's governing body
met on Thursday and cleared the club after a complaint by the
Croatian side over the Hammers' decision to play Stimac, who
should have been serving a two-match ban stretching back to 1995.
</P>
<P>
West Ham won the two-legged tie 6-1 on aggregate. UEFA have,
however, banned Stimac for the two legs of the second-round tie
against Steaua Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The dispute surrounded Stimac, who, when with Croatian side
Hajduk Split, was hit with a two-match ban after being sent off in
a European game against Panathinaikos.
</P>
<P>
UEFA admit they forgot about the defender's punishment and say
they only remembered it following the complaint by Osijek.
</P>
<P>
"It is normal procedure that, at the start of a competition,
UEFA provides all member associations with a list of players who
are suspended," read an official statement.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, The Football Association received such a list
but due to a technical error in our competition system, Igor
Stimac's name didn't appear on the list which was passed on from
the association to West Ham United.
</P>
<P>
"Even though it was West Ham's responsibility to ensure that
all of their players were eligible, the UEFA Control and
Disciplinary concluded at today's meeting in Zurich that "the
English club has acted in good faith".
</P>
<P>
Osijek president Antun Novalic had said: "West Ham are not that
good without Stimac and if he hadn't played maybe these games
would have turned out differently. We hope that UEFA will do
something about it."
</P>
<P>
A West Ham spokesman said: "As far as we are concerned we have
not done anything wrong. UEFA sent out a list of suspensions at
the start of the season and Igor Stimac's name was not on it."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Laili Ali, the second-
youngest of Muhammad Ali's nine children, will make her
professional boxing debut at Turning Stone Casino on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Laila said Thursday that she would knock out her opponent April
Fowler.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to knock her out," Laila said. "I'm coming to knock
somebody out, not just to win. Tomorrow is going to be a very
exciting day for me."
</P>
<P>
The fight will be staged in a 2,600-seat auditorium and 2,000
tickets have already sold out.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, 27, who lost her first and only professional bout seven
months ago, said:"That's just a name to me. She's never been in
the ring. I'm not getting in the ring with her father, I'm getting
in the ring with her."
</P>
<P>
Laila said her mother, Veronica, the third of Muhammad Ali's
four wives, would be there, but she wasn't sure whether Ali would.
</P>
<P>
"I would like my father to be here, but it goes two ways," said
the 21-year-old Laila, who operates a nail salon in Los Angeles in
her spare time. "My father doesn't want me to get hurt, but he
never once told me not to box," Laila said.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Urges EU to Help Clear Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Thursday
urged member nations of the European Union to help the Italian
magistrate clear up the mysterious 1980 crash of an Italian
airliner northwest of Sicily in which 81 people lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, EU Humanitarian Aid
Commissioner Poul Nielson, who spoke to the European Parliament
Thursday in an urgent debate on the tragedy, said that "the
Commission asks the member states to collaborate with Italian
authorities to clarify the causes of the disaster," known as the
Ustica disaster from the name of the island near which the plane
crashed.
</P>
<P>
Nielson added that the executive "deplores the tragedy" of
Ustica and "hopes that the investigation of the Italian
authorities are fair and transparent."
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament also issued an appeal to EU nations and
the United States to help Italian magistrates get to the bottom of
the Ustica riddle.
</P>
<P>
In an urgent resolution, approved by a wide margin, the
European Parliament members asked "all the states concerned,
starting with those directly cited in the judicial papers, to
furnish all the collaboration necessary to the Italian magistrate
to permit a definitive conclusion of the investigation."
</P>
<P>
On August 31 an Italian judge ended a nine-year probe, hampered
by cover-ups and lack of cooperation inside and outside Italy by
filing nine indictments against top Italian air-force officers,
essentially for the obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
The 5,400-page report presented by the Roman investigating
judge, Rosario Priore, mentioned as one hypothesis that the
airliner was caught up in an "act of undeclared war" in which the
target of what he said was an "international police operation"
could well have been Libyan leader Muammar Gheddafi.
</P>
<P>
The judge said there were at least six fighter planes in the
area, two French ones and four American ones, including two F-104s
near the airliner, and that an unidentified plane, possibly a
Libyan Mig fighter, appeared next to the DC-9 not long after take
off.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released just before Priore's report came out,
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Italy was looking at
ways of trying to pin down the "definitive ascertainment of the
truth, also as regards our NATO allies."
</P>
<P>
The first step in this direction was taken on September 4 when
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said sections of Priore's
report concerning the U.S. and France were sent to them, asking
for their "comments, views and their truth."
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can provide new clarification of this obscure
affair on which we have been trying to throw light for all these
long years," Dini said, "but we still may not be at the
conclusion."

workforce puts more pressures on inflation.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 7 (Xinhua)-- The intense
confrontations between paramilitaries and several guerrilla groups
in Colombia left around 50 dead, authorities said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The situation in colombia's southern department of Bolivar is
so bad, that several officials from the local administration had
to leave town because they feared being killed.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said intense fightings between right-wing

<HEADLINE> Draft Resolution on East Timor under Consideration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A draft resolution to
endorse U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's plan for a U.N.
transitional administration in East Timor (UNTAET) has been under
consideration by Security Council members, sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The draft, circulated by Britain, requests Annan to take
immediate steps to prepare for the earliest possible deployment of
all components of UNTAET, including the military component of up
to 9100 troops and a police unit of 1640 officers.
</P>
<P>
The circulation coincided with the Council's meeting Thursday
to start discussing Annan's report submitted to the Council on
October 4 for the establishment of UNTAET in preparation for East
Timor's transition to independence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission, projected to last tow to three years, will
take charge of all aspects of the territory's administration and
will be entitled to exercising all legislative and executive
authority.
</P>
<P>
No Council vote on the draft has been set and no cost has been
given for the mission. However, it would not be put into vote in
two weeks, the minimum time required by the U.S. Congress which
takes up the issue of any new peacekeeping operation only after a
prior notice of 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The military component would replace the multinational force
authorized by a Council resolution on September 15 to restore
peace and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The force, now numbering 3,700, is composed of 14 countries
with a projection to total 8000 troops whose costs would be borne
by contributing countries.
</P>
<P>
The takeover is not expected to take place until December or
early next year as the UNTAET would be in place only after
constitutional changes have been made by Indonesia whose
legislative body is expected to revoke this month or early
November East Timor's status as an Indonesian province set in
1976.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Main Stock Markets Continue to Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) - Europe's three main stock markets
closed sharply higher Thursday boosted by overnight strength in
the US market and rate freeze by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 was 82 points or 1.3 percent higher at
6179.10, 50 points off its session high after the Bank of England
left its interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eurotop 300, a pan-European gauge of the broader
market mood, was up 0.6 percent as telecoms stocks jumped almost 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Telecom shares remained the bedrock of London's gain as the
sector accounted for the top three FTSE 100 gainers.
</P>
<P>
Orange made solid progress, climbing 88p to 1312 as takeover
speculation was ignited by the recent spate of mega-mergers in the
US telecoms market.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax index rose more than 1 percent on the session,
relieved that the European Central Bank did not raise interest
rates. The Dax closed 1.23 percent higher at 5419.31 points.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in Paris closed higher along with other European
bourses in a relieved response to the ECB decision to leave
interest rates unchanged.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide New Financial Help to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Thursday plans to spend up to 50-60 million U.S. dollars during
the next 18 months to support Kosovo's reconstruction and economic
recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent decision by the board of executive
directors, the first tranche of 25 million dollars will be made
available from the bank's net income, and will be provided to
Kosovo on grant terms, the World Bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank's new strategy, outlined in a Transition Support
Strategy Paper approved Thursday, describes the latest assessment
of the damage caused to homes, businesses, and infrastructure
during NATO's bombing in Kosovo, as well as the post-conflict
challenges of reconstruction and recovery.
</P>
<P>
"This welcome new strategy allows us to help Kosovo with its
reconstruction efforts, and eventually pave the way for the
province to embark on a transition process towards a modern,
market economy," said Christian Portman, the bank's coordinator
for Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Transition Support Strategy Paper describes three
priority activities for the World Bank in the overall
reconstruction and recovery program for Kosovo: aid
coordination, policy and technical advice, and financial
support.

<HEADLINE> Russian Spy Agency Denies Hacking Pentagon Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Intelligence
Service (SVR) on Thursday denied any involvement in the hacking of
computer networks of the U.S. Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"That would be clumsy work for Russia's secret services," SVR
spokesman Boris Labusov said in comments on the possible
involvement of Russian computer hackers in a Pentagon computer
breakdown, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
reportedly told a Senate subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that
Russian hackers had gotten access to classified information
retrieved from U.S. military computer networks.
</P>
<P>
"The West had written for decades about how clever KGB and
Soviet intelligence were. Do they think we have become so stupid
now?" he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman hinted that the operation might have
been masterminded by the "secret services of third countries that
used Moscow addresses to hide their tracks."
</P>
<P>
"There are enough foreign embassies in Moscow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Russian intelligence veterans as saying that
the Americans are focussing on Russian cyberhacking in order to
distract attention from their own recent failures.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Health Protection Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House finally
approved Thursday a sweeping health protection bill, giving
patients more new rights in dealing with their health insurance
companies, including a controversial new right to file lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
The vote, 275-151, came after intense lobbying on both sides of
the Democratic and Republican Party, including President Bill
Clinton, who phoned lawmakers from Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
"It is time we asked the insurance industry to be responsible
for its actions," said Republican Representative Charlie Norwood,
who joined with Democrats to push the White House-backed bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows patients to sue Health Managed Organizations
(HMOs) in federal or state court and to collect whatever damages a
jury might award.
</P>
<P>
Federal law now effectively bans such lawsuits for millions of
Americans, even if they are injured or die because of an HMO's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the House rejected, by a vote of 238-193, a
Republican-backed patient protection bill that included new rights
to sue, but only in federal court and only in limited
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
For two years, Democrats have put the Republican Party on the
defensive over the politically popular health protection issue.
</P>
<P>
The House bill passed Thursday must be reconciled with a
considerably more limited version already approved by the Senate.
The Senate bill has no new rights to sue and excludes many
Americans from other patient protections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits Using Concrete Bombs Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
admitted that it had used concrete-fill bomb instead of explosives
in attacks on air defense systems in northern Iraq, hoping thus
could avoid condemnation by minimizing civilian casualties around
Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
"We've been using them for a long time," Gen Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations said the concrete
bombs made little difference as they were still killing Iraqi
civilians, and they were part of "an aggression which should
stop."
</P>
<P>
The concrete bombs used by U.S. warplanes patrolling no-fly
zones in Iraq was disclosed by the New York Times on Thursday,
which said that U.S. fighter jets had begun filling bombs with
concrete instead of explosives to minimize civilian casualties
when they targets military installations near populated areas.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman, confirming the New York Times report,
said: "There are occasions when we use explosives and occasions
when we use concrete -- there are certain targets where we want
to minimize collateral damage."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the New York Times report, Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Saeed Hasan, said it was "recognition by the United
States that its bombs are killing Iraqi civilians."
</P>
<P>
"Where it is concrete bombs, explosive bombs, depleted
uranium bombs, they are bombs killing Iraqi civilians," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They are part of an aggression, a part of a military
campaign against an independent country, a use of force without
any authorization by the Security Council By all means it is an
aggression which should stop," he said, adding that many members
of the Security Council opposed the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Sanctions on Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that it
supports international sanctions against Afghanistan's Taliban
leadership as proposed by the United States in a draft U.N.
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which was proposed by the U.S. several days ago at
the U.N., calls for "the introduction of sanctions against the
Taliban leadership as this movement supports international
terrorism and has given refuge to well-known terrorist Osama bin
Laden in Afghanistan," Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden was accused of masterminding the bombing of two U.S.
embassies in Africa. He has also been accused of funding Islamic
extremists based in Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. draft also expressed concern about international
interference in Afghanistan's affairs and calls for "excluding the
involvement of foreign servicemen in combat operations in
Afghanistan and arms supplies to that country," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow fully supports the draft and urged the U.N.
Security Council to "take measures to exclude the use of the
Afghan territory controlled by the Taliban for training and
strengthening the terrorists," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Rakhmanin said a group of leading American
experts in international terrorism is expected to arrive in Moscow
in mid-October to "enhance the level of cooperation in this area."
</P>
<P>
A Russian delegation comprised of representatives of the
Interior Ministry, the Federal Security Service and the Foreign
Intelligence Service is in the United States discussing ways of
combating international terrorism with American colleagues,
Interfax said.
