<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Joint Efforts to Revive Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
called for intensified efforts by parties concerned to bring the
deadlocked Middle East peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a message conveyed to Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein by Egyptian Ambassador to Jordan Hani Riyad
during his meeting with the Jordanian ruler at the Royal Court
here.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Mubarak briefed Abdullah on the outcome of his
recent visit to the United States and France aimed at breaking the
deadlock in the Mideast peace process, Jordan's official news
agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to Washington, Mubarak said that there was an
American understanding of the importance of resuming peace talks
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said that the prevailing conditions in the
region provided an opportunity to revive the peace process, and
joint support must be provided to the resumption of peace talks
between Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was apparently referring to the atmosphere arose from
the swear-in of Israel's new Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who had
pledged, during a brief visit to Amman on Wednesday, to comply
with all agreements his country had signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak's speech marked a far cry from his predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu, whose hard-line policies during his three years in
office had been blamed by Arab countries for the stalemate of
the peace process.

<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one people were dead and 11
others injured on Sunday in three separate road accidents in
southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian security sources said a mini-bus running to Cairo
collided head-on with a truck on the Asyut-Cairo highway, killing
14 people and injuring six others, the country's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a second accident which took place in the governorate of
Menia, 220 kilometers south of Cairo, two speeding cars ran
head-on into each other on a desert road in the east of the
governorate, leaving four people dead and five others injured, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
A speeding car overturned on the Agricultural Road between
Cairo and Alexandria after the driver tried to brake the car to
avoid an obstacle. The driver, his wife and daughter died in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt due to high speeding and
violations of rules and regulations. Statistics show that more
than 6,000 people die in accidents in a year and over 30,000 are
injured.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Free Longest-Held Palestinian Detainee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court agreed
Sunday to release the longest-held Palestinian detainee who has
been imprisoned for almost six years without trial.
</P>
<P>
The court approved an agreement made between Israeli military
authorities and West Bank resident Osama Barham, who was arrested
in 1993 for his membership in the militant Islamic Jihad group,
over the terms of his release, according to a court spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Barham, who said he had no idea what the charges against him
were, pledged in the agreement that he will refrain from violence
against Israel and register with police every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television reports said more than 60 Palestinians and
about 20 Lebanese civilians are being held by Israel without
charge or trial, with the length of their detentions ranging from
several months to several years.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli "administrative detention" law, prisoners can
be held without trial for easily renewable six-month
periods. Israel argued that such administrative detention is
needed in cases where Israel's security is threatened by
militants.
</P>
<P>
It's hard to tell if the release is an individual case or a
good-will gesture by the new Israeli government of Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Winning the election in May, Barak has pledged to abide by the
Wye interim agreement with the Palestinians, signed and then
frozen by his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The
accord calls for the release of 750 Palestinian political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu ordered the release of 250 prisoners last November
in the first of the three phases of the agreement, but most of
them were common criminals. The dispute sparked weeks of bloody
conflict between Israeli soldiers and the Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Chinese, U.S. Presidents Confer over Phone (More Added) (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reiterated China's solemn stand on the Taiwan issue in a telephone
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton tonight.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton reiterated the U.S. government's "strong
commitment" to adhering to its "one China" policy on the Taiwan
Issue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president had the telephone conversation tonight
with President Clinton at the latter's request.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that "the purpose of calling is to reiterate our
strong commitment to the 'one China' policy."
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you that policy will not change, you should
have full confidence in the statements I have made to you in our
previous meetings," Clinton told Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that they have talked about the Taiwan issue several
times, and in 1998 when President Clinton visited China, they had
a frank and in-depth exchange of views on that issue.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Jiang said, he repeatedly stressed that the
Taiwan issue involves China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, its cause of peaceful reunification and the national
sentiment of the entire Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The realization of the reunification of the motherland is the
strong determination of the Chinese government, and is also the
common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, including Taiwan
compatriots and overseas compatriots as well, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that recently, Lee Teng-hui flagrantly described
the cross-strait relations as "state-to-state" relations, which is
a very dangerous step he has taken toward splitting the country,
and a severe provocation to the "one China" principle recognized
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
This further exposed Lee's nature to split China's territory
and sovereignty, and his attempt to separate Taiwan from China,
Jiang said, reaffirming that there is only one China in the world,
and Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, and China's territory and
sovereignty absolutely brooks no separation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that our basic principle for solving the Taiwan
issue remains "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems
". We have been actively promoting personnel and economic
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, and have
also been working for direct links in mail, shipping and trade,
and promoting the cross-strait political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang stressed, we are not committed to abandoning the
use of force on the issue of Taiwan. The reason is very clear,
that is, there are certain forces in both Taiwan island and the
world that attempt to separate Taiwan from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
We will never sit idle if some people engage in "Taiwan's
independence" and foreign forces interfere in China's
reunification cause, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the reaction of the Chinese government
and people to Lee Teng-hui's splittist remarks has demonstrated
the strong determination of the Chinese government and people to
oppose splitting motherland, safeguard state sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
We have warned the Taiwan authorities to rein in at the edge of
precipice and stop various actions of splittism to avoid serious
consequences to the relations and situations across the Taiwan
Straits, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the anti-China force in the United States
remains rampant and some people there still favor the splittist
attempt on "Taiwan independence" and spare no effort to support
the "independence force" on the Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
History proves that the handling of the Taiwan issue will have
a direct impact on the process of Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang said,
hoping that the U.S. will earnestly abide by the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and by the commitment not to supporting "Taiwan
independence," "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and Taiwan
's access into any international organizations that only admit
sovereign state, which President Clinton publicly reiterated
during his China visit last year and was recently reaffirmed by
the White House.
</P>
<P>
This is of vital importance to maintaining the stability of the
situation across the Taiwan Straits and to restoring and improving
Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-U.S. relations, Clinton said that the U.S.-China
relations are very important and can not be undermined, adding
that he will work hard to improve the relations between the two
countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese government has always pay great
attention to developing the Sino-U.S. relations, and hoped that
the U.S. side will properly handle the problems now facing the
bilateral relations from strategic heights and long-term
perspectives.

<HEADLINE> Most UK Firms Want Delayed Euro Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) has backed joining the euro but do not favor early
entry, British papers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A poll of 5,000 CBI members conducted by research group Mori
will be published on Tuesday and will reveal that companies in
favor of the single currency outnumber those against it by three
to one, according to the Observer.
</P>
<P>
Most members are believed to have voted for membership between
2002 and 2005. The results come against the background of the euro
dropping to a record low of 1.01 U.S. dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier evidence has showed that the CBI supports British
membership of the euro in principle but some companies have been
split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last week an ICM poll indicated that if a referendum were held
now, 62 percent of respondents would vote against, and last month
the Institute of Directors found more than half its members
against joining.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Implement Economic Monitoring Program in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is expected to implement an economic monitoring program in
Angola in September this year, which will possibly lead to
financial aid to the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Jose Pedro de Morais, visiting IMF official in charge of
African affairs, said here Sunday that the financial institution
will soon send a technical delegation to the country to discuss
the implementation of the program.
</P>
<P>
Morais, who arrived here last Friday, said that the IMF may
begin providing financial aid to the war-torn country in the first
half of the next year, if the monitoring program is going on
smoothly and after the experts have made positive assessment on
the country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring program is a pre-condition for Angola to gain
financial aid from the IMF. It stipulates that the institution
has the right to participate in and assess the economic policies
and measures adopted by the Angolan government. Angola had a
similar program in its last fiscal year, but failed to implement
it owing to the renewed civil war.
</P>
<P>
The program also requires that the Angolan government should
strictly control its expenditure, reduce the number of civil
servants, bring down inflation rate and make its accounts
transparent as well as gradually repealing its foreign exchange
control and privatizing its banks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Turkey's Air-raid on Iranian Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday strongly condemned
the attack by Turkish warplanes on Iranian border villages and
termed it as "unexplainable."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
several civilians had been killed while some others injured in
the raid by the Turkish warplanes, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that the Turkish warplanes dropped rockets and
bombs on the border posts in Piranshahr and villages around
the city, Iran's northwestern province of West Azerbaijan
bordering Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, no details about the Turkish attack were available.
</P>
<P>
The attack was "unprovoked and unexplainable," Asefi said,
adding that the Turkish government should shoulder its
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, some 10,000 Turkish troops supported by
tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters and warplanes, entered
northern Iraq to crack down on the Turkish Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Some Turkish media have even claimed that the Turkish
Kurdish rebels have military bases on Iranian territory, but
Iran has repeatedly denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> 14 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S., British Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen Iraqi civilians were
killed and 17 others injured on Sunday in U.S. and British
warplanes bombardment of some civilian buildings in southern Iraq,
an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:30 (0730 GMT) and 17:40
(1340 GMT), a total of 16 formations of enemy warplanes coming
from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace
and bombed some civilian buildings in this area.
</P>
<P>
This is the heaviest civilian casualties caused by U.S. and
British air raids this year in their regular attacks on Iraqi
civilian and military targets in the no-fly zones in the north
and south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the U.S. and Britain launched four-night
airstrikes against Iraq, leading to the deaths of hundreds of
Iraqi civilians and soldiers and the injuries in thousands.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that nine formations of U.S. and British
warplanes coming from Turkey also violated northern Iraqi
airspace at 11:00 (0700 GMT) Sunday and attacked some civilian
facilities in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the invading enemy
planes and forced them to flee to their bases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, the U.S. and British warplanes have made
more than 10,200 sorties over the northern and southern no-fly
zones in Iraq, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from any possible attacks by the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British bombardment, Iraq has
declared that it does not recognize the restricted zones and vows
to fire at any western planes violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian and military targets ever since.

<HEADLINE> Denktash Says He May Attend Cyprus Talks If His </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said on Sunday that he may attend talks on the Cyprus
issue if the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is recognized
as a state.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Turkey's private BRT
television, Denktash stressed that "Let's talk about an agreement
between the two states on Cyprus from now on, not discuss a
solution. The name of this is confederation."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his readiness "to sign good neighborhood and
cooperation agreement between the states on the island of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Denktash declared the breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," which is now recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bi-communal federation formula, but the talks
between the two sides have made no substantive progress so far.
</P>
<P>
Denktash added that "the Greek Cypriot side escapes from
discussing the confederation and federation, tries to destroy
Turkey's guarantorship and does not accept exchange of
properties."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots will never make concessions on their
sovereignty, said Denktash, adding that "there can't be a quarter
or half sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously approved resolution on June 29, the
U.N. Security Council urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
invite the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, the talks should start with no
preconditions, all aspects of the conflict should be on the table
and the negotiations last until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution followed a similar appeal by the Group of
Eight (G-8), which groups the U.S., Canada, Britain, France,
Italy, Germany, Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the G-8 had urged Annan "to invite the leaders
of the two parties on Cyprus to negotiations in the fall of
1999."

<HEADLINE> Barak's Aides Defend His Timetable for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Senior aides to Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday defended his newly-set 15-month
timetable for final peace agreements on all tracks, saying it is
a target date rather than a firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media revealed that during their talks, Barak and
U.S. President Bill Clinton believe peace breakthroughs can be
made both with Syria and the Palestinians before the U.S. elections
in November 2000. Barak is on a week-long visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Critics in Israel said that setting such a target would encourage
Arab parties to raise their demand in hopes that Israel would
make last-minute concessions in order to meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy told a weekly cabinet meeting that
the aim of the timetable is to show Israel's eagerness to push
forward the peace process on all tracks as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Barak's chief-of-staff Danny Yatom, accompanying Barak on his
first U.S. visit, said in a telephone interview with Israel Radio
that the 15-month period is not a time limit.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new window of opportunity...This is our assessment
shared by the Americans that in the timetable of about 15 months,
we will be able to know if we are going to reach breakthrough or
not," he said.
</P>
<P>
After returning from his visit, which was aimed at
coordinating Israeli and U.S. efforts to revive the peace talks,
Barak will outline his peace plans through consultation with
Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians, Yatom said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials made no comment on Barak's timetable,
but urged him to implement the Wye interim agreement signed by
his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu last October.
</P>
<P>
Barak has called for the combination of the Wye agreement with
the final-status talks with the Palestinians, but the
Palestinians have demanded the full implementation of the interim
deal which calls for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu froze the Wye agreement last December after carrying
out the first of its three stages. The final status talks, in
which the thorny issues like the fate of Jerusalem and
Palestinian refugees will be dealt with, have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Barak said over the weekend that he had called Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to brief him on his
visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two are said to have agreed to meet immediately after
Barak's return for their second summit meeting since the new
Israeli prime minister took office early this month.
</P>
<P>
Levy described as "positive" Syrian media reports which said a
peace agreement will be reached in a period of less than 15
months, but he stressed that it is time for Damascus to take
concrete actions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks were frozen in the last three years
since they broke off in early 1996, with the two sides disputing
over how the talks should be restarted.
</P>
<P>
Damascus demanded the talks resume from where they left off, a
verbal promise from the former Labor government to return to
Syria the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau seized by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
But the hard-line government of Netanyahu, which opposed any
territorial concession over Golan, denied the existence of such a
promise.
</P>
<P>
Since defeating Netanyahu in the May election, Barak has
exchanged compliments with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and
expressed their readiness to resume the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reiterated China's solemn stand on the Taiwan issue in a telephone
conversation with U.S. Presdient Bill Clinton tonight.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton reiterated the U.S. government's "strong
commitment" to adhering to its "one China" policy on the Taiwan
Issue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president had the telephone conversation tonight
with President Clinton at the latter's request.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that "the purpose of calling is to reiterate our
strong commitment to the 'one China' policy."
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you that policy will not change, you should
have full confidence in the statements I have made to you in our
previous meetings," Clinton told Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that they have talked about the Taiwan issue several
times, and in 1998 when President Clinton visited China, they had
a frank and in-depth exchange of views on that issue.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Jiang said, he repeatedly stressed that the
Taiwan issue involves China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, its cause of peaceful reunification and the national
sentiment of the entire Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The realization of the reunification of the motherland is the
strong determination of the Chinese government, and is also the
common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, including Taiwan
compatriots and overseas compatriots as well, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that recently, Lee Teng-hui flagrantly described
the cross-strait relations as "state-to-state" relations, which is
a very dangerous step he has taken toward splitting the country,
and a severe provocation to the "one China" principle recognized
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
This further exposed Lee's nature to split China's territory
and sovereignty, and his attempt to separate Taiwan from China,
Jiang said, reaffirming that there is only one China in the world,
and Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, and China's territory and
sovereignty absolutely brooks no separation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that our basic principle for solving the Taiwan
issue remains "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems
". We have been actively promoting personnel and economic
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, and have
also been working for direct links in mail, shipping and trade,
and promoting the cross-strait political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang stressed, we are not committed to abandoning the
use of force on the issue of Taiwan. The reason is very clear,
that is, there are certain forces in both Taiwan island and the
world that attempt to separate Taiwan from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
We will never sit idle if some people engage in "Taiwan's
independence" and foreign forces interfere in China's
reunification cause, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Announces Purchase of 50 F-16 Fight Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Ministry on
Sunday officially announced the purchase of 50 F-16 fighter jets
from Lockheed Martin in a deal worth 2.5 billion U.S. dollars,
the largest ever defense contract signed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak decided that
Israel will buy the F-16 plane as the air force's new fighter,"
the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came two days after Israeli government
officials accompanying Barak on a visit to the U.S. told Lockheed
that they will buy 50 of their fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Words of the deal came following Barak's meeting with
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen Friday. Barak told both
President Bill Clinton and Cohen that he had decided to accept
the recommendation of the Israeli army and to go ahead with the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
The contract, expected to be signed by August 20, also gives
Israel the option to buy up to 60 additional fighters within two
years.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Israeli defense firms will get 900 million
U.S. dollars in new contracts as part of the deal, details of
which were not revealed.
</P>
<P>
The deal ended months of heated competition between Lockheed,
which produces the cheaper and more agile single-engined F-16,
and Boeing, which manufactures the heavier, multi-role
twin-engined F-15, since Washington agreed last September to sell
Israel 2.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Ministry had considered to split the
contract between the two companies, but former defense minister
Moshe Arens decided last month to buy F-16 fighters from
Lockheed. He then left the final decision to the new prime
minister as he requested.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, which delivered the first of Israel's 260 F-16 jets
in the early 1980s, lost a bid to Boeing in 1994, because Israel
needed the long-rang F-15I fighters to counter potential
belligerence from Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
It came into the latest deal with a conformal fuel tanks made
by Israel Aircraft Industries which increased its plane's range
to nearly match that of the F-15I fighters.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit to Washington, the first since he took office
early this month, was designed to enhance Israeli-U.S. strategic
and military ties as well as to coordinate efforts on the Middle
East peace process.

to the Gulf kingdom also reflects deep-rooted relations between
the two nations, adding that Islamabad considers Riyadh as a
heavyweight in the Islamic world.
</P>

Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz on
ways of boosting bilateral ties in the fields of economy,
trade and investment, the sources said.

<P>
We have warned the Taiwan authorities to rein in at the edge of

consequences to the relations and situations across the Taiwan
Straits, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the anti-China force in the United States
remains rampant and some people there still favor the splittist
attempt on "Taiwan independence" and spare no effort to support
the "independence force" on the Taiwan island.

very valuable, the CA boss, Charles B. Wang, told reporters on
Sunday morning.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Benchmark sensex set a
historic high of 4810.33 points during the week that was marked by
several new records on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the
National Stock Exchange (NSE) as investors celebrated the end of
the eight-week long conflict with Pakistan in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The boom in stocks, well supported by no-delivery period in
many Scripps, helped the sensex break the previous all-time record
of 4643.31 points on September 12, 1994, reflecting sustained
rally following all-round hectic buying on the back of continued
purchases by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIS), who
reportedly made single-day-record purchases of 412 crore Indian
rupee.
</P>
<P>
Even the BSE-100 index cleared its all-time high and closed at
the new record peak at 2030.91 points as also the S&AMP;P CNX Nifty
which soared to 1341.10 before closing at its new record peak of
1335.15 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index fluctuated in a wide range of 4810.33
and 4463.44 before closing the week at 4639.94 as against last
weekend close of 4362.87, netting a sharp gain of 277.07 points or
6.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
BSE-200 and the Dollex were quoted substantially up at 456.90
and 175.88 at the weekend compared with last weekend close of
431.44 and 165.55 respectively.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Title holder Dalian Wanda sank
further after going down 2-1 in Sunday's road match to the
upcoming young squad of Liaoning Fushun at the first division of
Chinese soccer league, falling down to the 13rd position in the 14-
team league.
</P>
<P>
At the midway of the 22-match season, the four-time reigning
champion has lost six games and tow in a row. Their only win in
the first half of the season was a 3-1 victory over the 10th-
ranked Guangdong Rongri on June 24.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuning, the striker of China's Olympic squad, open the
score on a straight header with only seven minutes into play and
gave Liaoning a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
But the struggling Wanda tried to level it 1-1 by Wang Tao's
header at the 55th minute, getting the revenge and pull the Wanda
back on the track.
</P>
<P>
But only 15 munites later, Qu Shengqing added the second goal
for the hosts and retained the top spot on the strikers' ranking
with a total of 9 goals.
</P>

The league leaders Shanghai Shenhua were drew to a 0-0
scoreless match.

<HEADLINE> Economic Performance in Sub-Sahara Improves: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa's economic
performance has shown substantial improvement in recent years,
based largely on improved policies, according to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
It said, however, sub-Saharan Africa still had a long way to go
to make a real dent in pervasive poverty, begin catching up with
other developing regions and integrate itself fully into the
global economy, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The overall economic situation is fragile, as evidenced by the
slowdown in economic growth and the increase in financial
imbalances in 1998, owing to poor weather, weak commodity prices
and armed conflicts," the lending institution said in its July
Survey.
</P>
<P>
The institution said structural adjustment was essential for
all African countries, requiring perseverance in policy
implementation and reforms that were consistent and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
It underscored the importance of a new partnership with
industrial countries that recognized and acted on Africa's need
for more open trade, more foreign direct investment, greater
transfer of technology and deeper debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said it would continue to support strong reform
programs with financial and technical assistance as well as
training designed to enhance administrative and technical
capacity.

LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern warned on Sunday that the deadline for decommissioning all
IRA weapons by May 2000 might not be met because of the recent
setbacks in the Northern Ireland peace process.

But he insisted there is still "plenty to build on" in efforts
to put the Good Friday Agreement back on course.

Ahern, due to meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London
on Tuesday to assess the state of the peace process and plan a
review, said: "We have to get to the endgame on this eventually."
</P>
<P>
He told Irish radio: "Last week was a setback, but we have to
keep on at it. There is too much agreement to go back on it. We
have to try to find a way around the difficulties."

Ahern, who is expected to have talks with Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams early this week, suggested the decommissioning

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Currency to Stabilize: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The central Bank of Tanzania
has assured people that the depreciation of Tanzanian shilling is
a temporary phenomenon and the currency will stabilize.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian shilling depreciated at an alarming rate of some
10 percent in the past three weeks. In private foreign exchange
centers, the mean rate stood at around 810 shillings per U.S.
dollar at the weekend, compared with 734 on June 28, triggering
fears that the currency is unreliable.
</P>
<P>
Daudi Ballali, the central bank governor, said Saturday that
one of the reasons for the depreciation was low exports of both
traditional and non- traditional goods during the past two years
due to adverse weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange dealer told Xinhua Sunday that the amount of
U.S. dollars released by the central bank to the auction market
has reduced from one million to between 200,000 and 300,000 a day
during the past month.

<HEADLINE> British Nuclear Shipment Heads to Japan After Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) - A British nuclear shipment, which
had been prevented by environmental activists from leaving a
harbour in northwest England, finally headed to sea on Monday on
the first leg of its journey to Japan, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd
(BNFL) said.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that (the ship named Pacific) Teal is on its
way. It has moved out of the harbour and is out in the open sea,"
a Reuters report quoted a spokesman for BNFL as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not know if a second ship, which was also
forced by protesters to keep in the docks, had left harbour yet.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Teal was earlier forced to return to its berth at
Barrow because of safety concerns sparked by an overnight protest
by the environmental group Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace group said it was fearing environmental fallout,
nuclear proliferation and possible hijacking on the high seas.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were arrested during the demonstration. Greenpeace
said earlier Monday it would not make another attempt to stop the
ships leaving the harbour.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Teal is due to head for a port city in France, en
route to Japan, where the plutonium fuel is to be loaded into
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said the two ships' combined cargo could be
converted into 60 bombs.
</P>
<P>
BNFL denied the plutonium was ever at risk and said the
security arrangements fully satisfied a U.S.-Japan nuclear pact,
under which Tokyo needs U.S. consent to ship plutonium.

The labs will be used to test the soil, water and air near

In another development, Russia resumed its railway service to

following the start of the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
However, the first carriage bound for Yugoslavia will only
reach Novi Sad, about 75 kilometers northwest of Belgrade, rather
than the capital itself, because the railway bridge across the
Danube was destroyed by NATO bombardment.

said.

<P>
"The Hague-based organization for banning chemical weapons has
not complained about any Russian misbehavior," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said any country, in particular Norway, can demand through
this organization an inspection tour of any area.
</P>
<P>
"However, this costs money and results in political costs if
the complaints prove false," Petrov said, "This is why some find
it easier to make unfounded accusations through the mass media."

In 1993, representatives from 160 nations approved the
Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned the production, use,
sale, and storage of all chemical weapons.

<HEADLINE> South African Cabinet Okays U.N. Anti-Apartheid Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African cabinet has
approved that parliament be requested to accede to the United
Nations International Convention on the Suppression and the
Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, Justice Minister Penuell
Maduna said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government is committed to the eradication
of all forms of apartheid or racial discrimination and will submit
periodic reports as required by the convention once acceded to by
our parliament, to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights about
legislative, judicial, administrative or other measures adopted to
give effect to the provision of the convention," the Justice
Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The convention was adopted and opened for signature,
ratification and accession by the U.N. General Assembly on
November 30, 1973 and came into operation on July 18, 1976.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the convention is to declare apartheid as a
crime and to criminalize acts of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
"It is with deep regret that the convention against apartheid
has not yet been ratified (by South Africa) despite the fact that
it is the significant foundation of our new democratic
government," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It dates back to 1976, and the previous government whose main
pillar was apartheid or racial discrimination could neither sign
or ratify the convention, it said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's September Referendum to Endorse Mubarak's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is to hold a referendum on
September 26 to endorse the parliament nomination of President
Hosni Mubarak for a fourth six-year term in office.
</P>
<P>
The country's Middle East News Agency reported on Monday that
Mubarak, 71, has issued a decree calling on all eligible voters to
take part in the referendum that day.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's People's Assembly (lower house) overwhelmingly
nominated Mubarak on June 2 for a further term. He is certain to
win the referendum as he is the sole candidate for the post.
</P>
<P>
Under Egypt's constitution, the nomination of a presidential
candidate must be put forward by one-third of the 454-member
People's Assembly and then be approved by a two-thirds
majority. The nomination is then endorsed in a public referendum.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Democratic Party led by Mubarak dominates
both the People's Assembly and the Shura Council, the consultative
upper house with no executive or legislative powers.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who was vice president under late President Anwar
Sadat, was first elected president in 1981 after Sadat's
assassination by Islamic radicals. He was reelected unopposed in
1987 and 1993.

<P>
The cobalt factory, located in Kasese district in western
Uganda, is expected to produce about 1,000 metric tons of the
metal annually, Kaliisa said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reaffirms Adherence to One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday reaffirmed adherence
to the principle that there is only one China in the world and
that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with China's Xinhua News Agency, Egyptian
Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Egyptian-Chinese
Friendship Association, Youssef Wali, denounced the separatist
remarks made by Lee Teng-hui, leader of the Taiwanese authorities,
as running counter to the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
Wali said Lee's remarks also contradict the wishes of the
Taiwanese people for China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui claimed in an interview with a German radio early
this month that the Taiwanese authorities had defined the
relationship across the Taiwan Straits as "state-to-state, or at
least special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has condemned Lee's remarks as an utter
exposure of his premeditated intentions to divide the Chinese
territory and sovereignty, and create "two Chinas," "one China,
one Taiwan" or "Taiwan's independence."
</P>
<P>
Wali said Lee's remarks were aimed at intentionally creating
tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, violating
international norms and jeopardizing the interests of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that Lee Teng-hui change his separatist position
and remove all the factors causing tensions between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Wali stressed that the Egyptian people cherish deep feelings
for the Chinese people and side with the Chinese people over
issues closely bound up with the interests of the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> More Than Hundred Raccoons Killed for Fear of Rabies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian trappers have killed 180
raccoons and 14 skunks in fear of spread of rabies first
discovered a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Eight trappers are working day and night to kill every raccoon,
skunk and fox within a 75-square-kilometer area in Prescott south
of Ottawa, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a "buffer zone" is being created in the surrounding
area of 225 square kilometers, where another seven trappers are
busy vaccinating every raccoon they've caught.
</P>
<P>
The "Ottawa Citizen" newspaper Monday quoted the Ministry of
Natural Resources as saying that the first case of raccoon rabies
in Canada was detected last Wednesday 10 kilometers north of the
U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Operation Point Control" of the ministry, an
estimated 400 raccoons will be killed and another 1,000
vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
Raccoons, infamous for scavenging in garbage bags, could spread
the deadly disease of rabies to humans. Costs associated with
dealing with raccoon rabies in the United States are between 100
million Canadian dollars (about 68 million U.S. dollars) and 300
million (about 204 million U.S. dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
The last person to die from rabies in Canada was an Alberta man
in 1986. There have been no known cases of humans contracting
raccoon-strain rabies ever since.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will be
launching several worthwhile projects and activities in line with
the Philippine millennium celebration, the Presidential Palace
said Monday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the millennium celebration begins
from September 23, the start of the 100-day countdown, to December
31, 1999. The whole year of 2000 will be tagged as the new
millennium year.
</P>
<P>
One of the activities is the Department of Tourism's "Milenyo
Pilipino" (Millennium Filipino) program to entice the more than
six million Filipinos residing and working abroad to visit the
country and join in the festivities, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already drafted an executive order which
provides, among others, the creation of a national committee,
composed of relevant government agencies and corporate offices, to
handle the planning and the implementation of the Millennium
Program.
</P>
<P>
The sum of 20 million pesos (500,000 U.S. dollars) will be
allotted as seed money for the various commitments and activities,
including special cultural and entertainment shows and a fireworks
display, said the release.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Milenyo Pilipino Festival, which will start on
December 1, the best of Philippine products, culture, heritage and
tourism will be showcased along Manila's Roxas Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
The boulevard will be designed based on the millennial theme.
It will have food booths, trade fair and such attractions as
replicas of the country's famous Banaue Rice Terraces, Vigan
Heritage Village, and Mayon Volcano.

<TEXT>
<P>
"It is the reasonable price of the Chinese commodities that
attract the people and they can afford it," said Ali Baraf.
</P>
<P>
As you enter the Bakara market, the first things you see are
the Chinese White Elephant and Tiger-Head radio batteries, and
next to them lie Chinese-made torches and lamps. As you move a
bit forward you can see the plastic sandals, soap, footballs,
suitcases, bed sheets, shoe polishes and vacuum flasks. Just as
you go a bit deeper you can see the colorful balances and pressure
lanterns.
</P>
<P>
In the electronic wards, almost all of the equipment belong to
China and other few Asian countries. Just name it, the radio
transistors, tape recorders, electric fans, color televisions,
computers, telephone sets, cellular mobile telephones and watches
are all from China.
</P>
<P>
But don't forget the children's world where most of the toys
are also from China, beginning from the wheelchairs for the
children to learn how to walk, equipped with the electronic sound
devices -- toy pistols, machine guns, cars, ambulances, the smart
learning boards, dolls and other beautiful toys.
</P>
<P>
People go through these commodities to buy their favorite at a
price that can be managed by the largely unemployed Somalis.
Still the business is not only in Bakara market, but also in the
chemists and pharmacies. You can find that most of the medicines
are also from China, from the widely consumed antibiotics,
bandages, massages against cold and flu and multi- vitamin drugs
including those equipped with the famous Ginseng.
</P>
<P>
Even though the economy of Somalia is now super decentralized
due to the lack of a central government and a central bank, still
some businessmen can estimate the amount of money involved in the
business with China.
</P>
<P>
"I spent 185,000 US dollars on business with China through
License of Commerce during the first half of this year," said Abdi
Mohamed Ali, who added that apart from his firm there are more
than 30 other firms doing the same as his.
</P>
<P>
"This makes more than 5.5 million dollars per annum," Ali
added. He said all those goods pass through the United Arab of
Emirates on their way to Somalia.

with 45, 000 dollars early this year and now a month ago I bought
the same commodity with only 42,000 dollars," said Trabune.
</P>
<P>
For some unclear reasons, the Somalis seem to trust the
Chinese more than any other country. One reason could probably be
the valid traces left behind by China during its collaboration
with the late regime. Almost all of those institutions built by
other friendly countries have been destroyed, except those built
by China. "It is the population of the two countries who in the
end benefit from any relation set up by any political organ or a
government," said Abdullahi Fataho, a Somali politician in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A tangible evidence is that even though Somalia's regime had
been toppled and all major facilities destroyed, still those built
by China remain intact, they include the main soccer stadium of
Mogadishu, the main maternity hospital of the capital (Benadir
Hospital), the main tarmac road linking Mogadishu to Baidoa, and
other main tarmac roads from the central regions to the northeast
and northwest of the country. All those facilities built by China
are still operational.
</P>
<P>
However, the only known facility built by China and destroyed
during the civil war is the National Theater. Many people regret
that it was destroyed just because of its beauty and architectural
designs. As long as those premises operate, the Somalia-China
relations will further exist and flourish since the people still
have goods marked at their bottoms "Made In the People's Republic
of China".

WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Not long after the skies grew dark with a second day's
setting sun, a Coast Guard admiral declared an end of hope Sunday
night that John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife or her sister could be
found alive in the waters that swallowed their aircraft Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
-- AOL, the unchallenged leader in cyberspace in the United
States, plans to announce no-charge service in Britain, and may
extend it to the whole continent, where it's starting to feel heat
from other free services and the former national telephone
monopolies in France and Germany that are offering the Internet at
rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has set a deadline of 15
months for achieving a comprehensive framework for peace in the
Middle East, a time line chosen in part to dovetail with the
American political calendar and the Presidential election, Israeli
officials said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
-- The steady stream of visitors across the decades to the
graves of President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert sadly
quickened on Sunday as the nation kept vigil for John F. Kennedy
Jr. In Boston, as at the cemetery in Washington, attendance
increased at the house where President Kennedy was born.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. defense firms are mulling over trans-Atlantic deals.
Following recent encouragement from top Pentagon brass such as

industry maneuvers has been touched off that are aimed at making
major trans-Atlantic mergers a reality in the months and years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslavia's top general expressed support for Milosevic and
called opponents of the president traitors. Vuk Draskovic, a
longtime opposition leader who briefly served in Milosevic's
government, joined a rally calling for the Serb strongman to quit.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Visit Four African States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac will
pay a visit to four African states from Wednesday till Sunday to
maintain and expand the political influence of France in sub-
Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that the
visit will be made under the banner of "friendship, openness,
peace and modernization" marking the relationship between France
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will promise the leaders of Guinea, Togo, Nigeria and
Cameroon that France will continue to plead for international
economic aid to Africa in international creditors' clubs, said
Colonna.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with African leaders the building of
democratic systems and the rule of law in Africa, said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Nigeria will be the highlight of the tour, as this
will be the first time for a French head of state to visit Nigeria,
Africa's most populous English-speaking country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, France has become the second largest
buyer of Nigerian products and Nigeria's third largest importer.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Togo, Chirac will congratulate Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema on his success in mediating a peace
treaty in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The French president supports the pioneering mechanism of
mediation used by Togo in Sierra Leone, which was jointly
established by the European Union (EU), the French-speaking
community, and the governments of France and Germany for promoting
internal dialogue between conflicting African states and parties.
</P>
<P>
They could also discuss a possible resumption of economic aid
by EU to Togo, which was suspended in 1993 by Brussels for Lome's
"insufficient progress in the field of democracy."
</P>
<P>
In Guinea, the French president will inaugurate with Guinean
President Lansana Conte the Dam on the river of Garafiri, which
was completed with French financing after the World Bank and the
African Development Bank withdrew from the project.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed Monday during Lebanese guerrillas'
attack, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The militiaman was killed by a roadside bomb on the road
between Kfar Houna and Rihan in the eastern sector of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack. It said in a statement that its
fighters detonated a bomb on a group of SLA militiamen at the
Kfar Houna crossing, causing several casualties.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israeli army confirmed the attack and the death
of the militiaman.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy
SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Russia-NATO Permanent Council May Resume Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Monday "consultations are being prepared on the
resumption of work by the Russia-NATO Permanent Council."
</P>
<P>
Such contacts "have to do primarily with the Russian
peacekeepers' participation in the international operation in
Kosovo," the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary consultations in a broader context on the
principles of further dealings between Russia and NATO are also
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia suspended its cooperation with NATO after the military
bloc launched a 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia on March 24.
Limited contacts resumed last month but were restricted to
consultations on cooperation in peacekeeping operations in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal reached in Helsinki, Finland, Russia will
eventually deploy 3,600 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Ivanov also commented on the "6 plus
2" meeting on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of deputy foreign ministers from China, Iran,
Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, the six
countries bordering Afghanistan, and Russia and the United States,
"marks an important stage in the search for a political settlement
of the Afghan problem," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the warring parties in Afghanistan, the Taliban
movement and the United Front, were participating in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan problem cannot be settled by military means," said
Ivanov, "It's important that the conflicting sides sit down at the
negotiating table and put an end to violence and create political
mechanisms for normalizing the situation."

Jiang said China believes that APEC should meet its developing
members' demand for tightening economic and technological
cooperation, and promote the actual implementation of this

<HEADLINE> 17 Iraqis Killed in U.S., British Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of Iraqi civilians
killed in Sunday's U.S.-British bombardment has risen to 17, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was the heaviest civilian casualty in 1999 in U.S.-British
regular attacks on Iraqi civilian and military targets in the two
no-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier INA reports quoted an Iraqi military spokesman as
saying on Sunday evening that 14 Iraqi civilians were killed and
17 others injured in the day when warplanes of the United States
and Britain bombed civilian buildings in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A number of houses at Manathera sub-district in the southern
province of Najaf, 200 kilometers to the south of Baghdad, were
also destroyed in the raid, said INA.
</P>
<P>
A funeral procession was held on Monday morning for the
victims in Najaf province, INA added.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the U.S. and Britain launched four nights of
airstrikes against Iraq, killing hundreds of Iraqi civilians and
soldiers and injured thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
Since the bombardment, Iraq has declared that it does not
recognize the two no-fly zones unilaterally set up by the western
allies and vows to fire at any planes violating its airspace.
</P>

The no-fly zones were carved up by the U.S.-led western allies

Since then, the U.S. and British warplanes have made more than

<HEADLINE> Workshop on Anchovy Fisheries to Be Held in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A workshop on anchovy fisheries in
the Gulf of Thailand will be held in Cha-am, a coastal city 170
kilometers southwest of Bangkok, from Wednesday to Friday this
week, a press release from the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is co-organized by the Department of Fisheries of
Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and FAO's
regional office in Asia and the Pacific (RAP).
</P>
<P>
About 80 participants are expected to attend the meeting,
including province governors, provincial fisheries officers around
the gulf, small-scale fishermen, representatives from the fish
processing sector and experts in this field.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will review the existing knowledge on anchovy
resources and their exploitation in the Gulf of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Anchovy fisheries have become a hot issue these two months as
some small-scale fishermen in the south blocked the Songkhla deep
sea port for days last month to protest the use of luring light to
catch anchovy nearshore, which is believed to have damaged coastal
resources.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Agriculture Ministry announced a ban on the
use of light for anchovy fishing later last month.
</P>
<P>
FAO's regional office in Bangkok, after receiving an appeal
from small-scale fishermen's organization in the south, decided to
organize the workshop to find solutions to anchovy fisheries in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The resulting recommendations of the workshop will be forwarded
to the Thai government for further consideration.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Breweries Have Poor Accounting Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's most profitable breweries
are plagued with a loophole-ridden accounting system, the Ministry
of Finance revealed in a report today.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a survey, the ministry conducted
among 110 breweries over the first half of the year, over 92
percent of them have various problems in calculating income, costs,
and profits.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry spokesman Wang Jun said here today that the
breweries made false accounts of more than 2.4 billion yuan (about
300 million U.S. dollars) worth of income and costs, and 1.4
billion yuan (about 170 million U.S. dollars) worth of profits.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the breweries surveyed have weak
accounting systems. "There are many loopholes in the accounting
systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some of the breweries have seriously violated
relevant State regulations and laws in this respect.
</P>
<P>
For example, Kouzi Group Corp. of Anhui Province in east China
reported a net profit of 1.14 million yuan last year. However, the
Finance Ministry found that it actually lost more than 22 million
yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
An advertising company under the Qufu City Distillery of
Shandong Province in east China deliberately destroyed some
account books and original vouchers.
</P>
<P>
The Songhe Distillery of Henan Province in central China used
illegal original vouchers to withdraw more than 800,000 yuan in
cash in a single month in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Yanghe Distillery and its subordinate companies failed to
put into account more than 100 million yuan worth of sales revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance named a dozen breweries that violated
State laws and regulations in its Report on the Quality of
Accounting Information, released today.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the ministry has been dealing with these
breweries and has asked authorities to mete out legal and
administrative punishment to the people involved.
</P>
<P>
The brewage industry has been one of the most profitable
industries in China. For example, taxes from alcoholic drinks
accounted for one-tenth of the country's total tax revenue in
January this year, growing more than 40 percent over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase tax and establish a modern management
system among Chinese breweries, the government is stepping up its
drive to help reform and supervise the companies' financial
systems.

<P>
CHANGSHA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of flood-relief
materials from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters (SFCDRH) arrived today in central China's Hunan
Province, a forefront of the flood-control campaign along the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The SFCDRH has allocated 500,000 square meters of plastic and
20,000 life jackets to Hunan, which has entered a critical phase
of its flood-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in three major rivers in Hunan have surged above
the warning level, and in some places are above the danger level.
</P>
<P>
Floods on the Yangtze and torrential rains in the province are
expected to raise the water level in Dongting Lake to about 35.5
meters, the second highest since the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949, according to local flood-control
officials.
</P>
<P>
Devastating flooding along the Yangtze River and in northeast
China provinces killed more than 3,000 people last year and
resulted in economic losses of 264.2 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) today announced major changes in the approval of
overseas listing by Chinese enterprises.

<P>
The other major change is that, along with state-owned
enterprises, the government said explicitly for the first time
that it supports companies in other forms of ownership in their
bids to be listed in overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Yongmin, a CSRC official, 45 Chinese
companies have been listed overseas, raising a total of 10.8
billion U.S. dollars. Among them, the Guangdong Kelong Electrical

<P>
HEFEI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China has
seen a strong surge in tourism this year, receiving a total of 70,
000 overseas and 1.87 million domestic visitors between January

</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that some 58,000 overseas tourists

in the country, during those months, up 37 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism contributed 4.2 percent, or 70 million U.S. dollars, to
the local GDP in 1998, compared to only 0.97 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Anhui boasts five State-class scenic spots including the

<HEADLINE> Greece for Dialogue With Turkey to Reduce Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou expressed the hope that the dialogue between Greece and
Turkey next week will reduce tension and give rise to greater
rapprochement between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this process will be able to first of all reduce
tension," Papandreou said in an interview with the Athens daily "
Eleftherotypia" published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Later June, Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem,
agreed during their talks in New York on establishing committees
of senior diplomats to investigate the possibility of cooperation
on the issues of culture, tourism, environment, illegal
immigration, terrorism, drug trafficking, cross-border crime,
trade, economy and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Senior foreign ministry officials of Greece and Turkey will
meet on July 26 and 27 to begin the nine-point dialogue.
</P>
<P>
While describing the dialogue as one on matters in which Greece
considered there was a field of common interest, Papandreou said
that issues were not included on which there were diametrically
differing views, such as Turkey's claims in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such a dialogue could not touch on issues that
pertain to Greece's national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds for their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that Turkey should take its
unilateral claims to questioning Greek sovereignty over a number
of uninhabited islets in the eastern Aegean to the International
Court of Justice at the Hague, but Turkey refused to do so.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt to Punish Illegal Diamond Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Luanda will severely punish illegal
diamond miners in Angola's central Bie Province, where the armed
fighting between the government and the rebel UNITA movement is
one of the fiercest, Sources from the Ministry of Geology and
Mines said.
</P>
<P>
The official Angola Daily Monday said following rumors that
diamond mines of rich reserves were discovered in Bie Province, a
large number of illegal miners have started mining in areas
controlled both by the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) and the government.
</P>
<P>
Officials from relevant government departments have been sent
to the province for investigation, said the sources, adding once
the rumor is confirmed, the individuals or groups engaged in
illegal diamond mining will be punished according to law.
</P>
<P>
Angolan law rules that diamond is one of the strategic
resources which should remain strictly under government control.
Its prospecting and exploitation must be approved through the
issue of government licenses.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the reason why government attaches so much
importance to the illegal mining in Bie is that it is worried that
the diamonds might get into the hands of UNIYA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the major diamond-producing countries in
Africa. The traditional diamond-producing area is in Lunda-Norte
Province in the northeast where about two million carat of diamond
were turned out in 1998, fetching 450 million U.S. dollars in
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
But according to government estimates, UNITA's smuggling of
diamond to the international market could fetch several hundred
millions of dollars in revenue, which would be used for the
purchase of weaponry and logistic goods to sustain UNITA's
fighting with the government.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Attempt to Split China Is Bound to Fail: Jiang Enzhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Lee Teng-hui's attempt to split
China has aroused immense indignation among the Chinese people at
home and abroad and his attempt is bound to fail, said Jiang Enzhu,
director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting for the formation of the Hong Kong
Compatriots Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the 50th
Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China,
Director Jiang said that Lee Teng-hui's flagrant description of
the cross-straits relations as "state-to-state" is a very
dangerous step towards splitting the country, a serious
provocation to the "one China" principle recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"This further reveals his nature of splitting China's territory
and sovereignty and separating Taiwan from China," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This divisive act of Lee Teng-hui has seriously damaged the
basis of the cross-straits relations, affected the stability of
the Taiwan Straits situation, harmed the peaceful reunification
process and therefore aroused great indignation among the Chinese
people at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, people from various circles here in Hong
Kong have come forward to denounce Lee's perverse action, fully
expressing the common aspiration of the Hong Kong compatriots to
resolutely safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
to oppose splittism and promote the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of
China. We are firmly opposed to any remarks and acts aimed at
creating 'two Chinas,' 'one China, one Taiwan' and 'Taiwan
independence'," Jiang declared.
</P>
<P>
To solve the Taiwan issue and realize the complete
reunification of the motherland is the sacred task of the entire
Chinese people and the irreversible trend of history, and Lee Teng-
hui's attempt to split the motherland is bound to fail, he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Optimistic About Asia-Pacific Market Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An Airbus Industrie market
forecast shows that the Asia-Pacific air transport market is
expected to generate demand for more than 4,300 passenger aircraft
valued at over 450 billion U.S. dollars over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In terms of aircraft numbers, this represents almost a quarter
of the European aircraft manufacturer's forecast world demand for
passenger aircraft between now and 2018, said the forecast report.
</P>
<P>
Adam Brown, Airbus Industrie Vice President Forecasting and
Strategic Planning, told Hong Kong media Monday that despite the
effects of the recent downturn on airline performance, underlying
fundamentals all point towards recovery for the industry within
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"Airbus Industrie remains extremely optimistic about the medium
and long-term prospects for Asian air travel," he said. "In fact,
we predict that the 52 largest airlines in the region will lead
the world in terms of overall growth in capacity over the next 20
years, to the point where they will be flying as many as the
airlines of Europe by the Year 2018."
</P>
<P>
According to the study, which takes into account a recovery
period of reduced growth between now and 2001, overall passenger
traffic in the region will rise at an annual average rate of 6.1
percent for the 20 years to 2018. This compares with a world
average of 5 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet this growth, available seat capacity in the
Asia-Pacific region will need to rise from the current level of
442,000, or 24 percent of global capacity, to over 1.2 million, or
30 percent of all available airline seats worldwide.
</P>
<P>
As a result, over 2,400 aircraft will be required by Asia-
Pacific airlines purely to meet growth requirements.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, almost all of the current in-service fleet of
just under 1,900 aircraft will also be replaced over the forecast
period, increasing the total market potential to the predicted
level of some 4,300 units.
</P>
<P>
In terms of aircraft size, Airbus Industrie forecast predicts
that the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be a key market for
the 300, 350 and 400 seaters, with a requirement for some 1,150
aircraft in the categories served the best-selling A330/A340
family.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that the Asia-Pacific region will also continue to
drive the development of new, very large aircraft for the 21st
century, with a requirement in the region for just over 660
aircraft larger than anything flying today.
</P>
<P>
This represents over half of the total predicted world demand
for some 1,200 units in this size category over the next 20 years,
which will be met by aircraft such as the new 480-600 seat A3XX
family now under study at Airbus Industrie, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Abuse of National Day Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Profit-seeking activities which
abuse the name of national day celebrations have been banned
across China in order to relieve the burdens on enterprises being
harassed by fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
The general offices of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee and the State Council jointly issued a circular
today which prohibits individuals and units from collecting fees,
asking for financial support, or canvassing advertisements from
enterprises before the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
"Some press and publication units, and governmental and social
organizations have been pressing enterprises to pay for
publications, television programs, and exhibitions as gifts for
the nation's birthday," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Some profit-seekers even produced souvenirs and presents for
the celebrations and have abused the national flag and emblem by
putting them on products, it said.
</P>
<P>
"These activities go against relevant regulations of the CPC
Central Committee and the central government and have brought
about adverse effects," it added. "They should be stopped
immediately."
</P>
<P>
The central government has repeatedly warned local governments
and organizations to avoid extravagance and waste while preparing
for the celebrations in October.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Will Take Back Refugees Quickly: Bangladeshi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad said here on Monday he was optimistic that Myanmar
would very soon take back its citizens, known here as Rohingya
refugees, to remove the irritant between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"The Myanmar foreign minister has assured me to take back all
their nationals very quickly," Azad told reporters after seeing
his Myanmar counterpart, U Win Aung, off at the Zia international
airport.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for home, Aung said the Rohingya
repatriation would be over soon, but he gave no time-frame.
</P>
<P>
Azad said he told Aung clearly that they had to take back their
nationals within this year, and Aung assured him of doing the
needful.
</P>
<P>
Since there was goodwill between the two sides, problems
between the two countries could be solved easily, said the
minister, adding that the Myanmar minister, through his visit, had
learnt the views of the Bangladeshi side on different issues that
affect bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Azad said it was not only the 7,000
refugees who had already been cleared by Myanmar and the UNHCR,
but the entire lot numbering over 20,000 that should be
repatriated. "We have also communicated to them that improvement
of relations depends to a large extent on how swiftly the refugee
problems is solved," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Azad said he was assured that the pace of repatriation would be
quickened and they agreed in principle to take back all their
nationals.
</P>
<P>
Besides the refugee issue, he also discussed with Aung such
issues as landmining and border trade, he said. Bangladesh had not
decided on Myanmar's proposal of forming a joint commission
between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Rohingyas crossed the Bangladesh border in 1991,
and about 230,000 of them have been repatriated under a memorandum
of understanding between Bangladesh and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar stopped in July
1997 reportedly as a result of the refugees' refusal to return.
</P>
<P>
The official BSS news agency said that since the repatriation
was resumed in November last year and up to June this year, only
378 Rohingyas had been repatriated, and during this period, 621
babies were born in the camps and 78 died, leaving an additional
543 to be included in the total number of refugees awaiting
repatriation.

ISLAMABAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The key indicator of share
prices on the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) closed 1.9 percent
higher Monday amid optimism that tension at Kargil has ended.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 share price index rose 21.89 points to 1156.67
points from Friday's 1134.78 points.

where the Mujahideen have vacated as scheduled," said Shakeel
Anwar Kamal, a dealer with Prudential Securities Pvt. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Somalia-China Trade Flourishes Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is the reasonable price of the Chinese commodities that
attract the people and they can afford it," said Ali Baraf.
</P>
<P>
As you enter the Bakara market, the first things you see are
the Chinese White Elephant and Tiger-Head radio batteries, and
next to them lie Chinese-made torches and lamps. As you move a
bit forward you can see the plastic sandals, soap, footballs,
suitcases, bed sheets, shoe polishes and vacuum flasks. Just as
you go a bit deeper you can see the colorful balances and pressure
lanterns.
</P>
<P>
In the electronic wards, almost all of the equipment belong to
China and other few Asian countries. Just name it, the radio
transistors, tape recorders, electric fans, color televisions,
computers, telephone sets, cellular mobile telephones and watches
are all from China.
</P>
<P>
But don't forget the children's world where most of the toys
are also from China, beginning from the wheelchairs for the
children to learn how to walk, equipped with the electronic sound
devices -- pistols, machine guns, cars, ambulances, the smart
learning boards, dolls and other beautiful toys.
</P>
<P>
People go through these commodities to buy their favorite at a
price that can be managed by the largely unemployed Somalis.
Still the business is not only in Bakara market, but also in the
chemists and pharmacies. You can find that most of the medicines
are also from China, from the widely consumed antibiotics,
bandages, massages against cold and flu and multi- vitamin drugs
including those equipped with the famous Ginseng.
</P>
<P>
Even though the economy of Somalia is now super decentralized
due to the lack of a central government and a central bank, still
some businessmen can estimate the amount of money involved in the
business with China.
</P>
<P>
"I spent 185,000 US dollars on business with China through
License of Commerce during the first half of this year," said Abdi
Mohamed Ali, who added that apart from his firm there are more
than 30 other firms doing the same as his.
</P>
<P>
"This makes more than 5.5 million dollars per annum," Ali
added. He said all those goods pass through the United Arab of
Emirates on their way to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Another fascinating thing is said to be the ever-cheapening
prices of the commodities imported from China, according to
Somali businessmen Muhidin Trabune, a large store owner in Bakara
market. He said the prices never stay the same in China for three
months. It is always cheaper than before.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, I bought two large containers of plastic sandals
with 45, 000 dollars early this year and now a month ago I bought
the same commodity with only 42,000 dollars," said Trabune.
</P>
<P>
For some unclear reasons, the Somalis seem to trust the
Chinese more than any other country. One reason could probably be
the valid traces left behind by China during its collaboration
with the late regime. Almost all of those institutions built by
other friendly countries have been destroyed, except those built
by China. "It is the population of the two countries who in the
end benefit from any relation set up by any political organ or a
government," said Abdullahi Fataho, a Somali politician in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A tangible evidence is that even though Somalia's regime had
been toppled and all major facilities destroyed, still those built
by China remain intact, they include the main soccer stadium of
Mogadishu, the main maternity hospital of the capital (Benadir
Hospital), the main tarmac road linking Mogadishu to Baidoa, and
other main tarmac roads from the central regions to the northeast
and northwest of the country. All those facilities built by China
are still operational.
</P>
<P>
However, the only known facility built by China and destroyed
during the civil war is the National Theater. Many people regret
that it was destroyed just because of its beauty and architectural
designs. As long as those premises operate, the Somalia-China
relations will further exist and flourish since the people still
have goods marked at their bottoms "Made In the People's Republic
of China".

<HEADLINE> Elf Launches Counter Takeover Bid Against Total-Fina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Elf-Aquitaine
launched on Monday a dramatic counter takeover bid against its
French-Belgian rival, Total-Fina, plunging the two best known
French industrial groups into a gigantic summer merger battle.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Officer of Elf-Aquitaine, Philippe Jaffre, made
the announcement at a press conference, two weeks after Total Fina
's chairman Thierry Desmarest staged a hostile take-over bid to
absorb Elf.
</P>
<P>
A merger either way between the two oil groups would result in
the world's fourth biggest oil and gas group and its fifth biggest
chemicals group.
</P>
<P>
Elf offers to exchange five shares of Total-Fina with every
three of its own shares, or buy every five shares of Total-Fina
with 190 euros (192 U.S. dollars) in cash.
</P>
<P>
The administration council of Elf said that it would launch a "
renewing industrial project" dividing a resulting entity into
separate oil and gas and chemical businesses.
</P>
<P>
The annual pretax synergies of a merged group are estimated at
2.5 billion euros (2.525 billion U.S. dollars) in three years,
more than twice the 1.2 billion euros as estimated by Total-Fina.
</P>
<P>
Elf said that its offer would give a 10 percent premium ex
dividend to the French-Belgian group's closing price on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This puts the value of Total-Fina at 50.3 billion euros (50.8
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Elf predicts that a merger with Total-Fina would result in the
downsizing of 6,000 jobs, including 2,000 in France, while Total
said that it would cut down 4,000 jobs if it took over Elf.
</P>
<P>
Elf now employs 85,000 people, and Total-Fina 71,600.
</P>
<P>
Total-Fina announced on July 5 that it offers four shares of
its own for three shares of Elf, which puts the value of Elf at 42
billion euros (42.42 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A counter take-over bid was the only choice for Elf, because an
alliance with a foreign oil group will be surely opposed by the
French government which has a right of veto, called "golden share.

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
today called on both Chinese and Australian youth to contribute to
the growth of bilateral ties by increasing mutual understanding
and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Jiang, who is also a member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee,
in a meeting with a delegation from the Australian Political
Exchange Council led by Judi Moylan, a member of the Australian
Federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>

Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
During the gathering, participants agreed that the maintenance
and development of healthy, stable and constructive Sino-
Australian relationship accord with the fundamental interests of
both peoples, and will also serve to safeguard peace, stability
and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.
</P>
<P>
They also believed that young people of the two countries
shoulder responsibilities for promoting Sino-Australian ties.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the delegation members talked about the
impression of their ongoing China visit. They said that the visit
enabled them to have a better understanding of China.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Speaker's Fate to Be Determined Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The fate of Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari,
Nigerian Speaker of the House of Representative, would be
determined Tuesday as both the upper and lower houses reconvene.
</P>
<P>
As calls for the resignation of the speaker mount, Buhari is to
file a suit Monday at a Lagos High Court against the Independent
Communications Network Limited, publishers of The News magazine.
</P>
<P>
The News magazine published on July 11 alleged that Buhari is
29 and not the 36 years of age he claims to be, and that he never
attended the University of Toronto in Canada which he also claims
to be an alumnus.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the speaker's lawyer Chief Ladi Williams gave the
publishers a 72-hour ultimatum to retract their story and
apologize to the speaker on their story in which their magazine
accused Buhari of forgery.
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP)
of which the speaker is a member have advised Buhari to step aside
quietly to save the reputation of the party.
</P>
<P>
Chief Solomon Lar, national chairman of the ruling party, had
been holding a series of consultations with party leaders on the
issue to see how the party could salvage the situation.
</P>
<P>
Party sources said that the PDP leadership had resolved to
force Buhari out of the party if the allegations were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the expulsion option was considered against
the backdrop of Buhari's vow to stay on in office and the fact
that it might be difficult to prosecute a successful impeachment
process against the speaker as he is said to enjoy the support of
the majority of the members.
</P>
<P>
A lobby team of the National Assembly whose members are from
the northern part of the country has been set up to save Buhari's
political career, saying that the allegations against Buhari were
part of a grand design to disgrace the north and deny it of the
position of Speaker of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senators of the opposition Alliance for Democracy
(AD) and members of the House of Representatives have begun
independent investigations into the allegations against the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Senate's Establishment Committee Otunba
Durojaiye described the allegations as an embarrassment to the law
makers, especially as a bill to fight corruption and other vices
was before the assembly.

<HEADLINE> Peace Group Says Settlements Flourish Since 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlement activities
have flourished since 1996 with 42 satellite settlements set up in
the occupied territories, a study conducted by Israel's Peace Now
movement indicates.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that 20 of the 42 new settlements are within
1,000 meters of their mother settlements, the local daily Haaretz
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, 13 are between 1,000 and 2,500 meters away and four
are more than 2.5 kilometers from their mother settlements.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that the majority of these settlements were
built without official permission, but were later approved by
former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense
minister Moshe Arens.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now members complained that the new government led by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is following in Netanyahu's footsteps
by ignoring complaints made against settlements.
</P>
<P>
After his victory in the May elections, Barak pledged to stop
building new settlements and solve the settlement issue with the
Palestinians in the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
However, during the coalition negotiations, Barak reportedly
promised Yisrael Baliyah Party and National Religious Party that
satellite settlements approved by the defense establishment, and
that lie within the official borders of their mother settlements,
will be allowed to remain in place at least until the final
status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now movement charged that Barak is wasting time to
stop the settlers from establishing irreversible facts on the
ground before the start of final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now's study is expected to be the basis of a cabinet
discussion next week regarding the future of satellite
settlements, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The discussion, requested by the left-wing Meretz party, will
use the distance from the mother settlement to its satellite as a
primary criterion for determining the settlement's future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, data published by Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics on Sunday showed that the number of Jewish settlers in
the territories has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
According to the data, 166,100 Jews are living in the West Bank
at the end of 1998, while 6,400 Jews are living in the Gaza Strip,
12 percent more than the figure at the end of 1997.

HONG KONG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate for the period April-June 1999 in Hong
Kong was 6.1 percent, and the provisional underemployment rate was
2.9 percent, according to statistics released today by the Census
and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
For the period March-May 1999, the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate was confirmed to be the same as the previously
released provisional figure of 6.3 percent, while the
underemployment rate was revised upward to 3.0 percent from the
provisional figure of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the period April-June 1999 with March-May 1999,
decreases in unemployment rate were seen mainly in the
construction, manufacturing, import/export trades, hotels,
transport, real estate and insurance sectors.
</P>
<P>
As to the underemployment rate, decreases were seen in the
decoration and maintenance, manufacturing, transport and
restaurants sectors.
</P>
<P>
K.Y. Tang, the government economist, observed that as business
conditions gradually improved, the labor market also benefited,
and both the unemployment and the underemployment rates fell in
the most recent period.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that with more fresh graduates and school
leavers entering the labor market in the next couple of months,
the unemployment rate especially for younger persons would
probably remain relatively high in the near term.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Attaches Importance to Farm Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Monday it will
increase agricultural input to meet the food requirement of the
ever-increasing population of the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on the development of agricultural input
supply system in sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopian Agricultural
Minister Mengistu Hulluka said increased use of modern input such
as improved seeds and fertilizers is of great importance to
agricultural development in African continent.
</P>
<P>
The four-day workshop is sponsored by the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the International
Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC).
</P>
<P>
Mengistu called on African countries to pay attention to the
role of government parastatals and private sector with regard to
provision of improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and other
inputs to farmers.
</P>
<P>
"African governments should, whenever required, create the
conditions necessary to ensure growth, stability and equitable
access to productive resources as well as to establish a sense of
participation by the farmers themselves and the communities at
large," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is a country where agriculture plays a vital role in
its national economy. It provides employment to over 85 percent
of the active labor force, and generates over 90 percent of the
export revenue in the country, according to Mengistu.
</P>
<P>
Lalla Ben Barka, ECA deputy executive secretary, also attached
importance to agricultural development in Africa when speaking at
the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Increasing agricultural productivity in Africa on a sustainable
basis will provide the key to a permanent solution to the
continent's food insecurity and poverty problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also expressed belief that private sector
involvement will play a bigger and bigger role in African
agriculture during the next millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung
left here Monday for home via Bangkok ending a three-day visit to
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Zia international airport before
his departure, Aung, terming his visit as a "familiarization"
tour, said the visit had enabled him to establish contact with
Bangladeshi leaders and know their mind on different issues.
</P>
<P>
The visit was "useful," and would help strengthen bilateral
relations between the two neighbors, said the Myanmar minister,
who arrived here on Saturday after a visit to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the repatriation of the remaining Myanmar refugees
in Bangladesh, Aung hoped that the problem would be "solved soon."
</P>
<P>
Aung said he was pleased to have met with President Shahabuddin
Ahmed, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and other Bangladeshi leaders,
adding that this would help bring the two nations closer and forge
better understanding between them.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that some problems still remained between the two
countries, but assured that those would be solved since there was
a "will" on both sides to resolve the problems.
</P>
<P>
Problems between the two neighbors could be solved once a joint
commission between the two countries was formed, and bilateral
relations would also get a boost with the formation of such a
commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aung and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Abdus Samad Azad, held
official talks Saturday on bilateral relations, particularly the
repatriation of the over 20,000 Myanmar refugees, known here as
Rohingya refugees, who are living in two camps in Cox's Bazar,
southeast Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> SADC Free Trade Deal Back on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations for the
establishment of a free trade area in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) by January next year are back on
track, independent news group's Business Report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came as a result of an agreement between South
African and Zimbabwean trade ministers last week to improve
Zimbabwe's trade quota under the current trade agreement between
the two countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mfundo Nkuhlu, chief director of African trade relations in the
South African Department of Trade and Industry, said the agreement
meant the SADC trade protocol could be ratified before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
"The ratification will probably take place once (South
Africa's) parliament is in session again, and this will mean that
the SADC free trade area would be implemented by January next
year," Nkuhlu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for a free trade area in the SADC region, which,
if implemented, is expected to create some five million new jobs
in the short term and add 15.7 billion rand (2.6 billion U.S.
dollars) to the region's gross domestic product, began last year.
</P>
<P>
They failed to reach their June deadline after several
contentious issue arose.
</P>
<P>
These included problems with rules of origin, the threatened
deterioration of the trade preferences of South Africa's weaker
partners in the Southern African Customs Union, and, most
importantly, the impasse with Zimbabwe, South Africa's biggest
trading partner in the SADC, over the amount of Zimbabwean goods
granted access to the South African market under the current
bilateral trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Customs Union covers five of the 14
members of the SADC -- South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho
and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Nkuhlu said this adjustment in the quota allocation was only a
technical one rather than an alteration of the existing agreement.

MAPUTO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Untied States closed its
embassy in Maputo, Mozambique Monday morning due to security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Harriet Mcguire, cultural and press official at the embassy,
said the move is to prevent accidents and casualties.
</P>
<P>
For the past few weeks, the United States' foreign agencies
including the embassy in Mozambique, have been the targets of
threat, therefore she said the temporary closure of the embassy is
a wise move.
</P>
<P>
The United States also closed its consulate, cultural section,
library and other offices in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy in Mozambique has reinforced its security
precautions following the bombing of embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya last August. In the past month, the United States has
surrounded its embassy with concrete frusta as high as one meter
without the approval of the Maputo authorities, which caused the
dissatisfaction of both Maputo citizens and city officials.

<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Economy in this Chinese capital
city soared a year-on-year 11.9 percent in the first half of this
year, 4.3 percentage points than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics announced today that
the Gross Domestic Product totaled 95.47 billion yuan (about 11.53
billion US dollars) during the first half-year period.
</P>
<P>
Beijing sets its annual economic growth target for 1999 at nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
The fast-paced economy is largely attributable to a remarkable
18.4-percent growth rate in the industrial sector, which chalked
up 38.06 billion yuan (about 4.59 billion U.S. dollars) in added
value in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The series of policies the municipal government has adopted
since last year to increase domestic demand is the major reason
behind the accelerated industrial growth," said Tang Long,
director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, which has maintained two-digit growth for
several years, created 54.12 billion yuan in added value during
the period, up 6.5 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector continued to register stable growth
during the period, bringing in 3.29 billion yuan in added value,
an increase of 2.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Britain Stops Nuclear Sailing to Japan After Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) - Britain on Monday was forced to
abandon plans to ship nuclear fuel to Japan after a standoff with
floating environmental activists who strongly protested against it.
</P>
<P>
British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) said the Pacific Teal, a ship
scheduled to leave for Japan returned to berth at Barrow, a port
city in northwest England, because of safety concerns sparked by
the overnight protest.
</P>
<P>
Another armed shipment of mixed oxide fuel, which had also been
preparing to leave the port for Japan, where the plutonium fuel
was to be loaded into nuclear power reactors, still remains in the
docks.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace environmental group, which staged the protest,
said the two ships' combined cargo could be converted into 60
nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the shipments fear environmental fallout,nuclear
proliferation and possible hijacking on the high seas.
</P>
<P>
BNFL denied the plutonium was ever at risk and said the
security arrangements fully satisfied a U.S.-Japan nuclear pact,
under which Tokyo needs U.S. consent to ship plutonium.
</P>
<P>
Local report said seven Greenpeace protesters have been
arrested at the demonstration against the shipments of nuclear
fuel.

<HEADLINE> Bankrupt Real Estate Joint Venture Auctioned Off in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Assets of a real estate joint
venture between a Beijing developer and a Hong Kong-based company
has been auctioned off at a price of 398 million yuan (about 48
million U.S. dollars) to pay off creditors.
</P>
<P>
The Xisen Group Co. Ltd from Leling of east China's Shandong
Province, one of the largest debtors of the Beijing L &AMP; D Rose
Garden Villa Co. Ltd, bought the famous "Rose Garden Villa"
residential houses at the auction held over the weekend to
minimize its losses.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing L &AMP; D Rose Garden Villa Co. Ltd was formerly the
Beijing Feida Rose Garden Villa Co. Ltd, a joint venture between
Beijing Changping County Real Estate Development Corp. and the
Hong Kong-based China Feida Real Estate Limited with a registered
capital of 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Located in the north suburbs of Beijing, the "Rose Garden Villa
" project, had planned to build more than 800 villas on nearly 500,
000 sq. km of land and a total of 186 villas of American, Japanese
and European styles were completed.
</P>
<P>
The ownership of the shares of the Beijing L &AMP; D Rose Garden
Villa Co. Ltd, the developer of the Rose Villa Project, has
changed several times in recent years while the operation and
management were steadily deteriorating, resulting in heavy
deficits.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, the court declared that the company must
file for bankruptcy and 105 creditors have registered with total
debt rights worth one billion yuan. The majority are from Hong
Kong, with a few foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The company was then liquidated and the Rose Villa project was
evaluated to be worth 600 million yuan. The Beijing No.1
Intermediate People's Court ruled in June the project be auctioned
off to pay off some of the creditors.
</P>
<P>
The court has also ruled that house buyers who have made a
whole or partial payment could move into the villas as normal or
could ask for a refund as a common creditor, in accordance with
the law, and be repaid on a proportional basis.

<HEADLINE> China Promoting Digital Library Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China is introducing digital
techniques into its libraries, so as to give more people access to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Libraries in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Nanjing cities and
Guangdong and Liaoning provinces have been pioneers in this
respect since 1997, according to the China Society of Library
Science.
</P>
<P>
Two libraries in Guangdong have already copied over three
million pages of their documents onto their websites on the www.
163.net and the www.169.net, which are expected to have some two
million visitors each month.
</P>
<P>
Digital science provides the libraries with more room for
further development, experts argue. And it will bring changes not
only to the contemporary library service, but also to its stored
contents. Printed books are only one kind of accumulation of
knowledge resources, while digital science greatly boosts
information sharing.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities in China are also trying to make use
of digital science in their libraries. Up to now, over 100 of them
have opened websites.
</P>
<P>
The National Library of Beijing set up its first electronic
reading room in 1996, and the second one in 1997, offering
software and CD data services.

<HEADLINE> Manila Considers Restoring Countrywide Development Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
considering restoring the countrywide development funds (CDF) to
be used for pro-poor projects by congressmen in congressional
districts, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said in a statement that the government has generated
enough savings that can be used to allocate 30 million pesos
(750,000 U.S. dollars) per congressional district that will be
identified by lawmakers in the fiscal year 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
He said that legislators will be allowed to identify projects
for government to fund, under their CDF, but these should all
conform with the government's pro-poor programs, to prevent misuse
of the money.
</P>
<P>
In the past, as much as 24 percent of the national budget were
reported to have been lost to graft and corruption. This finding
has prompted the government to abolish the CDF when it submitted
to Congress its proposed budget for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Zamora noted that the proposal is still under serious
consideration by the government, stressing that "if the government
decides to restore the funds, these would go only to hard
infrastructure projects."
</P>
<P>
If restored in the next fiscal year, Zamora said congressmen
and senators will be allowed to decide what projects they would
fund out of their CDF, but these should only involve hard
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
No figure has yet been given as to how much CDF will be given
to congressmen and senators since the matter is still under study,
Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said the restoration of CDF may be necessary since
legislators have complained that they have not been able to
address their constituents' needs after they have been stripped of
the power to identify the projects needed by their congressional
districts.

<P>
The report said preliminary figures released separately by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation have shown that the number of
murders dropped about 8 percent between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It's because of more police officers on the streets, tougher
sentences, more prosecutions, better prevention programs, a
healthy economy and a new approach to crime fighting that involves
a closer working relationship between communities and federal,
state and local law enforcement."  (Violent Crime Rate In U.S.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Expedition Team Adjusts Research Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABOARD THE SNOW DRAGON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Arctic
expedition team has adjusted its research plan to bring forward
its 13-15 day oceanic and fishery resources survey in the Bering
Sea and postpone research in the Arctic Ocean, as a result of
unfavorable weather and ice conditions.
</P>
<P>
The icebreaker Snow Dragon, carrying more than 120 scientists
and journalists, exited the Arctic Sea this morning, having
crossed the Arctic Circle five days ago.
</P>
<P>
The complex, unpredictable weather and ice conditions in the
Arctic Ocean hampered the ship from going further north, said Chen
Liqi, leader and chief scientist of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
The scientists will wait for an improvement in the ice
conditions, and recross the Arctic Circle. The adjustment of the
research plan will help ensure the success of the expedition, Chen
noted.
</P>
<P>
In the previous five days of research in the Chukchi Sea, the
scientists obtained ample, valuable air and water samples.
</P>
<P>
The scientists will proceed to focus on studying the ecological
system in the vicinity of the Arctic Ocean and the biological
resources in the Bering Sea, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The "Snow Dragon," which had already been used in five Chinese
expeditions to the South Pole, underwent examinations and major
overhauls last year; and it would sail to the South Pole again in
November this year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, prolonged exposure to the ice-floe area will do
harm to and even damage the vessel, and this is another reason why
the expedition team adjusted its plan, said Chen.

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Attracts More Overseas Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 82,000 overseas tourists
visited this capital city of southwest China's Sichuan Province in
the first half of this year, up 41 percent over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaoquan, director of the Chengdu City Tourism Bureau,
attributed the increase to a big rise in the number of tourists
from Southeast Asian countries which are recovering from the
region's worst financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, some 5,200 tourists from
Thailand and 7,200 from Singapore visited the city in the first
six months, compared to over 1,000 and 3,500 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The World Horticulture Exposition in the city of Kunming in the
neighboring Yunnan Province, which started on May 1 and runs
through October 31, was another main contributor to the increase.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the foreign exchange earned from the tourism
industry during the period increased by only 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
He explained that foreign tourists often stayed in the city for
a short period of time because their destinations were always
scenic spots in other part of the Sichuan province, such as
Mountain Emei, Leshan Buddha and Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong Nature
Reserves.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu has actually served as a transit for them, he added.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-funded Ventures Expand Business in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded ventures in this
Chinese capital are expanding their business thanks to improving
investment climate and promising market prospects.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the Municipal Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Commission showed that a total of 986 million
US dollars of overseas investment flowed into Beijing during the
January-June period, including 525 million US dollars from
existing overseas-funded ventures.
</P>
<P>
Companies that increased their investment by more than 20
million US dollars include Ericsson Mobile Communications Co. Ltd,
Lucent Technologies and Japan's SMC Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"It's the fourth year in a row for my firm to increase its
investment since we set up our China branch in Beijing in 1994,"
said Zhao Tong, president of Japan SMC (China) Co. Ltd. "We have
injected nearly 100 million US dollars into the China market so
far, compared to our initial investment of ten million US dollars.
"
</P>
<P>
The foreign partner of a pharmaceuticals company said his
company is mainly attracted by the improved investment climate in
Beijing and the huge market potential.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has adopted a series of measures and
policies since last year to increase the city's attraction for
overseas investment, including preferential policies to encourage
overseas investment in new, high-tech industries, and regulations
designed to draw more multinationals to set up their regional
headquarters in Beijing and start technological development
centers, according to a municipal trade official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total industrial output value of
overseas-funded businesses in Beijing surged 33 percent during the
first five months of this year to 27.875 billion yuan, while the
sales income rose 33.8 percent to 41.94 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By late June, Beijing had approved a total of 14,390 overseas-
funded ventures, involving 26.86 billion US dollars in contractual
investment. A total of 438 multinationals and world-renowned
enterprises have established branch companies in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Short of Anti-Malaria Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's health authorities,
battling a devastating malaria outbreak in the country's western
region, are running out of essential medicine.
</P>
<P>
Especially in short supply is the crucial drug quinine, the
backbone of the ministry's fight against the killer tropical
disease, the East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the disease had claimed more than 1,000
lives since its outbreak earlier this year, with most of the
victims from Kisii district, Nyanza Province in southwestern
Kenya. However, the government said about 700 people have died so
far.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Health Ministry said, "the Central Supplies
Unit in capital Nairobi has issued all its quinine stocks and
other anti-malaria drugs such as sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
(metakelfin) are fast running out."
</P>
<P>
In total, the government positioned over 130,000 doses of
quinine in risk districts by April, leaving some 73,000 doses in
stock at the Central Supplied Unit, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the government has spent about one
million U. S. dollars on the drugs and their transportation to
malaria-stricken districts.
</P>
<P>
The ministry officials are making much effort to procure new
supplies to combat the epidemic, which has reportedly affected
close to 200,000 people across this east African country.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Life Insurance Claims Case Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's largest personal insurance
claims case has been recently settled in Beijing, with the
beneficiaries expected to receive a total of 2.4 million yuan (
about 289,000 U.S. dollars) from the insurer.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the Taikang Life Insurance Co.,
Limited, the policy holder, who was identified as a Mr. Li, was
insured in 1997 against major diseases and two other liabilities
with a total insured amount of 360,000 yuan, in case of the policy
holder's death.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the insured was found of brain cancer in 1998
and eventually died in February 1999 at the age of 34.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the insurer paid out a total 360,000 yuan to cover
the medical bill and other insured liabilities.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Li also bought several policies for his twin sons,
according to which, the sons would be paid a total of 1.76 million
yuan in 13 years to cover their life and education costs. In
addition to other indemnities, the total amount in the future
would be nearly two million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The insurer has recently paid the twins 120,000 yuan as the
first batch of the claims package.
</P>
<P>
Chen Dongsheng, Taikang Life's General Manager, told reporters
that the timely settlement of any claims is the base for insurers
to won the trust of customers.
</P>
<P>
He added that the case may help raise the public's awareness of
insurance.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Bo, a professor with the Insurance Department of Beijing
University, told Xinhua in an interview that settlement has been a
major source of complaints against insurance companies in China
for a long time, adding that with competition getting more and
more fierce, only those insurers with good credit and services
could expect to expand their market shares.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Wants All Illegal Congo (K) Immigrants Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has ordered
the immediate deportation of all nationals of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) who entered the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Deputy Minister Edwin Hatembo who was on a tour of
Luapula Province in the north said the Immigration department has
powers to deport illegal immigrants without taking them to court.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted Hatembo as saying after
learning that the Immigration Department in the province was
prosecuting six Congolese nationals who entered the country
illegally.
</P>
<P>
Hatembo said illegal Congolese immigrants detained in Mansa,
northern Zambia, should be taken back to their country to avoid
congestion and shortage of food in prisons.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the short distance from Mansa to the Democratic
Republic of Congo, it is necessary that these people are cleared
because they are not budgeted for," said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials told Hatembo after he inspected prisons,
police and National Registration Departments in Mansa that there
were still many refugees entering the country in Kaputa, Northern
Province.
</P>
<P>
Other refugees who infiltrated villages have also started
reporting to Kaputa because of hunger.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday the number of refugees at Kaputa was 4,820 and the
process of transporting them to Mporokoso, also in Northern
Province, was still going on.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven Congolese soldiers who were being held in
Mansa demanded to be taken back to their country.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who had been held in the district for some time
appealed to Hatembo to free them as they were worried about the
welfare of their families in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Hatembo promised that the government would look into their
plight.

ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said that Turkey
considers Kosovars as a people with whom Turkey shares a common
history and culture.
</P>
<P>
Cem visited Turkish troops that serve under KFOR in Kosovo and
attended the opening ceremony of the coordination center
established by the Turkish Red Crescent.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Iran claimed that Turkish jets bombarded a military base
close to Piransehir and threatened to reciprocate, causing
tensions in the ties between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Riza Asefi claimed
that Turkish planes bombed Iran, taking a toll of civilians and
revolutionary guards.
</P>
<P>
Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish State Minister Sukru Sina Gerel said Turkey will not
back off from its position on a Cyprus solution, but has left the
door open for a formula that can provide the resumption of talks
without the official recognition of the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" as a state.
</P>
<P>
However, Gerel pointed out that providing equality between the
two Cypriot sides is a must.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Zambian Copper Miners to Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 copper miners at Roan
Antelope Mining Corporation will soon lose their jobs in a
trimming exercise aimed at strengthening operations.
</P>
<P>
Both management and Roan branch officials of the Mine-workers
Union of Zambia have confirmed the impending retrenchment
exercise, Zambia Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This will reduce the work force by about half of the private
copper mine.
</P>
<P>
The list of those to go has already been compiled, said the
Union.
</P>
<P>
"Yes it is true, the list has been compiled. As of now we are
awaiting the next move from the government," said Cameron Pwele,
Roan branch chairman of the Union.
</P>
<P>
Some miners said they are ready to start a new life but
demanded their benefits accrued from the state-run Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) before they can stop working.
</P>
<P>
A management official said reducing the work force will make
the operations of the mine viable because currently there are many
problems at the mine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations for improved conditions of service for
miners are going on smoothly and the Union said it is confident of
a positive response from the government.
</P>
<P>
In the process of privatization of Zambia's mining industry, a
number of workers have been retrenched and more will be.

<HEADLINE> Central Shaanxi To Become Mushroom-Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The arid plateau in central Shaanxi
Province in northwest China is hopeful of becoming a new mushroom-
production base in China, with the application of a new technique
developed by agronomists at the Shaanxi Provincial Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
After a one-year experiment, the agronomists have successfully
developed a technique to grow mushrooms using pruned fruit tree
branches.
</P>
<P>
They have produced 300,000 bags of mushrooms with the new
technique and processed them into 30,000 kg of dried mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's mushrooms are produced in the southern sub-
tropical areas, but the new technique means that more northerly
regions may now produce mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
With its moderate weather conditions and drastic temperature
difference between day and night, the arid plateau north of the
Weihe River in central Shaanxi is an ideal place for growing
mushrooms, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
They estimate that the area can produce 80,000 tons of
mushrooms, valued at more than four billion yuan (some 482 million
US dollars), every year, using the new technique.

WELLINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Web has come to the remote
South Pacific atoll of Niue, with the setting up an Internet

reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Internet equipment was hooked up to Niue's frame-relay
telephone switch, which pipes data at 128 kilobit per second by
satellite between the island and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Other communications between Niue's 1,750 inhabitants and the

each week to the "Rock of Polynesia," 2,400 kilometers north-east
of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Beefing up Position As Manufacturing Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's economic powerhouse
Shanghai has been placing great emphasis on developing local hi-
tech industry, as a key effort to maintain its position as the
leading manufacturing center.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, Shanghai has witnessed fast growth
in its burgeoning hi-tech industry, which include information
technology, bio-pharmaceuticals, and new materials. Latest
statistics show one-fifth of the nation's integrated circuit, one-
third of its telecommunications equipment, and 30 percent of IC
cards are produced by Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Such local pillar industries as automobiles, iron and steel,
equipment used for power station, fine chemicals, and household
apparatus also have occupied some 20 percent of the country's
markets each.
</P>
<P>
But the city has the need to boost its products up to world
standards and develop internationally-advanced technology and
products characteristic of creativity and advancement to cement
its position as the country's key manufacturing base, said Jiang
Yiren, vice-mayor of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has adopted favorable policies to lure overseas
investment to local large-scale projects and to encourage use of
scientific and technological achievements in production. Ten big
industrial and hi-tech projects are scheduled to become
operational within the year.
</P>
<P>
Some local group companies also have launched programs to train
personnel and increase recruitment of professionals.
</P>
<P>
Estimates say the hi-tech industry in Shanghai is expected to
yield 120 billion yuan (about 14.4 billion U.S. dollars) in output
value this year, up 25 percent on a yearly basis, or 18 percent of
local industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
This year Shanghai plans to use three billion dollars of
contractual overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Shuts Down Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province, the country's old industrial heartland, has joined a
nationwide bid to overhaul its coal-mining industry by shutting
down illegal or badly planned coal mines.
</P>
<P>
A total of 577 such mines have been closed down during the
first six months this year, involving coal output of 5.182 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government originally had plans to close 440
mines involving coal output of 7.2 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Rampant and badly planned development of small coal mines have
been blamed for heavy pollution, waste of natural resources, and
over-production and low quality of coal in the province, China's
old industrial base.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning started to restructure the coal-mining industry in
1997, shutting down small mines without operation permits and
mines without proper pollution-reduction measures. The province
also put a brake on opening new coal mines when shutting down old
and small ones.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the province first organized a thorough
investigation to locate such illegal mines, and local governments
at all levels also formed special taskforce to carry out the work.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial officials, Liaoning will focus its work
during the later half year on inspection of the shut-down work to
ensure a permanent closing of such mines.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Ex-Militiamen to Get Light Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Information Minister
Anwar Khalil has said he expected the majority of former members
of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) to receive light
prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them were low ranking and were not important. I
expect them to receive light sentences," Khalil was quoted Monday
by the Daily Star as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the sentences would consist of fines or imprisonment,
the minister said "certainly they will be sent to prison, most of
them will remain there for one to three months only."
</P>
<P>
Khalil was speaking during a tour of Jezzine, a southern
Christian town which was vacated by the militia early in June
after a 14-year-old control.
</P>
<P>
The militia conducted the withdrawal under the pressure of
Lebanese Muslim Shiite group Hezbollah's military attacks in the
area which have claimed more than 150 SLA lives over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
After the SLA retreated into the Israeli occupied border zone
in south Lebanon, over 200 militiamen or ex-members decided to
hand themselves in to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The trial of them are due to begin on Wednesday in the
military court.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong militia was established and funded by Israel
to help it patrol the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war trying to oust Israeli forces and
its proxy SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, those collaborating with Israel are considered as
traitors as the country is officially at war with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> "Sightfirst China Act" Benefits Cataract Sufferers in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- No one can imagine how excited
Rinzin Zhoima, who had suffered from cataracts since she was born,
felt when she saw her mother's face for the first time and how
blue the sky of her hometown was after she regained her eyesight
thanks to an operation.
</P>
<P>
Zhoima, aged 12, insisted on presenting a hada (a white silk
scarf presented as a gift by Tibetans) to Wang Dan, the doctor who
performed the operation this month.
</P>
<P>
"At last, I can see everything, and I can go to school in
September," she told reporters excitedly.
</P>
<P>
Zhoima, a native of Lhozhag County in southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region, is only one of 353 cataract sufferers in Tibet
who have regained their eyesight thanks to the "Sightfirst China
Act" this year.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the project, which was jointly launched by China's
Ministry of Health, the China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF)
and Lions Clubs International, a global non-governmental charity
organization, in 1997, is to provide free operations for cataract
sufferers in China.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of cataracts in Tibet is double that of inland
areas in China, due to the region's high elevation and strong
ultraviolet rays. Many cataract sufferers in Tibet can not receive
timely treatment because of economic, medical or communications
factors.
</P>
<P>
Last August, a group of doctors was sent to Lhasa, Shannan,
Qamdo and Nyingchi to conduct operations for cataract patients; as
a result, 1,129 people regained their sight.
</P>
<P>
Wang's team was the second batch to be sent to Tibet within two
years.
</P>
<P>
Since the project commenced in 1997, 92 medical teams have been
dispatched to 761 poor and remote counties in China, according to
Lu Manhua, vice-chairman of the rehabilitation division of the
CDPF.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that there are four million cataract patients in
the country at the moment, and the number is growing by 400,000
annually.

NANJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 34 trees each several
hundred years old in Taicang, east China's Jiangsu Province, have
been moved to a new place because of the reconstruction of the old

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry on
Sunday night summoned Turkish Charge d'Affairs to Tehran Kut
Sezgin, strongly protesting against Turkish bombardment on Iranian
border villages earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ministry condemned the aggression and violation of
Iranian airspace by Turkish warplanes, saying Iran reserves the
right to take any actions against the aggression and violation,
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iran underlined that the Turkish government should shoulder
the consequences of the aggression, offer an official apology to
Iran, pay compensations to Iran and avoid the repetition of such
incidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
Governor General of Iran's northwestern West Azarbaijan
province Mahmoud Mirlowhi announced that five people were killed
and 10 others injured in the raid early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Mirlowhi said that four Turkish warplanes raided a military
outpost on Iran-Iraq border and tribal tents in a region five
kilometers deep in the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
In the first reaction, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Sunday strongly condemned the raid and said
that the attack was "unprovoked and unexplainable."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the headquarters of Iran's armed forces Sunday
night also severely denounced the violation of Iranian airspace
by Turkish warplanes and called it as a flagrant violation of the
international law and against the good neighborly relations .
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the headquarters said that Iran reserves
the right to react in accordance with the international laws
and regulations and considers Turkey as responsible for any
consequences to the event.
</P>
<P>
It also called on international bodies to look into the
accident and condemn the aggressive act, expressing hope that
the Turkish government should not be affected by "the Israeli
insinuations and avoid from any action which could harm the
good neighborly relations and threaten the regional calm and
security."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, an emerging
financial and trade zone in this east China metropolis, did 6.73
billion U.S. dollars-worth of foreign trade in the first half of
this year, an increase of 36.7 percent over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the local Customs department indicate
that the area exported 2.87 billion U.S. dollars-worth of
commodities during the January-June period, up 31 percent, while
importing 3.86 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods, up 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local trade experts attributed the high growth mainly to
increases in the external trade of overseas-funded enterprises and
high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Customs, more than half of the
exports and imports were accomplished by the area's 2,000-odd
overseas-funded enterprises, compared with 15 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Technology-intensive goods, such as computers and machinery,
made up 50 percent of the total exports, while exports of labor-
and resource-intensive products kept on declining.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and Germany are the biggest trading
partners of the area in terms of trade volume.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans to Lose 17 Years in Life Expectancy Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations predicts a
17-year loss in life expectancy for Kenyans by the year 2010 as a
result of the spread of AIDS, the East African daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
AIDS, often referred to as a "poor man's disease", had 95
percent of all the infected persons living in developing countries
and a prevalence of 10 percent or more, according to the United
Nations 1999 Human Development Report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that due to the epidemic, life expectancy in
developing countries is expected to go down to 47 years by the
year 2010, back to what it was in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Although the disease is also spreading fast to areas
previously thought to be free of the virus like China and Russia,
the disease is still associated with poverty and especially the
marginalized people," the report warned.
</P>
<P>
Kenya which was placed 134th in last year's ranking dropped to
136 this year, due to an increase in the number of HIV/AIDS
cases, said Macleod Nyirongo, deputy regional representative of
the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenyan Health Minister Jackson Kalweo has decried
under- reporting of AIDS cases, saying that by the end of 1998,
only 750,000 of AIDS cases were reported with another 1.9 million
people estimated to be infected.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Agronomist Sets Record for Dry-Field Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An agronomist in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province has set a record by raising the per ha yield of
wheat growing in dry fields from 750 kg to 6,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
Li Like, 64, quit his job as deputy head of the Shaanxi
Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1981 in order to
grow high-yield wheat on arid land.
</P>
<P>
He finally succeeded after 18 years of experimentation.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, Li experimented with increasing the
application of phosphate fertilizer while turning up the soil and
regulating the use of water in the course of crop growth. The
method was spread to over 20 counties, increasing the annual wheat
output there by 400 million kg -- the per ha yield rising from 653
kg to 3,750 kg.
</P>
<P>
Later, Li found that rapid seepage of surface water prevents
higher yields. So, he left a higher wheat stock in the fields
during harvest time and put layers of straw in the fields in a bid
to preserve the moisture of the earth's surface. In this way, the
per ha yield rose to 6,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
North China has 20 million ha of arid land, and dry fields in
Shaanxi make up 60 percent of its total farmland. On average, the
per ha output of dry fields north of the Weihe River lingered
around 653 kg for many years. So Li's research is of vital
importance for dry field crop production in both Shaanxi and north
China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) said Li's achievement has great significance
for dry field farming worldwide after a recent investigation in
Shaanxi.

She added that the program presents a balanced development of
domestic and foreign markets and focuses equally on resort,
cultural and heritage tourism.
</P>

tourism industry, the DOT has been participating in various
international trade fairs so as to encourage foreigners to visit
the Philippines, Araneta said.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Fights Deterioration of Water Control Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The water control authorities
in north China's Hebei province have dealt with a series of cases
in which highway builders destroyed water control facilities.
</P>
<P>
The construction units responsible have been ordered to take
immediate remedial measures, including clearing away materials
blocking water courses and channels, to prepare for the flood
season.
</P>
<P>
Water control experts said flooding occurs frequently in Hebei,
and the destruction of water control facilities in recent years
will make the province even more vulnerable to floods.
</P>
<P>
Local media have given extensive coverage to illegal activities
by highway builders, such as dumping garbage into reservoirs and
rivers and building highways over reservoirs. As a result, the
provincial government formed a field survey team to conduct field
investigations and discovered that most highway contractors
ignored the requirement to map out relevant plans to prevent water
and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the provincial government has issued two urgent
circulars calling for a halt to such destructive activities, and
more concern from highway builders for environmental protection
and the prevention of water and soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Defaults on Foreign Repayments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has defaulted on the
repayment of 4.6 billion shillings (62.1 million U.S. dollars)
owed to bilateral creditors, exposing its struggling economy to
further inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The failure to meet external debt obligations, which was due by
the end of June, means that new lines of credit will be hard to
open and importers run the risk of incurring higher cost as a
result of dishonoring letter of credit, the East African weekly
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts say Kenyan importers might also be required
to pay cash up front for goods which would render pressure on the
battered Kenyan shilling as importers and investors seeking to
repatriate their profits and principal investment scramble for the
available hard currency.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, the Kenyan government is said to be
honoring its obligation to the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The debt in question owed mainly to France, Japan, Austria and
Britain include 3.5 billion shillings of principal repayments and
1.1 billion shillings of interest payments.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the amount of debt Kenya can't pay is
expected to rise following a sharp increase in Kenya's external
repayment obligations from 23.6 billion shillings in 1998/99 to
33.5 billion shillings in 1999/ 2000 fiscal year.

QINGDAO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's first marine technology
market, the Qingdao Marine Technology Trade Center, has opened in
this coastal city in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The center, aiming to become a national one eventually, will
focus on the trading of marine development technologies, exchange
of information concerning marine industries, and technical
services,
</P>
<P>
Jiang Huashan, director of the Qingdao Municipal Commission for
Science and Technology, referred to the move as part of the city's

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime Rates Decline in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Violent crime rates in the
United States last year declined 7 percent to their lowest levels
since the Justice Department began tracking the figure in 1973,
Attorney General Janet Reno announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crimes against property including burglary, car
theft and household theft also fell 12 percent to their lowest
levels since 1973, according to this year's National Crime
Victimization Survey released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1998, violent crime rates fell 27 percent, from 50
to 37 per 1,000 people aged 12 or older, the survey said. Violent
crime includes rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault
and simple assault.
</P>
<P>
The report said preliminary figures released separately by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation have shown that the number of
murders dropped about 8 percent between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said there is no one reason for the
drop of violent crime rates. She gave the Clinton administration's
policies credit for combining the effects of several strategies.
</P>
<P>
"It's because of more police officers on the streets, tougher
sentences, more prosecutions, better prevention programs, a
healthy economy and a new approach to crime fighting that involves
a closer working relationship between communities and federal,
state and local law enforcement," Reno said.

<P>
MACAO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- With Macao's upcoming return to the
motherland, more people in the mainland areas of China tend to pay
a visit to the unique place which blends Chinese and Western
styles.
</P>
<P>
Now that many people have growing interest in Macao and want to
know more about the place, some provincial branches of the China
International Travel Service Co. Ltd. in the mainland are
arranging large tourist groups to Macao.
</P>
<P>
On July 17, a total of 677 tourists from southwest China's
Guizhou Province arrived in Macao. They made the travel by train
first to Guangzhou City which is about two hours' ride to Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Guizhou branch of the travel service began preparations for
the trip one month ago. According to an original plan, the number
of tourists was estimated to be around 570, but as many as 800
people applied to join in. Some people had to stay for a future
trip.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, a 750-member tourist group from east China's
Zhejiang Province will also come to Macao. Likely, the tourists
will go to Guangzhou by train first.
</P>

Sources with the Macao branch of the travel service said that
many other provincial branches in the mainland are also

<HEADLINE> Narcotics Cases Reach Record High in Thai Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Narcotics cases in Thai courts
have reached a historical high and the trend is still rising, The
Nation Monday quoted Criminal Court Chief Justice Pramot Chapanan
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Narcotics cases had been over-represented in the Criminal
Court, reaching an all-time high of 70 percent of all criminal
cases, Pramot said.
</P>
<P>
There had been many more cases in 1999 than in any of the
previous years, and the Criminal Court had to increase the number
of permanent benches of judges on drug-related trials from 10 to
14 to cope with the influx of cases, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed support for a proposal of the Office of
Narcotics Control Board to reduce the minimum penalty for retail
drug trafficking from five years to four, which would help speed
up cases.
</P>
<P>
With the minimum penalty for minor drug traffickers reduced to
four years as proposed, the Criminal Procedure Code provides that
the court would not have to summon witnesses for testimony.
</P>
<P>
Court procedures for such cases would be shorter, and the
number of cases on trial in the courts would be decreased, Pramot
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also realized that the public may not like this
idea.
</P>
<P>
But he argued that prisons so far are overcrowded with 10,000
convicted heroin and amphetamine traffickers, none of whom were
heads of drug trafficking syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Applying harsh punishment to them would not help solve drug
abuse problem in the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Jr. Likely Dead, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
and her sister were probably dead in a plane crash on Friday night,
according to a Coast Guard official Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to shift, and I say shift very purposely, from
our focus on search and rescue to search and recovery," said Rear
Adm. Richard M. Larrabee at a press conference broadcast live on
tv in Aquinnah, Massachusetts Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the search had no major progress on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Kennedy was piloting his single-engine plane,
with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her older sister
Lauren Bessette on board, when it crashed in the waters off Martha
's Vineyard on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
His father, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in
1963 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
The searchers zeroed in on a spot at the bottom of the sea
after picking up an automatic emergency signal Sunday, while
Americans grieved over the almost certain deaths of Kennedy, his
wife and her sister.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday in Washington, President Bill Clinton offered the
prayers of a nation, saying the Kennedys "have suffered much and
given more" as a family over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people, including Coast Guardsmen and members of
the Air Force and National Guard, concentrated on a 1,000-square-
kilometer area off Gay Head, on the southwestern edge of Martha's
Vineyard, using ships, helicopters, planes and all-terrain
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, searchers found little more than the fragment
of a headrest and some insulation. Saturday's search had yielded a
wheel, a headrest, part of a plane support, a prescription bottle
belonging to Kennedy's wife and a piece of baggage belonging to
his sister-in-law.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government planned
to improve its revenue performance in second half of 1999 while
keeping the deficit target for the whole year at 68.4 billion
pesos (1.71 billion U.S. dollars), the Department of Finance (DoF)
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its first year accomplishment report, the DoF said that
financing economic growth is an enormous challenge for the fiscal
sector, particularly the remaining economic agenda on
liberalization and deregulation.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve this, the government is keen on
implementing the right mix of fiscal programs through the
implementation of effective tax administration, borrowing and
privatization activities.
</P>
<P>
"Tax reforms will be implemented to remove distortions in the
tax system, enhance its equity features, and promote the
protection of the environment," the DoF reported.
</P>
<P>
The report added that these tax reforms include rationalization
of fiscal incentives, taxation of the financial sector, and the
introduction of the "green" taxes.
</P>
<P>
The DoF also intended to introduce the taxation of electronic
commerce as the economy becomes more integrated with the
globalization of markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the government is expected to borrow
from bilateral and multilateral funds as these provide lower
interest rates and longer maturities.
</P>
<P>
The government opted to an expansionary fiscal stand to
stimulate the economy because it believes that pump-priming the
economy over the next two years will lead to attaining a balanced
budget in order to revert to fiscal surpluses in the medium-term.

Local self-employed households and private enterprises created
as much as 480 billion yuan-worth of industrial output value in
1998, accounting for 43 percent of the local total GDP.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's Governor Chai Songyue has praised private businesses
for their contributions to local economic growth in increasing
employment and the local government's tax revenue, as well as the
growth of local urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses are expanding by means of trade markets
totaling some 4,400 in the province, where over 86 percent of the
total 750,000 operators are self-employed or from private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The local booming of private businesses is regarded as a result
of the upgrading of the status of the private sector and the
adoption of a series of favorable policies for them by the
province in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale private enterprises are now mushrooming in Zhejiang,
with the number of private enterprises each with over 10 million
yuan of registered capital reaching 404 and the number of
enterprises each with 100 million yuan of output value reaching 36.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Knocks U.S. out of Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- After dropping each of the
first two sets, Patrick Rafter rallied to beat a weary Todd Martin
4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 on Sunday and send Australia on to the
Davis Cup semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
Martin's loss knocks the United States out of the competition
and sets up a meeting between Australia and Russia, which earned
its spot in the semis when Marat Safin downed Karol Kucera of
Slovakia 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Rafter rallied from deficits of two sets and three games in the
fifth set to put out a victory at Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Rafter broke Martin for the third straight service game to take
a 5-4 lead and saved out the match at love to clinch the best-of-
five quarterfinal with a 4-1 overall win.
</P>
<P>
After a neutral doctor declared him fit to play, Martin gave it
all he had against the world's second-ranked player. Even after
Rafter came back to force the fifth set, Martin got the early
break in the second game of the final set and opened a 3-0 lead.
But the American proceeded to drop his final three service games.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Lleyton Hewitt completed the 4-1 series win by beating
Alex O'Brien 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Belgium reached the Davis Cup semifinals for the first time in
the modern era when Xavier Malisse beat Switzerland's Roger
Federer in the first reverse singles match of the day.
</P>
<P>
Cedric Pioline beat Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Coffee Export Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam exported 217,000 tones of
coffee beans in the first six months of this year, an increase
10.2 percent over the same period last year, according to a report
of Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trade earned more than 300 million U.S. dollars, Vietnam's
General Statistics Office said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's coffee has been exported to more than 50 countries
and territories with the United States, Germany and Italy being
the biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
The country aims to earn more than 500 million U.S. dollars
from exports of more than 400,000 tones of coffee beans this year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is now Vietnam's second biggest farm export after rice.
The country has in the past five years become one of the world's
top ten exporters. In the 1997-98 crop, Vietnam ranked third after
Brazil and Colombia in terms of coffee export volume.
</P>
<P>
The world coffee price decreased sharply this year, and
Vietnam's coffee dropped to 1,118 U.S. dollars per tone, the
Vietnam Coffee Corporation said. Coffee prices are now on the rise
but Vietnam still has stockpiles of 50,000 tones of coffee beans
ready for export.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 ha in the country are now planted with
coffee, mainly in central highlands and central southern
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is striving to expand coffee areas to 400,000 ha with
an expected output of 550,000 tones by 2005, earning 1 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Gansu's GDP Up in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
generated 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion US dollars) in gross
domestic product in the first half of this year, up eight percent
over last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The output of summer grain in Gansu is expected to decline by
930,000 tons compared with last year as a result of a 180-day
serious drought. However, both the cash income and expenditure of
local farmers increased in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value of township-run enterprises in
Gansu totaled 29.2 billion yuan at the end of June, a 14-percent
rise. The added value of state-owned and key non-state firms
surged 6.4 percent, to reach 9.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official attributed the rapid economic growth
mainly to relatively high investment in fixed assets. Gansu
invested 11 billion yuan in fixed assets in the first half of the
year, 3.2 billion yuan more than the figure for the same period of
last year. Investment in infrastructure totaled 5.5 billion yuan,
accounting for half of the total investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Gansu's import and export value had declined to 145 million U.S.
dollars by the end of May, a drop of 27 percent compared with last
year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The disposable income of urban residents per capita at the end
of June averaged 2,255 yuan, up 13 percent.

BUDAPEST, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Gabor Balogh took the
men's individual title in the 39th Modern Pentathlon World
Championships on Sunday, helping Hungary take the team title.
</P>
<P>
Balogh, 23, sixth in Mexico City last year, took the lead after
the second discipline, fencing. But his lead over Libor Capalini
of the Czech Republic was down to just eight points after four
events, which means he had only a two-second advantage in the last
discipline, running.
</P>
<P>
Few expected Balogh to be able to maintain the first position
for he was more than a minute slower than Capalini during the
qualification race on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Balogh eventually won the race 12 seconds ahead of his
closest rival.
</P>
<P>
By winning the world championship, Balogh qualified for 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The team gold medal went to Hungary, who was 430 points ahead
of Lithuania and another 124 points ahead of Blears.
</P>
<P>
Team order was established on the basis of the total individual
scores of the team members.

<HEADLINE> China Highlights Development of Rural Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have pointed
out that stimulating the rural market is becoming increasingly
crucial to the country's economic growth in light of the
sluggishness of the urban market.
</P>
<P>
China has a rural population of 900 million, and each one-yuan-
worth of consumption will increase the demand of related
industrial and agricultural means of production by some 140
percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that 58 percent of the rural population lives on
the level of only having sufficient food and clothing, while the
proportion at the well-off level is increasing.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that the purchasing power of the well-off farmers
is comparatively high, and so the rural market has great
consumption potential.
</P>
<P>
China stepped up the development of the rural market in 1996,
and since then it has grown more active. In some cities and
provinces, the growth rate of the sales volume in rural areas has
exceeded that of the urban market.
</P>
<P>
From January to May this year, the total retail sales of the
rural market grew 6.3 percent on a year-on-year basis, only 0.6
percentage points lower than urban sales.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shouzhong, a market analyst with the State Administration
of Internal Trade (SAIT), said that the main obstacle to the
stimulation of the rural market is the low growth of farmers' cash
income.
</P>
<P>
"Only by increasing the amount of cash in farmers' pockets can
the potential of the rural market be fully tapped," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also urged domestic enterprises to develop new products
which meet the demands of the rural population, and halt the
practice of selling over-supplied goods in the rural market.
</P>
<P>
The SAIT and related government departments are making enhanced
efforts to expand sales outlets in rural areas by cultivating
chain stores, agencies, franchises and other new business formats.

<HEADLINE> Australian Insurer Invests in China's Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- AMP, Australia's largest life
insurance company, has just launched a big housing project in this,
China's leading industrial and commercial city.
</P>
<P>
AMP President George Trumbull said the move is part of the
company's massive program to increase investment in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Trumbull, the housing project will cost a total of
60 million U.S. dollars and will act as a springboard for the
insurer to enter the real estate markets in other large Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
"China has a dozen cities each with a population of at least
one million, and housing is a problem for many of them," Trumbull
said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is to construct 20 buildings
containing 800 flats in four years in the Pudong New Area, an
emerging financial and trade zone in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
AMP has put 600 million U.S. dollars-worth of investment into
the telecommunications and transportation sectors in Beijing,
Nanjing, Dalian, Xiamen and several other Chinese cities since it
entered China in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Insect Pests Under Control in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A massive infestation of insects
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, which has affected about
200,000 ha of forests, has been basically brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Triggered by abnormally warm weather last winter, the
infestation involved more than 20 species of insects, and more
than five million trees were affected.
</P>
<P>
The province organized experts for joint diagnosis of the
infestation, and they worked out biological and chemical measures
to kill the pests. Local governments at all levels raised nearly
one million yuan (120,000 US dollars) for the work.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the affected forests have received
treatment, and 356,000 diseased trees have been chopped down,
according to Sun Yongping, director of the province's forest
insect pest prevention office.
</P>
<P>
"The threat from the first generation of the pests is easing,
but another round of infestation by the second generation may
break out this autumn or next year," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is expected to set up an early-warning system
regarding insect infestation so as to deal with the problem as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has a forest coverage rate of only about 30 percent,
with 4.45 million ha of trees.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's PDI-P Holds National Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) Chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri opened a
closed-door leadership meeting in Depok near Jakarta on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In her address, Megawati said although some members of the
political elite are still reluctant to acknowledge the PDI-P
victory, the party must continue to take "the way of truth" it has
been fighting for.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep fighting for this, trust me, the PDI-P will win
again in the next elections," she was quoted by The Indonesian
Observer Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
While saying it is too early to celebrate the triumph, Megawati
told the party to become a "humble victor".
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P gained about 34 percent of votes in the June 7
general elections, far outnumbering the ruling Golkar Party which
trails the leading party with around 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
The three-day leadership meeting is expected to reconfirm the
party's nomination of Megawati as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
"Her nomination was mandated by the party's previous congress,
so we hope everybody will stick to what was decided by the
congress," the party's Deputy Chairman Soetardjo Soerjogoeritno
said.
</P>
<P>
Soetardjo said the meeting would draw up the criteria for
candidates to fill seats in the House of Representatives won by
the party from its leftover votes, as stipulated by the General
Elections Commission (KPU).
</P>
<P>
He refused to confirm whether party leaders would discuss a
coalition arrangement with other parties, saying they would wait
until the KPU announced the official poll results. The
announcement is tentatively scheduled for July 25.
</P>
<P>
Attendants will also evaluate the party's performance across
the country, Soetardjo was quoted by The Jakarta Post as saying.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Bank Loans Inch up In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in months,
bank's lending of the Philippines inched up by 0.3 percent in May
from 1.3 percent contraction in April, Malaya newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted central bank governor Rafael Buenaventura as
saying that commercial banks' total loan portfolio expanded by 3.6
billion pesos (90 million U.S. dollars) to 1.468 trillion pesos
(36.7 billion dollars) from the previous month's portfolio of
1.4652 trillion pesos (36.63 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since loan portfolio expanded, the system's non-performing or
souring loans (NPL) lightly dropped from 14.48 percent in April to
14.45 percent in May, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said that both the increase in outstanding loans
and the minimal decrease in NPLs are encouraging sighs of renewing
vitality in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the asset deterioration of the Philippine
banking system is lower than NPL ratio of the other countries in
the region ranging from 19 to 75 percent as of May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, banks continue to build up their loan loss reserves
way above the requirement of the central bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, the loan loss reserves as of May
amounted to 70.8 billion pesos (1.77 billion dollars), covering
33.4 percent of soured loans and accounting for 4.8 percent of the
total loan portfolio.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs 6 Billion Dollars to Plug Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia needed between 5.5 and 6
billion U.S. dollars in new foreign loans to plug the 1999/2000
state budget deficit, according to the National Development
Planning Board (Bappenas) Chairman Boediono.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the needed loans had been secured after the
country's largest donors, including Japan and the World Bank,
confirmed their financial support earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The total (overseas loans) we need is between 5.5 billion and
6 billion dollars for the 1999/2000 fiscal year (ending March
2000). But some (of the needed loan) have been pledged," he was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Boediono said the remaining budget shortfall was expected to be
covered by commitments from donors at the upcoming Consultative
Group on Indonesia (CGI) meeting in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia particularly needs program loans to help finance the
costly bank restructuring program, which required 17 trillion
rupiah (2.54 billion dollars) of the current state budget.
</P>
<P>
The government, the World Bank and the chairman of the CGI have
been pressured by Indonesian opposition parties and several
non-governmental organizations to postpone the upcoming donors
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties say new loan negotiations should be held
under the country's next administration, which will be formed
later this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Boediono said a delay of the CGI meeting would damage
confidence in the economy because the market would be nervous
about the hole in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
He also said the current administration would only negotiate
for loans to finance the 1999/2000 state budget.
</P>
<P>
The government would not negotiate for loans needed for the
2000/2001 state budget, he said, adding this would be the
responsibility of the next administration.
</P>
<P>
Several government officials earlier said several CGI members
were ready to provide some 5 billion dollars in new loans at the
next CGI meeting. The country received some 7.9 billion dollars
from CGI last year.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita is scheduled to leave for Tokyo on Monday,
where he will meet with high-ranking Japanese officials and seek
Japan's support at the CGI meeting.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Indonesia's largest donor.

<HEADLINE> China's Medicine Storage for Emergencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish a multi-
level medicine storage and supply network in order to provide
efficient medical aids in the wake of natural disasters, epidemics
and other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The network will include central and local medicine storage
facilities storing some 1.2 billion yuan (145 million U.S. dollars)
worth of drugs and medical appliances, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country has decided to allocate 550 million yuan (66.3
million dollars) to prepare medical supplies for possible
nationwide disasters, while local medicine storage facilities will
be established with funds from provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
China established a medicine storage system composed of 13
medicine storage banks in the 1970s, all funded and managed by the
central government.
</P>
<P>
"However, the country's shift to a market-oriented economy has
put some storage banks into budget difficulties since the 1990s,
leading to a shrinking medical storage that no longer satisfies
the State's need in times of emergencies," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical Department under the State Economic and Trade
Commission will be responsible for the overall management and
supervision of the network.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Population Institute
intends to expand cooperation with China in the next few years to
increase world understanding of China's family planning program,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes a senior official
with the institute as saying in Beijing that the cooperation will
also introduce China's experience in managing its economy and its
social welfare system to other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The institute plans to cooperate with the State Family Planning
Commission (SFPC) to publish a Chinese edition of its volume on
success stories in population development.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies will also discuss further personnel exchanges so
that more Chinese family planning workers can be trained in
delivering information and services and have the chance to observe
population programs in the United States, said Werner Fornos,
president of the institute.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Population Institute, launched in 1969, is the largest
U.S. non-governmental organization in the population field. It has
maintained a close co-operative relationship with the SFPC since
1984.
</P>
<P>
Fornos said he has witnessed great changes in China including a
sharp decline in population growth, improved economic conditions,
success in poverty eradication efforts, empowering of women,
community projects, and improvements in sanitation, housing and
education.
</P>
<P>
"Looking into the year 2000 and beyond, I think China is a
valuable partner in international development, especially in south-
to-south relations and teaching countries in the developing world
to manage their economy and social system," he said.
</P>
<P>
He highly commended China's Family Planning University in
Nanjing, the only one in the world, the paper reports.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Trade Issues Play Central Part in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Sunday wound up his two-week visit to Japan and the United
States, which was seen by analysts as a trip to boost Australian
exports and discuss disturbing trade issues.
</P>
<P>
With its recent economic boom and ability to ride out the
Asian financial storm, Australia feels the need to expand its
overseas markets, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's gross domestic product grew 5 percent in 1998,
faster than the U.S. economy and more than double the aggregate
growth rate of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and OECD forecast that in 2000
Australia will grow faster than all Group-7 economies.
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, Australia, as an agricultural exporter
with a tiny domestic market, has no choice but to persist with its
arguments for free trade, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the markets of Japan and the United States, the
top two trade partners of Australia, are of much significance to
the country's exports, they said.
</P>
<P>
On trade, Howard's trip to Japan has two aims. The first aim is
to broaden Australia's exports to Japan from traditional
commodities to new industries, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the five-day visit to Japan, Howard and
his Japanese counterpart Keizo Obuchi reached agreement on a joint
approach to electric commerce and a millennium conference to
discuss new technology.
</P>
<P>
Japan also approved the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to
register to trade securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The e-commerce agreement will see the removal of legal
obstacles to electronic transactions and the promotion of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Second aim is to push for more opening of Japanese
agricultural markets, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Howard used his meeting with Obuchi to urge Japan to be
committed to reforming its own economy, opening its markets and
promoting free trade.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese, who have yet to get rid of the effect of
Asian financial crisis and pursue the policy of food security,
greater agricultural self-sufficiency, offered only their own
version on the issues.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Obuchi explained our basic position on
agriculture, which is going to be the agenda of WTO negotiations,"
said Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Chikahito Harada.
</P>
<P>
Howard's U.S. trip was overshadowed even before it started,
following President Bill Clinton's announcement of imposing a
quota on lamb import from Australia, New Zealand and some other
countries, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The United States also slapped a 9 percent tariff on sales
within the quota and a 40 percent penalty on sales outside the
quota.
</P>
<P>
Analysts of the Australian lamb industry said the decision
could cost the country up to 9.9 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although Howard condemned the decision as "appalling" and
"hypocritical", he acknowledged that he had little chance of
having the decision reversed.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is constantly encouraging people to support
free trade and condemning others who don't practice it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But when it suits their own convenience, because they are the
strongest country in the world, they just slam on these punitive
tariffs."
</P>
<P>
"In the end, we can only complain - and protect our own," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lamb dominated the meeting between Howard and Clinton in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
And Howard warned Clinton that his attack on Australian lamb
producers had harmed bilateral relations more than any decision in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
"I made it plain to him the issue had caused a greater adverse
reaction in Australia on a trade matter than any other trade issue
that I could remember," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"The president understood we were very angered about it and
very upset about it," he added.
</P>
<P>
From the U.S. political perspective, the decision was obvious,
the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. consumers are spread throughout the United States and
will not change their votes on inferior and slightly more
expensive lamb as a result of the decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. farmers, however, have made it very clear to their
congressional representatives that they would change their votes
and the representatives have pressured the White House.
</P>
<P>
There are votes and political benefits in caving in to
protectionism, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, Howard still has a great deal of difficult
talks ahead to promote Australia's exports, even after he
concluded his trade mission to the two countries, they said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese in Cairo Slam Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Chinese community in
Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday slammed the recent separatist remarks made
by Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui that the cross-Straits relationship is "
state-to-state."
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaiyu, a doctor, said at a meeting organized by the
Chinese Embassy here that Lee Teng-hui's fallacy has exposed his
premeditated intentions to divide China and split the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
If Lee's attempts should succeed, China would be dismembered
and face the danger of war, and ethnic Chinese all over the world
would lose dignity, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed indignation over Lee's separatist remarks, adding
that they can not represent the wishes of the Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, leader of the Taiwan authorities, claimed in an
interview with a German radio early this month that the Taiwan
authorities had defined the relationship across the Taiwan Straits
as "state-to-state, or at least special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has condemned Lee's remarks as an utter
exposure of his premeditated intentions to divide Chinese
territory and sovereignty, and create "two Chinas," "one China,
one Taiwan" or "Taiwan's independence."
</P>
<P>
Ge Xin'ai, a former women's table tennis world champion and a
coach in Egypt now, said it is universally acknowledged that there
is only one China in the world and that Taiwan is an inseparable
part of China.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Chinese living abroad are firmly opposed to Lee's
separatist remarks and hope that China will be reunified as soon
as possible, she said.
</P>
<P>
All other participants in the meeting also lashed out at Lee's
separatist remarks and expressed confidence that his attempts to
split the country are doomed to failure and that China will
eventually accomplish its sacred task of national reunification.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu State Sector Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The state sector in east China's
Jiangsu Province, one of the country's economic powerhouses, has
become profitable this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the state-owned enterprises and major non-
public manufacturers in the province generated a total of 102.1
billion yuan in added industrial value in the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises achieved 1.1 billion yuan in
profits during the January-May period, compared with a loss of 839
million yuan during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the upward trend to years of
restructuring and improved management.
</P>
<P>
They predict that the momentum will continue throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu achieved 155.4 billion yuan in gross domestic product (
GDP) in the first quarter of the year, accounting for one-tenth of
the country's total GDP.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Move Downtown Manufacturers to Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- This, China's leading industrial
and commercial city has decided not to start any new industrial
projects in its downtown districts in principle.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal economic commission noted that
the decision is part of a massive program to remove local
industries to the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the city has started to build nine
city-level manufacturing centers with a total designed area of 250
sq km on its outskirts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the new centers have so far registered
about 2,000 industrial projects, of which 764 are funded by
overseas investors, including 46 funded by some of the world's top
500 multinationals.
</P>
<P>
These new centers have been busily building up their major
industries in line with the city's industrial restructuring plan.
The Jiading Industrial Zone, for example, has already established
four pillar industries: automotive accessories, refrigeration
equipment, electronic goods and metal processing.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts predict that the industrial centers will become
modernized satellite towns in the years to come.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes on Sunday
struck Iraqi missile and communication sites in the southern
no-fly zone, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
Targets included a surface-to-air missile site near Abu, about
200 miles (320 km) south of Baghdad, and a communication site near
Al Khidr, about 150 miles (240km) southeast of Baghdad, said the
U.S. Central Command, based at Mac Dill Air Force Base in Tampa,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
The command said the strike was carried by U.S. Air Force
F-16s, along with a Navy F-a-18 and F-14 aircraft, which fired
precision guided missiles at their targets at about 10:15 a.m.
EST (1415 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Iraq said 14 people were killed and 17 injured by the U.S.
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in the southern and northern Iraq were
imposed by the United States and Britain right after the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has announced that any foreign warplanes invading its
space would violate its sovereignty and would be fired.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Reject FA Cup Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The debate over Manchester United's
withdrawal from the FA Cup drags on - with the club rejecting
another potential solution, according to local reports here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Martin Edwards has declared there is no chance of the
club fielding their youth team in the competition.
</P>
<P>
It had been suggested that United's youngsters could compete
while the senior side contests the World Club Championship in
Brazil in January.
</P>
<P>
"The FA would certainly give this idea every consideration,"
said Football Association chairman Geoff Thompson.
</P>
<P>
"The rules state that a club must field its best available team.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, that would appear to be the players left behind
who have not gone to Brazil."
</P>
<P>
But Edwards says such a scheme is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
"No offer of that nature has been made to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently said that every option was reviewed and
our decision has been made."
</P>
<P>
The Treble-winners have been accused of devaluing the famous
old competition by pulling out, but Edwards added: "I think that
it would devalue the competition even more for us to play the
youth team.
</P>
<P>
"What would the long-term ramifications of that be in terms of
other clubs in the future?"
</P>
<P>
As the debate continues United are on a lucrative overseas tour.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday the first team beat the Australian national team 1-0
in a friendly in Sydney watched by over 78,000 people.
</P>
<P>
But Edwards insists the Brazil trip is wanted only by the FA to
help England's 2006 World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
He remains keen to shift blame for the decision away from the
club.
</P>
<P>
"We would have preferred to have played in the FA Cup but we
changed our minds purely because of the government pressure," he
told The Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
"The government and the FA put it on our conscience."
</P>
<P>
But Thompson told the Sunday Times that the World Cup bid was
not the main factor.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that the FA would still have adopted the same
intensity about United going even if there was no vote on 2006,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The chance of an English team, a European team, becoming world
champion is too great an opportunity to pass up.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the reaction of some people but I believe it
is a bold decision by the FA in a one-off situation.
</P>
<P>
"We must become more international and less insular."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The British Open golf championship,
which is being held in Carnoustie, Scotland has gone into a three-
way play-off with Scotland's Paul Lawrie, Justin Leonard of the
United States and France's Jean Van de Velde.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Van de Velde tossed away a three-stroke lead at the
final hole in one of the most dramatic finishes in the
championship's history on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lawrie, who carded a final round 67, and Leonard, 72, waiting
to see what happened, Van de Velde chipped out of the sand and
then rolled in a 4-foot putt to join the duo in a play-off.

<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Paul Lawrie of Scotland held off
French qualifier Jean Van de Velde and 1997 champion Justin
Leonard in a four hole play-off to win the British Open golf
championship in Carnoustie, Scotland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old from Aberdeen birdied the third play-off hole --
the 17th - and then kept his nerve with a superb approach on the
last to make another birdie three as his rivals faltered.
</P>
<P>
The trio had finished the regulation 72 holes on six-over-par
290.
</P>
<P>
Lawrie had earlier fired a four-under par 67, the best round of
the day, to close a seven-shot gap on overnight leader Van de
Velde.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman blew a three-shot cushion on the last hole,
taking a triple bogey seven when a six would have given him the
title.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Strive for Peace with Its Neighbors: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said on Sunday that Israel will strive for peace with
its neighbors so as to strengthen the country. He left open the
option of a Palestinian state but refused to budge on the thorny
issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak, in a taped interview broadcast by NBC, said that time is
now right to "leave no stone unturned" in the road to strengthen
Israel "through peace with all its neighbors".
</P>
<P>
"I believe that within 15 months from now, we will know whether
we have a major breakthrough on the Palestinian, Syrian, and
Lebanese tracks or not," he told Jim Russert, the anchor man of
NBC television's "Meet the Press" program.
</P>
<P>
"This is a moment of truth. We should live up to the challenge
and put an end to the conflict of 100 years while strengthening,
rather than weakening, the state of Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
When ask about the possibility of a "true" Palestinian state to
be set up in the future, Barak said, "when the time comes, the
Palestinians will have to negotiate with us what kind of entity is
shaped for them in a context, a wider context of all the other
issues that are on the table."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Barak, who arrived here on Wednesday for his first
visit to the United States since winning Israel's general election
last May, remained firm on the issue of Jerusalem, which both the
Israelis and the Palestinians have claimed to be the center of
their states.
</P>
<P>
"A united sovereign Jerusalem is our capital, and will remain
so forever," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he is willing to make compromises to
achieve peace with Syria, but it depends on what the Syrians will
offer on such matters as stopping Lebanese terror, water
resources, the opening of embassies and borders, security and
early warning arrangements and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
view, Barak ruled out the need for the presence of U.S. troops in
the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that U.S. troops will be needed in the Golan
Heights. Maybe there will be a need for a few dozens of foreign
observers or controllers or members of inspections teams. All like
this would be provided by either American or other U.N. leading
members," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also tried to exclude the involvement of the CIA in the
Mid-east peace process. "Once we resume trust with our neighbors,
I don't think that there will be a real need for CIA agents to
look after the last Palestinian policemen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has held several rounds of talks with President Bill
Clinton in the past few days, implied in his remarks that the
United States should be "sensitive to the needs of the Arabs"
while remaining Israel's "best ally.".
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has been and will be in the future an ally of Israel,
may be the best ally we have. At the same time, without being an
honest broker sensitive to the needs of the Arabs, it cannot
facilitate the kind of services for the peace process," said
Barak, who is to have further meetings with Clinton on Monday.
