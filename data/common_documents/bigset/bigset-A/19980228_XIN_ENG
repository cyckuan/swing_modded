<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts NGOs and Donors Forum on Nature Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The second forum attended by
non-governmental organizations (NGO) and donors concerned with
China's nature conservation work ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Focussing on progress and problems in the management of China's
nature reserves, the forum is scheduled for once every two years
and aims to promote coordination and cooperation among NGOs and
donors on the one hand and the Chinese government on the other.
</P>
<P>
The forum made a positive evaluation of the improvements in
China's nature protection work in recent years. It also selected
some areas in which various NGOs can make even greater
contributions.
</P>
<P>
"We hope China will become a model for the world in achieving
both good nature conservation work and sustainable community
development," said Susan Chen, a senior ecologist from the World
Bank, who is currently in charge of a Chinese nature reserve
management project funded jointly by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) and the Chinese government, with some 20 million US
dollars donated by the GEF.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Yongfan, deputy-director in charge of wildlife
conservation under the Ministry of Forestry, China has one of the
world's richest wild species resources.
</P>
<P>
He extended thanks to the NGOs attending the forum for their
contributions to China's ecological improvements, saying that the
Chinese government will continually take an active stand on
cooperating with the NGOs in the conservation of nature.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has altogether nearly 800 nature reserves,
accounting for some 7.3 percent of its total land area.
</P>
<P>
Representatives and officials from the UN Development Programme
(UNDP), World Bank, GEF, Ford Foundation, World Resources
Institute, Sino-U.S. Friendship Volunteers, and China's Ministry
of Forestry, Ministry of Finance, State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, Academy of Sciences and nature reserves attended the
forum.

<HEADLINE> Kohl: Euro Set to Start Punctually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Friday said the single European currency will come into being on
schedule in 1999 after statistics showed that Germany, France and
Italy will meet the budget deficit requirement for joining.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that the Euro (single currency) will come punctually
on January 1, 1999. And it will be a stable currency, just like
the German mark over the past 50 years," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after the German federal statistics office
announced that Germany had a less-than-expected budget deficit of
2.7 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, well below the 3
percent limit set by the European Union Maastricht Treaty for the
Euro membership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France, Italy, and Finland, also announced Friday
that their budgets were also in line with the criteria.
</P>
<P>
It is now widely expected that around ten or eleven EU member
states will be able to make the first wave to join the Euro in
1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the final decision on the membership line-up has still
to be made by leaders of the 15 EU members during a special summit
on May 2.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis Costs S. Korea Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 934,000 South Koreans were
unemployed in January, the highest level since 1987, while
consumption and investments tumbled to record lows due to the
country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics issued Friday by South Korea's National
Statistical Office, an additional 276,000 workers lost their jobs
last month, raising the unemployment rate to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rates last December and in January 1997 stood at
3.1 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. The country has a
population of 44 million.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output in January fell by 10.3 percent over the
same month last year, the biggest monthly drop since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Last month also saw 3,323 companies bankrupt, up from 3,197 in
the previous month, reflecting snowballing job cuts and industrial
slump.
</P>
<P>
As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and South Korea
recently set the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) growth
target for 1998 at 1 percent or less, the number of unemployed
workers might reach 2 million by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retail and wholesale sales dropped by 8.7 percent in
January compared with the same month last year, the biggest
monthly decline since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that a variety of stringent IMF-imposed economic
measures, such as the government's fiscal cuts, low GDP
growth and industrial restructuring, will further depress the
economy this year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's financial crisis was caused by corporate failures
and bad loans of financial institutions since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the IMF last December for a
bail-out loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to
restructure its economy, open its markets and shut down ailing
financial institutions.

<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, sent
a letter of congratulations on the opening here today of a
national conference of directors of commodity inspection bureaus.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said in
the letter that the year 1997 saw new achievements made in the
commodity inspection field, with better-trained staff and a
remarkable upgrading of the quality of work.
</P>
<P>
As important economic supervisory and executive
law-enforcement organs involving foreign business, the commodity
inspection bureaus play an important role in the country's
socialist construction, especially in the field of opening
to the outside world and Sino-foreign economic and trade
development, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his hope that a socialist commodity inspection
system full of dynamism and vitality would be set up as soon as
possible, adapted to both the socialist market-oriented economy
and international practice.
</P>
<P>
China's commodity inspection bureaus inspected 2.3 million
batches of import and export commodities in 1997, with the total
value of goods reaching 108 billion US dollars. In addition,
progress has been made in its efforts in applying ISO9000
series standards to export-oriented enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China has closed 1,650
illegal paging service providers in order to put an end to serious
radio communications disturbances for aircraft and other
inconveniences brought about by wireless paging services.
</P>
<P>
Today's overseas edition of the ``People's Daily'' quoted an
official from the State Radio Management Committee as saying that
irrational locations of paging service providers and poor quality
of related equipment are the main factors affecting normal airplane
flights and disturbing radio astronomy and military
telecommunications.

The official said that in recent years China has witnessed a
rapid development of paging services. The country now has over
26,000 radio paging transmitters, with more than 50 million pager
holders.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the 1,650 illegal paging services
providers accounted for 60 percent of the country's total paging
transmitters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the paging service providers located on
mountains will be relocated in other places, in a bid to clear
disturbances affecting Beijing's International Airport, Shenzhen
Airport and Guangzhou's Baiyun International Airport.

<HEADLINE> CIA Drafts Covert Plan to Topple Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The CIA has drafted a plant
for a major program of sabotage and subversion against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, the International Herald Tribune said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for enlisting Kurdish and Shiite agents to
destroy or damage key Iraqi pillars of economic and political
power, such as utility plants or government broadcast stations,
the newspaper quoted some U.S. officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the plan calls for increasing political
pressure on Iraq through propaganda programs such as "Radio Free
Iraq" broadcast to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to try to undermine Saddam by showing Iraqi
citizens that he is not invincible, strengthening his opponents
inside Iraq and trying to ignite a rebellion within his inner
circle.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a propaganda operation. This is a major campaign
of sabotage," a senior government official said of the CIA plan.
</P>
<P>
For the plan to go forward, President Bill Clinton must sign a
written order, known as a "finding."
</P>
<P>
If it is approved as now conceived, it could become one of the
biggest covert actions since the end of the Cold War, costing tens
of millions of U.S. dollars a year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf War in 1991, the CIA has backed Kurdish
dissidents in the north of Iraq, Shiite Muslim groups in the
south, Iraqi exiles in London and Iraqi military defectors based
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
These operations, which have cost about 100 million U.S.
dollars, have had little or no success.
</P>
<P>
The plan, still in the draft stage, has now been disclosed by
the officials because they had doubts on it.
</P>
<P>
They consider the new plan no more likely to succeed than the
agency's earlier effort.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, in August 1996, Saddam sent tanks into northern
Iraq to destroy a CIA base staffed by U.S. intelligence officers
and Kurdish agents, arresting and executing score of Kurds.
</P>
<P>
But now influential senators are calling on the agency once
more.
</P>
<P>
"It may well be that a covert action or covert actions might
succeed in deposing Saddam Hussein," Democratic Senator Arlen
Specter said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Leave Lebanon After Security Guaranteed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel will pull out its
military forces from south Lebanon only after reaching an
agreement on security with the lebanese government, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a Jewish delegation from Canada, Netanyahu said
Israel is interested in the U.N. resolution 425 and so does the
Lebanese government, and if the security of northern Israel is
guaranteed, Israel will withdraw its troops from the security
zone in South Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution 425 was adopted in 1978, asking Israel to
withdraw troops from South Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the Israeli side believes that the Lebanese
government could not decide independently on any security issue
with Israel because of Syria.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian government uses Lebanon as a surrogate battlefield
against Israel and it supports Hezbollah (Party of God) to fight
against Israel," Netanyahu added.
</P>
<P>
On the territory dispute with Syria, Netanyahu said that the
Golan Heights is a "wall of protection" to Israel and Israel could
not return it to Syria unless Israel's security is safeguard.
</P>
<P>
Israel is ready to discuss all issues the Syrian government
wants to put onto the negotiating table, and the negotiations must
be held unconditionally, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's words on security issues with Lebanon and Syria
were apparently related to the intensified military conflicts in
South Lebanon over the last few weeks between Israeli forces and
local resistance groups including Iranian-backed hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, three Israel soldiers were killed and
three others wounded, two of them seriously, in a long-range
Hezbollah mortar attack on the Israeli outpost in the western
sector of the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The three dead Israeli soldiers, including captain Assaf
Rosenfeld, 21, were reportedly laid to rest at different military
cemeteries on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in South
Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern security, in the face of
strong resistance which is fighting to end Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Make Progress on Gaza Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to clear the
way for the opening of Dahaniya airport in southern Gaza Strip,
Israeli and Palestinian leaders met in Gaza Friday to make
progress on the issue, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Palestinian National Authority's (PNA)
deputy leader Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai confirmed they have made headway in dealing with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
He added that they agreed to continue discussions next week,
which will be carried out within the framework of joint working
committees.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abu Mazen reportedly raised other issues,
such as the plan for a safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank
and release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation
Authority Fayez Zeidan said that there were still points of
contention holding up an agreement on the airport, relating to
security and civil aviation procedures.
</P>
<P>
The talks over Gaza airport was held as Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks have been stalled for nearly a year over Israeli
expansion of settlement and the long-delayed Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz Friday quoted a senior U.S. government
source as saying the U.S. will not immediately present Israel and
the PNA with its proposals for a second-phase pullback from the
territories, but will wait a while to give the two sides time to
solve other problems, such as the opening of Dahaniya airport.
</P>
<P>
The source refused to say how long Washington would wait
before officially offering its plan for an Israeli withdrawal
form 13.1 percent of the West Bank over a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said Thursday
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had promised President
Arafat in a letter to renew U.S. efforts to revive the peace
process following the easing of the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
But he said the message from Albright does not contain any
specific proposals to resolve the differences between Israel and
PNA.

<HEADLINE> Israel Apologizes to Switzerland for Mossad Foul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel officially apologized
to Switzerland Friday for a bungled bugging operation by its
secret intelligence service Mossad in a Bern suburb, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry Director Eitan Ben-tsur wrote in a
letter to Swiss President and Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti that
Israel regretted the complications caused by the attempt to bug
suspected Islamic militants in a building in Bern.
</P>
<P>
But Ben-tsur defended the Mossad operation, citing that
terrorists are threatening the security and safety of Israel and
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two countries will well resolve the
incident and keep their sound bilateral relations intact.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Swiss dispute was made public by Israeli media
reports on Wednesday that five Mossad agents were caught
red-handed last week by Swiss police while trying to wiretap an
apartment block in the Bern.
</P>
<P>
The reports speculated that the Mossad agents were targeting a
member of the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah, which,
along with other resistance forces, is fighting against Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has reportedly intended to solve the
problem quietly through diplomatic channels, but the reports in
Israel have forced it to publicize the case.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland charged Israel for violating its sovereignty and
international laws, but said the incident would be quickly settled
if Israel officially apologizes.
</P>
<P>
The botched Mossad incident, following a failed attempt on the
life of a Hamas political leader in Jordan's capital Amman last
September, has chilled the friendly relations between Israel and
Switzerland, which have been conducting close intelligence
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss president has yet to decide if to go ahead with his
scheduled visit to Israel in May or to postpone it in protest.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Britain Discuss EU Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's special envoy for
Cyprus, Sir David Hannay, said here Friday that there will be
quiet diplomacy regarding the participation of Turkish Cypriots
in Cyprus' accession talks with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after a meeting with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, during which they discussed what he called "a
number of sensitive subjects".
</P>
<P>
"We concentrated particularly on things that the British
presidency has been asked to do by the EU on the approach to a
joint negotiating team," the envoy told reporters. Britain is
holding the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the approach to be agreed upon will have to
"reconcile and meet all hopes anywhere."
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to go into any further details, noting
that he agrees "100 percent" with the views expressed by Cypriot
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides that this is a time for quiet
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Hannay said he might be returning to Cyprus next week when EU
External Relations Commissioner, Hans Van den Broek, will visit
the island.
</P>
<P>
The British envoy arrived here Thursday for a 24-hour visit,
working on a formula for the Turkish Cypriot participation in the
Cyprus-EU membership talks, due to start on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Hannay said he had asked to see Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf
Denktash, but was refused, partly because of British government's
decision last month to require visas for Turkish Cypriots
travelling to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader also denounced the EU decision on
membership talks with Cypriot government and took retaliatory
measures, including suspension of bicommunal contacts with the
Greek Cypriot side since last December.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federal state, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Israel Posts Low Economic Growth Rate for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Treasury has
readjusted the country's economic growth rate to as low as 2
percent in 1998, the The Jerusalem Post newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Treasury was quoted by the daily as
saying that this growth rate, which is 1 to 1.5 percentage point
lower than originally projected, will be the lowest in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the slowdown of the economy to recent
concerns about the tense situation in the Gulf area, which have
deterred investments in Israel and also forced the country to add
a considerable spending in defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in southeast Asia also plays a role,
indirectly eating into Israel's economic growth by as much as 0.8
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said that tourism, one of the major sources of
Israel's income, is undergoing a prolonged slowdown due to a
series of terrorist attacks last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics said on
Thursday that the economy continued to stagnate through December
and January.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Prime Minister's office announced that
it is attempting to organize an economic gathering of leaders of
the public and private sectors and workers in a bid to formulate
an overall program to cut the unemployment rate and boost economic
growth to 4 to 5 percent as seen a couple of years ago.

<HEADLINE> Russian Gov't Decides to Bury Tsar's Remains in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government made a
decision to bury the remains of the last Russian Tsar Nicholas II
and his family in St. Petersburg on July 17, 1998, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A special government meeting chaired by First Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov ruled that the royal remains should be
placed in the Romanov family vault in the cathedral of the St.
Peter and St. Paul Fortress.
</P>
<P>
The decision has at last ended the long-standing dispute over
the buried address for the Tsar's remains.
</P>
<P>
The last Russian Tsar Nicholas II and his family were killed by
a Bolshevik firing squad in July 1918. The site of burial of the
Romanov family was discovered off the old Koptyaki road 18
kilometers from Yekaterinburg in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The government commission on identification and burial of the
remains was set up in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov, who headed the government commission, described the
decision as "completely well-considered and appropriate."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was to
make arrangements for the funeral. The St. Petersburg
administration, the Russian Orthodox hierarchy and surviving
Romanovs were to be involved.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to publish records of the
execution, including the archives of Sokolov, a White Guard
investigator of the killing, and notes by Yurovsky, commander of
the firing squad.

<HEADLINE> Greek Official: Defense Pact Backs Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Foreign
Under-Secretary Yiannos Kranidiotis said Friday that a joint
defense pact between Greece and Cyprus plays a key role in backing
diplomatic efforts to seek a settlement for the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Cypriot National Guard
Commander Nicolaos Vorvolakos, Kranidiotis said that "the dogma
serves the diplomatic effort undertaken for a peaceful and just
solution in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a defense pact in 1993, under which
Greece will provide Cyprus with military assistance in case the
Greek Cypriots are attacked.
</P>
<P>
The defense pact is part of the policy pursued by the two
countries, the Greek official added, stressing that without
defense there would be no successful diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis noted that the Greek Cypriots have the inalienable
right to strengthen their defense as long as there is a lack of
satisfactory political solution in the country.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north in 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by Greek Cypriot supporters for a union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis arrived here Tuesday on a five-day visit to discuss
with the Cypriot side on renewed international efforts to settle
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federal state, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Kaklamanis Slams U.S. for Being Partial to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis Friday criticized the U.S. for giving
unprincipled support to neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with U.S. Ambassador in Athens Nicholas
Burns, Kaklamanis said that the U.S. had not convinced anyone that
it was truly interested in offering its good services to Greece
and Turkey. On the contrary, he said, the U.S. was acting as
Turkey's "guardian and patron."
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his opposition to the pressure being
exerted by Washington on the European Union (EU) concerning the
participation of Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus-EU accession talks as
well as Turkey's future in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis stressed that his country would not give in to any
form of blackmail or to any interference by third parties.
</P>
<P>
Greece has opposed the equal participation of Turkish Cypriots
in Cyprus's accession negotiations with the EU, saying that Athens
wants them to be involved in the negotiations with two conditions.
The Turkish Cypriots' participation would not lead to the
recognition of northern Cyprus and not create obstacles to the
island republic's accession to the EU, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on statements by U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Mark Grossman, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said that anyone concerned about growing tension in the Aegean Sea
should intervene and seek a solution with those causing the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Grossman reportedly described the situation in the Aegean as
"very dangerous," saying that Washington would do something to
defuse the tension there.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- French writer Roger Garaudy was
condemned to pay 120,000 francs (20,000 U.S. dollars) in fines for
disputing crimes against humanity and racial defamation by the
Correctional Tribunal of Paris Friday.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, who was formerly a Roman Catholic and a militant of
the French Communist Party but later converted to Islam, said in
"The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics," a book published in
1996, that the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was
exaggerated by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old writer was absent from the court-room when the
judgement was read by Judge Jean-Yves Monfort, while the elite
mobile gendarmery military police formed a cordon to protect the
court from a group of Jewish youths outside shouting "Death to the
Nazis!"
</P>
<P>
The editor and publisher of "The Founding Myths of Israeli
Politics," Pierre Guillaume, was cleared of accusation of
"disputing crimes against humanity" by the court.
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was made, Garaudy said that he would make an
appeal.

LUANDA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
Friday, expressing his concerns over the former rebel party's
refusal to implement the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
According to Aldeniro da Conceicao, spokesman for the
Presidential Office, the president has said in the letter that
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
has sabotaged the stability and peace process, and thus rendering
the materialisation of the February 28 deadline for the country's
peace impossible.
</P>
<P>
President Santos also urged UNITA to take correct attitude to
keep the country from going into another civil war, adding that
UNITA is recapturing land.
</P>
<P>
He asked the international community, especially the United
States to take actions to stop UNITA from bringing peace process
in Angola into failure.
</P>
<P>
The president called the international community to press
UNITA to change its attitude which seems to be obstructing the
talk between him and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
President Santo's letter is an answer to Albright who has
written several letters to him after her December visit to
Angola.

GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 exhibitors from
over 40 countries and regions will participate in the 26th
International Exhibition of Inventions to be held here next month.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 inventions in all aspects will be on show. The
organizers believe that some of them are spectacular and will be
popular items in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
They predict that the show from March 27 to April 5 will
attract 100,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide representation of the exhibition this year is
even more marked: more and better organized exhibitors from
eastern Europe will be present, often with the official support of
their respective governments, according to a press release of the
organizing committee here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asian participants are those from China, Malaysia, South Korea,
and for the first time, Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Regularly well-represented countries in the exhibition are
France, Germany, Italy and Spain. There will be more exhibitors
from North America.
</P>
<P>
The organizers claim that the highly professional nature of the
world's most important exhibition of inventions is due to the fact
that international industry and business structures have realized
that this Geneva event is a real "gold mine" for new products,
ready to be manufactured and marketed.

<HEADLINE> Burundian President to Visit France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Burundian President Pierre
Buyoya will pay a working visit to France on March 5 and 6, during
which he will be received by President Jacques Chirac, said the
Burundian embassy here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya will give a press conference in Paris on "the security,
political, economic and social situation of Burundi and on the
results of his meetings with French leaders," said the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian president will also meet with French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine and Delegate Minister of Cooperation
Charles Josselin.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit of eight African countries decided last
weekend in Kampala, Uganda, to maintain the 18-months-old economic
sanction imposed on Burundi since Buyoya came to power in a
bloodless coup d'etat on July 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of these countries said the sanction is aimed at
forcing Buyoya to talk with Hutu rebels waging a war with
Tutsi-led government forces for three years.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Liberation early this
week, Buyoya said that his country will "continue to function"
despite the economic sanction.
</P>
<P>
He also accused some "personalities" of Burundi's neighboring
countries of preparing to interfere in Burundi when the country
was in full chaos in 1996 prior to his coming to power.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 people have been killed over the past three years
in the war between Tutsi-led government forces and Hutu rebels in
the tiny central African state, similar in ethnic composition and
size with neighboring Rwanda.

HANOI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's National Assembly has
approved government decrees to fight corruption and waste and to
regulate the rights and activities of public servants.
</P>
<P>
The decrees meet the urgent needs of Vietnam's social and
economic development and help purify and strengthen the state, an
official statement said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption decree contains measures to prevent, detect

</P>
<P>
The statement said the government and the communist party have
endeavoured to uncover and deal with cases of corruption, but its
efforts had failed to eliminate the problem.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption ordinance was aimed at intensifying the
struggle against corruption, raising the efficiency of the legal
system, ensuring the interest of the state, organizations, and
legal rights and interests of individuals, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
A decree on practicing thrift provides detailed regulations on
fighting wasteful behavior in spending state budget allocations,
construction investment, and managing and using state assets and

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Hold National Census As Per Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Federal Cabinet
Saturday decided to hold its fifth National Population and Housing
Census from March 2 to 18 as per schedule.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet took the decision in a session chaired by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif on Saturday in Lahore, capital of the
largest Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
This has put to an end to days of speculations by the local
media that the census, which is already seven years behind the
schedule, would be postponed again.
</P>
<P>
The last national census was held in 1981, since then the
successive governments have not held it despite a constitutional
provision stipulates that it should be held in every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The holding of the fifth census was approved by the Federal
cabinet in the middle of last year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' New Cabinet Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The re-elected Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides announced Saturday the formation of his
11-member new cabinet, with the foreign minister and other four
ministers retaining their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The other four are ministers of finance, justice and public
order, communications and works and health.
</P>
<P>
The post of Minister of defense went to the Socialist Party
(EDEK), which decided on free-vote during the second round
elections.
</P>
<P>
Dinos Michaelides and Andreas Moushouttas returned to the
interior and labour ministries respectively. They had taken the
portfolios of the two ministries until last November when their
center-right Democratic Party (DIKO) broke away from the ruling
coalition and joined the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The two men disagreed with their party's decision to support
George Iacovou in the presidential elections earlier this month,
and turned to support Clerides in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The ministers gave the prescribed affirmation before the
president during a ceremony at the Presidential Palace, shortly
after the new President of the Republic was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was re-elected for a second five-year term after two
rounds of elections held on February 8 and 15.
</P>
<P>
Following his election, Clerides invited all parties to
participate in his new government, an offer turned down by main
oppositions DIKO and left-wing Progress Party of Working People
(AKEL).
</P>
<P>
However, the new cabinet absorbed some members from other
political parties which backed Clerides in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Clerides urged his new cabinet to
work together in a constructive manner to the benefit of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said the Council of Ministers embarks on its task at a time
when "we anticipate significant developments in the Cyprus problem
and our accession course to the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Noting that cabinet members came from different political
spheres, Clerides said "cooperation among all of us must be
constructive for the good of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet is as follows:
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs: Ioannis Kasoulides
</P>
<P>
Minister of Interior: Dinos Michaelides
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance: Christodoulos Christodoulou
</P>
<P>
Minister of Defense: Yiannakis Omirou
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education and Culture: Lykourgos Kappas
</P>
<P>

<P>
Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism: Nicos Rolandis

<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice and Public Order: Nicos Koshis
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Construction started today on
the Chinese capital's second major avenue, parallel to Chang'an
Avenue, the city's busiest downtown thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
The Ping'an Avenue project is estimated to cost two billion
yuan, and is scheduled to be completed in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The project was first proposed in the 1950s, but was shelved
because of the large number of buildings which would have to have
been demolished.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipality estimates that some 3,300 families
will have to be resettled, 300 work units will have to be
relocated and 110,000 sq m of buildings will have to be demolished
along the 6,890 meter avenue.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin inspected the construction site
today, and gave instructions that buildings and other items of
cultural importance should be preserved.

<HEADLINE> India's Third Phase of Polling Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Barring stray incidents of
violence, India's third phase of polling, which ended in 10 states
and the Union Territory of Daman and Diu off the eastern coast of
the country, passed off peacefully on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the first two phases of general elections to the 12th
Lower House of Parliament on February 16 and 22, which witnessed
various violent incidents in 222 and 183 Parliamentary
constituencies respectively killing over 100 people, there was no
report of death from any constituency in Saturday's polling. Only
cases of clashes among various political rival parties and
complaints of booth capturing were reported here and there.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 50 percent of the 140 million voters exercised
their franchise in 131 constituencies Saturday in the third phase
of polling, which was virtually the last phase of general
elections to elect 543 MPs in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
Polling for one seat each in Mizoram and Nagaland states was
held on February 23.
</P>
<P>
Repolling in Patna, capital of Bihar State in eastern India,
which was declared null and void by the Election Commission in the
wake of widespread electoral irregularities, will be held on March
30.
</P>
<P>
Security was beefed up in the 131 constituencies, especially in
sensitive polling stations on Saturday in view of poll violence in
the first two phases of polls.
</P>
<P>
According to the arrangements of the Election Commission,
counting of ballots will begin from March 2.
</P>
<P>
Indian President K. R. Narayanan dissolved the 11th Lower House
of Parliament on December 4 last year as no political party could
muster enough support to form the next central government after
the Gujral government resigned due to the withdrawal of support to
it by the Congress on November 28 last year.
</P>
<P>
This is the second general election in less than two years in
the country, because the 11th Lower House, which was elected in
April-May 1996, was a hung Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Recent poll surveys foresaw another hung Parliament in the
country.

<HEADLINE> France Regrets Attack on Journalists Reporting Garaudy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- France Saturday expressed regret
that journalists from Moslem countries were beaten up for their
reporting of the court verdict on French writer Roger Garaudy, who
was convicted of "contesting crimes against humanity".
</P>
<P>
"We regret the incidents of which several foreign journalists
became victims,'' said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that a lawsuit has been launched against the attackers
by the French Foreign Ministry, because it is in charge of the
security of all registered foreign journalists in France.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, formerly a Roman Catholic and a campaigner of the
French Communist Party who later converted to Islam, was condemned
on Friday by the Paris Correctional Tribunal for disputing the
Holocaust against Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old writer and philosopher was ordered to pay
120,000 francs (20,000 U.S. dollars) in fines for declaring in his
1996 book, "Founding Myths of Israeli Politics," that the number
of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Several journalists from Moslem countries, including an
Egyptian reporter for the Middle Eeast News Agency (MENA) and two
Iranian television reporters, were beaten up when they were
leaving the courtroom in central Paris.
</P>
<P>
A radical group of Jewish youths in France, Betar-Tagar, has
claimed responsibility for the attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A newly formed Tax
Contestation Committee in Kuwait will help resolve tax disputes
between foreign companies and local tax authorities arising from
mis-interpretation of tax laws.
</P>
<P>
The committee, whose formation was announced Saturday by
Director of the Finance Ministry's Taxes Department Jassem
Al-Sharrah, will consider cases resulting from the
mis-interpretation of tax laws in order to reduce the number of
disputes referred to the court and settle them directly inside
the ministry, Kuwait News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It said that this would streamline the procedures in solving
disputes in tax collections.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharrah said according to the 1995 law, companies wishing
to contest the tax report could apply within 30 days of receiving
the tax department's report.
</P>
<P>
A total of 228 foreign companies are now operating in Kuwait,
most of them being in the contracting, insurance, hotel and
commerce sectors, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Around 13 million Kuwait Dinars (42.9 million U.S. dollars)
were levied in the first quarter of the current fiscal year (to
end on June 30).
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has so far signed agreements with 14 countries to avoid
double taxation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Starts Weekly Air Quality Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Municipality published
its first weekly report on local air quality today.
</P>
<P>
The report, published in major local newspapers, shows that
from February 20 to 26 the city suffered from fourth-degree air
pollution -- the second-worst out of five degrees. Nitrogen oxide
is the biggest pollutant, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
The next-worst pollutants were sulphur dioxide, carbon
monoxide, and suspended particles and dust, according to the
report. Some local radio and television stations broadcast the
report Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The burning of coal, discharge of motor vehicle exhaust and
dust particles in the air are regarded as the main reasons for the
serious air pollution in Beijing, said Zhao Yixin, director of the
local environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is the biggest coal consumer among all the national
capitals in the world, with 28 million tons of coal consumed a
year, according to experts. During the winter, about 90 percent of
the sulphur dioxide, and more than half of the smoke and dust in
Beijing's air come from the burning of coal, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Exhaust fumes from the 1.2 million motor vehicles in the city
adds greatly to the pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the publication of air quality report shows that the
city government is determined to improve the environment and is
keen to benefit from supervision by the local residents, said Wang
Guangtao, deputy mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Already 27 Chinese cities have begun to release such reports,
which shows the concern of the local governments about urban
environmental protection, said Xie Zhenhua, director of the
National Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
A hotline has been set up in tandem with the report in Beijing
to provide people with an opportunity to express their concerns
about air quality and to spread information about environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"It is alarming to learn that our city is in such a dreadful
state of atmospheric pollution," said university teacher Zhao
Liming, calling on the hotline. "I think everybody should urge the
government to take action against air pollution."
</P>
<P>
Deputy mayor Wang said that the city has already decided to
take some measures, including pumping more natural gas from
northwest China, spreading the use of non-polluting coal, making
vehicle exhaust pipes compulsory and tightening the control of air
pollution in major industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
"We shall never sacrifice the environment for rapid economic
development, which is often unsustainable," said the deputy
mayor. "Economic development should always be co-ordinated with
environmental protection."

<HEADLINE> Acting Regional Chairman with Practical Work Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Ma Qizhi, acting chairman of
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Government, has a tight
schedule since he was elected a deputy to the Ninth National
People's Congress of China, which will be held early March.
</P>
<P>
He has presided over the regional agricultural conference, which
closed recently, and is making investigations of some local
enterprises with the aim of drawing up new policies to accelerate
the pace of reforms in state-owned enterprises. He works at least
10 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Ma has worked as a farmer, worker and teacher since he
graduated from the History Department of the Central Institute for
Nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Later, he served as deputy secretary of the Guyuan Prefectural
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), deputy head of
the Organization Department of the Regional Party Committee,
member of the Standing Committee of the Regional Party Committee,
and deputy secretary of the Regional Party Committee. He became
the acting chairman of the regional government in December 1997,
and was elected alternate member of the 14th and 15th CPC central
committees.
</P>
<P>
While taking charge of the regional publicity, politics and legal
affairs, Ma launched two mass campaigns to help local officials
and ordinary people to break away from the ideas of sticking to old
ways and to speed up the pace of reforms in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ningxia has leaped from the 27th place in the
country to 23rd in per-capita annual net income for farmers. The
poverty-stricken population in the region has greatly been reduced.
</P>
<P>
Though fundamental changes have taken place in the four decades
since the autonomous region was founded, it is still at the level
of low development in the primary stage of socialism, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He is confident about the region's future development, as the
central government has shifted the emphasis of economic
development to the central and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
As the only Hui (Moslem) autonomous region in China, Ningxia
enjoys preferential treatment, and has been granted the right to
adopt more flexible measures for its economic development, Ma said.

MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Russian government
ministers, including one deputy prime minister and two ministers,
were sacked by President Boris Yeltsin Saturday, Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov, Transport Minister
Nikolai Tsakh and Education Minister Vladimir Kinelyov were
relieved from their duties because they were moving to other jobs,
an official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin had warned earlier in the week that three ministers
would be dismissed because he regarded them as responsible for
Russia's dire economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a government meeting held on Thursday, Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that changes in the
government must be natural, and he opposed endless bureaucratic
reshuffling and hectic reorganization.
</P>
<P>
But he vowed to seriously improve the efficiency of the
goverment, including the role and personal responsibility of
ministers and heads of federal agencies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. humanitarian workers who
returned here Thursday are going back to work with "full speed,"
Denis Halliday, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad things are back to normal," Halliday said. "We are
happy that we are back and we are expecting more to be back."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven U.N. humanitarian observers returned from Amman,
Jordan, to Baghdad following the easing of tension over the
U.N. arms inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We worked very closely and very well with the (Iraqi)
government ministries and we anticipate no difficulties," Halliday
said, when answering questions from Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Mao, one of the returned observers, said that so
far no incidents have occurred during the implementation of the
food distribution plan in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on Iraq's announcement Saturday that it does
not have the capacity to pump out 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth
of oil to buy food, Halliday said that Iraq's agreement to
increase oil export to 4 billion dollars in six months "is already
a 100 percent increase, so the deal is pretty good."
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell 2
billion dollars worth of oil in six months to buy humanitarian
supplies for its people. Last week the U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution to increase the quota to 5.2 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Appeals to Turkish Cypriots for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Saturday called on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
to work together for a common homeland and reunite this East
Mediterranean island divided since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the House of Representatives Saturday during a
sworn-in ceremony, Clerides said his main objective is to achieve
progress in the efforts to secure a solution of the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
He said he would promote the Republic's application for
accession to the European Union and utilize the dynamics created
to reunify Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that he intends to maintain close
cooperation with Greece, build the country's defense and
implement the Cypriot-Greek joint defense doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Turning to his "compatriot Rauf Denktash," Clerides said "I
call on you to work with us for our common homeland. Let us start
the process for creating a new Cyprus in a new century."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "it is our duty to do so and it is the
best gift we can give to our children and grand-children, to all
Cypriot children."
</P>
<P>
Although third parties can help toward this goal, "a lot
depends on ourselves," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to cooperating with the Turkish Cypriot
leadership in the coming months so as to turn this ideal into a
reality in Cyprus," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clerides urged the Turkish Cypriots to "think about the
future and bequeath to future generations a heritage of peace,
not a heritage of confrontation and conflict."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Cyprus should be one state, with a single
sovereignty, single international personality and single
citizenship, regardless of decentralization and specific
differences.
</P>
<P>
A Cyprus settlement, he said, is not difficult, provided there
is goodwill on all sides.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Turkey, Clerides said it must realize that a
solution in Cyprus will give the necessary impetus, offering at
the same time tremendous benefits.
</P>
<P>
He called on Turkey to allow the Turkish Cypriots to
participate in the journey toward EU accession, or face the
isolation of Turkish Cypriot community.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on defense issues, he reiterated that "we have no
intention of attacking anyone, our intention is to have an
adequate deterrent to avert the military option as a method of
solving differences.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained a 35,000-strong military force in the
northern part of the island since then.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's decision last year to purchase
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles and construction of
Paphos military air base have triggered off criticism from the
U.S. and some other western countries, and threats from Turkey
that it will strike the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
On the home front, Clerides promised to promote the principles
of meritocracy and good government, maintain a strong and dynamic
economy, upgrade the island's role as an international service
center and strengthen and upgrade democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was re-elected in the run-off elections on February
15 for another five-year term in office as the eighth president of
Cyprus Republic since its independence in 1960.

SEOUL, February 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime
Minister-designate Kim Jong-pil said Saturday that he will accept
a parliamentary vote on his nomination by President Kim Dae-jung
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Kim Jong-pil has openly expressed his
own position on his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil, honorary president of the United Liberal
Democrats, was nominated by President Kim Dae-jung last week as
cabinet head.
</P>
<P>
However, the majority opposition Grand National Party, which
has 161 seats in the 293-seat National Assembly (parliament), said
it will veto the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party said Kim Jong-pil is very conservative
politically and unfit for a post steering the nation into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil, 72, has been a political heavyweight for more
than 40 years. He was founder of the Korean Intelligence Agency
and held the position of prime minister from 1971-1975.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the United Liberal Democrats led by Kim Jong-pil
united with the National Congress for New Politics headed by Kim
Dae-jung in a bid to win the presidential election on December 18.
</P>
<P>
Under the alliance agreement, Kim Dae-jung must appoint Kim
Jong-pil as prime minister after he becomes president.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Unable to Pump More Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid said Saturday that Iraq does not have the
capacity of pumping more than 4 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
in six months.
</P>
<P>
Rashid told a press conference that the lack of spare parts of
oil-pumping equipment is the reason behind Iraq's inability to
export 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in six months.
</P>
<P>
A new U.N. Security Council resolution adopted a week ago
allows Iraq to increase oil export from 2 billion dollars in a
six-month period to 5.2 billion dollars to buy humanitarian
supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq now can pump 2.65 million barrels of oil every day,"
said Rashid, adding that if the U.N. agrees to allow Iraq to import
spare parts, Iraq can increase its capacity of pumping oil.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that negotiations on this issue are under way with
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Friendly countries" will be given priority to sign oil
contracts, said Rashid, adding that Iraq has concluded contracts
with Russian, Chinese and Turkish oil companies to open up new
oil-fields.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil minister's remarks came on the eve of the 25th
anniversary of the nationalization of Iraq's oil companies. On
March 1, 1973, the Iraqi government expelled all foreign oil
companies in the country and took over the control of all oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will continue to exert all efforts, with the cooperation
of foreign companies, in order to raise its oil-pumping capacity,
Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Iraq will have the capacity of
exporting 6 million barrels of oil per day after the
U.N. sanctions imposed on it are lifted.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in
1990 can not be lifted until the U. N. Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction verifies
that the country has destroyed all banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has complained to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that
the new U.N. resolution, which is based on Annan's proposal, would
weaken Iraq's call for the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
During his recent Baghdad trip, Annan discussed this issue with
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Political groups in France are again debating whether the
1970 law which cracked down on drug dealing will be eased, after
a civil group, Act Up, called for the lifting of the law and the
State Secretary of Public Health Bernard Kouchner hinted at
changing some articles of the law. Although most other Western
European countries have similar legislation, the article L630 of
the law, which bans invitation to use drugs, is the most
severe and most applicable in Europe.
</P>
<P>

Liberation that if Saddam Hussein violates his agreement with
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the threat of a
military strike will become a reality. ``Our goal is to let the
UNSCOM do their job until the end, to dismantle the Iraqi
arsenal. We will do it by diplomacy or by force, at the choice of
Saddam,'' he said.

-- The publication of the public accounts of 15 European Union
countries was made on Friday. France, Germany and Italy all have
met EU criteria on budget deficit for joining the euro by cutting
their public deficits to below 3 percent. Apart from Greece, all
EU countries can be admitted into the monetary union. But Britain,
Sweden and Denmark have not applied for it.

<HEADLINE> China to Publish New Pharmacopoeia of Traditional Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China is to publish a series
of volumes, starting next year, to provide the latest guide to the
use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
</P>
<P>
The 30-volume Materia Medica of China will contain information
on more than 8,000 kinds of herbal medicines and drugs made from
animal materials or minerals, according to the State
Administration of TCM, which initiated the compilation work in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Each medicinal material entry will have its name, description
of its outward appearance, chemical composition and functions, and
planting and processing methods, as well as clinical research
results and contra-indications.
</P>
<P>
The books will also include some 1,500 kinds of medicines that
are used by some of China's ethnic groups, such as the Tibetan,
Mongolian, Uygur and Dai peoples.
</P>
<P>
A two-volume abstract of the work has already been published by
the Shanghai Science and Technology Publishing House, and contains
information on 535 kinds of major medicines for clinical use.
</P>
<P>
"These books are important traditional Chinese medicine
reference materials, including the results of centuries of
experience in the field as well as the results of modern
research," said Li Zhenji, deputy director of the Administration.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Compendium of Materia Medica, which was compiled
by Li Shizhen, a noted TCM master of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),
is still regarded as the leading guide to the use of traditional
Chinese medicines. However, it only contains information on 1,892
kinds of medicines.

<HEADLINE> China Builds First 200mm Silicon Wafer Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's first patented
production line for 200mm silicon wafers went into operation
today.
</P>
<P>
The production line, with an annual capacity of 200,000
polished wafers of 200mm silicon, was built by the National
Engineering Research Center for Semiconductor Materials,
affiliated with the General Research Institute for Nonferrous
Metals (GRINM).
</P>
<P>
It is part of the 909 Project, a major State construction
project for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
Its total investment is about 10 billion yuan (some 1.2 billion US
dollars), said Tu Hailing, president of the GRINM.
</P>
<P>
Compared with integrated circuits made from 150mm silicon
wafers, those made from 200mm silicon wafers have higher
efficiency and less production cost, Tu said, adding that the
production line will help promote the development of the country's
electronic information industry.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that China will be the biggest electronic
information market in the 21st century. There will be an estimated
one trillion yuan (about 120 billion US dollars) of market
capacity for the country's electronic information industry by the
year 2000, and the figure will rise to six trillion yuan by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already begun to grant preferential
policies to the electronic information industry, which it regards
as a pillar industry in the future.
</P>
<P>
The GRINM is a major research and development center for
information materials in China and has successfully produced the
first 150mm and 200mm CZ silicon monocrystals in the country since
1992. It produced 300mm CZ silicon monocrystals last August,
which makes China one of the few countries in the world to have
such capacity.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Telecommunications Revenue Sharply Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The revenue from long-distance
calls fell sharply in January in South Korea due to the financial
hardships caused by austere economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Korea Telecom, the official telecommunications company, said
Saturday its income from long distance calls by individuals and
businesses in January dropped by 21.2 percent to 93.4 billion won
(about 5.7 billion U.S. dollars) from last December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dacom Corporation, the country's second largest
telecommunications company, reported that its revenue from trunk
calls in January plunged by 14.3 percent to 13.2 billion won
(about 800 million dollars) from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Both Korea Telecom and Dacom attributed the reduction to the
austerity measures imposed in accordance with conditions set by
the International Monetary Fund, and many holidays last month.
</P>
<P>
The two telecommunication operators estimated that February will
see another 10 percent drop in their revenues.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the world's 11th largest economy, has been in
a serious economic crisis since late 1997 because of corporate
collapses and bad loans by financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the IMF for a rescue loan of 57
billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to restructure its economy,
completely open its markets, and shut down ailing financial
institutions in order to pay back a large part of its foreign
debts of 164 billion U.S. dollars this year.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz is expected to meet U.N. Special Commission Chairman
Richard Butler here early next month to discuss a wide range of
issues, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Rashid said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any personal feelings against Butler," said
Rashid at a news conference in the Oil Ministry here.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq will have normal work relations with U.N. arms
inspectors on conditions that they stick to its mandate and
behave according to U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors have to behave according to
U.N. standards, behave like an U.N. organization and work
according to the mandate of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now with the international public opinion understanding the
difficulties, the visit of the U.N. secretary-general, the
agreement we have just concluded, the UNSCOM should go back to
normal U.N. behavior and stick to their mandate," Rashid
said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief Kofi Annan recently visited Iraq and signed an
agreement with the Iraqi government on weapons inspections which
may avert U.S. military strike against Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands' Minister of
Economic Affairs G.J. (Hans) Wijers arrived in Hong Kong Saturday
morning, on the last leg of a six-day trip to China.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, he met with Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa and Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions focused on Hong Kong's economic and financial
situation against the backdrop of the regional financial turmoil.
"I'm impressed by the commitment of your senior authorities to
keep the Hong Kong dollar at its current value ... and by your
ability to do that," Wijers told a press conference after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is in a position to play an important role in the
region in the years to come, the minister noted, who characterized
the services-oriented city as a gateway to the region.
</P>
<P>
He expected continued good partnership between Hong Kong and
the Netherlands, both of which, with fine port infrastructure,
have long been engaged in international trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
An agreement between Hong Kong's semi-official trade promotion
body, the Trade Development Council, and the Netherlands' Foreign
Trade Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs was signed
here Saturday to boost bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing his tour of China's inland, Wijers said, apart from
contracts worth of 250 million U.S. dollars signed, progress was
also made in areas such as agricultural food processing,
infrastructure, financial services, environment and energy.
</P>
<P>
Aimed to "accomplish deeper economic ties with China", the
minister headed a top-level 70-company mission, the largest ever
Dutch business mission, to visit China.
</P>
<P>
He met with Vice Chinese Premier Li Lanqing and Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi during his stay in
Beijing. He later stopped over in Shanghai and Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister on Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid said Saturday that Iraq does not have the capacity
of pumping more than 4 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil for
export in six months.
</P>
<P>
Rashid told a press conference that the lack of spare parts of
oil-pumping equipment is the reason behind Iraq's inability to
export 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in six months.
</P>
<P>
A new U.N. Security Council resolution adopted a week ago
allowed Iraq to increase oil export from 2 billion dollars in a
six-month period to 5.2 billion dollars to buy humanitarian
supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, which touched off the Gulf War. The sanctions barred the
country from exporting oil, its economic mainstay.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister said that Iraq now can pump 2.65 million
barrels of oil per day, and that if the U.N. agrees to allow
Iraq to import spare parts, Iraq can increase its capacity of
pumping oil.
</P>
<P>
He added that negotiations on this issue are under way with
the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Iraq has complained to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that
the new U.N. resolution, which is based on Annan's proposal, would
weaken Iraq's call for the lifting of the economic sanctions
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his recent Baghdad trip, Annan discussed this issue with
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.

 Currencies
</P>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from nine
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) ended a two-day meeting here Saturday by pledging to
support the use of regional currencies for promoting intra-ASEAN
trade.
</P>
<P>
A joint press statement issued at the conclusion of the second
ASEAN finance ministers meeting said the ministers endorsed the
use of Bilateral Payment Arrangement (BPA) as proposed by the
Special Task Force of the ASEAN Central Banks.
</P>
<P>
The approach will initially be implemented on a voluntary basis,
with a view to evolving this facility into a multilateral
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that the ASEAN Surveillance Mechanism
would be established immediately within the general framework of
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) with the assistance of the
Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers exchanged views on the
financial and economic situation in the region. They agreed that
while the financial crisis had affected the short-term economic
and business conditions in ASEAN, the long-term prospects in the
region remained attractive and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their confidence that the region, in
particular the affected countries, would overcome the crisis
quickly as the economic fundamentals remained strong. The savings
rate of the region remained one of the highest in the world and
while the rates of inflation has increased recently, they were
within manageable levels.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reiterated the commitment, made by the ASEAN heads
of government in Kuala Lumpur on December 15, 1997, to maintain an
open trade and investment environment in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers welcomed the structural and financial
reforms undertaken by ASEAN countries to strengthen their
economies and called on the international community to recognize
and respond to these initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The meeting welcomed the greater flexibility of conditionalities
attached to the IMF support programs and urged the IMF to
accelerate the implementation of its programs of support.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also welcomed the decision of the People's
Republic of China not to devalue the RMB (national currency).
</P>
<P>
They urged the G-7 countries to open their markets further to
products from ASEAN and to adopt a more proactive approach to
enable the affected countries to overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also urged the international financial
institutions and concerned agencies, in devising their support
programs, to take full account of the need to protect the poor,
particularly in terms of education, health and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the Third Meeting of the ASEAN Finance
Ministers would be held in early 1999 in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Non-Governmental Entrepreneur Elected NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Hongtao (Heart) K Group
President Xie Shengming is a representative of the
non-governmental enterprises among deputies to the forthcoming
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) of China.
</P>
<P>
"I will propose a motion for boosting high-tech development by
non-governmental industrial firms," said 42-year-old Xie.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the Central China Teachers' University,
Xie set up a psychological research institute for young people and
established a magazine to provide psychological guidance for
youth.
</P>
<P>
Later, he allied himself with some other intellectuals to start
a pharmaceutical plant for making blood promotion pills at an
investment of 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The plant's output value, sales volume and pre-tax profits
increased by 300 percent in the past few years. Its assets soared
to 3.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, it led all other enterprises across the country in key
economic indicators and was designated as a key high-tech
enterprise by the State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Xie's group has made donations totalling 28 million yuan to
the needy.
</P>
<P>
As an outstanding entrepreneur, Xie became a news maker in Wuhan,
capital of central China's Hubei Province, and was elected a
deputy to the Ninth People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Xie regards it an honor as well as a sacred mission and vows to
take an active part in deliberating state affairs.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
provided equal opportunity for both the state-owned and
non-governmental enterprises. In view of fierce market competition,
the latter should upgrade technology, introduce the joint stock
system and seek new areas for economic growth, he said.

ABU DHABI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has drawn up a law against money laundering as part of a
drive to fight drug smuggling, local English-language daily
Emirates News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The law was mapped out by UAE's Central Bank last month and is
waiting for the approval of the UAE cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The draft law came following calls for measures to curb money
laundering after a surge in drug trafficking in the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Police records show that more than 10 tonnes of heroin, cocaine,
hashish and other narcotics have been seized in the UAE in the
past years.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and other Gulf states have become targets for drug
gangs due to the absence of laws against money laundering,
according to UAE anti-drug officials.
</P>
<P>
UAE authorities are investigating several money laundering
cases, but they would have no way to prosecute the culprits unless
the anti-laundering law is enforced.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy on Importance of Adapting to International Norms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- It is of vital significance to
adapt to international norms for a smooth construction of major
projects, said a newly-elected deputy of north China's Shanxi
Province to the country's Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
which will convene its first session in Beijing next week.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yousan, deputy general commander-in-chief of the World
Bank-financed Yellow River water diversion project, cited on-going
construction of the project to divert water from Yellow River to
Wanjiazhai of north China's Shanxi Province as a good example.
</P>
<P>
In August 1994, when Zheng, also deputy head of Shanxi
Provincial Planning Commission, was appointed to be the deputy
general commander-in-chief of the water diversion project
headquarters, there were a lot of problems awaiting him, including
where to find investment, as well as problems in project
management.
</P>
<P>
Three years have passed, the headquarters has finished all
preparatory work for the construction of the water diversion
project. It has attracted WB to finance the project by adapting
to international practice in handling daily businesses.
</P>
<P>
When a group of WB-appointed specialists who were on their
sixth tour to inspect the water diversion project, also dubbed as
"lifeline" of Shanxi Province, arrived in Shanxi in late 1996 and
were presented with a carefully-prepared memorandum which greatly
impressed Joseph Goldberg, a high-ranking official with WB.
</P>
<P>
Mr Goldberg said it was the first time in his decade or so
business with China to see such a well-prepared memorandum which
is a typical act of the market economy and has proved that the
water diversion project is adapted to international common
practice.
</P>
<P>
Now, the construction of the dam for the water diversion
project progresses rapidly, and necessary infrastructure has been
readily in place thanks to concerted efforts of Zheng and his
colleagues. The first generating unit is expected to generate
electricity this year.
</P>
<P>
The highly efficient performance in constructing the water
diversion project is the result of WB participation, said Zheng.
He said he felt pity that WB canceled its plans to finance two
local projects of Shanxi just because of the province's some
substandard working procedures.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, WB is going to provide over 400
million U.S. dollars in loans for the water diversion project
which started in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Power generating units will be built in Wanjiazhai Village,
Pianguan County, to divert water from the Yellow River to Taiyuan,
the provincial capital in the south, and to Shuozhou and Datong,
two industrial cities in northern Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
The project will consist of two phases. In the first, water
will be pumped from the Yellow River, which runs from north to
south in the western part of Shanxi, to Taiyuan. It is expected to
be finished in 2001. Work began on the project in 1993. It is
expected to cost 11.3 billion yuan (about 1.36 billion
U.S. dollars), with the WB putting in up to 400 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Most of California Become Disaster Zones Due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two-thirds of the
58 counties of California have been declared as federal disaster
zones due to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people have been killed and an estimated 500
million U.S. dollars worth of property damaged in El Nino-caused
storms, floods and mudslides since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the employment figures for January and
February to be released will show a drop in construction industry
due to the El Nino factor.
</P>
<P>
Milk production has dropped 5 percent in the whole California
and 7 percent in Los Angeles this month.
</P>
<P>
El Nino also forced a delay in spring planting of nursery
goods, which boasts the third-largest crop in California.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the previous disaster in California, the 1994
earthquake, which claimed 61 deaths and more than 10 billion
dollars in damage, the current damage resulting from El Nino may
be just a drop in the bucket.
</P>
<P>
However, forecasters have warned that the El Nino weather
phenomenon will continue raging through late spring.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino will remain the same for the next two to three months
at least," said Vernon Kousky, a senior chief analyst in the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
It was impossible to tell if the worst has been over or if even
more violent weather is on the way, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bank Employees' Strike Continues in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The strike by Kenya's bank
employees entered its second day Saturday, demanding the
immediate scrapping of the new 22 percent interest rate imposed
on employees' loans and allowances.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued last night, Labor Minister J.K. Ngulu
declared the strike illegal as "it does not fall within the
meaning of a trade dispute," Daily Nation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told the striking employees from most banks of the country
to resume their duties in their own interest and seek dialogue on
the contentious interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Most branches of the 53-member Kenya Bankers Association
remained closed or opened briefly Friday in this east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Opiyo, Chairman of All Banks Shop Stewards Committee
(ABSC), was quoted as saying Friday that the tax contradicted the
government's policy of asking bankers to lower their interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that employees of all banks in Kenya would continue
with the strike until the Ministry of Finance rescinded its
decision and scrapped the new tax rates.
</P>
<P>
the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Friday accused the ABSC of
misleading its members, saying that under the Income Tax Act, the
general policy in Kenya has always been that all remuneration
provided to employees are taxable.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the KRA said the 22 percent rate
is far below what the Kenyan public is paying for commercial
loans where the interest ranges between 30 and 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tussle between the government and bank employees on the
issue of taxation has been going on for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the bank workers union formally served the
government with a 21-day notice of strike over the increased
taxation on the loans given as benefit to bank staff by their
employers.
</P>
<P>
The new rate of tax ranging from 15 percent to 22 percent is
based on the average 91-day treasury bill rate for the relevant
quarter.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprises Turning Around in Shenyang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned industrial
enterprises in Liaoning Province, China's oldest heavy industry
base, have said good-bye to eight years of being in the red.
</P>
<P>
The sector collected 66 million yuan in profits in 1997, while
large and medium-sized state enterprises reported losses of 205
million yuan, 56 percent less than the previous year, according to
the Liaoning Provincial Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The major turn for the better is due to the profound reforms
introduced into the sector last year," the province's Party
secretary, Wen Shizhen, said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has more than 3,500 state enterprises, nearly 1,000 of
which are large and medium-sized ones, accounting for one tenth of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1990s problems like serious debts and
large numbers of redundant workers pushed quite a number of them
to the brink of ruin.
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, the local state-owned enterprises achieved
152.3 billion yuan in output value, a year-on-year increase of 10
percent and exceeding the national average for the first time in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
The commission's director, Wang Huabin, attributed the good
result mainly to the introduction of the modern enterprise system,
improved capital structure, and the strategy of focussing on large
state enterprises while allowing small ones more decision-making
freedom.

<P>
In 1997 the state-owned industrial sector reported a 97.4
percent sales ratio, an all-time high for the past few years. Some
more-marketable products and leading businesses began to play a more
important role in propping up local economic growth. As a matter
of fact, 60 best-selling products contributed 70 percent to the
state industry's added value in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1990s the province began to make greater efforts
to optimize its capital structure and reorganize its state-owned
assets. So far, it has set up 60 large enterprise groups, with 80
percent of its small and medium-sized businesses involved in
reforms of property and management systems.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy has also been accepted. Over the past two years, 139
businesses have been merged, and another 162 declared bankrupt,
bringing down the assets-to-liability ratio by 4.3 percentage
points. As a result, a million redundant workers were left
jobless, but half of them have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The province has had 42 state-owned enterprises listed on stock
markets, raising 14.4 billion yuan. Share-holding transformation
has not only helped pool needed capital, but also increased
pressure on managers to seek better managerial mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liaoning has intensified its efforts to upgrade
technology. Last year, it spent 24 billion yuan on technical
improvement projects, up 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji put forward the three-year goal to turn
these enterprises around in a tour of the province last year. And
now the recovery trend of the state sector presents good
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite possible to achieve the aim so long as we have
good policies and management methods," said Prof. Lin Muxi, an
economist at Liaoning University here.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province's state enterprises will try new
ways of multiform realization of ownership, common prosperity
of diversified economies, and various forms of income
distribution.
</P>
<P>
It will also choose 100 large and medium-sized state
enterprises for overseas cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Warns Against Anti-Abacha Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian police has warned
against a mass rally in Lagos next Tuesday planned by
organizations opposing the presidential candidacy of the west
African country's military leader, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, the Lagos State Police Commissioner
Alhaji Abubakar Tsav said any procession without permit will be
illegal and will be dispersed by force and the organizers
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the police has not received any applications
for the proposed rally and, in fact, a ban on public procession
is still in force in the state.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's National Democratic Coalition and several other
groups announced recently that they will organize a rally of five
million people in Lagos on March 3 in protest of a rally on the
same day in the capital Abuja, organized by supporters of
Abacha's presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, which include the National
Council of Youth Association of Nigeria and others, the Abuja
rally will be attended by two million people.
</P>
<P>
The opinion of the Nigerian public is divided over the issue
of whether Abacha should shed his uniform to contest in the
elections of a civilian president in August, which is the
highlight of the military government's transition to civil rule
program.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Holds Talks With Brunei's Sultan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Brunei is interested in
investing in Malaysia, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
told reporters after talks with Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Brunei expressed interest to invest "in whatever
field that is worthwhile," but added that no figures were
mentioned about Brunei's possible investment.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA) would discuss
the potential investment and "will do the due diligence on the
possible business investment."
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Mahathir and the sultan also discussed the
financial and economic crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
To a question whether there were concrete proposals from Brunei
on dealing with the current financial and economic situation in
the region, Mahathir said: "There were not really concrete
(measures) but we worry about the fall in Asian currencies which
will trigger a lot of problems for all the countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that among the problems was the migration of people
from countries most affected by the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Brunei would be able to invest in Malaysia within this
year, Mahathir said he was quite sure that Brunei might decide
early.
</P>
<P>
"They might even buy shares in the local stock market for
example. I don't know because everything is open," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir added it would take some time for the BIA "to do the
due diligence in investing" in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Hassanal arrived here Friday night for an overnight
working visit.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday
that the purpose of the sultan's trip was to have discussions with
Mahathir "especially in the context of coordinating efforts to
overcome the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders last met on February 18 when Mahathir made an
overnight trip to Bandar Seri Begawan, capital of Brunei.

<HEADLINE> China's Agriculture Lures Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
overseas investors have turned to China's agriculture as they find
a potential consumer market in the country's vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1.2 billion population consumes huge amount of
farm produce and by-products, and the rapid improving living
standards add handsomely to market demands.
</P>
<P>
"The growing market not only opens investment opportunities,
but also means good returns," said an official with the Ministry
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is a major area the central government encourages
overseas investors to go. That's why it listed most of the key
agricultural projects in the Guiding Directory on Industries Open
to Foreign Investment, which went into effect on January 1, this
year and allows investors to be exempt from tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province in south China has witnessed a rapid growth
of overseas investment in agriculture. In 1995, for example, the
province had a six per cent increase in using overseas investment,
while the increase in agriculture was as high as 370 per cent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last June, Dongguan city had approved nearly 100
agriculture-related overseas-backed businesses, involving more
than 100 million US dollars of investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of last year overseas
businesses had invested in 7,000 agriculture-related projects in
China, with a total contractual investment of seven billion US
dollars, accounting for 1.48 per cent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Overseas involvement in China's agriculture will further speed
up the transition from the traditional self-sufficient agriculture
to the modern commercialized agriculture, sector insiders said.

<HEADLINE> Engineer of Uzbek Ethnic Group Elected NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- "I will do my best to submit
the aspirations of ordinary people and safeguard their interests,"
said Ma Like, a deputy to the Ninth People's Congress (NPC) from
Uzbek ethnic group of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Ma Like was born into an ordinary family. His father died
when he was only seven years old. "Although we were poor, my
mother managed to make us continue our schooling through hard work
and thrift," he said.
</P>
<P>
"She taught us to become a useful person to the society when
we grow up," 36-year-old Ma Like added.
</P>
<P>
Graduating from a university, Ma acted as a technician in an
electric company in Xinjiang. Later he was appointed the company's
chief engineer after working in the field for nine years.
</P>
<P>
According to his colleagues, Ma Like is able to win other's
respect not only because he has good expertise, but because he is
honest and sympathetic. He also gets along well with people of
other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Ma Like said that his own norm of life is to be upright, frank,
open and above board and harmonious with others.
</P>
<P>
"All ethnic groups live in the same globe. We can achieve
common development as long as we establish a friendship like that
among brothers and sisters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Resembling most other people of the Uzbek ethnic group in
Xinjiang, Ma Like was also a descendent of emigrants from
Uzbekstan half a century ago. However, he said he had no intention
of returning to Uzbekstan.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident about China's future," he said, explaining that
China, through 20 years of reform and opening-up, has passed the
times with the shortage of commodities. "China will be more
prosperous in the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the first annual session of the Ninth NPC to be held next
week in Beijing, he will submit a proposal on Xinjiang's electric
development and educational matters in ethnic minorities, he
told Xinhua.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Major Johnny Paul Koromah, head
of the toppled Sierra Leonean military junta has been declared
wanted by the West Africa peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Field Commander Major-General Timothy Shelpidi
announced this upon arrival at the Lagos airport Friday. Media
reports said he is in Nigeria for a consultation mission.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned Koromah is a wanted man and I am
looking for him," Shelpidi said.
</P>
<P>
On possible counter attacks from the remaining troops of
Koromah, the commander said, "If he launches an attack, good luck
to him."
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi said his troops will provide security for President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who is expected to return to Sierra Leone to
resume office on March 10, and so is all humanitarian agencies
providing relief materials in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's capture of Sierra Leonean capital Freetown about two
weeks ago has sent Koromah and his junta members on the run.
Though many of his ministers have been arrested by ECOMOG troops,
Koromah himself has been missing.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to wide speculations that he may have fled Sierra
Leone, a man who claimed himself to be Koromah once told the
British Broadcasting Corporation on telephone that he is in the
hills near Freetown and vowed to fight back.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Face Hunger in Mozambican County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 people are now
facing hunger in Mandimba county in north Mozambique's Niassa
province.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Domingos Esteches, head of Agriculture
and Fishery Bureau in Mandimba county, the Noticias paper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He blamed this on too much rain water last December and this
January which has flooded most of the farmland.
</P>
<P>
Esteches estimated that 60 percent of the 30,000 hectares of
farmland on which have been planted various crops will harvest
nothing.
</P>
<P>
The remaining land where an average hectare produced 500 kg of
grain last season might only produce 300 kg, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Another factor which might have contributed to the famine
threat is that some farmers have sold their "surplus" grain too
early to neighboring Malawi, Esteches added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Union Threatens to Be on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has called for a two-day mass stay-away from work
on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here Friday, the ZCTU leadership said it
was calling the strike because the government had not responded
to the demands put forward by the labor movement on reducing
prices of basic commodities, scrapping the 2.5 percent sales tax,
five percent development levy and 15 percent tax on pensions
profits.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership, having exceeded their mandate of one month,
has no option but to implement the resolution of calling mass
action. The leadership has thus set the dates of Tuesday and
Wednesday next week for a mass stay-away," said ZCTU President
Gibson Sibanda.
</P>
<P>
However, Florence Chitauro, Minister of Public Service, Labor
and Social Welfare, implored the ZCTU to seriously reconsider
their planned stay-away.
</P>
<P>
"Let us all discuss our problems in good faith and find the
best ways to resolve them through dialogue," said Chitauro in a
statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
She said the government takes seriously the grievances put
forward by the ZCTU and it was its conviction that the problems
which affect not only the workers and employers but also the
welfare of the nation should be thoroughly debated and
collectively resolved peacefully.

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's State Education
Commission (SEC) received 25 million yuan in donation today from
an company in Shenzhen City to set up a fund, which will help poor
students complete their college studies.
</P>
<P>
The fund, titled "Huawei Poor Students Fund", will receive five
million yuan (about 600,000 US dollars) a year from the Huawei
Technologies Co., Ltd in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong
Province in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Students have to pay for all the expenses of their college
education after the reform of China's education system, said Chen
Zhili, vice-minister of the State Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
This can often put the students from low-income families on
edge if they want to enroll themselves for higher education, Chen
said, adding that these students accounted for 20 percent
of the three million college student body in China.
</P>
<P>
The government and society have become more concerned about
poor students in recent years and are trying to offer help, she
said, but shortage of fund is still a barrier for higher education
in China.
</P>
<P>
Chen called on all the businesses, social organizations and
individuals to provide more assistance to the country's higher
education, "and in return we will provide the society with better
trained people."

reunification policy different from his predecessors, nor did
South Korea respond to the DPRK's recent appeal for improving
relations. (DPRK-Kim Dae-jung)

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff said Friday
that the U.S. warplanes will continue to stay in the Gulf, ready
for air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"They're prepared, they're ready, they're not winding down,"
Michael Ryan told a conference in Orlando, Florida, on aerial
warfare organized by the Air Force Association.
</P>
<P>
"They are going to stay as long as they are needed. This is
a 'wait and see'." He said no redeployment was imminent despite a
U.N.-brokered accord that averted a looming showdown between the
United States and Iraq. (US-Iraq-U.S. Warplanes)

BEIRUT -- Lebanon said Friday that it is not "a card" of Syria,
rather a supporter of Syria in the same struggle for the
restoration of lands occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
remarks early in the day, Lebanese Information Minister Bassem
Al-Sabaa said Israel is attempting to drive a wedge between
Lebanon and Syria by giving the public an illusion that Lebanon is
"a card" in Syria's hands. In fact, Israel is afraid that the two
countries join hands to fight for their rights to restore south
Lebanon and the Golan Heights under Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning State businesses Make Steady Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- State-owned businesses in
northeast China's Liaoning province, the country's heavy
industrial base, made steady progress though half of them were
still operating in the red last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the provincial government showed that
Liaoning saw a nine percent increase in Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in 1997 over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The province's inflation rate of one percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Director of the provincial statistic bureau Zhang Benbo told a
press conference here today that this is second consecutive year
that Liaoning registered a relatively high growth rate with a low
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
On industrial situation of the province, he said that large-
and medium-sized state-owned businesses increased output by ten
percent in 1997 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning accounts for one-tenth of the large- and medium-sized
state-owned businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told the press conference that though the whole
industrial sector of the province increased profits and tax by
22.17 billion yuan (2.64 billion US dollars), or 2.7 percent over
1996, 55.5 percent of large- and medium-sized state owned
businesses suffered a total loss of 5.6 billion yuan (666.7
million US dollars) in 1997. The annual GDP of the province was
350.12 billion yuan (41.68 billion US dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in the past year, the industrial sector of the
province continued to readjust its product mix by marketing over
6,500 new ones.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province's agricultural output increased
merely 0.3 percent in 1997 due to decrease in farming output
caused by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province will focus on optimizing ownership
system and promoting growth of non-state-owned enterprises in the
next few years.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Set up Privatization Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A privatization agency will be
set up to speed the process of Privatizing public enterprises
which have contributed to high government budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce
conference on privatization in Nyanga, east Zimbabwe Friday,
Cephas Msipa, minister of state responsible for public sector
reform, said the agency would be located in the president's
office.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that it had taken the government a long time to
set up the privatization agency but pointed out that work was in
progress to finalize issues relating to its funding,
accommodation and staffing.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the setting up of the agency will result in
greater efficiency and freer flow of information on
privatization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of the privatization agency, the minister
said the government had made commendable progress on
commercialization and privatizing some of the loss-making
parastatals, including enterprises owned by the Zimbabwe
Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government was aware that the
privatization of parastatals would result in the loss of hundreds
of jobs as enterprises restructured and called for programs to be
put in place for training workers to be retrenched to enable them
to do other jobs or set up business of their own.
</P>
<P>
"The private and public sectors should work together toward
the successful implementation of the privatization program. I
urge you to view it as a national program not as a government
program," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> From Jobber Girl to NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The past decade was a period
of hard work and harvest for Chen Xueying, a jobber girl in south
China's Guangdong Province, a pioneer of China's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
With a wish to enjoy a free urban life, Chen left her hometown,
a poor mountainous village in the eastern part of Guangdong, in
1988 and entered Xinhua Precision Machine Tool Company, a
Sino-Japanese joint venture.
</P>
<P>
"I felt curious and nervous when I first saw a modern
production line," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
Chen digged into her job and became well-versed in technical
norms of every position of the production line. Two years later,
she was promoted to the head of the line.
</P>
<P>
However, the enterprising girl was not satisfied with what she
had achieved. She learned modestly from technicians and made notes
of key technical problems in her production line.
</P>
<P>
Then, she spent three months on modifying the process flow
chart on 15 spots and readjusted the position chart. In this way
the output of the production line was raised from 1,000 to 1,800 a
day while the number of workers on the line reduced by 11.
</P>
<P>
Citing another example, General Manager Zhang Haoxian said a
new production line has turned out 30,000 waste stereo component
cores which were difficult to be repaired again. So the company
has decided to discard them.
</P>
<P>
Chen volunteered to repair them and used to work extra hours,
preventing a loss of 100,000 U.S. dollars for the company.
</P>
<P>
She won the title of "labor hero" in the national electronic field
in 1995 and "outstanding youth" in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This year, she was elected a deputy to the Ninth National
Congress and will go to Beijing on behalf of the 300,000 jobber
girls and boys in Guangdong.

100-bluechips stock Composite Index (CI) close to breaching the
750 points level.
</P>
<P>
For the week, the market opened lower on lack of fresh leads

be allowed to buy stakes in Bumiputera (aboriginals) companies
especially those which face financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The market however gave up its gains thereafter over
uncertainty on the terms that non-Bumiputera firms would be able
to buy Bumiputera shares.
</P>
<P>
The market sentiment was lifted after Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim's clarification on Thursday that the changes
announced might be permanent in nature and the spillover effect
was felt on Friday morning as investors bought generously but in

ringgit (about 1.3586 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Village Communist Leader Elected NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Wang Xianshi, one month ago
elected a new deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is extremely busy
every day with matters related to fellow villagers.
</P>
<P>
He cares about the aged at the home for the aged, vegetables in
greenhouses, three village-run businesses, among other things.
</P>
<P>
The Doufuao Village in Togtoh County of Inner Mongolia used to
be so poor that it was well-known only for its debts.
</P>
<P>
Before 1991 when Wang Xianshi was elected secretary of the
village's Communist Party Committee, the annual per capita income
of local farmers was only 600 yuan (about 75 US dollars). Last
year, the figure rose to 2,180 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The village runs three businesses which have a total output
value of 10 million yuan a year. About 40 percent of the
households live in newly built brick-tile houses which are
spacious and bright, and 90 percent of homes boast modern
household electric appliances and farm machines.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, generations living in the village used
to drink high fluorine water. Last year the villagers were able to
drink clean tap water.
</P>
<P>
"We could not imagine all of these before," said Hao Jun, Wang
Xianshi's predecessor. "I gave little benefits to the villagers
when I acted as secretary, so I stepped down on my own initiative."
</P>
<P>
In some remote Chinese villages, those with pioneering spirit
are often chosen to lead others to get well-off together. Before
acting as Party committee secretary, Wang Xianshi was the richest
in the village engaged in contracting construction projects.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the villagers, Wang began to serve as
village leader, leading all the farmers to achieve common
wealth. Successively, he handed out more than 200,000 yuan to help
the villagers develop planting and breeding projects.
</P>
<P>
Wang becomes busier after being elected NPC deputy. He said the
most pressing task was doing investigations in rural work and
listening to the farmers' views and suggestions which he would
take to the upcoming first session of the Ninth NPC to be held
next week in Beijing.

<P>
PYONGYONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung's inaugural speech did not mention the principle and
basic issues involved in inter-Korean relations, the DPRK "Rodong
Sinmun" said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kim's speech failed to give any realistic suggestions on the
peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, "Rodong Sinmun"
said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea felt it was
disappointing that Kim did not offer a reunification policy
different from his predecessors, nor did South Korea respond to
the DPRK's recent appeal for improving relations.
</P>
<P>
There can be communication and cooperation, as well as
dialogues and discussions, between the DPRK and South Korea, but
both need to face up to the past and learn from it, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should make a joint effort to get rid of outside
interference. Both of the same ethnic peoples, the DPRK and South
Korea, should seek autonomy, reconciliation and unity, rather than
getting involved in confrontations, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK hoped the change of power in South Korea will bring
more changes towards improving the inter-Korean relations and
reunification.

<HEADLINE> Slovenia Continues to Seek NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia's Premier Janez
Drnovsek said his country will continue to perform all activities
essential for integration with NATO.
</P>
<P>
STA, Slovenia's Press Agency, said Drnovsek made the remark
Friday in a news conference after talks with Javier Solana,
Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), who is on a two-day visit to Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO membership remains one of Slovenia's goals," the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
But whether Slovenia will be admitted to NATO does not depend
on fulfilling criteria set by the military alliance, he complained.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia had successfully met the basic criteria for membership
even before the Madrid summit in July 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana repeated the importance of cooperation between Slovenia
and NATO. He praised the activities that were conducted last year,
adding that this year would be even more important, since the
Partnership for Peace intends to organize this year's most
important exercise in Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general said NATO would not change its open door
policy for applicant countries. He stressed that NATO expected
Slovenia to further upgrade its defense system in accordance with
democratic principles and NATO standards.
</P>
<P>
Several meetings will occur in 1998 to address various aspects
of cooperation between Slovenia and the Alliance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Solana stressed that Slovenia is very important to NATO. The
role of Slovenia has grown in importance since it became a
nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Power Crisis Called Hindrance to Bangladesh's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The biggest hindrance to
Bangladesh's industrialization is the power crisis, a government
official was quoted Saturday by press reports here as saying.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir told a
meeting on the industrial policy here Friday that the current
electricity supply is 2,200 megawatts, but the country needs 4,000
megawatts to attain the expected level of industrialization, the
state minister said, adding, "Electricity is such a product, the
supply of which creates further demand for that."
</P>
<P>
"We have to ensure electricity supply before the demand is
created," he said, calling for the private sector's participation
in power generation.
</P>
<P>
The power sector is open to the private sector, he said. "But
the response is not very encouraging," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the capacity of power generation should be
raised by at least 1,000 megawatts immediately by the government
itself through setting up new plants and the responsibility for
meeting further demand should be left to the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's Asia Policy Unchanged: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev said on Friday that his country will not
change its Southeast Asia policy despite the aftermath of
financial crisis in this region.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan would not abolish the agreements it had signed with
Southeast Asian countries on economic relations and trade, despite
their domestic economic difficulties, Tokayev told a national
newspaper..
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asia is not yet over, and
countries involved have seen currency devaluations, market
fluctuations and social and political uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Kazakhstan was geographically an Asian country,
Tokayev said his country, since its independence in 1991, had
always put its diplomatic focus on enhancing cooperation with
Asian states.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh foreign minister also spoke highly of China's
achievements in economic reforms and in guarding against financial
risk. He said China had not only evaded serious impact from the
financial crisis, but also maintained an annual economic growth
rate of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
As always, Kazakhstan attached importance to developing
bilateral relationships with Iran, Tokayev said.
</P>
<P>
There were no grounds to believe that Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbeyev's visit to the United States represented a
setback in relations between Kazakhstan and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Welcomes Cease-fire Between in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand expressed welcome to
a cease-fire between Cambodian forces loyal to Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and those of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Bangkok
Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand
Paribatra as saying the Thai government hoped the cease-fire would
be followed by smooth procedures of national reconciliation with
full cooperation from all Cambodian sides.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh issued a statement in Bangkok on Friday, saying he
was ordering his soldiers to unilaterally stop fighting and
prepare for the general elections scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, the Cambodian government ordered a truce in
response, but said the cease-fire only covered fighting against
Ranariddh's troops, not that against the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire is the first step of a plan proposed by Japan to
end the conflict in Cambodia and enable Ranariddh, who left the
country last July, to take part in the elections scheduled for
July 26.
</P>
<P>
The Thai deputy foreign minister said on Friday that the
cease-fire will have great impact on peace and stability in the
region and along the Thai-Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the repatriation of the 64,000 Cambodian refugees
in Thailand, saying Cambodia's national reconciliation would only
be complete when free and fair elections took place with the
participation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand is considering asking an international
organization to observe the repatriation.
</P>
<P>
He also praised as a new positive development the move of Hun
Sen to extend the deadline for candidates to register for the
elections so that Ranariddh would have enough time to return home
and compete.

BANGKOK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan

The prime minister is also expected to discuss the economic

</P>
<P>
During his visit, Chuan will donate 5,000 tons of rice to help
Indonesia alleviate price rises and food shortage, which was
caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon and aggravated by the
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said on Friday that the donation was a return to the

dollars as part of a 17.2-billion-dollar bailout package of the
International Monetary Fund, but had to back out later due to its

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Plays Important Role in China's Economic Policy-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Subcommittee on the
Economy of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has been playing an
important role in making the country's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the subcommittee has put forward 30
suggestions and investigation reports to the central authorities
on promoting the country's healthy economic development.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the CPPCC put forward suggestions to help cool down the
overheated construction, runaway inflation and chaotic financial
situation that were bedevilling the country.
</P>
<P>
China's leading bodies adopted many of the suggestions, and as
a result the country has been able to remain unscathed during the
ongoing Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the Subcommittee on the Economy have
backgrounds in economic theory and practice. They regularly
discuss China's economic situation, and schedule one or two key
subjects for further study every year.
</P>
<P>
Issues such as how to curb inflation, help state enterprises to
get out of difficulty and lift the heavy burden from farmers are
hot topics among the CPPCC members.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions of the CPPCC members were also reflected in
China's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the long-term
objectives to the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of state enterprises and governmental organs, the
subcommittee suggested to the central government that it draw up
overall and practical measures in line with its efforts to build a
socialist market economy, which must focus on restructuring state
enterprises, paring down government organs and making the
functions of the government more efficient.
</P>
<P>
These suggestions have been endorsed by the State Council and
used as reference by the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the CPPCC subcommittee has conducted a series of
investigations into agricultural development, and submitted to the
central government reports on grain and cotton production,
construction of irrigation projects and the heavy burdens on
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Corruption in Construction Industry Significantly Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of
Construction Hou Jie said here Friday a nationwide inspection of
construction projects has significantly curbed corruption in the
country's building sector and helped end chaos in the industry,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The inspection has been going on for 22 months, and has covered
310,700 construction projects, each involving an investment of
more than 500,000 yuan, Hou told a two-day national conference,
which is to end today.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1996, the ministry and three related central
government departments have launched consecutive investigations to
track down those engaged in construction malpractice and
corruption that is mainly responsible for shoddy building projects
and even serious structural collapses.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly one-third of the inspected projects were found to be
built in violation of regulations and rules set by construction
authorities," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,156 construction projects finished before 1995 were
found to have serious problems in quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that thanks to the concerted efforts of the
inspectors and local officials, 83,100, or 82.93 percent, of the
"problem" construction projects had been rectified by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
"We have downgraded 2,165 construction enterprises and
confiscated more than 4,000 licenses, meanwhile collecting 2.7
billion yuan worth of fines and unpaid taxes and 16.5 billion yuan
of construction arrears," Hou said.

<HEADLINE> Financial System to Undergo Five Major Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Five major changes will take
place in China's financial industry in 1998 as a result of the
country's three-year reform plan to establish a modern financial
system, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the plan seeks to regroup the financial industry and
reorganize financial institutions this year. Regrouping of
financial institutions will focus on merging branches within
individual banks or with other banks.
</P>
<P>
The "Big Four" state commercial banks will shift their focus
from the domestic market to establishing overseas branches.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's central bank -- the People's Bank of China
-- will establish first-level branches while abrogating or merging
county-level branches, according to the division of economic areas.
</P>
<P>
The second major change seeks to diversify the financial
mechanism separating enterprise management from government
functions.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks will speed up reforms to enhance commercial
viability. Management will be awarded more decision-making power.
</P>
<P>
Some security companies, trust and investment corporations and
non-bank financial institutions will reorganized as investment
banks.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, while China will adhere to its moderately tight
monetary policy, the implementation of the policy will become more
flexible and diversified.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will manage macro financial conditions through
indirect means, including the adjustment of deposit reserves,
reloaning, rediscounting, opening market operation and altering
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The fourth change relates to the realization that competition
among financial institutions is intensifying.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions and different regions will compete for
capital flow sources. If all goes well, there will be a resulting
increase level of competition among strong bank clientele.
</P>
<P>
The final change involves further expansion of the money market
to make up the capital deficiency of some institutions, thereby
raising capital efficiency.
</P>
<P>
More high-performing enterprises will be listed on the stock
exchange, while it will be possible to deal in state and corporate
equities of listed companies, also on the stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Visits S.American to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi is scheduled to depart for a six-day South American tour on
Saturday and aims to boost Italy's economic ties with Mercosur,
the region's largest economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure, Prodi told the Italian news agency
Ansa Friday that his trip would be centered on economic interests.
</P>
<P>
"South America is a traditional area of interest for Italian
foreign policy and for our investors," Prodi said. "Now, with its
growth and the consolidation of its democratic institutions, the
region is attracting the world's attention, both economically and
politically."
</P>
<P>
Italy and the European Union (EU) had been following the
development of regional integration under the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur), Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the 1995 EU-Mercosur accords, cooperation
between the two communities was destined not only to continue but
also to "accelerate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with
Chile and Bolivia as its associate members.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's South America will take him to Uruguay, Brazil and
Chile.
</P>
<P>
He will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Augusto Frantozzi
and a delegation of businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attempts to Bypass Congress on Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A day after campaign
finance legislation stalled in the Senate, U.S. President Bill
Clinton called on two federal agencies to put administrative
features of the legislation into effect.
</P>
<P>
In letters to the Federal Election Commission and the Federal
Communications Commission on Friday, Clinton urged a ban on
so-called "soft money" -- unlimited, hard-to-trace donations
interest groups are allowed to make to political parties -- and
requested that free and/or low-cost broadcast time be mandated for
candidates, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in his letter that the campaign-finance overhaul
appeared dead and "the most realistic next steps for reform will
come from the actions of regulatory agencies."
</P>
<P>
But even one of the sponsors of the campaign finance overhaul
legislation, Republican Senator John McCain, indicated displeasure
with the move through a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"That's something that should be decided by the executive and
legislative branch," an AP report quoted McCain spokeswoman Nancy
Ives as saying. "Mandating free broadcast time cannot and should
not be done by a regulatory agency, and that applies to banning
soft money as well."
</P>
<P>
Joe Lockhart, White House deputy press secretary traveling with
the president, who is in Utah on a three-day family ski vacation,
said that Senator McCain's pique was understood.
</P>
<P>
"We want campaign finance reform. If Congress won't deliver
campaign finance reform, we'll try to deliver it
administratively," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
In a showdown test vote Thursday on the bill, sponsored by
McCain and Democratic Senator Russ Feingold, supporters fell nine
votes shy of the 60 needed to end a Republican filibuster -- a
delaying tactic -- dooming the issue at least for now. The
centerpiece of the bill was a ban on unregulated "soft money."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing starts to release
today the weekly urban air quality report for the general public,
said Wang Guangtao, vice mayor of the capital city.
</P>

carbon monoxide and ozone.
</P>
<P>
"Information on air quality obtained by eight monitoring sites
across the city will also be publicized to the general public,

Guangtao said.
</P>
<P>
The city's air quality report shows that the city's air
pollution index stands at 206 from February 20 to 26, the air
quality ranks forth grade, a medium polluted city level, and the
nitrogen and oxygen compound created by coal burning and motor
vehicles' exhausts constitute the major pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Preparations got underway in June for releasing daily air
quality report, which will finally lead to publicizing air quality
forecast in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city has attached great importance to the city's
environmental protection. The municipal government has invested
more than 80 billion yuan (about 9.64 billion US dollars) in
environmental protection for the coming ten years, and the city's
enterprises have spent 2.7 billion yuan in completing 6,000-odd
pollution treatment projects.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Release Air Quality Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the oxygen-nitrogen compound level has risen since the
1980s because of the increasing number of automobiles, sulfur
level has remained the same, and the amount of suspended particles
has been declining, said Zhao Yiqi, director of the municipal
city's environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to a 41-week environmental study, the city's air
quality was quite good for ten weeks with slight pollution for 16
weeks in summer; medium pollution for 14 weeks, and serious
pollution for only one week.
</P>
<P>
An irrational industrial structure, rapid urban development,
and a growing population are all causes growing environmental
pressures. There are more than 4,000 construction sites around the
city, which has grown 28 percent in size.
</P>
<P>
Major cities like Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan have provided
such reports in the local media since last May.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal city will stress the air pollution treatment in
coming years," Zhao Yiqi said, adding that various measures will
be taken to improve the urban environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
"Investment in environmental protection will be increased from
accounting for two percent of the city's gross national products
to three percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Measures to be taken includes: replacing the city's energy
source of coal with natural gas, setting up 40 non-coal districts
in the urban areas; central heating, energy-efficient, and
sulfur separation devices are to be widely used; stricter
measures will be taken to tackle car emission pollution.
</P>
<P>
Management of construction sites will be further improved to
prevent dust pollution and key industrial air pollution will also
be treated.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN's Second Finance Ministers Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of the nine
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) opened a meeting here Saturday to discuss the region's
prolonged financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda set by an ASEAN senior officials
meeting Friday, the ministers will discuss various issues
including the use of regional currencies in an intra-ASEAN trading
system which was proposed at the Second Informal ASEAN Summit in
Kuala Lumpur last December.
</P>
<P>
Intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies instead of the U.S.
dollar is one of the strategies which members of the 30-year-old
organization plan to implement to control the financial crisis in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The regional economic woes, first triggered by the depreciation
of Thailand's currency, the baht, in mid-1997, has led to
significant devaluations in some other ASEAN currencies against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting disclosed that the ministers may reach
an agreement on financial cooperation among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting will also decide on the date and venue of
the next finance ministers' meeting and make preparations for the
sixth ASEAN summit scheduled to be held in Vietnam in December
1998, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to issue a joint press statement
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Wind Power to Be Available to 8 million People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Eight million Chinese people
who now have no access to electric power will have it by the end
of the century, an official of the State Planning Commission (SPC)
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the new power source is part
of the SPC's "Riding the Wind Plan," which was launched during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) to speed up the use of wind power.
</P>
<P>
"The full use of China's rich wind resources is of great
significance for reducing environmental pollution," said SPC
Vice-Minister Ye Qing at the signing ceremony establishing the
Xi'an Nordex Wind Turbine Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
The firm is a joint venture between China's Xi'an Aero-Engine
Corp. and Gas Turbine Power (Group) Corp. and Germany's Nordex
Balcke-Durr company.
</P>
<P>
It will manufacture 140 large wind turbines which can annually
produce 250 kwh and 600 kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Ye said by 2000, China's installed capacity of wind power is
expected to reach 400,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
Coal now is the primary source of energy in China, and that
situation will not change easily in a short time.
</P>
<P>
China's big coal consumption "will yield heavy pressure over
exploitation of natural resources, transportation and
environmental protection," an SPC official said, adding that wind
power is a good choice to solve this problem.

<HEADLINE> Kazakstan Optimistic About Caspian Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Kazakstan's Foreign Minister,
Kasymzhomart Tokayev, said Friday he was optimistic about reaching
an agreement on the Caspian Sea at a summit of the five Caspian
nations this year.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev said in an interview with the weekly "Panorama" that it
is possible to solve the legal status issue of the sea in near
future.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Kazakstan and Russia instructed the two
governments to set up special groups for bilateral discussions on
this issue after they met in Moscow in January.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached between the two sides in February to
divide the continental shelf of the Caspian Sea into five
according to the center line, Tokayev said.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan now share a close viewpoint with
Kazakstan and Russia, and the four countries are expected to make
further agreements.
</P>
<P>
Kazakstan and Russia would try to persuade Iran, another
Caspian nation, to abandon its plan for the common possession of
the sea among the five countries, said Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Azerbaijan and Kazakstan insisted on dividing the
Caspian Sea into five as a lake, while Russia, Iran and
Turkmenistan held that it should be possessed jointly or divided
according to nautical mileages among the five countries.

(about 2,018 U.S. dollars), an 8.5 percent increase on 1996.
</P>
<P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court to Rule on Line-Item Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court agreed on
Friday to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the
president line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a federal judge struck down the line-item
veto law as unconstitutional, but the administration has appealed
that ruling directly to the Supreme Court, as mandated by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The highest court's review will yield by late June what could
be a momentous balance-of-powers ruling. The case is scheduled to
be argued before the justices on April 27.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Republican-led Congress voted to provide the
president with the unprecedented power of canceling specific items
in spending and tax legislation, considered a key to fighting
wasteful "pork-barrel" projects.
</P>
<P>
The law took effect in January 1997, and Clinton used the
line-item veto 82 times last year, but Congress is expected to
restore 38 of those items with two-thirds majority votes in both
the House of Representatives and Senate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan said the 1996 law wrongly
"crosses the line between acceptable delegations of rule-making
authority and unauthorized surrender to the president of an
inherently legislative function; namely, the authority to
permanently shape laws and package legislation."
</P>
<P>
In the appeal acted on Friday, Justice Department lawyers
argued that Congress did not let the president unlawfully usurp
its power.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto was challenged last year by a group of
mostly Democratic senators, but the challenge was dismissed by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
This term's challengers are led by New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Idaho farmers.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani is seeking to restore a provision of last summer's
budget-balancing bill that would have let the city and New York
state raise taxes on hospitals and use the money to attract
federal Medicaid payments.

The Snake River Potato Growers sued over a Clinton veto of farm
cooperative subsidies.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A draft solution on the
UN-Iraq Deal drawn up by Britain and sponsored by the United
States and Japan met strong opposition in the Security Council of
the United Nations, diplomatic sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution warned Iraq of "the serious consequences "
if it does not comply with the Memorandum of Understanding reached
between the UN chief and the Government of Iraq days ago.
</P>
<P>
The sources said in the morning's consultation of the Security
Council, France, Russia, China as well as Brazil insisted that any
document make clear that the use of force against Iraq would not
be automatically without another Security council decision.
</P>
<P>
The same sources said China and France took the lead in
preventing Britain from formally submitting the draft resolution
to council members.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China and France briefed seven developing nations in
the Council after the consultation, and they agreed the resolution
should be: endorse Annan's agreement, call for its
implementation, strengthen language on the eventual lifting of
sanctions and contain no automatic use of force or hint of it, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations is expected to
consider its response to the Memorandum of Understanding
negotiated by the Secretary-General and Iraq through the beginning
of next week.

LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all sustained their recent rally and ended the week higher, with
London and Paris all hitting another new closing highs.
</P>
<P>
A sharp bout of profit-taking took leading British shares in
London back below the 5,800 level the market had reached earlier
during the session to close up only 2.5 points at 5,767.3, but
still the eighth record close since the beginning of February.
</P>
<P>
Talk that Glazo Wellcome may launch a hostile bid for
SmithKline Beecham fueled the market early on but gains proved
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts reckon the FTSE 100 index is poised to
break the 6,000-point mark.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index of leading German shares ended
with moderate gains, up 16.01 points at 4,711.79, but off fresh
record highs set earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the firm dollar and strong Wall Street
boosted the market.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris closed 24.89 points higher at
3,421.92, a new record closing high, as the market responded to a
steady opening in New York and data confirming France will meet

<HEADLINE> Study: National Republican Senatorial Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Mitch
McConnell and the National Republic Senatorial Committee he
chaired raised a record amount in "soft money" in 1997, according
to a Common Cause study.
</P>
<P>
The 10.7 million U.S. dollars raised by McConnell's committee
set a record for soft money raised by a congressional party
committee during a non-federal election year, said a spokesman for
the government watchdog group on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The previous record was set in 1995, when the same committee,
then chaired by Senator Alphonse D'Amato raised 6.6 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
McConnell has worked hard to help defeat a bipartisan campaign
finance overhaul plan, which would have banned so-called "soft
money" contributions -- unlimited hard-to-trace donations interest
groups are allowed to make to political parties.
</P>
<P>
Common Cause President Ann McBride has said, "Senator McConnell
would have the American people believe that his opposition to
campaign finance reform is based simply on an innocent defense of
the First Amendment. But what Senator McConnell fails to tell the
American people is that he is defending the corrupt soft money
system and at the same time is personally raising record amounts
of these unregulated, unlimited contributions."

in the Gulf, ready for air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"They're prepared, they're ready, they're not winding down,"
Michael Ryan told a conference in Orlando, Florida, on aerial
warfare organized by the Air Force Association.
</P>
<P>
He said no redeployment was imminent despite a U.N.-brokered
accord that averted a looming showdown between the United States
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"They are going to stay as long as they are needed. This is a
'wait and see'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Air Force was the modern enforcer of "gunboat
diplomacy", referring to 19th-century powers that sent their
warships to force concessions from weak nations under the threat
of bombardment, Ryan said: "I think that's a great compliment."
</P>
<P>
"One of the things about the Air Force is that we can get
there very quickly. We can react very fast with a very
substantial force," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Belittles World Court's Ruling on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday dismissed as "procedural matter" a ruling by the
International Court of Justice that gave Libya the first round
in a bitter legal battle over the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The International Court of Justice at the Hague, Netherlands,
ruled it had jurisdiction to hear Libyan complaints against
Britain and the United States over their 10-year pursuit of the
bombers of Pan Am flight 103.
</P>
<P>
Pan Am 103 exploded in December 1988 as it flew above the
Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing all 259 on board and 11
people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department shrugged off the World Court's
ruling as "a procedural matter."
</P>
<P>
"Libya got no satisfaction as the court except that the case
will continue, which we expect to win," spokesman James Foley
told reporters. "We are very confident that the decisions at the
U.N. Security Council will be upheld."
</P>
<P>
Right after the Lockerbie bombing, London and Washington
immediately pinned the blame on Libya and demanded the
extradition of two suspected bombers for trial in Britain or in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
To back their demands, they encouraged the U.N. Security
Council to impose sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British insistence on trying the two suspects in
their countries lie at the heart of Libya's original complaint to
the World Court in March 1992. In that document, Libya contended
it should be allowed to try the men itself.
</P>
<P>
The White House said U.N. sanctions and resolutions against
Libya remain in force despite the World Court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
"We had asked for them (the World Court) to dismiss Libya's
case as a preliminary matter. They have not done that, but
meanwhile we are convinced that Libya's claims against the
United States are not valid," White House spokesman P. J.
Crowley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said the World Court's ruling was simply a "technical
decision by the court."
</P>
<P>
"We will file a detailed answer to Libya's claims and await
further proceedings." he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urged to Further Stabilize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary
Fund (IMF) official said Friday that the Kenyan government should
take further actions to stabilize its economy and prepare some
conditions for resumption of negotiations on a suspended loan
with IMF.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Goodall Gondwe, Deputy
Director of the IMF's African Department, said that the Kenyan
government "is quite determined to do something about the
financial problems" which are facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Governor of the Central Bank of kenya, Nicah
Cheserem, expressed the government's willingness to implement
policy measures agreed with a visiting IMF mission when he met
with British Parliament Members who are on a visit to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Gondwe who led the IMF mission told reporters that in August,
1997, an IMF mission reached agreement with the Kenyan government
on a program of actions (four conditions) on a number of issues
of economic governance.
</P>
<P>
The mission which arrived in Kenya on February 9 and has just
concluded its talks with the government found that progress had
been made in implementing these conditions, said the IMF
official.
</P>
<P>
However, the official noted, "within each one of the four
conditions, a number of things should be done" and "there is a
long way to go in implementing these measures".
</P>
<P>
He predicted that negotiations on a possible second-annual
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement could
begin after the 1998/99 budget next June "if things are very
well".
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205 million U.S. Dollars loan package
under its soft-term ESAF on July 31 last year to reinforce its
protest against graft and poor governance in Kenya's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has said that it had complied with
agreements with IMF to set up an Anti-Corruption Authority,
strengthen the independent Kenya Revenue Authority, renegotiate
purchase contracts of Independent Power Producers and implement
the energy sector reform to ensure transparency.
</P>
<P>
But, Cheserem Friday admitted the failure to implement all
policy measures agreed with the IMF, slow pace in the
privatization of state enterprises and failure to fully address
governance issues.
</P>
<P>
According to Gondwe, Kenya's economic growth rate was
estimated at 3.5 percent in the second half of last year and at 1
percent from January to June this year and at 2 percent for the
fiscal 1997/98 year, down from 4.6 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of diminishing revenue and increased expenditure
including a higher wage bill stemming from the recent agreement
on teachers' salaries, he said, the current budget deficit was
envisaged at 1.7 percent of GDP, but now is estimated at 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
If these policy measures agreed with the Kenyan government are
fully implemented, the IMF official said, the deficit would be
reduced to 2.4 percent of GDP at the end of the current fiscal
year.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Hopes to Lift Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said Friday that there is a hope of releasing the
international sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Hero of the Day program on Russia's
NTV television channel, Primakov said that for the Iraqi
leadership displaying its forces was not the main reason for
changing its position toward international inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein realized that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission "ushers in a new stage,"
Primakov noted. When Iraq takes a constructive stance, it will be
possible to lift the sanctions sooner, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister believed that the Iraqi president will
fulfill his obligations, but voiced fear that there might be
provocations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military presence in the Gulf region will remain "for
some time" but then will "scatter," Primakov predicted.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on weapons inspection was signed between the U.N.
and the Iraqi leadership on February 23.
</P>
<P>
After that Russia called for lifting the international
sanctions against Iraq, which has affected the Iraqi population
seriously for more than seven years.

<HEADLINE> UK's Slowdown in Growth May Be Less Severe Than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The strong pound has done
surprisingly little damage to UK exports, according to the latest
economic data, as the trade deficit showed a surprising
improvement during December.
</P>
<P>
The December trade deficit was 510 million pounds (816 million
U.S. dollars), after 861 million pounds (1,306 million dollars) in
November, according to data from the Office for National
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter trade deficit was 1.93 billion pounds (3.09
billion dollars) after 530 million pounds (848 million dollars) in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The data will have a broadly impact on next week's meeting of
the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England, which is in
charge of setting interest rates, economic analysts here expect.
</P>
<P>
They were uncharacteristically vague about how the Bank of
England's Monetary Policy Committee would vote on interest rates
next week.
</P>
<P>
"The three members who voted to raise rates in January and
February will not have changed their minds. The question is
whether another two will have joined them," said Ciaran Barr, an
economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
</P>
<P>
The split vote on the MPC in the latest two months demonstrated
how close a call the interest rate decision has been.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's Inflation Report said the inflation outlook depends
on whether overseas trade slows the economy enough to offset
strong pay and price pressures at home.
</P>
<P>
However, the unexpected improvement could not disguise the
worsening trend in trade, with the deficit jumping to more than 4
billion pounds (6.4 billion dollars) in the final quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
David Walton, UK economist at Goldman Sachs, the U.S.
investment bank, said, "The underlying trend in the trade balance
remains adverse and net trade is likely to act as a drag on GDP
growth throughout 1998."

<HEADLINE> Oman Calls for GCC Meeting to Boost Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Oman on Friday urged the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to hold an emergency
meeting to discuss ways of propping up oil prices, the official
Omani News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Oman is "in consultations with other GCC countries on such a
meeting to reach a joint stand. I hope the meeting will be held
immediately," Omani Oil Minister Mohammed al-Ramhi said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ramhi criticized some Gulf countries for piling downward
pressures on the oil markets by producing more than their quotas
granted by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
</P>
<P>
He warned that such violations of quotas would give no hope to
oil price recovery.
</P>
<P>
Like other GCC members, whose economies are seriously reliant
on oil exports, Muscat has been keeping a wary eye on the oil
price slump.
</P>
<P>
The oil price collapse was triggered by redundant supplies and
slacked demand due to OPEC's November decision to increase its
output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5 million barrels per day, a
mild winter in northern hemisphere and Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The bearish factors have depressed crude prices from 1997's
averaged 19.4 U.S. dollars a barrel to the psychologically
important barrier of 14 dollars in the past months.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that the downslide would accelerate in
the next few months with Iraq's return to the markets, which has
become more possible than ever before after Baghdad and the United
Nations reached a deal on resolve the crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful solution accord signed Monday morning greatly
eased worries about the disruption of Iraq's oil exports, which
had been anticipated pending a possible U.S. military showdown
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, most GCC states remained hesitant to take actions to
shore up the sagging prices. They also refrain from supporting an
OPEC meeting to give oil prices a leg up by cutting off outputs.
</P>
<P>
The GCC state - Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain - share nearly 45 percent of proven oil
reserves in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, oil revenues accounted for about two thirds
of their total incomes.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionist Against Sinn Fein Returning to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of Ulster
Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, urged the British government
on Friday not to allow Sinn Fein to return to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
at Downing Street, Trimble told reporters that he expressed his
"very, very great concern" the Sinn Fein would be allowed back to
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I made clear our opposition to an early return for Sinn Fein
and we think that particularly March 9 would not be an appropriate
period," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that would be quite wrong and We are firmly
opposed to that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of Irish Republican Army which
struggles to separates Northern Ireland from Great Britain, was
barred from the peace talks last weekend for IRA's alleged
involvement in two killings this month. But the party could be
readmitted into the talks on March 9 on condition IRA conducts no
more terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
But Trimble, leader of the largest party representing Northern
Ireland's Protestant majority, did not say what action his Ulster
Unionist Party would take if Sinn Fein were allowed back into the
multiparty peace talks. He only said they would find a way of
making sure Sinn Fein would not dominate or control the process.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, U.S. Normalize Defense Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and his American counterpart Al Gore Friday
jointly announced the normalization of defense trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The normalization would take effect immediately through the
suspension of debarment of South African companies which had been
prohibited from United States defense trade, the South Africa's
Foreign Affairs Department said in statement on behalf of Mbeki
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the announcement, the South African parastatal
companies Armscor, Denel and its divisions were prohibited from
participating in transactions involving U.S. defense articles,
services and related technology because of actions undertaken
during the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
"In July 1996, (U.S.) Vice-President Gore and South African
Deputy President Mbeki agreed to a framework for resolution of
the issues related to the violations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It included the establishment of export control compliance
programs in each company. The U.S. and South Africa have each
determined that these compliance programs are satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The programs, which were reviewed by U.S. experts in South
Africa from February 20 to 26, were designed to ensure compliance
with American defense trade law and regulations when handling
U.S. origin items.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. inspection in South Africa during the past few days
had resulted in satisfaction at events. The American auditors had
found no reason why the embargo should not be lifted now,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of debarment opens the door for normalized
defense trade between the U.S. and South Africa, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Requests to Washington concerning defense trade transactions
that involve the South African companies (will) no longer be
subject to a presumption of denial. Instead, they will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with U.S. foreign
policy and national security criteria, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Armscor spokesman Billy Nel welcomed the Pretoria-Washington
agreement. He said he was glad it had been resolved: Armscor had
been working towards a normalization of the relations for over a
year.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations voluntary embargo imposed in 1963 -- giving
UN members the option of weapons trading or not with South Africa
-- was made compulsory in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was lifted in 1994, with the ending of apartheid
rule, but Washington maintained its own embargo.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, South African companies were indicted by a U.S. court
for dealing in defense material originating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lifting sanctions will now allow South Africa to proceed with a
deal to buy Swedish-built jet fighters laden with U.S. technology. The
deal has been on ice pending the lifting of the sanction.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Trying to Eradicate Tsetse Fly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Rift Valley
tsetse fly control and eradication project set up at a cost of
over 43 million U.S. Dollars has begun operation, the Ethiopian
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project was earmarked by the Ethiopian government and the
International Atomic Energy Agency with an aim to control and
eradicate tsetse fly which transmits trypanosomiasis within the
next 10 years in Ethiopia's lowland areas.
</P>
<P>
Tsetse fly is the carrier of the animal killer disease
trypanosomiasis.
</P>
<P>
The project will use atomic energy rays to sterilize the
tsetse flies and thereby reduce their reproductive rate. The idea
is to reproduce such sterilized flies in large numbers and to let
them loose and thus cause them to die out because they would no
longer be able to reproduce themselves.
</P>
<P>
About half of 1.5 million domestic animals in the lowland
areas are affected by trypanosomiasis.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Favors OPEC Action to Shore up Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has no objection to an
emergency session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to discuss cutting oil outputs to rescue sagging world
crude prices.
</P>
<P>
An official from Qatar's Ministry of Energy and Industry, who
was not named by the Qatari news agency, said Friday that Qatar
would attend an emergency OPEC meeting if a majority of members
decide to call one.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar will go along with the majority. If most members want a
meeting, we will attend it," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Qatar's participation would be
preconditioned upon the reaching of an formula to reduce output
in advance.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the situation (in oil markets) will not improve
without a cut in production. There should be a pre-agreed formula
and a minimum hope to solve the problems (of over-supplies)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari official made his remark amid reports that oil
ministers from OPEC member states are consulting ways to respond
to the recent price collapse.
</P>
<P>
The collapse was triggered by ample supplies and slacked
demand due to OPEC's November decision to increase its output
ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5 million barrels per day, a mild
winter in northern hemisphere and Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
So far, OPEC has taken no joint action against the falling oil
prices, but some members such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Indonesia
hinted they would consider an extraordinary meeting to discuss ways
of shoring up the prices.

<HEADLINE> UN Launches $550 Million Appeal to Meet Needs of Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Friday launched a consolidated inter-agency appeal for countries
of the Great Lakes and Central Africa, seeking 550 million U.S.
dollars to meet the emergency neeeds of over 5 million people in
1998 in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, United
Republic of Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said
that the humanitarian situation in the region still remains grave.
Cross-border and internal tensions are on the increase, leaving
hundreds of thousands vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
The Office said over 2 million people are displaced throughout
the region. In addition, the food deficit has increased, social
services have been disrupted and the economies have become
severely debilitated. These afflictions have been further
compounded by the effects of recent drought and flooding.
</P>
<P>
The appeal reflects the complex mosaic of requirements in the
region. It aims at providing the basic life-saving assistance
still needed while also assisting countries in rebuilding their
national infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The appeal has been formulated in line with UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's program for reform, in that it
seeks to address both basic relief needs and reconstruction
requirements of war-damaged societies in a balanced and integrated
fashion.
</P>
<P>
It also corporates capacity-building activities identified by
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In so
doing, the appeal attempts to build an environment conducive to
reconciliation and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the international community will respond
generously in helping the people of the Great Lakes region and
Central Africa to break the cycle of destructive crisis and embark
on the path of reconstruction and reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Outlines Land Distribution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Lands and Agriculture Minister
Kumbirai Kangai Friday unveiled Zimbabwe's future land
distribution patterns which will cut commercial farmers land from
15.5 million hectares to six million.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing participants at a one-day Zimbabwe
economic society seminar on land reform.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said Zimbabwe has a total land area of 39 million
hectares with 33.3 million reserved for agricultural purposes and
six million for national parks.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's land reform program focuses on the identification
and acquisition of land to eliminate the racial and sectoral
imbalances in land distribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's 5,000 white commercial farmers own
almost half of the total agriculture land.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said for independence to be meaningful the government
had to embark on the land redistribution exercise.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was still working on farms and the
hectarage that were going to be acquired, but had realized that
simply resettling people without ensuring efficient and effective
utilization would not result in optimum production in
resettlement areas.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was currently spearheading the drafting
of a new land bill.
</P>
<P>
The government would introduce a tax on agricultural land to
encourage efficient utilization of land and discourage holding of
land for speculative purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kangai stressed the land reform program sought to eradicate
poverty and reduce pressure for land in the communal areas.
</P>
<P>
about 70,000 families have been resettled since independence
in 1980 but another 100,000 still wait for the land which the
government has been promising for the past 18 years.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refutes Netanayhu Words on Lebanon, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon said on Friday that it
is not "a card" of Syria, rather a supporter of Syria in the same
struggle for the restoration of lands occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
remarks early in the day, Lebanese Information Minister Bassem
Al-Sabaa said Israel is attempting to drive a wedge between
Lebanon and Syria by give the public an illusion that Lebanon is
"a card" in Syria's hands.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Israel is afraid that the two countries join hands to
fight for their rights to restore south Lebanon and the Golan
Heights under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Syria's Golan Heights in 1967, and set up a
so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Netanyahu accused Syria of using Lebanon as a
war front to launch attacks on Israel, forcing the Jewish state to
negotiate with it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he made it clear that Israel is ready to hold talks
with Syria on any issues, including the Golan Heights, without
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel is willing to comply with the United
Nations Resolution 425 after security arrangements are clinched
with Lebanese government, a condition rejected by the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, adopted in 1978, calls for unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister said that it is absolutely clear that
Israel is exactly unwilling to withdraw its troops from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli will never be able to change the historical and
geographical facts which it has been trying to do, Al-Sabaa
added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's Legal Abortion on Horizon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- One year has passed
since South Africa legalized abortion on February 1, 1997, and
during the period success and failure of the law remain one of
the major topics of local people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, overall 18,346 women had terminations of pregnancy
(TOPs) from February 1 to September 30 throughout South Africa,
according to incomplete official statistics.
</P>
<P>
This indeed is not a small number for South Africa where until
today a considerable number of conservative people still frown on
any form of abortion.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the legalization of abortion and accessible
terminations, the number of maternal deaths in South Africa has
dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
It was officially estimated that before terminations were
legalized, 300,000 women suffered back street abortions in South
Africa annually, with about 44,000 of them being admitted to
hospital because of complications.
</P>
<P>
The back street abortions have annually costed the medical
departments around 8.6 million Rand (about 1.75 million U.S.
Dollars). What is worse, medical authorities said, more than 400
women died every year of back street abortions.
</P>
<P>
Of all nine provinces in South Africa, hospitals of Gauteng
are believed to have the most abundant medical experts and the
most advanced medical equipment as compared with their
counterparts in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is reasonable and understandable to see Gauteng
Province, which Pretoria and Johannesburg are situated in, taking
the lead in the number of TOPs -- 9,124 women had terminations
performed in Gauteng Province from last February to September
while there were only 329 in the neighboring Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Gauteng Province has at least 101
designated facilities to perform TOPs compared to only two in
Northern Province and two in Eastern Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that the sharp difference has forced women from
largely rural provinces to flood the hospitals and community
health centers in provinces with better resources, asking for
abortions.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Mhlanga, director of maternal, children and women's
health, told the media recently that "access (to professional
abortion) for poor, rural women is very limited."
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon, in which urban women benefit far more than
those in rural areas, demonstrated deficiency of the current
legalization of abortion, she said.
</P>
<P>
To make up the "uneven success" of legal abortion, the South
African Health Department has designated this year a significant
number of additional clinics to carry out professional abortion
operations wherever facilities are available.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the health authorities are also training as many
as possible qualified medical staff so as to make the rank and
file women have more easy access to safe abortion.

However, he indicated that the Angolan government will not
hesitate to do everything possible to safeguard the country's
territorial integrity, sovereignty, stability and rule of law.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Mining Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Friday calls on China
to cooperate with it in mineral exploration and exploitation to
tap its rich mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
This is also important for further promoting the existing good
relations between the two countries, said Minister of Solid
Minerals Development Alhaji Kaloma Ali.
</P>
<P>
The minister made these remarks at a meeting with a Chinese
delegation led by Shou Jiahua, Deputy Minister of Geology and
Geological Resources.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali, Nigeria has discovered some 400 varieties of
solid minerals, including gold, kaolin and talc. However, due to
lack of necessary technology and machinery, the country has to
import some foreign mineral products to meet its domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Nigeria hopes China will assist the country with
its technology which is "practical and easy to master", Ali said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also wanted Chinese companies to bring their
mineral exploration and exploitation equipment to Nigeria, saying
that Nigerian companies will like the cheap and easy-to-operate
machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
He added that the cooperation in mineral resources on the
basis of mutual benefit will help expand bilateral trade and
strengthen economic ties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the leading oil producing and exporting country in
Africa, with the turnover of oil accounting for more than 60
percent of the government's annual revenue and foreign exchange
income.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the over-dependence on oil and diversify the source
of foreign exchange, the Nigerian government has over the past
few years put it high on its agenda to develop solid minerals.
</P>
<P>
Ali's ministry was only established three years ago to carry
out this government strategy and has based high expectation from
China on the friendly bilateral relations, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade has also been increasing with the good
relations, and as a result, Nigeria has become China's second
largest trade partner in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, trade between China and
Nigeria is close to 300 million U.S. Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Currently a Chinese company is engaged in the rehabilitation
of Nigeria's railway system and the dredging of a port leading to
the country's first export processing zone has been completed by
another Chinese company.
