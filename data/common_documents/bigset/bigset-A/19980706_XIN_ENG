<HEADLINE> UK to Build New Aircraft Carriers to Replace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said Sunday that Britain would built two huge new
aircraft carriers to replace three smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
Robertson made the remarks during an interview with BBC TV
ahead of the planned announcement of the conclusions of the
government's sweeping defense review next week.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC, "When we get the carriers they will be built in
Britain. That will not be until 2012, but certainly at that time
they will be built in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gordon Brown reportedly wanted Robertson to award
contracts on the basis of value for money only and accept overseas
bids for the aircraft carriers if they were cheaper than bids from
British firms.
</P>
<P>
On the defense review itself, Robertson said that the review
had not been cuts-led and instead was designed to shape the armed
forces to fulfill Britain's foreign policy obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We want Britain to be relevant in the world, to
fulfill its obligations to national defense and its allies, but
also to make a difference in the world where the British people
want us to make a difference."
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he was confident the review would be supported
by service chiefs who had been widely consulted during the review
process.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Textile Workers's Wage to Increase by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The estimated number of 12,000
textile workers in Zimbabwe will get a 34 percent wage increase,
an official announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President of Zimbabwe Textile Workers Union Robson Mangombe
said wage increases agreement reached between the union and the
employers, Central African Textile Manufacturers Association
(CATMA), went into effect from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Mangombe added that earlier workers were awarded an interim
increment of 10 percent from April to the end of June this year,
in a bid to cushion them from the prevailing inflationary cost of
living.
</P>
<P>
"However with the new wage increases that 10 percent has been
scrapped off," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the union was yet to hold discussions with the
employers on issues relating to housing, transport and medical
aid allowances for the workers.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Employment Council Milton Gwethu said
most of the workers in the industry were living below the poverty
datum line of 3,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (166 U.S. Dollars) and as
a result there was need to cushion them from the increasing cost
of commodity prices.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport Sees Last Flight Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 747-400 took off from
Kai Tak shortly after midnight on Sunday, the last scheduled
flight to depart from the airport, marking a historic moment in
the long chapter of Hong Kong's aviation history.
</P>
<P>
The 388-seat Boeing 747-400, Cathay Pacific's CX 251, departed
for London.
</P>
<P>
The last incoming flight landed at Kai Tak at 11:40
p.m. Sunday, the last operational day of the airport. Kai Tak will
be officially closed at 6:30 a.m. Monday, when the new airport at
Chek Lap Kok opens for commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
At around 10:00 p.m. (14:00 GMT) on Sunday, passengers, Civil
Aviation officials, stewardess, and dozens of reporters clustered
around Gate 31, from where the last passengers were to board the
plane.
</P>
<P>
Mr Ho, a teacher from Taiwan who was going for a
holiday in Britain, was busy taking pictures in front of the
boarding gate. "It is the last night of Kai Tak. I feel a little
bit sad," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
But the Bennetts from Britain were excited when they realized
that they would be on the final flight departing from Kai Tak. The
husband, wife and daughter quickly checked in to catch a last
glimpse of Kai Tak before they returned their London home. "It's a
 day to remember," said Bennett's wife Gina.
</P>
<P>
Captain Kim Sharman, the pilot of the flight, said at the
boarding gate: "I have been part of Hong Kong for 21 years. There
are a lot of memories tonight."
</P>
<P>
"Nostalgic" was how the 51-year-old captain felt at the moment
after flying Cathay Pacific's flights for two decades.
</P>
<P>
A Cathay Pacific stewardess Huang Yiling was on hand to help
passengers on a wheelchair. She said: "I'll be missing this
airport. It is the most convenient airport in the world."
</P>
<P>
Passengers started boarding at 10:50 p.m., and Hong Kong's
Department of Civil Aviation (CAD) presented to each of them a
souvenir, inscribed with "Hong Kong International Airport (Kai
Tak) 1936-1998."

<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- About thirty airliners parked in
the airfield of the old Kai Tak airport made a short hop to their
new home at the Chek Lap Kok airport, which opens to commercial
operation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The last of the airliners, a Cathay Pacific plane, took off at
1:05 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
Closely following the relocation of the airliners, lights at
Kai Tak will be switched off by Hong Kong Director of Civil
Aviation Richard Siegel, marking a full stop to Kai Tak's 73-year
operation.
</P>
<P>
The airliner relocation formed an integral part of the
overnight move of airport operations which also involved 1,000
vehicles movements and 14 barge sailings between 5:30 p.m. Sunday
and 6:30 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first and last time that late night flights are
allowed at Kai Tak, where there has been an after-midnight curfew
to prevent aircraft noise disturbing residents living near the
airport.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not to Open Gaza Roads: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel will not open roads in the
Gaza Strip in face of Palestinian violence, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu accused the
Palestinians of blockading Jewish settlements and threatening
violence in a standoff over a coastal road in Gaza last week.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel would not agree to the request of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to open Israel-controlled
roads in Gaza in face of violence.
</P>
<P>
The PNA must understand that any attempt to violate the
agreements would meet with "absolute Israeli refusal" to allow
that to happen, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will know how to take measures to secure its citizens,"
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks came as Israeli army officers are expected
to meet with Palestinian security officials in Gaza in the next
few days to discuss the future of the disputed road.
</P>
<P>
His words seem to be contradictory to the promise made by the
Israeli army that if possible, it will reopen roads that are
currently closed to the Palestinians for "security reasons."
</P>
<P>
The proposed meeting was arranged in an agreement leading to
the end of the standoff, during which the Palestinians blockaded
roads to Jewish settlements in protest against Israeli soldiers'
refusal to allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian vehicles to pass what
they called "security roads" near the settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have accused each other of
violating in this incident peace agreement they have signed.

<HEADLINE> Last Flight Lands at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The last batch of incoming air
passengers at Kai Tak Airport were greeted Sunday night by a large
number of reporters and photographers and sightseers, more warmly
than their family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
The last incoming flight, Dragon Air's KA 841 from the inland
Chinese city of Chongqing, landed at Kai Tak at 11:40 p.m. Sunday,
the last operational day of the airport.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak will be officially closed at 6:30 a.m. Monday, when the
new airport at Chek Lap Kok opens for commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
Lights flashed and the scene looked much more like greeting
Hollywood superstars.
</P>
<P>
Nearly every passenger was seizing the last chance to snap
pictures at the arrivals hall.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong passenger bombarded with questions by reporters
said in Cantonese: "I will miss Kai Tak." The man took many
pictures after getting off the plane -- at the side of the plane,
immigration counters and the arrivals hall.
</P>
<P>
The flight was about one hour and 10 minutes later than
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Around 1:00 a.m. Monday, there will be a lights out ceremony
putting an end to Kai Tak's 73 years of services.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Sweep Across Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires mainly caused by high
temperatures have since this weekend been sweeping across Greece
with the death of a woman and destruction of homes and thousands
of acres of pinewoods and farmland.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four fires are still raging out of some 185 blazes that
erupted Saturday, and Greek firefighters have extinguished 161 of
the total.
</P>
<P>
The worst still raging are on Parnitha, one of the mountains
ringing the Greek capital of Athens, in Vytina, Arkadia, Kavala,
northeastern Greece, and on the island of Evia.
</P>
<P>
A 67-year-old woman reportedly died in a blaze on Salamina and
three others were injured.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the effort were 5,000 firefighters, 1,200
military personnel, and 52 planes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
A strong heat wave is currently hitting Greece with the
temperatures soaring as high as 45 degrees in most parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government attributes the spate of forest fires
mainly to high temperatures, but police are also investigating
whether arson is to blame for some of the fires.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Aim to Re-create Mammoths From Frozen Sperm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are planning to create a
new generation of the extinct mammoths by using deep-frozen sperm
from animals that died 40,000 years ago, The Sunday Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Next month an expedition to Siberia will excavate mammoth
carcasses buried in the Arctic permafrost, with the intention of
extracting sperm from them and use it to fertilize elephants' eggs
and breed hybrids.
</P>
<P>
Cross-breeding with successive generations would allow the
hybrids gradually to become pure genetic copies of their mammoth
ancestors, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists involved in the project run jointly by Britain,
Japan and Russia have already proved that long-dead sperm can be
used to create viable embryos in cattle, according to The Sunday
Times.

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz on Sunday met with the leader of France's "Christian's
Movement in the Fifth Republic" Michel Grimard, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz and Grimard reviewed the latest developments of Iraq's
relations with the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
and means of further developing Iraqi-French ties in the interests
of the two countries, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz praised "French friends and political figures" for their
peace-loving effort and support to Baghdad's call for the lifting
of crippling U.N. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sweeping sanctions in 1990
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions can only be lifted
by the Security Council after UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
scrapped all prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's meeting, Grimard voiced objection to the trade
embargo on Iraq, stressing his party's determination to continue
efforts to champion "Iraq's just cause."
</P>
<P>
He said he was hopeful that the coming months would witness an
end to the eight-year sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi and French defense
ministers Sunday held talks on a host of bilateral and regional
issues of common concern, especially ways to promote defense
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Saudi Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
France's Alain Richard praised Saudi-French relations, which they
said are improving, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Richard, who arrived earlier in Jeddah, Saudi Red Sea coast
city, on a one-day visit, reportedly delivered a letter to Prince
Sultan during the meeting, but the content of the letter was not
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Informed diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said the two
officials discussed defense cooperation in light of France's
readiness to supply the kingdom with its defense needs.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the talks covered a potential Saudi purchase
of French-made le Clair tanks, a deal still facing competition
from the U.S.-made "Abrhams" main battle tanks and British-made
"Challenger" tanks.
</P>
<P>
It was said that France hopes to sell 350 le Clair tanks and
38 Recovery vehicles worth 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, French diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia are
cautious about the deal. They said the Richard's visit was not
aimed at concluding contracts.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: 73-year-old Kai Tak Airport Closes Down (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- At 01:16 a.m. Monday, the lights
along Hong Kong Kai Tak's 3,390-meter-long runway were turned off,
marking a full stop to the airport's 73-year services.
</P>
<P>
Director of Civil Aviation Richard Siegel switched off the
lights at the Air Traffic Control Center, watched by
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan and Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the greatest airports in the world. But it's time
to say good-bye to an old friend," Siegel told all the guests at
a "lights out" ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the lights out ceremony, a dramatic overnight
relocation of airport operations from Kai Tak to the new Hong Kong
International Airport at Chek Lap Kok was in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Thirty airliners parked in the Kai Tak airfield made a short
hop to the new airport, forming an integral part of the 13-hour
mammoth movement to be finished at 6:30 a.m. Monday when the new
airport greets its first incoming flight.
</P>
<P>
The final day's air traffic at Kai Tak was as busy as
before. The last incoming flight, from southwest China's
Chongqing, touched down at Kai Tak at 11:40 p.m. Sunday, while
the last outbound flight took off shortly after midnight for
London.
</P>
<P>
Among the last batch of passengers departing from Kai Tak was
Mr Ho, a teacher from Taiwan who was going for a holiday in
Britain. He was busy taking pictures in front of the boarding
gate. "It is the last night of Kai Tak. I feel a little bit sad,"
he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
But the Bennetts from Britain were excited when they realized
that they would be on the final flight departing from Kai Tak. The
husband, wife and daughter quickly checked in to catch a last
glimpse of Kai Tak prior to their long journey back home in
London. "It's a day to remember," said Bennett's wife Gina.
</P>
<P>
Captain Kim Sharman, the pilot of the flight, said at the
boarding gate: "I have been part of Hong Kong for 21 years. There
are a lot of memories tonight." "Nostalgic" was how the
51-year-old captain felt at the moment after flying Cathay
Pacific's flights for two decades.
</P>
<P>
A Cathay Pacific stewardess Huang Yiling was on hand to help
passengers on wheelchairs. She said: "I'll be missing this
airport. It is the most convenient airport in the world."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Department of Civil Aviation presented to each of
them a souvenir, inscribed with "Hong Kong International Airport
(Kai Tak) 1936-1998."

<P>
It was not just passengers who were excited. The last
operational day of Kai Tak gripped the hearts of the people, with
hundreds of thousands turning out to pay last respects to the "old
friend" that grew up with the city and its people.
</P>
<P>
Inside the passenger terminal building, there were a big number
of sightseers who were snapping final pictures of signposting,
flight information monitors and airline counters, and buying
airport postcards at retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
The rooftop of the multistoried airport carpark was closed to
the public throughout Sunday, but lower stories were packed with
plane spotters taking photographs and shooting video footage of
aircraft on their dramatic descent to the runway jutting into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
At vantage points at the Kowloon City, a densely populated area
where the airport is located, and on the waterfront of the
harbor, nostalgic Hong Kongers were clustering to say a good-bye
to Kai Tak airport.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hong Kong Airport Authority Wong Po-yan has for
the past several years been associated with the construction of
the new airport and is eager to see its operation. But on the
last day of Kai Tak, the airport he has been so familiar with,
Wong said: "I think all of us will cherish the memory of Kai Tak."
</P>
<P>
Despite the geographic limitation, the overcrowded downtown Kai
Tak airport has been operating efficiently and speedily in terms
of both moving passengers and cargo.
</P>
<P>
It ranked as one of the world's busiest airports in 1997, its
last full year of operation, by handling 28.3 million passengers
and 1.79 million tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Total aircraft movements hit 165,154 in 1997 -- to put it in
another way, every two minutes during peak hours there was an
aircraft taking off or landing at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 airlines now offer direct regular services to link
Hong Kong with more than 100 destinations all over the world.
</P>
<P>
After the movement of the airport, Kai Tak will be redeveloped
for residential and commercial use.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan Sunday received a letter from Iran's First Vice President
Hassan Habibi which stressed Iran's keenness to improve bilateral
relations and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered by Habibi's personal envoy, Iranian
Ambassador Ali Asghar Khagi, during his meeting with Ramadan here,
the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramadan said that President Saddam Hussein
attached importance to relations between the two countries and
expressed the hope that they would be developed to a high level
through cooperation in different fields with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said that Saddam's hope goes in harmony with the
instructions of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to close the
files of the past and look to the future in a new spirit and with
a joint action to serve the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said Iraqi leadership and people are relieved to see
current bilateral relations, and emphasized the significance of
solving outstanding issues between the two sides, most important
of which is the issue of prisoners of war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the issue of POWs will be settled in
three months as has been agreed upon by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of meetings and visits between Iraqi and
Iranian officials will contribute to high-level cooperation, he
said, affirming Iraq's willingness to develop bilateral ties for
mutual benefit and to ensure peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf also met with Khagi and discussed the issue of POWs.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors, which fought a bloody war in 1980-88, have
stepped up efforts to solve issues that are in the way of a full
resumption of normal relations.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the two countries carried out the largest swap of
POWs and detainees since 1991, during which some 6,000 were set
free.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday called on the
Lebanese government to help probe into the case of four Iranian
diplomats missing in Beirut in 1982.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said that since
several factional leaders involved in the criminal action have
been under investigation, Iran hopes the Lebanese government would
see into the case.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Israel of being behind the case, saying
those Iranians were abducted by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
in northern Beirut on July 4, 1982.
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence that the four Iranian nationals have been
taken to Israel and they are alive," it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Lebanon was mired in its 1975-90 civil war, in which
different factions of Muslims and Christians were fighting for
control of Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan, Iran Strengthen Joint Efforts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran are
strengthening their joint efforts for promoting the long-desired
peace process in war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
High-level government officials from Pakistan and Iran will be
holding consultations on Afghanistan in Tehran next week.
Pakistan's special envoy on the Afghan issue Iftikhar Murshid
plans to visit Iran next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Murshid was to proceed to Tehran on Sunday, but the visit has
been delayed for two days.
</P>
<P>
According to government sources, the consultations in Tehran
will be a follow-up to a joint Pakistan-Iran team's recent visit
to Afghanistan, as well as talks with leaders of the Taliban
militia and the opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
A two-member Pakistan-Iran fact-finding mission recently
visited Kandahar, Afghanistan's largest city and the headquarters
of the Taliban, and Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The team held separate talks with the leaders of the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The Main objective of the visit was to put on track the talks
between the Taliban and their rivals, which broke down in
Islamabad on May 3 after five days," the sources said. The joint
team urged the two rival Afghan factions to go to the negotiation
table to try find a peaceful solution to the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
The two Afghan warring factions held their first face-to-face
talks in more than a year in late April and early May. The talks
broke down due to their serious differences over matters
concerning the formation of the proposed Ulema (religious
scholars) Commission, exchange of POWs and the lifting of the
blockade to humanitarian assistance to central Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, the two sides had agreed on the formation of
the Ulema Commission to seek a peaceful solution to the
long-running problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban, who themselves proposed forming the Ulema
Commission, dropped the idea of holding dialogue with the Northern
Alliance under the proposed commission at the Islamabad talks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's unilateral discontinuation of the talks and the
dropping of the idea of the Ulema Commission shocked the peace
brokers including Pakistan, Iran, the United Nations and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to resume the talks, Pakistan launched the fresh
peace efforts last month when Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Siddique Kanju visited Afghanistan for talks with the
leadership of the two warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Kanju invited one representative each from the two sides to
come to Pakistan to discuss new options relating to the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan and Iran discussed new proposals for the
resumption of the talks during a visit here by Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi and Iranian envoy on Afghanistan Alaedin
Broujerdi.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-Iran joint team, in its recent visit to
Afghanistan, also discussed with the two Afghan factions the
possibility of holding the next meeting in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance has suggested that the next talks should
be held outside Pakistan. The ousted Afghan president, Burhanuddin
Rabbani, renewed the proposal for holding talks in Iran at a press
conference in Mazar-e-Sharif on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that diplomatic efforts are underway to convince
the Taliban militia to go to Iran for talks with their rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's chief representative based in Islamabad, during a
recent interview with Xinhua, said the militia had no difference
with Iran. But he added: "regrettably Tehran has not yet changed
its policy towards us."
</P>
<P>
However, Iran has denied the Taliban's accusations that it is
backing the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences over the Afghan issue, Pakistan and
Iran have been coordinating efforts to promote a negotiated
settlement of the Afghan imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was the first country to recognize the Taliban
government in May 1997 when forces of the Islamic militia briefly
entered Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Iran, however, still recognizes the ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani as the legitimate ruler of the central Asian
nation.

<HEADLINE> Coordinated Strategies to Address Year 2000 Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Year 2000 Council has
recommended that national government bodies be created in order to
implement coordinated strategies to address the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of coordinated national strategies will
produce efficiencies and accelerate the action necessary to tackle
the Year 2000 problem in the short time that remains before the
millennium change, said the council in a press release Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The council, established on April 8, 1998, is sponsored by the
Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payment
and Settlement Systems, the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors, and the International Organization of Securities
Commissions. The secretariat for the council is provided by the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) based in the northern
Swiss city of Basle.
</P>
<P>
The council intends to meet regularly and has agreed on a range
of initiatives to ensure a high level of attention on the Year
2000 computer challenge within the global financial supervisory
community, to share information on regulatory and supervisory
strategies and approaches, to discuss possible contingency
measures, and to serve as a point of contact with national and
international private-sector initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"The seriousness of the potential consequences of failing to
adequately meet the Year 2000 challenges and the complexity of
developing solutions to avoid major disruptions clearly demands a
more coordinated effort across key industries than is currently
under way in most countries," the council said.
</P>
<P>
"One possibility for designing and implementing a national
coordinated strategy is the creation of a national government body
that would coordinate preparations for Year 2000 readiness across
the key industries and infrastructure providers in its
jurisdiction," its said.
</P>
<P>
The tasks that the council recommended to a national government
coordinating body include:
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the awareness of the complexity of the Year 2000
challenges in both the private and the public sectors;
</P>
<P>
-- Cooperating with relevant private sector organizations to
ensure that proper action is taken in all sectors of the economy
to achieve Year 2000 readiness by all users of information
technology, both large and small;
</P>
<P>
-- Paying particular attention to readiness efforts of major
utility providers such as electricity companies, telecommunication
companies and water suppliers;
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing target dates for completing key phases of Year
2000 programs appropriate for the industry and market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged Not to Politicize Iranian Defector's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The mother of an Iranian defector on
Sunday urged the United States "not to allow any political
exploitation" of the mental state of her son who sought political
asylum in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, Masoomeh
Khadang, wife of a former commander of the elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps, also appealed for international help
in reuniting her son, Ahmad Rezaee, with the family.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad, son of Mohson Rezaee, arrived in the U.S. last March
from the United Arab Emirates, where he was offered a job last
year.
</P>
<P>
"I also wish to ask you, as foreign minister who represents the
esteemed leader, the nation and the government in foreign affairs,
to caution the U.S. government not to allow my son to be subjected
to any psychological pressures and not to allow any political
exploitation of his mental anguish," she said in the letter,
quoted by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
She said that his son suffered in a traffic accident some 17
months ago, the mental anguish as a result of the accident and his
unsuccessful marriage left him in a state of depression.
</P>
<P>
While still under medical observation and treatment, he was
deceived by a person called Majid Tawana and was subsequently
separated from his family, she explained.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad was passed through several countries before being taken
to the U.S., she said.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of America, the U.S. government organ, aired an
interview with Ahmad on Thursday, claiming that he has sought
political asylum in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
But Ahmad's younger brother Ali said on Friday that he was
kidnapped by the U.S. National Aeronautical and Space
Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
However, local daily Salam on Sunday quoted "an informed source
close to Rezaee" denied Ali's claim, saying that Ahmad's seeking
asylum was a personal issue and had no connection with other
matters.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Repay Foreign Arrears by Year-end </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Sunday that it will
repay 172 million U.S. dollars in foreign arrears by the end of
this year, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a Japanese delegation, Iranian Deputy
Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohammad Jaafar
Mojarrad said that Iran's arrears stood at 11 billion dollars in
1993 while its total foreign debts at 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation arrived here on Saturday to explore
opportunities for investment in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mojarrad said that Iran reduced its foreign debts to 12.9
billion dollars by the end of 1997 and the short-term borrowings
to 23 percent of the total from 76 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A CBI report last month said the country's total external
obligations amounted to 24.5 billion dollars by end of 1997 if
contingent obligations, including opened letters of credit that
are not yet consigned and future interest are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report issued by the Bank of International
Settlements said that Iran's deposits in foreign banks decreased
to 6.676 billion dollars in 1997 due to the fall of the country's
oil income.
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian economic experts and officials, including CBI
Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh, believed that the country's foreign
debts would rise this year as the world oil prices have slumped to
less than 12 dollars a barrel, the lowest in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Mojarrad told the Japanese delegation that the Iranian
government has succeeded in reducing the inflation rate to 17.3
percent in 1997 from 60 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Jordan Sign Oil Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Jordan on Sunday signed an
agreement on bilateral oil cooperation on securing the oil supply
to Jordan for the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid and visiting Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources Mohammed Saleh Hourani.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq promised to meet Jordan's demand for
crude and oil products in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to continue talks on laying of a
750-Kilometer pipeline, with a daily transport capacity of 150,000
barrels, to carry Iraqi oil to Jordan's Zarqa refinery, some 30
kilometers north of capital Amman.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for coordination on exploring for oil
and natural gas in the border regions of the two countries, as
well as research on a number of joint projects to provide service
for the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a protocol last December on Iraq's
supplying Jordan with 4.8 million tonnes of Iraqi crude and oil
products in 1998, at cut-rate prices, about two U.S. dollars below
market level per barrel.
</P>
<P>
This was in addition to Iraq's free offer to Jordan about 300
million dollars worth of crude in 1998 under the instruction of
President Saddam Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's New Law-Makers Discuss Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The newly elected members of
Nigeria's National House of Assembly (parliament) from the five
political parties have met in the capital Abuja to chart a common
position on calls for their dissolution.
</P>
<P>
The polls of parliament was held in April this year with 460
members elected.
</P>
<P>
But with the sudden death of the former head of state, late
General Sani Abacha, there have been growing calls on the new
military leadership headed by General Abdulsalam Abubakar to
dissolve the parties and cancel all elections held under the
flawed transition of program of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Thus the meeting, held Saturday, became necessary to ensure
that the newly-elected parliament members did not allow
themselves to be made the sacrificial lamb or let the public
misconstrue their silence as "passing a vote of no confidence" on
themselves, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Sunday, quoting a
senator-elect.
</P>
<P>
Allowing a cancellation of the April national assembly
election would not only amount to "a coup against democracy, but
a naked injustice against those who have always worked hard to
legitimately earn their victory," said Hajiya Najaatu Mohammed,
who is also one of the conveners of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
She alleged that since the sudden death of Abacha, there had
been "a desperate bid not only to de-emphasize our election in
the context of a search for viable option but also to create a
dangerous impression in the minds of the people that we are part
of the problem and we should be done away with."
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Ibrahim Nantu, another member-elect, regretted that
only the local few were getting the attention of government in
the current discussion on the way forward.
</P>
<P>
About 200 members-elect attended the one-day meeting which
expected to come up with a communique on their position of the
transition program.
</P>
<P>
The April national assembly polls, taking place after the five
parties had adopted Abacha as their sole presidential candidate,
was marked by poor turn-out, thus casting doubts on the results.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Nigerians have called for annulment of all
previous elections under the Abacha regime, including the local
council and state assembly polls.
</P>
<P>
Some have even suggested that the five political parties
should be scrapped for compromising their positions and betraying
the people.
</P>
<P>
Last weeks two international figures, Kofi Annan of the United
Nations and Emeka Anyaoku of the Commonwealth, visited Nigeria on
how to resolve its's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two visitors met with government officials, opposition
leader Moshood Abiola and other interest groups, except
representatives of the five parties.
</P>
<P>
This might be the major cause that triggered off the
convention of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Optimistic About France's Economic Perspective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
Sunday expressed his optimism over the perspective of France's
economic growth and said his Socialist government would maintain
the socio-economic policy it has been carrying out.
</P>
<P>
Jospin signed a budget plan for the government, which restricts
the increase of spending to 1 percent, lower than the inflation
rate, in the following fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said employment and economic growth remain the two major
concerns of his government, while the public budget deficit will
drop from 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year
to 2.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the way of succeeding in our economic policy. Growth
is resuming, jobs are being created, especially for the youths,
and heads of enterprises, because we have relaunched consumption
and are investing," Jospin said in an interview with the Europe 1
television channel.
</P>
<P>
France's GDP is officially expected to grow more than 3 percent
this year, while 400,000 jobs are expected to be created each
month, cutting the unemployment rate to 11.5 percent by the end of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rainstorms Hit Southwestern Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Rainstorms have swept across nine
cities and prefectures in southwest China's Sichuan Province since
July 3, causing flooding in some regions, but no casualties so far.
</P>
<P>
The most severely-hit regions were in the counties of
Shuangliu, Wenjiang and Pixian, which saw an average of 30 cm of
rain that put large amounts of farmland and some urban areas under
water. The provincial capital, Chengdu, has also been hit by
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have called for emergency rescue efforts as
rain continues to fall on the Sichuan Basin.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangsu Province, more than 400,000 people
living along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been put
on full flood alert. Water levels near the provincial capital,
Nanjing, rose to 9.90 meters today, and a record-high peak is
expected to sweep across the province on July 11. The provincial
government has issued an emergency call for flood defense
preparations and has allocated an emergency fund of 3.2 million
yuan (about 400,000 US dollars) for the flood relief work.
</P>
<P>
While flood is sweeping across half of China, a new technique
has been developed in north China's Hebei Province to prevent
floodwaters from breaching dykes by stopping up breached parts of
the dyke using a combination of steel, wood, clay, and stones. It
was already used successfully once before in 1996 to block
floodwaters moving at a rate of 800 cubic meters per second and is
expected to be applied more extensively.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firms Step Up Efforts on Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadian businesses are stepping up
efforts to avoid anticipated computer problems when the calendar
hits January 1, 2000, Statistics Canada said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all Canadian firms reported being aware of the so-called
"millennium bug" and more than two-thirds said they had taken steps to
prepare their systems for it.
</P>
<P>
The May survey results compared favorably with a similar survey
conducted last October, which found less than half of firms had taken
any action, with about one in 10 not even knowing about the issue,
the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The improvements mainly reflect changes among small businesses,
where the overall proportion of firms taking action jumped from 39
percent to 66 percent, and among medium-sized firms, where there was
an increase from 70 percent to 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of large businesses reporting action was virtually
unchanged, from 93 percent last October to 94 percent in May. However,
more of them said they are tackling the problem in a more systematic
manner.
</P>
<P>
One potential problem is that significant amounts of businesses
said they did not expect to achieve Year 2000 readiness until after
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The expected time frames for these firms may be too late as
preparing and testing can take longer than planned in the best of
circumstances," the agency warned.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Upbeat About Re-election Despite Unfavorable Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- With an eye on the improving economy,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday expressed confidence about
winning re-election in the September national vote despite the
current poor showings of his ruling party in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his last news conference before traveling to a
Austrian spa to spend his traditional summer vacations, Kohl
repeated his government projections that the German economy would
grow at a rate of close to 3 percent this year while unemployment
would fall below 4 million this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The structural reforms introduced by the government had
contributed to the current economic upswing, Kohl stressed.
</P>
<P>
With reference to opinion polls which show Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) party trailing almost 10 percentage points
behind the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), Kohl
admitted that the SPD had done more to mobilize voters than his
CDU party.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that with only 11 months before the September
elections, about three quarters of German voters had not yet made
up their minds, therefore there was still great potential to be
fully tapped by the CDU.
</P>
<P>
"We have not actually started our election campaigns," Kohl
said.
</P>
<P>
The September 27 German general elections put Kohl against his
much younger SPD challenger Gerhard Schroeder, who is the premier
of the western German Lower Saxony state.
</P>
<P>
Kohl stressed that the upcoming elections campaign would see a
serious comparison of the actual policies pursued by the CDU and
the SPD, not rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"We can seize our chances, and we will win the election," Kohl
said.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills One at Phnom Penh Downtown Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 6 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
and several wounded Monday about 8:10 pm local time when a
powerful bomb exploded at Hun Sen Park near the Independence
Monument in Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Police said a 19-year-old girl died and eight others who were
injured in the blast were taken to hospital. One of them was
believed to be in a serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion was not immediately known and it is
not clear if it had any relationship to the general elections
scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
No one had claimed responsibility for the explosion. Further
investigations are under way.
</P>
<P>
The blast came exactly a year after last July's bloody
factional fighting. On July 5 and 6 last year, a political power
struggle between Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and now deposed
first prime minister Ranariddh turned into violence, with dozens
of people injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
Also on March 30 last year, four grenades exploded at a
demonstration led by opposition leader Sam Rainsy and more than one
hundred people were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Three opposition political parties, the Sam Rainsy Party,
Funcinpec and Son Sann held memorial services and marches on
Sunday and Monday in Phnom Penh to commemorate the victims.

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Urges U.S. Blocking of Bank Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Flavio Cotti has
appealed to the government of the United States to block possible
sanctions against Swiss banks for their role in handling Holocaust
victims' accounts during World War II.
</P>
<P>
In an interview given to the Swiss weekly SonntagsBlick Sunday,
Cotti said that Switzerland wanted a clear sign that Washington
would move to stop the boycotts threatened by some U.S. states and
cities against Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss expect a response from the U.S. government to
demonstrate it "is aware of its international responsibilities and
will block steps like boycotts," Cotti said.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, New York state and city decided to phase in
sanctions starting in September against two big Swiss banks unless
progress is made. California has said it will use similar
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Cotti said that his government took the latest threats "very
seriously" and would not bow to these "attempts at coercion."
</P>
<P>
Cotti said that the Swiss government would make a decision
shortly on whether to file a complaint in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) against the U.S. states and cities involved.
</P>
<P>
In June, Swiss banks offered to settle class action suits by
Holocaust victims in the United States for 600 million U.S.
dollars, less than half of what Jewish groups have demanded.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's New Airport Runs Smoothly on 1st Day (1) (By Wang Qun and Chang Kefei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The new Hong Kong International
Airport at Chek Lap Kok was running smoothly on its first day of
full operation.
</P>
<P>
The airport greeted its first commercial flight, a Cathay
Pacific's Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet from New York, at 6:20 a.m.
Monday, 10 minutes ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Almost one hour later at 7:18 a.m., another Cathay Pacific's
airliner, Airbus A330, took off from Chek Lap Kok for Manila to
become the first flight departing from the new airport.
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible, it's a fantastic project," said Andrew
Little, a young Briton who felt so lucky to be the first passenger
touching down at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Little and his wife, Rhina, were warmly greeted by Hong Kong's
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang and Chairman of the Airport Authority (AA) Wong Po-yan at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
The couple received No. 1 and No. 2 of the certificates issued
by the AA to the passengers using the airport on its first day of
commercial operation, and a commemorative book as a lasting
reminder of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
The historic flights and many hundreds of others had all gone
smoothly, Clinton Leeks, Corporate Development Director of the
Airport Authority (AA), told a press briefing on Monday noon.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tourists from the mainland also arrived at the new
airport on its first operational day. China Travel Service and
China International Travel Service, two leading travel agencies in
China, organized large-scale package tours from Beijing, as well
as other Chinese cities, to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Monday, the quota for mainland visitors who can
take part in "Hong Kong Tour" would be increased by 30 percent to
some 1,500 per day.
</P>
<P>
For the Hong Kong people, it was a day to remember, and in a
special form. Peter Kelly, a Cathay Pacific duty manager, arrived
from Taipei early Monday with his two daughters. He chose to take
off from the old Kai Tak Sunday, its final day of operation, and
flew back to land at Chek Lap Kok new airport to mark a
significant chapter in Hong Kong's aviation history.
</P>
<P>
"It's very nice. It's a lot better here," said Kelly. As he had
lived in Hong Kong for 13 years, he still cherished a nostalgic
feeling for old Kai Tak which he said "had a character."
</P>
<P>
He said that his first impression of the new terminal building
was "spacious." The passenger terminal, with a floor area of
550,000 square meters eventually, is nine times as large as that
of Kai Tak.

<HEADLINE> Lucky Boy From Poor Chinese Village Chosen for International Internet Summit (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHENG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Liu Tongxuan, a 13-year-old
student from a poor mountainous village 300 kilometers southwest
of Beijing, is elated at having recently been selected to
participate in the '98 Online Junior Forum organized by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who helps his grandmother feed the family's pigs everyday
after school, said, "Through computer, I'm looking forward to
asking foreign friends how they cultivate the soil and raise pigs
on their farms."
</P>
<P>
The young student, who lives in a village in Mancheng County at
the foot of the Taihang Mountains in north China's Hebei Province,
will join 1,000 primary and middle school students from around the
world in Internet online discussions beginning on August 1.
</P>
<P>
A total of 127 Chinese students from Beijing, Shanghai and
Mancheng will join in the forum designed by Nicholas Negro Ponte,
author of the work entitled "Being Digital," and hosted by the
Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
</P>
<P>
Liu is a student at the Xinzhang Middle School which has no
computer.
</P>
<P>
"I have only seen computers on television and can only imagine
that they are as large as the Universe and can hold everything,"
wrote Liu in a composition which won him the right to join the
forum.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what teachers mean when they refer to things
like 'WORD' and 'DOS'. Nonetheless, I really enjoy watching
programs about computers." said Liu.
</P>
<P>
"It will be wonderful to talk with foreign friends
participating in the forum. I don't know what Internet is all
about, but I certainly want to learn," he added.

Zheng Yang, 13, and two of her rural female classmates will
also participate in the forum.
</P>
<P>
Zheng has also watched TV computer programs and won the right
to participate in the forum by drawing a computer screen showing
Beijing's Tian'anmen Square, the White House in Washington
D.C. and London's Big Ben.
</P>
<P>
While computers are rapidly entering the homes of ordinary
Chinese families in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai, most
schools in the countryside have not as yet entered the age of
computers and teachers have little knowledge of the subject.
</P>
<P>
"American children are quite familiar with computers, while
Beijing's children are currently learning computers and young
students in Mancheng can simply sketch some on paper," according
to Cheng Donghong from the China Association of Science and
Technology (CAST) and also the forum's Chinese organizer.
</P>
<P>
"We want to offer Chinese children in the countryside a window
to become acquainted with the world of computers and inspire their
imagination through digital technology and offer revolutionary
changes to their schooling and life." said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Cheng noted that organizers at MIT will provide computers for
the four rural children and CAST will offer related computer
training. The telephones in their homes and the schools will be
linked to the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Visits Flood Relief Workers in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji visited the
flood relief sites along the Yangtze River in east China's Jiangxi
Province on Saturday and Sunday to thank the people involved in
the struggles and to give instructions on the flood relief work.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went to the city of Jiujiang on July 4, accompanied by
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, who is the head of the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, and Jiangxi Province
officials.
</P>
<P>
Rainstorms have swept most parts of Jiangxi Province since mid
June, causing severe floodings and sharp water level rises in the
province's rivers and lakes. Many dykes were breached, with a
large number of houses collapsed, farmland flooded, and huge
losses of lives and property. More than three million people in
the province were mobilized to the anti-flooding sites.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji visited two villages in the city's De'an County,
which has suffered heavy damages from the flooding. Zhu spoke with
flood victims and asked about their living arrangements, and told
leaders at all levels that they should look after the victims well
and provide them with basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
He examined a section of the Yangtze River dike in Jiujiang and
the urban flood protection from a patrol boat and said that the
Yangtze River embankment needs to be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the provincial government to be prepared for even
more flooding and said that priority needs to be given to
protecting people's lives and property.

<HEADLINE> Addis Taxi Owners Complain Over New Traffic Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Taxi Owners Associations
in Addis Ababa have complained over the soon-to-be effected
traffic regulation.
</P>
<P>
Segen and Nib Taxi Owners Associations said in their
statements that it was prematurely issued and not in
consideration of the living standard of the service caterers.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa Administration announced last Friday a new
road safety regulation which will be implemented as of July 8,
1998, the first day of Ethiopia's 1998/99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulation, a traffic controller, "any member of
the police force in uniforms", would right away impose penalties
on offenders, who would then make payments to the city's
transport and communications bureau, rather than waiting for
court decisions as was the case in the past.
</P>
<P>
The regulation puts penalties ranging from 40 to 140 Birr (5.7
to 20 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two associations said that the new regulation will give
way to even worse form of bribery instead of curbing the
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of the new regulation is premature before the
conditions of roads in the city are improved, they complained.
The roads in Addis Ababa are unable to accommodate the ever
increasing vehicles and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official Ethiopian News Agency Monday quoted
Abebe Zeleul, head of Transport and Communications Bureau of
Addis Ababa Administration, as saying that about 500 drivers in
the capital city trespass traffic rules and regulations daily and
700 car accidents are registered on average each month.
</P>
<P>
Abebe said that some 531 persons lost their lives in car
accidents over the past two years in the city, while 2,514 others
sustained injuries and property worth over 20 million Birr (2.8
million U.S. Dollars) were damaged.
</P>
<P>
He thus believed that there is no other alternative other than
effecting the new regulation to contain traffic irregularities in
the capital.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- A year ago, Thailand's currency melted down, igniting an
economic crisis in Asia that led to three huge international
bailouts, the forced resignation of Asia's longest-serving leader
and a banking crisis in Japan. The crisis, which at first rang few
alarm bells in the United States, now stands as the largest single
threat to the economic boom Americans have been enjoying for the
last six years. Officials say the impact could be greater than
they had expected even a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
-- America's biggest health maintenance organizations are
quitting managed care programs for the poor and
elderly. Organizations like Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Pacificare,
Oxford Health Plans, Kaiser Permanents and Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Associations have shut down Medicare services in at least
12 states.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The 1994 agreement between the United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is under severe
strain because the administration has not found the money to
carry it out.
</P>
<P>
-- Protestants and Catholics faced off in an angry
confrontation across a village cow pasture in Northern Ireland
Sunday night, with an army of policemen and soldiers in between to
maintain a tense stalemate, as old hostilities tested the new era
of peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. special envoy on Kosovo Richard Holbrooke ended three
days of diplomacy in Belgrade and Pristina, capital of Kosovo, as
he tried to start peace talks. He said a change in the province's
status within the Yugoslavian federation was needed. Serb forces took
the strategic village of Kijevo Friday.

</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, became

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A former Russian wrestling champion
was shot to death Sunday in North Ossetia in an apparent contract
killing.
</P>
<P>
Sokrat Kasoyev, long Russia's judo and sambo champion and
winner of many international competitions, was shot at close range
by unidentified gunmen, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Monday,
quoting an official with the Russian republic's interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
Kasoyev, once a member of the Soviet and Russian national sambo
teams, was attacked at a gas station inside his Mercedes car.
</P>
<P>
Tass said his son, Stanislav, was also in the car. It did not
say whether Stanislav was hurt, but one worker of the gas station
was killed and two others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have launched an investigation into the
killing, but Interior Ministry officials believe that the murder
was prompted by Krasoyev's business activities.
</P>
<P>
After retiring from sports, Krasoyev became director of an
Orion company, which supplies fuel and lubricants, and had
repeated told friends that he was blackmailed by racketeers, Tass

<HEADLINE> Russia, Kazakhstan Sign Accords on Caspian and Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia and
Kazakhstan agreed here Monday on the division of the northern
Caspian seabed and the settlement of financial issues.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Kazakh counterpart
Nursultan Nazarbayev also signed a declaration on "eternal
friendship" and an alliance for the 21st century, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev arrived Sunday night on a three-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
The documents were originally to be signed during Yeltsin's
planned visit to Kazakhstan last week, but he postponed the trip
to persuade lawmakers to approve the government's economic
stabilization plan and major laws crucial for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Tass gave no detail on the accord on financial issues, but
Yeltsin said: "Russia has debts to Kazakhstan and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to assess their sums in such a way as to make
it clear to everybody who remains in the red."
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we shall agree to wipe out all debts," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two countries have been instructed to
accurately calculate the debts before Yeltsin's visit to
Kazakhstan in September, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement on the Caspian Sea, the two countries will
divide the seabed along the median line, "with the maintenance of
the common use of water surface, including the guarantee of
freedom of navigation, coordinated fishery rules, and
environmental protection".

<HEADLINE> Prices of Essential Commodities Up in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- As the economic fallout of
India's nuclear tests in May gathers momentum, a steep rise in the
prices of essential commodities has put most things out of reach
for the lower and middle classes in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks, prices of vegetables, fruits,
pulses, tea and vegetable oils, to list a few, have more than
doubled, forcing most households to apply austerity measures to
cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
The steep price rise has made parliament members cutting across
party lines Monday in Lok Sabha, the lower house, to express their
serious concern over the situation and ask the government to take
immediate steps to arrest the spiraling inflation.
</P>
<P>
Suryakanta Patil from the Congress and Geeta Mukherjee from the
Communist Party of India said that external aid had come to a halt
after the nuclear tests and the country was now facing a serious
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the local markets, price of tomatoes has increased to 40 to
46 rupees a kilogram from 15 rupees just a month earlier, onions
are now selling for 14-18 rupees a kilogram, potatoes 14-16
rupees, lemons 60-70 rupees and beans 36-42 rupees a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
As a result of economic sanctions imposed by many countries and
international organizations following the nuclear tests, the
Indian currency depreciated by some 10 percent in less than two
months and the exchange rate of rupee against the greenback is
fluctuating between 42 to 43 for one dollar.
</P>
<P>
A researcher in social sciences said, "most vegetables, even
when they are not expensive as they are at the moment, are well
beyond the reach of substantial sections of the Indian
population."
</P>
<P>
An angry housewife said, "the BJP (the Bharatiya Janata Party)
government is more busy trying to save itself rather than applying
itself in trying to control such inflation."
</P>
<P>
"When the government is weak, the country faces an inflationary
trend. Today, the prices of tomatoes and onions have gone beyond
the reach of middle-class family," she added.
</P>
<P>
However, BJP leaders and government officials said repeatedly
that the international sanctions would not affect the Indian
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada on Monday
ordered Police Director General Roberto Lastimoso to unmask the
more than 2,000 policemen and soldiers who are allegedly involved
in various crimes.
</P>
<P>
The President gave Lastimoso 72 hours to probe deeper into the
cases of these scalawags in uniform, saying "I am in a hurry " to
crack these "bad eggs" in the force.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Presidential Task Force on
Intelligence and Counter-intelligence, 2,423 policemen and
soldiers have been linked to various criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada, who is also the concurrent secretary of the
Department of Interior and Local Governments, announced that the
police have crippled a notorious kidnap-for-ransom syndicate which
recently murdered two victims, including a retired military
officer.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the syndicate and its seven members were arrested
last week by the National Police.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has vowed to hunt criminals to extinction even as he
ordered the police over the weekend to reel in a "big fish" among
the country's criminals within his first 100 days in office.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of peace and order in the country is one of the
several priorities listed by the Estrada administration which
assumed office on June 30.

<HEADLINE> Libya's Role in Somali Politics Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 6 (Xinhua) --Some politicians and subclan
leaders Monday criticized Libya for its role in the current
Somali political affairs.
</P>
<P>
The criticism came after many of Mogadishu's faction leaders
unexpectedly left for Libya Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, Ali Margus, the Leader of the
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) accused Libya for further
facilitating the bloodsheding in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Margus vowed to continue fighting Hussein Aidid's men as long
as they maintain the control of Bay and Bakol regions which late
General Aidid captured in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Politicians in North Mogadishu opposing Ali Mahdi Mohamed also
said Ali Mahdi should not have gone to Libya at this particular
moment since the differences between the north Mogadishu leaders
are not settled.
</P>
<P>
These politicians believed that Libya will at least offer a
huge amount of money to the faction leaders to encourage the
peace process they lead, thus further hurting the opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting among the factions in some parts of the
Lower Shabelle Region, the "grain basket" of the country, has been
considered to further deteriorate the already weak crop
production this season after rats and floods devastated the
expected yields.
</P>
<P>
This season's crop harvest may be less than half of last year,
hitting a five-year low, the U.N. organization said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that clannish fighting, which began early
Friday at three villages in Lower Shabelle region between Biyomal
and Tunni clans, killed at least four people and wounded several
others.
</P>
<P>
The fighting still continues on Monday at the villages of
Fitadhere, Werarmaleh and Maryan Gubay.
</P>
<P>
According to the former chairman of Maryan Gubay village,
Hajji Harakow, the fighting had begun over misunderstanding of
the ownership of farmlands in the region.
</P>
<P>
Early in May, two people were killed and eight others wounded
when the two sides clashed for the same cause.

BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng, in a meeting with the British
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, said he hopes the European
Union (EU) will soon end its restrictions towards Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
Shi listed various restrictions Chinese goods have suffered in
Europe such as anti-dumping towards Chinese products and
forbidding China to export products like frozen chicken and
seafood to these countries. "These shouldn't be the case," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister said China is ready to open its markets
step by step, but that the EU should first open its market to
Chinese goods and drop the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the UK, as a major force in the EU, will make
a positive effort in that direction.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China will keep the renminbi stable and is
confident about having 8 percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Prescott, who attended the first anniversary celebrations of
Hong Kong's Return to China, said that the "one country, two
systems" has been "very successful" and that this means that a
stable China can contribute to the economic stability of Hong Kong.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The opening of the new Hong Kong
International Airport will serve to stimulate the local economy,
Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang has said, according to
a local newspaper here today.
</P>
<P>
The new airport at Chek Lap Kok will help "consolidate Hong
Kong's position as an international aviation center of the
region," Tsang was quoted by the Chinese language paper Wen Wei Po
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong needs a new and modern international airport, "the
sooner the better," Tsang said in an interview with a local TV
station.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the hub of the international aviation industry and
the new airport can surely be of great help to Hong Kong and the
whole region in the future.
</P>
<P>
With more up-to-date facilities and equipment than other
airports, the new Hong Kong International Airport will be the
world's most modernized one for a long time, Tsang said.

<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's Ariel Ortega, who has been

serve the ban at the Copa America competition in 1999.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said on Monday that Ortega, who had
been given a red card at the World Cup quarterfinal against the
Netherlands, could miss the first three games in the tournament to be
held in Paraguay.

German defender Christian Woerns, who had been sent off in
Germany's 3-0 quarterfinal loss to Croatia, will serve his two-game
ban in the 2000 European championship.
</P>
<P>
But Cooper said another German player Michael Tarnat, who had

<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine Football Federation

</P>
<P>
Nestor Pekerman is tipped as the man most likely to replace
Daniel Passerella and former superstar Diego Maradona also expressed
that it was his dream to lead the Argentine national team.
</P>
<P>
But Argentine federation president Julio Grondona said he would
not rush to judgement on picking Passerella's successor.
</P>
<P>
"We have until January 1 to choose a new coach," Grondona said.
</P>
<P>
Pekerman has been hugely successful with Argentina's junior
teams over the past four years. He coached Argentina to the World

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport to Promote Economy: Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- "The opening of the new Hong Kong
International Airport marks a new era for Hong Kong's aviation
industry," said the Hong Kong Commercial Daily Monday in an
editorially.
</P>
<P>
"The first-class relocation operations of the international
airport from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok demonstrated in front of the
Hong Kong residents greatly boosted their confidence and the new
airport is expected to bring about new vitality and wealth," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
"It's better for us to look more into the difficult aspects of
the situation and take precautions and make necessary plans for
the future," the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the economic turmoil, the new airport might fail to
bring its role and effect to full play in a fairly long period of
time. The authorities should try to find other means to promote
business in aviation and start the redevelopment projects at the
site of Kai Tak so as to create more chances for Hong Kong's
economy," it said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong badly needs a new airport to boost the local tourist
industry, the paper said in an article.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak Airport's location in a densely-populated urban area
had crushed the chance for the 73-year-old airport to increase
flights. But the round-the-clock and all-weather service of the
new airport at Chek Lap Kok offers a bright prospect for doubling
flight numbers in the future, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The new airport could also greatly increase Hong Kong's links
with China's inland areas, which has been proved all the more
important, especially amid the Asian financial crisis, it added.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is expected to bring a prosperous start to the
local taxi service, the local newspaper Tin Tin Daily News
predicted in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour service of the new airport is expected to increase
the night taxi business by about 20 percent. "It's a nice boost
for the bleak taxi business in Hong Kong," a taxi driver was
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Air travelers with family members could be the main customers
for the airport-oriented taxi service, the newspaper said.

PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian team captain Dunga has
warned his teammate to keep it simple in the semi-final match

</P>
<P>
Dunga told Roberto Carlos never to try a bicycle clearance in

"As far as I'm concerned you have always try to be the best in
everything. Sometimes it's best to keep it simple." Dunga said.

Dunga predicted that the game against the Netherlands would be
open:"We have got to play our own game on Tuesday. It should be a
very open game but the team that keeps its shape and presses forward
will win."
</P>
<P>
Brazil will play the match without right-back Cafu due to
bookings. But Dunga said he was fully confident in Ze Carlos who will
take Cafu's place:"Ze Carlos is a hard worker who might not be as
talented as Cafu but will make up for that with his enthusiasm."

<HEADLINE> Adversity Prompts Cairo Summit: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The "extremely adverse" developments
in the Mideast peace process were the main reason for the
Egyptian, Jordanian and Palestinian leaders to hold a summit in
Cairo Sunday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that "the problems in the over-15-month
stalled Mideast peace process" has largely led to the three-way
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added that Sunday's summit focused in particular on the
Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday joined in a call here for
unremitting efforts to put the derailed peace process back on
track.
</P>
<P>
They warned of a "very dangerous" situation in the region due
to the breakdown in the peace march caused by Israel's
intransigent policy.
</P>
<P>
"The recent extremely adverse developments and happenings in
the occupied Palestinian territories warranted inter-Arab
consultation: something that has already been held on a wide
scale," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, consultations among the Arab states are
expected to continue to overcome the deadlock in the peace talks,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries will diligently pursue the flagging peace march
to prevent the situation in which "debates and arguments drag on
without reaching conclusive results," he added.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of China is inviting applications
from community organizations for sponsorship under the Basic Law
Promotion Funding Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, operated by the Hong Affairs Bureau (HAB) under the
auspices of the Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee, aims to
encourage and enable organizations to initiate activities that
would enhance public understanding of the Basic Law, an HAB
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the importance of the Basic Law, the spokesman said,
the Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee was set up to map out
strategies for promoting the Basic Law, and coordinate the efforts
of government departments and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Tasked with the promotion of the Basic Law in the local
community, the HAB has introduced the new scheme to encourage
community organizations to organize a wide variety of activities
for their target groups, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that one of the effective ways to make people
understand the Basic Law and its relevance to their daily life is
through community involvement," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Military Advised to Delay Handover Next Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The month-old military government in
Nigeria led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar has received new
year to that of next year, the Post Express reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A nine-page recommendation anchored by a committee of two
social sciences professors also advised the government to
dissolve all the transition agencies, including the political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Their continued existence would negate the enthroning and
sustenance of genuine democratic polity, it claimed.
</P>
<P>
The committee, inaugurated shortly after Abubakar took over
power on June 9, also suggested the thawing of the country's
previous bellicose stance against the international community and
the promotion of human rights and respect for independence of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the government may have accepted
all the recommendation of the committee with the invitation and
warm reception accorded Kofi Annan, United Nations
secretary-general, and his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku
last week.
</P>
<P>
The government also hosted a delegation from the European
Union led by British Deputy Foreign Minister Tony Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Unitd States delegation to be led by Under
Secretary of State Thomas Pickering is slated to visit the
country this week.
</P>
<P>
All these moves, particularly coming on the heels of the
release of nearly 30 detainees, are expected to end the country's
political and economic isolation, and build new relations with
pro-democracy groups within and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
What is widely believed as a major score of the Abubakar
government is the reported renouncement by detained politician
Moshood Abiola of his presidential mandate.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was said to be the winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential polls. He was detained by the government of late
General Sani Abacha for declaring himself president of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The release of the businessman-politician has since become a
testimony that the government is determined to embrace democracy.
</P>
<P>
Since Abubakar assumed power after Abacha's death on June 8,
pro-democracy groups have been demanding Abiola be release to
lead a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
But the Abubakar government may not want Abiola to become
president in that way although it is expected to free the
detained multi-millionaire before long.
</P>
<P>
However, in the country's new political dispensation, many
people believe#,every shade of the political spectrum is expected
to be allowed to unhindered participation, if a true national
reconciliation is pursued.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Leaves for Visit to Israel, Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
left here Monday for a four-day visit to Israel and Palestine in a
bid to play Turkey's role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cem's talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials will also
cover bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister will travel to Gaza and later to the West
Bank town of Ramallah for talks with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and other senior
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said that further development of Turkey's ties with
Israel depends on Tel Aviv's respect towards the legal rights of
the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Cem's current visit is expected to cement Turkey's ties with
the Jewish state and make preparations for Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz's trip to Tel Aviv in September.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been involved in a number of joint defense
activities with Israel. The cooperation began with the signing of
a military training and cooperation agreement in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allowed the reciprocal training of Turkish and
Israeli military personnel and aircraft in joint exercises.
</P>
<P>
However, the defense cooperation between Turkey and Israel
angered neighboring Iran and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Apart from their defense cooperation, Turkey and Israel have
also signed a trade agreement to reciprocally lift customs
taxes.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Stock Market Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's stock market recorded a
historical level of trading last week, with shares worth of 1.165
billion Naira (about 14 million U.S. Dollars) changing hands.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)
to record a turnover of one-billion-Naira mark in just a week
since it was established over 36 years ago, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 124.9 million shares were traded in 2,109 deals
last week, representing a 257 percent rise in terms of volume and
a 477 percent increase in terms of value against the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
The historical record came due to the active trading of the
shares of the First Bank of Nigeria, one of the leading banks in
the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The bank attracted a total investment of 1.019 billion Naira
(about 12 million U.S. Dollars) in 228 deals involving more than
105 million shares. The volume accounted for 84 percent of the
total trade in the week.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts were quoted as saying that the high volume
recorded by the bank might have been a result of the 100 Kobo
(0.01 U.S. Dollars) dividend announced recently. But others said
that certain shareholders may have started to consolidate their
holding in the bank.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, about 13 percent of the total paid-up
shares of the bank changed hands at the market last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Monday that it is indispensable for regional
cooperation to flourish that an environment of peace and harmony
exists.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made these remarks while meeting with visiting Sri
Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar who arrived here
Sunday as a special envoy of Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, according to a press release issued by the Foreign
Office Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy handed over a letter of invitation from the
Sri Lankan President to Sharif for the tenth summit of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to be held in
Colombo from July 29 to 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the invitation, Sharif said that he was looking
forward to participating in the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, Sharif said, was taking place at a time of
momentous developments in the region. The nuclearization of South
Asia had heightened tensions and there was wide-spread and serious
concern among countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
It was important for the SAARC to address itself to these
realities and to adopt measures which would effectively meet these
concerns, Sharif stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he assured the special envoy of Pakistan's
cooperation in making the Colombo summit a success.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the visiting special envoy called on Pakistani
President Rafiq Tarar and extended to him an invitation from
Chandrika Kumaratunga to undertake an official visit to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Rafiq Tarar conveyed to the envoy Pakistan's commitment to
further strengthening relations with Sri Lanka on bilateral plane
as well as in the context of the SAARC.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister on Monday also met his
Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan who on the occasion stressed
Pakistan's commitment to the principles and purposes of the SAARC.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign Ministers reviewed and expressed satisfaction
with the state of bilateral relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Gohar provided his Sri Lankan counterpart with a comprehensive
briefing on developments following India's nuclear tests on May 11
and 13.
</P>
<P>
He explained the rationale for Pakistan's exercise of the
nuclear option and reiterated Pakistan's desire to settle all its
outstanding issues with India through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, Gohar said, must be meaningful and
result-oriented and should in a substantive and specific manner
address the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.

<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Dutch skipper Frank de Boer said
defence would be the key factor in the semi-final match between the
Netherlands and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"It's true Brazil have four players on three goals each, which
always gives defences a problem when you're not quite sure where the
goals might come from." said Frank de Boer.
</P>
<P>
"But we have only conceded four goals in five games ourselves
and we feel we've got ourselves together," said de Boer, "We
certainly will not fall asleep again as we did against Mexico."
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team squandered a 2-0 lead and were forced to a 2-2 draw
in a group match against Mexico earlier in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Studies Effects of El Nino to Help Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is studying the effects of
El Nino in order to develop a model to help farmers understand the
global weather pattern when the ocean current in the Pacific coast
off Peru warms up or cools down, a press report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization
(SPARRSO) is monitoring the El Nino phenomenon, which is
responsible for rains or drought world-wide, to help the country's
farmers cope with its effects, SPARRSO director Dr. A.M. Chowdhury
told a recent function at the Bangladesh Institute of Strategic
Studies.
</P>
<P>
Farmers needed help to chart their crop calendar to keep
themselves updated with the changing mood of nature to better cope
with it, and vary the sowing and planting periods, he said, adding
that the model would be prepared by the SPARRSO and the Bangladesh
Agriculture Research Council.
</P>
<P>
"It has become imperative in the backdrop of past performance
of El Nino," the weather expert said.
</P>
<P>
Since El Nino went 'retreating' in May, it has begun casting
its eye on Bangladesh for the past few days, bringing much needed
rains, he noted, adding that the reverse was likely to trigger
rainfall and flooding.
</P>
<P>
On the past effects of El Nino, he said that after it occurred
in 1972-73, El Nino reversed to trigger floods in 1974, in 1982-83
it reversed into a spate of flooding, and again in 1986, El Nino
led to the worst flooding when it reversed in 1987 and 1988
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon had been responsible for only 40 percent
rainfall in the country in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not only we had 60 percent less rainfall in June, but it also
delayed the arrival of Monsoon by a month," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Raps French Organizers of World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commissioner in charge
of competition, Karel Van Miert, has rapped the French organizers
of the World Cup soccer tournament for its distribution of tickets.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily La Tribune published on
Monday, Van Miert warned against the abuse of power in
professional sports and reminded European sports professionals
that they should abide by the laws of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that the European Commission is "on the point of
communicating officially its grievances" to the French Committee
of Organization (CFO) over tickets distribution.
</P>
<P>
"If we are obliged to take into account of specificity, sports
should not be above the laws. There is such money circulating in
the professional sports that an abuse of dominant position or a
monopoly is clearly in infraction of the EU laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in professional sports, organizers who follow the
rules based on national or regional interests conflict with the EU
principle of non-discriminatory and free circulation of people,
properties and services.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the notion that the rights for TV
transmission belong to the sports leagues or federations is
becoming more and more contestable.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian referees have officiated the most
World Cup finals games, FIFA said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen games so far have been refereed by Italians, 14 by
Englishmen, 12 by Brazilians, Frenchmen and Germans respectively, said
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper.
</P>
<P>
The Italians also lead on the aggregate number of referees selected
for the World Cup finals at 37.
</P>
<P>
Overall there have been 34 Englishmen, 34 Frenchmen, 28 Swiss, 25
Brazilians and 22 Germans selected.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen referees have refereed in three World Cup finals, Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
French referee Joel Quiniou still holds the record of officiating
eight games in the finals.
</P>
<P>
There would be no referee who could break the record at the finals
in France, FIFA said.
</P>
<P>
But Quiniou's record of sending off five players has been broken by
Mexican Arturo Brizio Carter here.
</P>
<P>
Carter has given marching orders to seven players in six games.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Military Advised to Delay Hand-over Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The month-old military government in
Nigeria led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar has received new
recommendation to extend the hand-over date from October 1 this
year to that of next year, the Post Express reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A nine-page recommendation anchored by a committee of two
social sciences professors also advised the government to
dissolve all the transition agencies, including the political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Their continued existence would negate the enthroning and
sustenance of genuine democratic polity, it claimed.
</P>
<P>
The committee, inaugurated shortly after Abubakar took over
power on June 9, also suggested the thawing of the country's
previous bellicose stance against the international community and
the promotion of human rights and respect for independence of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the government may have accepted
all the recommendation of the committee with the invitation and
warm reception accorded Kofi Annan, United Nations
secretary-general, and his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku
last week.
</P>
<P>
The government also hosted a delegation from the European
Union led by British Deputy Foreign Minister Tony Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Unitedu States delegation to be led by Under
Secretary of State Thomas Pickering is slated to visit the
country this week.
</P>
<P>
All these moves, particularly coming on the heels of the
release of nearly 30 detainees, are expected to end the country's
political and economic isolation, and build new relations with
pro-democracy groups within and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
What is widely believed as a major score of the Abubakar
government is the reported renouncement by detained politician
Moshood Abiola of his presidential mandate.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was said to be the winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential polls. He was detained by the government of late
General Sani Abacha for declaring himself president of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The release of the businessman-politician has since become a
testimony that the government is determined to embrace democracy.
</P>
<P>
Since Abubakar assumed power after Abacha's death on June 8,
pro-democracy groups have been demanding Abiola be release to
lead a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
But the Abubakar government may not want Abiola to become
president in that way although it is expected to free the
detained multi-millionaire before long.
</P>
<P>
However, in the country's new political dispensation, many
people believe, every shade of the political spectrum is expected
to be allowed to unhindered participation, if a true national
reconciliation is pursued.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Protests at Moscow's Expulsion of Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 6 (Xinhua ) -- The South Korean Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Monday called in Valery E. Suhinin, a
minister-counsellor of the Russian Embassy in Seoul to protest over
Moscow's expulsion of a South Korean diplomat last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Sun Joun-yung told
Suhinin that Moscow's actions last Friday violated the
international convention on diplomatic activities.
</P>
<P>
"Russia violates the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as
it detained a Korean diplomat registered in the Moscow government,"
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry declared Cho Sung-woo, a
councilor at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow, "persona non
grata'' and ordered him to leave Russian within 72 hours after
detaining and questioning him for hours on espionage charge last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cho was accused of having engaged in espionage activity by the
Russian Federal Security Service as a Russian Foreign Ministry
official named Valentin Moiseyev was arrested when he was providing
"confidential information" to Cho.
</P>
<P>
Sun also expressed "deep regret" that Russia revealed the
expulsion to the media before it consulted with Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which failed to call in Ambassador Evgeny
V. Afanasiev of Russia as he is on a summer vacation, said South
Korea will take action after questioning Cho, who is to arrive in
Seoul late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Moscow had enjoyed good relations since they
established diplomatic ties in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief Vows to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief of General Staff
Ismai Hakki Karadayi has reaffirmed that it is the right and duty
of the Turkish Armed Forces to crack down on religious
radicalism.
</P>
<P>
The written statement of the top general, dated Sunday and
available Monday, came only one day after Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said that it is primarily the task of the government to
deal with such issues.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi made it clear that it is not the duty of the
government alone to combat fundamentalism, but the army is
responsible for it as well.
</P>
<P>
"It is an obligation imposed on us by the law to protect with
the same sensitivity the existing constitutional system, to which
we feel absolutely attached," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We consider this obligation of ours to be in parallel to the
activities in the same direction of the governments of the
Republic," it added.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that Karadayi's statement aimed at
showing the secular military's determination to continue taking
tough measures against those fundamental groups and their
spokesmen in the political circles as well.
</P>
<P>
Last week, General Cevik Bir, deputy chief of general staff,
said that the Virtue Party, which was founded on the basis of the
former Welfare Party closed early this year for its strong Islamic
color, would win in the general elections scheduled for next April.
</P>
<P>
These remarks invoked response from Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit who said they might prompt unnecessary worries among
the secular political groups. He also called on the powerful
generals to stay away from party politics.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military, which dubs itself as "a firm and legal
defender of the country's secular system," has repeatedly stated
that fundamentalism constitutes a direct threat to Turkey's state
security.
</P>
<P>
The powerful generals forced the former pro-Islamic Necmettin
Erbakan coalition government to step down last Summer. The action
was acclaimed by domestic secularists but suffered criticism from
some Western countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Seeks Peace, Harmony in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has urged African leaders to work
relentlessly in a bid to achieve peace and harmony within the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The leaders should seek more mature, humane and diplomatic
means of settling disputes as "Africa is tired of wars," the
Nigerian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, the country's chief of defense staff until he was
appointed head of state nearly a month ago, made the remarks at a
meeting Sunday with Cavaye Djibril, special envoy of Camerounian
President Paul Biya.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy, who is also President of the National
Assembly or parliament of Cameroun, was in Nigeria to deliver a
condolence message over the death of Nigeria's former head of
state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Despite territorial dispute between the two countries,
Abubakar said that Nigeria will continue to live at peace with
its neighboring states in the true spirit of African solidarity
and brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
He described Cameroun as a very important neighbor sharing a
1,600-km-long border populated by about 30 million Nigerians and
Camerounians living in peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have clashed sporadically since 1994 over
the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea.
Helicopters, patrol boats and rockets were involved in the past
clashes.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Bakassi, an impoverished chain of islands and
swamp inhabited by Efik-speaking fishermen from Nigeria, is
currently before the International Court of Justice at the Hague
in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Fighting in Bissau Invites ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Renewed fighting in the capital of
Guinea Bissau following a sub-regional call for an immediate end
to hostilities may increase the possibility of a military
intervention from other west African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Monday, pro-government and
rebel forces in that country exchanged mortar and rifle fire
Sunday, which was more intense than in recent days since a
military revolt led by former Army Chief of Staff Amsumane Mane
started a month ago.
</P>
<P>
No casualties of the latest round of fighting were available.
But it is reported that most of the 300,000 people who live in
Bissau have fled toward the interior, causing fears of epidemics
and famine.
</P>
<P>
Worried about the worsening situation in the country, foreign
and defense ministers from member states of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held an emergency
meeting last weekend, appealing for an end to the fighting there.
</P>
<P>
What analysts saw as the major outcome of the two-day meeting
was the resolution adopted by the ministers that ECOWAS should
begin preparations to send in an intervention force if peace
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation body also reaffirmed its support for the elected
government of Guinea Bissau's President Joau Bernardo Vieira and
for the assistance already given to him by the armies of
neighboring Guinea and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Senegal have sent some 2,000 troops to help the
Vieira government's efforts to end the revolt that has reportedly
killed hundreds of civilians.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which ended Saturday in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire,
the ministers agreed that the central objective of sending the
ECOWAS peace keeping force known as ECOMOG for intervention would
be to restore peace in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The ministers therefore resolved that ECOWAS members
immediately beef up the strength of ECOMOG as the first step
toward the use of force, since there are now only soldiers from
Nigeria and Ghana serving the west African peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Many member states have pledged long ago to provide logistic
support and troops contribution to ECOMOG. But nothing has been
done so far.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that efforts should be redoubled to enhance
ECOWAS unity, continued fighting in Guinea Bissau may serve to
strengthen ECOWAS determination to step in militarily to end the
bloodshed, especially after the success of ECOMOG in Liberia and
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Revenue Officers to Probe VAT Evaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian revenue
authorities will send officers to disguise as consumers for the
investigation of businessmen who attempt to evade the
newly-introduced Value Added Tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
"We will deploy investigators in the field throughout Mainland
Tanzania to pose as customers so that we capture traders not
registered for VAT," the VAT Commissioner, Placidus John Luoga
has said.
</P>
<P>
The new tax became effective in Mainland Tanzania on July 1.
Zanzibar has delayed the implementation of VAT to January 1999.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 9,000 traders have been registered for VAT
on Mainland Tanzania, against a target of 15,000, according to
Monday's Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The new tax is applied at a standard rate of 20 percent except
for certain items that were zero-rated. Traders whose annual
turnover has reached 20 million Shillings (about 30,000 U.S.
Dollars) should register for the new tax system.
</P>
<P>
The official, who was briefing over 600 workers of Tanzanian
Revenue Authority (TRA) on the operation of the VAT last week,
said the VAT Act empowers the VAT Commissioner to register
traders who qualify but simply decide not to register.
</P>
<P>
He said the law provides that traders failed to register can
be penalized, either by paying a fine not exceeding 200,000
Shillings or jailed for not less than two months but not more
than 12 months or suffer both.
</P>
<P>
"However, those who come up to register on their own, before
we discover them, will not be penalized," Luoga said. "We still
register them."
</P>
<P>
He said registration of traders for VAT is a continuous
process and education on the new tax system will go on.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Container Terminal Plan Comes Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government's plan to
allow an American company to construct a container terminal at the
country' southeastern Chittagong port has come under fire from
dock workers there who said the project might "risk the country's
independence."
</P>
<P>
"The terminal is proposed to be sited close to the Chittagong
Air Force base and a naval base, and it cannot be ruled out that
the terminal may be used by agents and spies from neighboring and
far away countries," said Mahfuzur Rahman, a port labor leader
from the ruling Awami League, according to a report reaching here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has already given the go-ahead to
the U.S. company, the Stevedoring Service of America (SSA), to
build the 500 million-U.S. dollar international container
terminal, and has approved the firm's proposal to build it on a
"build-own-operate" basis, Shipping Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The terminal, the single U.S.-funded project in Bangladesh, is
designed to boost local and regional trade while easing congestion
at the Chittagong port, which handles most of the country's
trading with other countries, according to Ashfaq Jamil Rahman,
deputy managing director of the SSA Bangladesh Limited.
</P>
<P>
The physical work on the project, which would be capable of
handling 800,000 containers annually upon completion, would start
in October-November this year, he said. The terminal would be
partially operational within 18 months and fully operational by
the year 2001, he added.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the Chittagong Port Authority on Saturday,
trade union leaders said the government should have reached a
consensus with them before taking any decision to lease out lands
to any foreign company for setting up the terminal.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions preferred to raise the port's own container
handling capacity rather than give the work to a foreign company,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The handling capacity of the port could be raised by increasing
the power and efficiency of the port authority in taking
operational, administrative and financial decisions, according to
Kamaluddin Ahmed, president of the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce
and Industry.
</P>
<P>
But a senior port authority official said the government was
unable to take firm steps for the port's development, including
private handling of equipment to speed up loading and unloading,
due to resistance by powerful trade unions, which were reportedly
fearing the foreseeable competition and the possible unemployment
of many of their members.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment was not the only concern. The project "will
jeopardize not only the country's business interests but its
security," said Mahfuzur Rahman, whose view was shared by many
others who have urged the government to reconsider the plan for
having the container terminal built by a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
Nurullah Bahar, a leader of the pro-Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (the country's major opposition) labor front, even demanded
the scrapping of the agreement on constructing the terminal, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Ailing Kia Motors to Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ailing Kia Motors
Corp. and its subsidiary company Asia Motors Co., will be put up
for international bidding on July 15, according to the Korean
Development Bank Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Keun-young, governor of the Korea Development Bank, one of
Kia's main creditors, Monday told a press conference that any
qualified South Korean and foreign buyers are welcome to participate
in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that Kia, now under court receivership, will be sold off
simultaneously through public bidding and liquidation procedures.
</P>
<P>
He said his bank will disclose the detailed criteria to be used to
select the successful bidder on July 15, as well as Kia's debt
repayment and other liquidation plans, including the size of capital
reduction and volume of new shares.
</P>
<P>
"Kia's debt repayment programs could vary according to the capital
reduction, new stock issue, business prospects and cash flows over the
next decade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's announcement of the timetable for the public tender is
expected to trigger a battle among South Korean and foreign auto
makers to take over Kia, which went belly-up last July under debts of
more than 10 trillion won (some 7.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both South Korean Hyundai Motor and American Ford Motor have
expressed their readiness to take over ailing Kia.

<HEADLINE> Another New Offshore Oil Well in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A new oil well capable of producing
over 20,000 barrels of quality petroleum per day has been sunk
offshore in northern Cabinda, according to a press release
available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Angola National Oil Company and Cabinda Gulf Oil Company
recently announced in their joint statement that quality oil has
been discovered 400 meters deep under sea level at the No. 9
Benguela well in No. 14 Waters region near Cabinda and the output
of its trial production has exceeded 20,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The discovery shows that there is a great reserve of petroleum
in the waters. And currently, Cabinda Gulf Oil Company is making
further exploration to identify the oil reserves in the area.
</P>
<P>
The release said this is the third time oil has been found in
No. 14 water region. But it did not reveal the outputs of Well
Kuito and Well Luanda, the two exploratory wells previously sunk
by Cabinda Gulf company.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth offshore oil field found in Angola since
early this year. Previously, Esso Exploration Angola Ltd., a
subsidiary of the U.S. Exxon Corporation, struck a well which has
an output of 6,800 barrels per day in No. 15 Waters region near
Luanda. Esso later drilled another well pumping out 10,000
barrels of oil per day in the same water area.

Elf Corporation, also sank a well putting out 12,000 barrels of
oil per day in No. 17 Waters region near Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda Gulf Oil Company is a subsidiary of the U.S. Chevron.
It has been exploring oil in Angola for 50 years and is the
leading oil company in the industry in this southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The oil output of Cabinda Gulf company is 550,000 barrels per
day while the total output in Angola's oil industry is nearly
800,000 barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Americans Hail Clinton's China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Americans in California
on Sunday hailed U.S. President Bill Clinton's China visit, saying
that they are delighted to see him "making history in promoting
Sino-American relationship during the past weeks."
</P>
<P>
"It is just through your visit that American people see a
genuine China which is very different from what they knew before,"
leaders of eight organizations of the Chinese community said in a
congratulatory letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The president has just concluded a nine-day trip to China,
which he said was fascinating, and hopes for more regular summits
between the United States and China in the future.
</P>
<P>
"You have engaged not only the Chinese leaders, but also the
Chinese people," they said. "This would be the most important
result of your successful visit."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on behalf of the eight organizations,
Richard Koo, president of Sino-American Institute of Human
Resources, said the visit will "give U.S. president a vision to
form a right policy on China."
</P>
<P>
Koo said he believes President Clinton will push the Sino-U.S.
constructive and strategic partnership to a higher level, and find
the best approaches to solve the remaining disputes between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
All the leaders of the eight organizations urged both the U.S.
president and Congress to grant China the permanent
most-favored-nation trading status.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us to establish a long-term commercial
ties with China, if the United States wants China to be a
strategic partner," they said.
</P>
<P>
They also urged Clinton to take efficient steps to speed up the
negotiation with China on its admission into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"The membership of WTO would enable China to be more open, more
dynamic and more free-marketed," they said, adding that, as
Chinese-Americans, "we would like to see smooth and cooperative
relations between the two great countries."

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar hovered in a
slightly lower range Monday as uncertainty surrounded the details
of Japan's economic reform package.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended the session weaker at 61.56 U.S.
cents, from 61.72 U.S. cents in Sydney previously, as Japan again
disappointed a market hopeful of strong reforms.
</P>
<P>
Remarks Monday by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in
which he appeared to back down from the prospect of permanent tax
cuts, instigated a downturn in the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Australian dollar, a recent yen proxy, also
headed downward.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank of Canada senior economist Su-Lin Ong said the
Australian dollar was likely to remain heavily influenced by the
yen, which in turn would be driven by the Japanese government's
commitment to further reform.
</P>
<P>
"As the markets await further news from Japan on a timetable of
immediate action on further banking reforms, deregulation, and
stimulus to domestic demand, any disappointment and impatience
will translate to Japanese yen weakness, as evident in last week's
Japanese yen movements," Ong said.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was trading at
86.41 Japanese yen, from 85.94 yen previously, and at 1.1187
German marks, from 1.1213 marks.

HANOI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will facilitate procedures at

<HEADLINE> SriLankan Tea Exports Threatened By Russian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's best tea export market,
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), is being threatened
by the financial crisis in Russia, according to reports reaching
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CIS has already purchased 13.46 million kilograms of Sri
Lankan tea in the first three months of this year but exporters
have been cautioned against granting credit lines to CIS countries
which are considered a high-risk market.
</P>
<P>
Russia has plunged into a financial crisis mainly due to a
40-percent fall in prices of oil and natural gas in the world
market which are Russia's main sources of income. This has left
Russia with no alternative but to make purchases on credit terms,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan exporters have been cautioned about their supply of
tea to Russia on credit terms, the reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Economy has begun to take off after
four years of development efforts in he Binhai New Area in
Tianjin, the largest opening-up port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
Binhai covers the Tianjin Development Zone, a Bonded Zone, and
Tianjin Harbor in a 350-square-kilometer area. Tianjin has spent
10 billion yuan on its infrastructure and has overseas-funded
enterprises on 125 sq. km. of land.

third of Tianjin's, and its industrial output value has grown 37
percent and exports, 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
Binhai's improved investment conditions make it a new area for
investment from abroad. By the end of April, it had approved

combined contractual volume of more than 10 billion U.S. dollars,
or half the city's total, and 60 of the top 500 multinationals in
the world are represented here, such as Motorola and Samsung.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 28 domestic provinces and autonomous regions have
set up 4,000 businesses in the zone with an aggregate investment
of 6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said that Tianjin's exports are expected to
reach around 10 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000 and the
annual handling capacity of the harbor to go up to 100 million
tons.

ANKARA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
said here Monday that Turkey supports Macedonia's effort for
protection of independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark before his departure for a two-day official
visit to Macedonia, the first by a Turkish prime minister since
Macedonia gained independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The remark is largely referring to Macedonia's dispute with
Greece, a Turkey's rival, over the name of the tiny Balkan country
in southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Greece held that the term of Macedonia is a geographic
reference to an area covering the northern part of Greece and must
not be misused by another country, while Macedonia has vowed to
safeguard its sovereignty and insisted to keep its current name.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz also said at the Ankara Esenboga Airport that Turkey
also provides support for the efforts for Macedonia's economic
development in stability and its integration with the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will hold talks on the international and
regional issues with his Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski.
</P>
<P>
"Our joint interests and our goal is to secure peace,
stability and cooperation in the Balkans," said Yilmaz, adding
that "the situation in Kosovo is one of the most important
obstacles for the goals in the future."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that a settlement to the Kosovo problem
should be found through dialog and within the territorial
integrity of Yogoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister also said that he will open up the
consulate general of Turkey in Manastir in Macedonia during his
visit.

A social welfare protocol will be signed by the two
governments.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Military Advised to Handover Next Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The month-old military government in
Nigeria led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar has received new
year to that of next year, the Post Express reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A nine-page recommendation anchored by a committee of two
social sciences professors also advised the government to
dissolve all the transition agencies, including the political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Their continued existence would negate the enthroning and
sustenance of genuine democratic policy, it claimed.
</P>
<P>
The committee, inaugurated shortly after Abubakar took over
power on June 9, also suggested the thawing of the country's
previous bellicose stance against the international community and
the promotion of human rights and respect for independence of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the government may have accepted
all the recommendation of the committee with the invitation and
warm reception accorded Kofi Annan, United Nations
secretary-general, and his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku
last week.
</P>
<P>
The government also hosted a delegation from the European
Union led by British Deputy Foreign Minister Tony Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Unitd States delegation to be led by Under
Secretary of State Thomas Pickering is slated to visit the
country this week.
</P>
<P>
All these moves, particularly coming on the heels of the
release of nearly 30 detainees, are expected to end the country's
political and economic isolation, and build new relations with
pro-democracy groups within and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
What is widely believed as a major score of the Abubakar
government is the reported renouncement by detained politician
Moshood Abiola of his presidential mandate.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was said to be the winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential polls. He was detained by the government of late
General Sani Abacha for declaring himself president of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The release of the businessman-politician has since become a
testimony that the government is determined to embrace democracy.

Since Abubakar assumed power after Abacha's death on June 8,
pro-democracy groups have been demanding Abiola be released to
lead a government of national unity.

<P>
But the Abubakar government may not want Abiola to become
president in that way although it is expected to free the
detained multi-millionaire before long.

However, in the country's new political dispensation, many
people believe#,every shade of the political spectrum is expected
to be allowed to unhindered participation, if a true national

<P>
TOKYO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo Monday
after posting an eight-day streak of gains, amid a lack of fresh
market incentives.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 160.79 points, or 0.97
percent, from last Friday's close to finish at 16,350.45.

<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all

items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli security officials are concerned that the recent
series of attacks on Arab property in the Hebron area may be the
work of an organized group. Four vegetable stalls belonging to
Palestinians near the Avraham Avinu enclave in Hebron were
torched on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Police are still trying to find out whether the arson was
carried out by persons involved in Friday's vandalism and if the
recent incidents are the work of an extremist underground.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is the 12th in the world in terms of per capita
Internet users, Science Minister Michael Eitan told the cabinet
Sunday. Eitan said that there are some 500,000 Internet users in
Israel, comprising about 10 percent of the population.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Develops Fine-Wool Sheep for Textiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
northwest China is now making new efforts to develop fine-wool
sheep in a bid to boost the local and national textile industry.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's four major grassland areas, Xinjiang has
recently begun improving its breeding system for two-million head
of high-quality fine-wool sheep to improve the quality of its
wool in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's major fine-wool producers, the region
provides more than 40 percent of the nation's total fine-sheep
wool output annually.
</P>
<P>
The region had over 12 million head of fine-wool sheep in 1990,
but in subsequent years that number declined dramatically because
of lower wool prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
This caused the Regional Animal Husbandry Department and
Science and Technology Commission to begin a renewal system in
1995 in an effort to end the growing quality decline of fine-wool
sheep due to hybridization of high-quality sheep with poor-quality
sheep.
</P>
<P>
The departments offered special training to more than 100,000
herdsmen and farmers, and implemented related management
regulations in line with these efforts.
</P>
<P>
As a result, three prefectures in northern Xinjiang, where the
system is being implemented, have cultivated just over two million
head of fine-wool sheep, and are expected to produce over 9,000
tons of high-quality wool this year which will account for 22
percent of the regional total.
</P>
<P>
This project will make it possible for the region to bring its
number of fine-wool sheep up to the 1990 level within three
years, according to experts at the regional Academy of Animal
Husbandry Sciences.
</P>
<P>
A major producer of fine-wool in China, Xinjiang has since 1954
provided more than 800, 000 tons of fine-wool to the country's
textile industry.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Plans Fish Exports to Asian States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has planned to
export fresh fish products, mostly Nile Perch, to China, Japan
and Australia in a bid to lessen dependence on a volatile
European Union (EU) market.
</P>
<P>
Zakia Meghji, Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, was
quoted Monday by local media as saying that the government
appreciated the EU's lifting the ban on fresh fish products
imports from Tanzania in fear of being contaminated by cholera
vibrio, but there was a need to reduce dependence on one market.
</P>
<P>
Meghji told parliament in central Dodoma over the weekend that
Tanzanian fresh fish products were not affected by the cholera
outbreak early this year.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen identified China including Hong Kong, Japan and
Australia as the new potential market for the fresh fish products
from Lake Victoria regions of Mwanza and Mara during a weekend
meeting with fish processors in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The EU officially lifted the six-month ban on July 1 following
recommendations made by the European Commission Veterinary
Committee, but cautioning that consignments of fresh fish
products must be accompanied by health certificates before their
entry into the EU market.
</P>
<P>
The EU appointed the Fishery Division in Meghji's ministry as
the authority for the enforcement of the EU regulations on
hygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has sent 4,000 samples of fish to a Belgium
laboratory where tests proved that none of them were found with
cholera vibrio, the bacteria which causes cholera.
</P>
<P>
The EU ban has adversely affected Tanzania's fish exports
which stand at about 13,000 tons annually worth 15 million U.S.
Dollars.

grabbed some cash from Mushala who was held at gun-point. The duo
were ordered to lie still on the ground.
</P>
<P>
This is certainly not an isolated aggravated robbery taking
place every day in the "Christian" country. It simply reflects
how rampant the crimes are and how the public order has
deteriorated in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that the crime rate in Zambia has
increased by a worrying 13 percent in the last five years alone,
which police officer Beenwell Chimfwenbe attributed to various
social-economic factors.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Yet to Carry out Ship Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are yet
to implement most ship safety measures they have agreed on the
setting up of search-and-rescue units in Lake Victoria and the
Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
None of the three east African states have trained divers for
rescue operations, purchased diving equipment or set up rescue
coordination centers as recommended by a joint special task force
set up two years ago, the East African weekly newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The task force, comprising experts from maritime bodies and
related agencies in the region, was established one month after a
vessel sank in Lake Victoria in May 1996, killing 800 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
In April 1994, the M/V (motor vessel) Mtongwe ferry capsized
in Kenya's coastal city Mombasa, a leading Indian Ocean port in
east Africa, claiming 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
According to a report recently issued by the task force, Kenya
has not complied with the requirement to carry out disaster
preparedness drills twice a year at national and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
Uganda conducted one drill to tackle oil pollution and
Tanzania held one aeronautical drill in capital Dar es Salaam,
but none on rescue at sea or lake.
</P>
<P>
The report said none of the three states has made any progress
toward installing meteorological equipment on ships in Lake
Victoria and that supporting meteorological centers have not been
set up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no progress was reported in the use of emergency
communication facilities on the lake and in facilitating access
to a radio link.
</P>
<P>
Vessels owned by the Tanzania Railways Corporation can
communicate with each other and with offshore centers, while
Kenyan vessels can only communicate via a radio station at
Kisumu, Kenya's major port ashore Lake Victoria.

<HEADLINE> International Team to Begin Mission in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- An international team is to begin
Monday their observation in Kosovo, special U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The team, Holbrooke was quoted as saying by a Tanjug news
agency report, would help implement a joint statement made last
month by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his Russian
counterpart Boris Yeltsin on finding a peaceful solution to the
ethnic crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russian, U.S. and British ambassadors would join the team, he
told a press briefing jointly held with his Russian counterpart
Nikolai Afanasyevsky in Pristinalast, capital of Kosovo, a
province of the Serbian Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Afanasyevsky, as Russia's deputy foreign minister,
said now is the best time for the Serb government to resume
unconditional talks with ethnic Albanian politicians.
</P>
<P>
Both Holbrooke and Afanasyevsky were emerging from talks with
Ibrahim Rugova, a leader of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, they met separately with other political
party leaders representing ethnic Albanians, who account for the
majority of Kosovo's population.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news reports said Rugova was satisfied with the plan for
upcoming observation by the international team.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important moment for Kosovo," he said. "We are
asking the armed groups on the ground and the local Albanian
population to form the best conditions for the mission."
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for
Kosovo. Hundreds of people have died since last February, when
armed conflicts escalated tensions there into a crisis.

<HEADLINE> Eye Pigment May Explain Biological Clock Resetting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have identified
a new pigment in the eye that may explain more precisely how the
biological clocks resetting occurs, and why some people experience
problems related to disruptions of their body clocks.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from The Washington Post, Aziz Sancar of
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his team found
the new light-sensitive pigment, called cryptochrome or CRY, in a
part of the retina that is distinct from the location of opsins,
which are pigments that absorb light used for seeing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. scientists also found CRY in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, which is the part of the brain responsible for the body's
biological clock. In the brain CRY appears to fluctuate according
to light-dark cycles.
</P>
<P>
The report said this discovery could help explain how the
clocks of blind people still function and are reset by light,
adding that while the opsins in their retinas may be destroyed,
obliterating their ability to see, the CRY may be intact.
</P>
<P>
It also could explain all sorts of problems that stem from a
faulty setting of the biological clock, including winter
depression known as seasonal affective disorder and jet lag.
</P>
<P>
They also found CRY in the skin, which suggests that there may
be many "clocks" distributed throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed the finding is potentially of
fundamental importance, but more research is needed to determine
that CRY does play a direct role in regulating the biological
clock.

LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will be very

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Steady Growth of Industrial Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shanghai, China's
leading manufacturing center, reported 248.2 billion yuan in
industrial output for the first six months of this year, a rise of
9.2 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to May, the municipality delivered 36.2 billion
yuan worth of commodities for export, an increase of 8.3 percent.
The comprehensive industrial economic efficiency index for the
same period stands at 102.81, an increase of 10.3 percentage
points since the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's industrial production saw a negative growth at the
beginning of this year due to the adverse effects of the Southeast
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial authorities have therefore adjusted production
plans and intensified market exploration in accordance with the
new situation. These efforts have proved effective as industrial
production began to pick up in February, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 48 newly completed major
technical upgrading projects were put into production, turning out
important new products with a combined value of 13.7 billion
yuan. These projects have played an important role in stabilizing
Shanghai's industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's application of 28 new scientific and technological
processes to industrial production from January to June has
created important new products with a total output value of 29.8
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the city approved 200
overseas-financed industrial projects, with contracts involving
1.884 billion U.S. dollars in overseas funds, or 73 percent of the
city's total.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Coal Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's largest coal
producer, is planning to export more coal products in a bid to ease
the country's large domestic stockpile.
</P>
<P>
To support coal exports, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China will offer coal enterprises loans totaling around three
billion yuan this year to alleviate their shortage of funds, said
Zhang Baoming, director of the newly formed Coal Industry
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the country will offer a nine percent
export rebate to coal enterprises instead of the current three
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Administration will still cut export commissions for coal
enterprises by one third in an effort to arouse the
coal-exporting initiatives of these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China is the world's largest coal
producer, turning out an annual 1.35 billion tons, or one third of
the world's total. China has earned 5.4 billion US dollars
by exporting 150 million tons of coal over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
However, China's annual coal exports amount to only just over 30
million tons, about six percent of the world's total coal trade,
and so there is a huge untapped potential.
</P>
<P>
China plans to export 35 million tons of coal this year, and 50
million tons by the year 2000. The expansion of coal exports will
make this sector of the economy more open to the rest of the
world, the official said.
</P>
<P>
At present, supply exceeds demand in coal markets both at home
and abroad. The dwindling demand for coal in Southeast Asian
countries last year has affected China's coal exports, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that China will take all possible measures to
expand its coal-market share worldwide, particularly in Asia,
Europe and South America.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Tests May Harm Sri Lankan Environment: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A leading Sri Lankan scientist has
cautioned that Sri Lanka could be adversely affected by the
atmospheric conditions caused by the nuclear explosions by India
and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Granville Dharmawardena of Colombo University issued the
warning while delivering a lecture on "The Impact of Atomic
Explosions on the Environment" here Saturday, university sources
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dharmawardena said there is every possibility that the
atmospheric conditions in Sri Lanka will be adversely affected by
such explosions in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is the duty of governments to prevent any
harmful effect on their own environment and that of their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The safety of respective countries and their neighbors depends
entirely on the nature and policy of the governments in India and
Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that emission of radiation or release of
radioactivity can cause harm not only to the countries concerned
but also to neighboring countries as well.
</P>
<P>
In this circumstance, he said, Sri Lanka has to be very alert
and think of what preventive measures can be taken against the
degradation of its environment due to the atomic explosions.
</P>
<P>
It is a serious matter which can affect a generation of human
beings, animals and plants, he said.

<HEADLINE> Current Account Deficit Plunges in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' current account
deficit declined by 98 percent to 10 million U.S. dollars as of
June 12 this year from the year-ago level of 513 million dollars,
central bank data showed.
</P>
<P>
Business Daily, quoting the data Monday, however reported that
the deficit was also a big turnaround from the 68-million-dollar
surplus recorded during the first two months this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the decline of the current account deficit led
to an improvement in the Philippines' balance of payments to a
surplus of 1.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Balance of payments is a record of a country's foreign exchange
inflows and outflows through trade of goods and services,
investments, loans and others.
</P>
<P>
It is a closely-watched indicator of a country's vulnerability
to currency crisis and is now even more closely monitored because
of the ongoing Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The current account is one of the two major components of the
balance of payments and records inflows and outflows through trade
in goods and services and net transfers.
</P>
<P>
The central bank data did not provide an explanation to the
decline of the current account deficit, but analysts said this was
thanks to the good performance of the exports sector.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the peso by almost 50 percent since the
start of the financial crisis last July has created windfalls for
exporters who can now price their products and services more
competitively in the global market.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year, the Philippines'
exports grew by 22 percent to 11.5 billion U.S. dollars when
compared with the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Step Up Efforts Opening Euroasia Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu said his country would step up cooperation with
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia, especially in opening up a trade
corridor across the Eurasia continent.
</P>
<P>
Arriving home Saturday evening after a six-day tour of the
three Caucasus countries, Constantinescu told the press that joint
efforts would be made to turn the trade corridor, known as
"Eurasia continental bridge," into a new "Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
As willingness for closer ties was expressed, joint statements
issued and cooperation agreements singed, he said at Otopeni
International Airport here, the achievements made in his visit to
the three countries were "far beyond" initial expectations.
</P>
<P>
Through discussions with Azerbaijani, Georgian and Armenian
leaders on opening up the trade corridor, a foundation has been
laid for working together in early next century on the "most
magnificent" engineering project, said the Romanian president.
</P>
<P>
The new "Silk Road" linking Japan, China and Central Asian
nations on one end, and European nations on the other, would help
promote friendship and cultural exchanges in addition to
transportation of oil, natural gas and other commodities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Romania's government institutions and businesses
to take opportunities brought about by the project and Romania's
favorable geographic location, and turn the country into a major
hub on the "Eurasia continental bridge."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka May Hold Presidential Polls This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government intends
to hold early presidential election before the end of the year and
will postpone Provincial Council elections scheduled for August
this year, the official Daily News newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister G. L. Peiris told
the powerful Mahanayake Theras (Buddhist prelates) in Kandy city
Sunday that the government wants to put off the Provincial Council
elections for six months for security reasons and hold the
presidential election, which is due in late 2000, by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
He said this decision has been taken after a full assessment of
the security situation in the country. He said it is difficult for
the government to decide whether to withdraw more police personnel
from operational areas in the north to provide security for the
provincial polls.
</P>
<P>
The government's dilemma, Peiris said, is whether to hold the
Provincial Council elections or to continue the operations in the
north against the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
who have been fighting against the government for a separate
state.
</P>
<P>
He said the war in the north is at a decisive stage and
withdrawal of the army and police from the area would be a risk.
</P>
<P>
Two prelates who insist that the war against the rebels should
not be hampered at any cost favored the postponement of the
Provincial Council elections.
</P>
<P>
An early presidential election has been proposed by the
opposition United National Party which says if the government
postpones the Provincial Council elections, it should hold an
early presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Thailand at Bottom of Heap in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Among Asia's emerging markets,
Thailand was the worst performer in June as the banking crisis
depleted the attraction of commercial banks, Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) said.
</P>
<P>
MSCI's monthly indices, available here Monday, showed that the
banking sector in Thailand headed the list of losers as investors
feared further action from the Bank of Thailand against unhealthy
institutions with insufficient capital.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's index at the end of June retreated 27.7 percent from
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
According to MSCI, while most European developed markets
continued to advance in June, Asia-Pacific developing markets
accounted for the three weakest performers -- Malaysia, Singapore,
and New Zealand, which recorded drops of 22.8, 14 and 13.1 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, the weak ringgit, compounded with concerns over
the yen, further eroded investor confidence. A struggle for
economic leadership between the prime minister and his finance
minister was also contributing uncertainties to a depressed
market, the Morgan Stanley report said.
</P>
<P>
In June, top performers among developed markets were Belgium,
with a positive rise of 7.2 percent; Finland 5.9 percent; and the
United States 4.2 percent, the report said.

Economists here noticed that the inflation rate for June is the

The inflation was pushed higher by the increases in all the
major commodity groups except housing and repairs and services as
a result of the El Nino phenomenon and the Asian financial crisis
which started last July, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
By commodity group on a year-on-year basis, the inflation rate
for food, beverages and tobacco increased to 10.1 percent from 9
percent; miscellaneous items to 9.4 percent from 8.8; clothing to
8.7 percent from 8.3 percent; and fuel, light and water to 5.5
percent from 5 percent.

By region, the inflation rate for Metro Manila decreased to

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists recently excavated
an ancient tomb dating back over 2,500 years in east China's
Zhejiang Province, according to today's Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The tomb represents yet another important archeological
discovery in Zhejiang over the past decade, following the Hemudu
Ruins and Liangzhu Culture Ruins.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located near the peak of Yinshan Mountain in Lanting
Township, Shaoxing County, was built to house the remains of an
emperor from the Yue King which existed between the Spring and
Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.) and the Warring States (475-221 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
The tomb, which is 350 meters long, 300 meters wide and 25
meters high, includes three burial chambers separated by walls
made of large tree trunks.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists recovered over 40 relics, including a jade sword
and jade utensils, as well as a stone axe and lacquered
tools.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was initially discovered in the late 1970s and was

<HEADLINE> Thailand Trying to Preserve Bangkok Landscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's capital, Bangkok, has
proposed laws limiting building heights in Samphanthawong, Phra
Nakhon and Pom Prap districts in the city, in a bid to preserve
the areas' landscape.
</P>
<P>
A city official said Monday that the law is aimed at stopping
high-rises obscuring Rattanakosin Island lying in the center of
the city.
</P>
<P>
Height limits will vary from area to area depending on the
number of historic sites and the density of commercial land use,
said the official who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
There are four proposed height limits: 16 meters (four floors),
20 meters (five floors), 23 meters (six floors) and 37 meters
(nine floors).
</P>
<P>
Where there are many historic sites and temples, building
heights would have to be under 16 meters, while in heavy
commercial zones like Yaowarat Road they could be as high as 37
meters.
</P>
<P>
The 16-meter limit will apply to most areas within 50 meters of
temples and historic sites.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would have little impact on land developers
because there is presently only one application for building a
high-rise within the targeted areas, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law has been submitted to the city council for
approval, he said.

<HEADLINE> Highway Accessible to More Rural Towns in Plateau Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Compared to a meager 400 kilometers
of highway in 1949, the plateau province of Qinghai now has over
17,000 kilometers of roads connecting 98 percent of its rural
townships.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the geological conditions
of Qinghai Province are very complicated, making highway
construction an extremely difficult job.
</P>
<P>
With a growing economy, the province, with more than 80 percent
of its area located over 3,000 meters above sea level, has
accelerated road construction in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1997, government departments spent 1.1
billion yuan (132.53 million US dollars) to build highways in
Qinghai, an amount higher than the entire sum spent in the 35
years between 1950 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
The province has also been encouraging local governments,
enterprises and individuals to contribute their own money to the
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province raised over 360 million yuan for the
building and renovating of over 780 kilometers of roads.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai now plans to invest 2.8 billion yuan in road
construction between 1998 and 2000.

<HEADLINE> China Works to Educate Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government will make
more efforts to develop higher-level education in areas inhabited
by minority peoples as elementary schooling has been popularized,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The government will improve conditions in universities for the
country's 55 minority nationalities and increase special classes
in ordinary universities for ethnic groups, said Abdu Wshur,
vice-director of the Department for Ethnic Group Education under
the Ministry of Education, in an interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Before the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the
country had no special university for ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Today, there are 13 minority-oriented universities and over 100
regional schools. And 50 ministry-managed universities have opened
classes for ethnic groups, said Abdu.
</P>
<P>
To promote research on higher education for ethnic groups, a
book "Research and Development of Higher Education for the
Minority in China" has been published.
</P>
<P>
Another important task is to improve bilingual teaching
programs for ethnic groups, including compiling more minority
language textbooks, said the official.
</P>
<P>
At present, students from 21 major ethnic groups use textbooks
in their own languages. The others study bilingually, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok's ambition to be the
regional hub for airline travel is not affected by new airports
opening in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong, Pradit Pattaraprasit,
deputy minister of the Thai Transport and Communications Ministry,
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Being a regional aviation hub depends on geographical location,
facilities, tourist attractions, economic growth and investment
potential, Pradit said.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment in response to the opening of the 2.3
billion U.S. dollar Kuala Lumpur international airport late last
month and Hong Kong's 20 billion U.S. dollar Chek La Kok airport
which started commercial operation Monday, The Bangkok Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok is hoping its 130 billion baht (3.1 billion dollars)
project to develop a new major international airport, unofficially
known as Nong Ngu Hao, will prove a regional winner. The airport
is expected to begin operation in 2004 with a capacity to serve 30

<P>
DANDONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The city of Dandong in northeast
China's Liaoning Province plans to raise the output value of its
water-based industries to 4.3 billion yuan in five years.
</P>
<P>
A local oceanography and aquatic products official says they
hope that by early next century, water-based industries will
account for 30 percent of the city's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Dandong is on the border with the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea and its 1,000 rivers, numerous reservoirs and ponds,
marshland, and 3,500 sq.km. of sea are suited to water-based
industries.
</P>
<P>
The city had 2.4 billion yuan in output value from water-based
industries in 1997, five times the 1985 figure, and the ratio of
such industries to the city's GDP rose from 2.2 percent in 1985 to
15 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Ocean fishing and marine aquatic products have generated 1.8
billion yuan in annual output value.
</P>
<P>
The City Oceanography and Aquatic Products Bureau has been
introducing new development programs for breeding crabs, shrimps,
and aquatic products in tidal areas and offshore.
</P>
<P>
Dandong is on the Yalu River estuary and has 17 ports and 29
hydroelectric power stations and plans to expand its marine
chemical industry, marine food industry, and explore marine
mineral resources.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Province Faces Tough Job Fulfilling Tax Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
recorded a year-on-year tax increase of 9.9 percent for the first
half of this year and faces a tough job fulfilling the annual
quota during the second half year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liuming, director of the provincial tax bureau, said the
province levied taxes of 29 billion yuan during the first five
months and must therefore collect an average of four billion yuan
monthly in the second half of the year, or 20 percent more than
for the same period last year, simply to fulfill this year's quota.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, which enjoys one of the most dynamic local economies
in China, recorded a 24 percent tax increase to 100 billion yuan
last year, or 14 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
However, the province will face difficulties in maintaining the
high growth rate, according to Vice-Governor Wang Qishan.
</P>
<P>
"The slow growth in tax collection can be attributed to the
sluggish economic growth and represents the follow-up impact of
the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia which has adversely
affected exports, as well as successive high growth rates in
previous years and changes in the management modes of
enterprises," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has also redoubled efforts to check tax evasion and
problems related to rebates.

BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Shougang Corporation, or Capital
Iron and Steel, plans to spend 3.9 billion yuan (469 million US
dollars) on pollution control during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for 60 environmental protection projects

environmental improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the amount of pollution, the corporation has decided
to hold annual steel output to eight million tons. It now has 200
dust removers in operation in its workshops that can removee 37.82
million cubic meters of smoke and dust per hour.
</P>
<P>
The amount of dust at Shougang last year was down 5.3 percent
from 1995, and suspended particles, by 22.4 percent. The company
has also turned its blast furnace gas into fuel for Beijing
residents, reducing the amount of pollution caused by burning coal
by 2,300 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Shougang is also building a production line for treating 1.2
million tons of steel sediment annually. And, the amount of dust
at the end of the century will be 20 percent less than in
1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, the capital of central China's
Hubei Province, has opened an unified fee collection center for
companies with overseas funding to try to put a halt to random
fees and overcharging.
</P>
<P>
Each month, the Wuhan Overseas Investment Fee Collection Center
will issue overseas-funded enterprises a fee collection list
describing the fees they are expected to pay, and no other office
will be allowed to levy charges on overseas enterprises operating
in the city.
</P>
<P>
The office opened on June 30 as part of the preferential
treatment that is expected to improve investment conditions for
overseas investors in the city, where random fees and overcharging
used to run rampant. There were as many as 229 types of arbitrary
administrative fees for overseas-funded enterprises at one time.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 3,391 ventures with overseas investment
in the city. By May, the city had utilized 5 billion U.S. dollars
worth of foreign funding.

</P>
<P>
Fujian currently has 265 new and high-tech enterprises, which
generated a total 25 billion yuan in output value last year.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech sector has become the most dynamic economic area

provincial government official said.
</P>
<P>
Of all the high-tech enterprises in Fujian, 38 had a sales of
100 million yuan or more each last year.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech development zones in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Sanming,
Quanzhou and other places have played an important role in
boosting the development of high-tech enterprises and industries,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
A non-government science and technology park in the hilly
county of Dehua, for instance, generated more than 200 million
yuan in output value last year, the same year it was built. The
park's output value is expected to reach 5 billion yuan by 2000.
</P>
<P>
To catch up with the more developed areas such as the special
economic zone of Shenzhen in terms of the proportion of high-tech
output value, Fujian is formulating new policies to assist
high-tech enterprises, the official said.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong province
will take some pioneering steps when it tries out a new entrance
examination system for colleges and universities next year.
</P>
<P>
Local high school graduates will be required to take an exam on
Chinese, mathematics, and English and will have optional tests in
physics, chemistry, political science, geography, history, or
biology, depending on what they want to major in. Every college or
university department taking students from Guangdong will have to
pick one or two of these last six to test the applicant.

Previously, in addition to the Chinese, mathematics, English,
and political science tests, high school grads had to pass
physics, chemistry, and biology tests if they were applying for
science or engineering majors, or geography and history exams if
they wanted to major in social sciences.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the reform is meant to reduce the
burden on high school students and to help colleges and
universities choose the right students.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The regional financial crisis
continued to wreak havoc with the Philippine economy as
investments registered with the Board of Investments dropped by
23.6 percent to 152 billion pesos (3.8 billion U.S. dollars) in
the first half this year.
</P>
<P>
The Business Daily reported Monday that the amount represented
the cost of 141 projects, compared to 239 in the same period last
year with a total project cost of 199 billion pesos (5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said that while there was a slowdown in the total
amount of approved investments, foreign equity rose by 41.7
percent to 26.9 billion pesos (672 million dollars) during the
period under review, showing that foreign investors are regaining
their confidence in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms a trend noticed in earlier months of continued
foreign interest in the Philippines," the Board of Investment said
in a statement, noting, "This is opposite to the experience of
other countries affected by the Asian contagion."
</P>
<P>
By origin, the investors so far this year came from China's
Hong Kong and the United States.
</P>

The board said the sectors that attracted the bulk of
investments were construction and housing components,

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Offer Loan Guarantee for High-Tech Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
has begun providing 50 million yuan (6 million U.S. dollars) as an
loan guarantee for high-tech ventures in the capital.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official said the city would increase
the guarantee fund to 200 million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars)
in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Zou Zuye, head of Beijing's Municipal Science and Technology
Commission, said the move is designed to boost development of the
city's high-tech ventures, which is believed to be a main sector
for the city's economic growth in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said the guarantee will be offered to support medium- and
small-size high-tech ventures and scientific research
institutions.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years the lack of funds has greatly hindered
the development of the high-tech ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that, by the end of May, 368 high-tech
ventures had applied for bank loans in Beijing. However, only 16
ventures obtained a limited sum of loans from the banks and the
others failed in their attempt because guarantee conditions were
lacking.
</P>
<P>
Zou said the loan guarantee will come from government
appropriations and donations.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing welcomes donations from domestic and overseas
organizations and agencies as well as individuals.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
plans to build expressways linking this capital to four other
cities to improve its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The four expressways will run from Lanzhou to Zhonghe, Baiyin,
Chankou and Haishiwan. Preparations for the road construction,
which will be financed by locally pooled funds and loans from the
World Bank, are well under way.
</P>
<P>
A major town on the ancient "Silk Road," Lanzhou was made an
open city by the Chinese State Council in 1992. However, in recent
years Lanzhou's economic growth has been hampered by inadequate
facilities in highway, railway and aviation
transportation. Currently, Gansu has one expressway running 13.1
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years both the Gansu provincial government and
Lanzhou City government have taken measures to raise funds
for the construction of transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the four planned expressways, which will have a
combined length of 274 kilometers, to help attract investors to
Lanzhou.

BBC Radio reported there were petrol bombings, burning

However, police said there were no arrests or injuries yet.

Thousands of Protestant Orangemen made a traditional march to
church Sunday, as they have since 1807, but were held back by the
barricades erected by police and troops to prevent them through
the Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
The independent Parades Commission has decided to ban the
Protestant march on the traditional route that includes the
Catholic areas in Portadown. But the Orange Order, the organizer

<HEADLINE> Greece Proposes to Host Palestinian-Israeli Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Sunday expressed its
willingness to host a high-level meeting between Israeli and
Palestinian officials in a bid to break the deadlock of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the close of a five-day meeting of Palestinian and
Israeli officials and personalities in the southeastern Greek
island of Rhodes, Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis
said that Greece could host such a meeting, even one between
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece did not have the ambition of imposing the resumption of
the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis, but wanted to
contribute to the creation of a climate of mutual understanding
and cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Rhodes meeting from July 1 to 5, the third of its kind, had
an informal character and was organized by the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, participants, including head of the
Palestinian negotiating team Faisal Husseini and the Israeli labor
and culture ministers, suggested that a 10-member consultant
committee be set up to observe decisions and the implementation of
the agreements struck during relevant meetings.
