`WHOA-JACK!': COHEN UPDATES BUCHNER'S `WOYZECK'  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was inevitable that one day Jeff Cohen would come
to Georg Buchner. In the last couple of years Cohen has updated two
Chekhov plays and a Greek tragedy to punch holes in the
self-satisfaction of the '90s. Buchner's ``Woyzeck,'' a play about
a soldier driven by personal abuse and social corruption to kill
his mistress, which Buchner wrote as a protest against injustice,
must have been irresistible to Cohen _ even more so, perhaps,
because it is so fragmentary that Buchner's friends assumed it was
unfinished when he died in 1837. It waited 76 years to find its
first producer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Whoa-Jack!'' Cohen turns it into a drama about a black
American soldier at an Army base in Alabama in 1960 who is slightly
unhinged by the Ku Klux Klan mentality of the era and is pushed
over the edge by a white major who has an affair with the soldier's
girlfriend, the mother of his infant son. The racial themes fit
Buchner's plot naturally. That the German playwright was also a
brilliant anatomist who put some medical experimentation into his
play lets Cohen conjure up the infamous Tuskegee syphilis
experiments on unsuspecting black men.
</P>
<P>
   For the Worth Street Theater company's production, Cohen, who
directs, has assembled a good cast, with strong performances from
actors in the four key roles: Michael D. Brown as the soldier,
Private Jackson; Genie Sloan as his lover, Mary; Phyllis Johnson as
Mary's friend, the only person in the play who can foresee the
tragedy unfolding; and Roy Barnitt as the camp commandant, who
represents weakness and bigotry among whites but who really
believes, as he says, thatrucial final minutes not even Bargonetti's
incomparable guitar and Esther's magnificent rendition of ``Strange
Fruit' can lift one from the feeling of letdown, although his
strings and her voice are surely the best memories one takes aay
from this performance. ``Whoa-Jack!'' has been extended through
Feb. 15.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ Lawrence Taylor did it his way, for which he offers not a
whiff of an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's way produced a rap sheet full of bad things. Lots of
them, including failure to pay child support. Even now, he has drug
charges hanging over his head, yet he refuses to hang his head in
shame.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a man you want in your Pro Football Hall of Fame? Do you
want to take your kid to the shrine in Canton, Ohio, and show him
Lawrence Taylor's bronze bust? Should L.T., a bust of a human
being, be officially certified as an immortal?
</P>
<P>
   No two ways about it, he is a lousy role model.
</P>
<P>
   But he was an amazingly gifted football player.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hall of Fame, invented to honor the latter, already
includes plenty of the former.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally accepted, albeit not altogether accurately, that
Taylor reinvented his position, that of outside linebacker.
Actually, the Oilers' Robert Brazile, who started a string of Pro
Bowl seasons as a rookie in 1975, was L.T. before L.T. became L.T.
But Dr. Doom lost his hard edge prematurely, and Taylor, performing
at a remarkable level in the New York media spotlight, eclipsed
Brazile completely.
</P>
<P>
   His ``A'' game lasted more than a decade, and he contributed
significantly to two world-championship Giants teams. For those who
hadn't paid Brazile much mind, Taylor was an entirely new breed of
cat, too quick and agile to be as big as he was. Were it not for
his considerable non-football liabilities, his assets would
guarantee him election to the Hall in this, his first year of
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, however, there will be much acrimonious debate _
possibly an unprecedented level _ when the selection committee
convenes today to decide whether to Cantonize L.T. If the full
complement of 36 is present, it will take eight ``no'' votes to
block his entry, and recent polls suggest a sufficient number of
thumbs-down may be lurking.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Hall's bylaws contain nothing in the way of
a ``morals'' clause. By all accounts, Taylor is supposed to be
judged solely on the basis of what he contributed to football, not
on how many times he has stumbled elsewhere. Even the commish, Paul
Tagliabue, won't dispute that point.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Blood McNally was a member of Canton's original class of
inductees despite his well-documented legacy as an unrepentant
hell-raiser. Paul Hornung made it, too, and he was banished for a
season for wagering on games.
</P>
<P>
   And O.J. Simpson is permanently ensconced as well, although
obviously he was elected long before he came to be seen by many
Americans as a heinous double murderer who stiff-armed the system.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there is one conspicuous _ although clearly not correct _
precedent for Taylor's exclusion. Bob Hayes, once the world's
fastest human, averaged 20 yards per catch as a Dallas Cowboy and
was basically responsible for the invention of the zone defense.
Yet because he did time in the pen at Huntsville for a drug
conviction, you won't find Bullet Bob's likeness anywhere near
Canton.
</P>
<P>
   Older sportswriters who own a vote seem unanimously inclined to
veto Taylor's bid, at least this year. Those who heard him speak on
his own behalf during an occasionally testy conference call Monday
were further put off by his stubborn unwillingness to show the
least bit of remorse for the stupid choices he has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't apologize for anything,'' L.T. said. ``I live my life
like I live my life. All of us have things we'd like to change.
Unfortunately, we can't do that. I try to do the best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get in (the Hall), I don't get in. That's a part of
life. I'll leave my fate up to the voters. That's for you guys to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   And it should be a simple decision. L.T. was the best of the
best, and he stayed on top for a long time despite a
self-destructive bent that could have short-circuited his career on
numerous occasions. Given the criteria as presently spelled out, he
has to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the argument is wrongly centered. Perhaps the Hall
should re-examine its framework for membership. Should public
deportment be a factor? Need only model citizens apply? It's a
defendable position, considering how impressionable our kids can
be.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we ask football players to behave in an antisocial
fashion. Almost everything that happens on the field would be at
least a misdemeanor if committed on the street. This is not a sport
that fosters ``good'' behavior. It demands anything but civility.
</P>
<P>
   L.T. played this violent, dangerous, reckless game as violently,
dangerously and recklessly as anyone ever has. That he has opted to
live his life similarly shouldn't be all that surprising or,
frankly, repellent. To expect complete conformity and normalcy
outside the white lines is a tad unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocritical, too.

Make no mistake about it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am the Iceman _ Ice,'' Basketball Hall of Famer George
Gervin Sr. declared. ``Gee is the Ice Cube.''
</P>
<P>
   George Gervin Jr., or Gee as he prefers to be called, is trying
to make his own name as the Houston Cougars continue their arduous
journey with first-year coach Clyde Drexler tonight when they meet
South Florida at Hofheinz Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, the Conference USA scoring leader at 21.5 points per game,
is growing along with the Cougars. He carries a heavy burden for
his team on his skinny 6-2, 175-pound frame, averaging 33 minutes
per game and taking on most of the playmaking role and much of the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strain,'' Gervin said, ``but I'm trying to use it to my
advantage, learning what to do against these funky defenses some
teams are using, standing up to the physical demands, doing
whatever I can to help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   C-USA wins have been scarce for the Cougars (7-11, 2-6 in
conference). The Bulls, gifted with some of the best young players
in Division I, also are 2-6 (9-8 for the year) after their sixth
straight loss, 65-58 to DePaul on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gervins Sr. and Jr. take issue with those who want to compare
them. George, voted one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, scored
20,708 points in his 10 NBA seasons with the San Antonio Spurs
(1977-86), led the league in scoring four times with his assortment
of finger rolls and acrobatic shots and four times was selected to
the All-NBA first team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 6-8, and he's 6-2,'' Gervin said of Gee. ``The only
comparison is, he's my son. He can't do some of the things I was
able to do, and I can't do some of the things he can do. He and I
understand people will say that (making the comparison). I told
him, `I'm the Iceman; you're the Ice Cube.' I know he can be as
good as he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin is 17th nationally in scoring, and he is second in C-USA
in 3-point accuracy (44.7 percent), first in 3-pointers per game
(2.56), sixth in free-throw accuracy (81.9 percent), 10th in
assists (3.33 per game) and 12th in steals (1.7). The figures that
disturb him: 43.3-percent shooting overall and a 68-to-60
turnover/assist ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to learn to make better decisions with the ball and not
try to force things that aren't there,'' he said. ``I'm hard on
myself. I want to win so bad, sometimes I try to take it on my own
hands. It's not that I'm being selfish; it's about trying to help
my team win. I can't think of myself as a great player until I win
some games.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-year junior, Gervin played last season for San Jacinto
College, following just after Omar Sneed and Steve Francis, who are
starring this season at Memphis and Maryland, respectively. Until
his last game for San Jac, a loss to Tyler in the state
junior-college tournament in Waco last year, Gervin thought he
would play for South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   George Gervin met South Florida head coach Seth Greenberg on a
plane trip and mentioned that Gee might be a prospect for him.
Assistant David Zimroth watched Gee with San Jacinto several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking it might be a good place for me,'' Gee said.
``I guess coach Greenberg wasn't quite pleased with that last game,
and I never heard from them again. I've been waiting for this game
since last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when Gervin and his friends from San Jac would come to
Hofheinz Pavilion to play pickup games against several of his
current UH teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We smacked those guys,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   His San Jac buddies included Calvin Bowman, now at West
Virginia, Alex Scales (Oregon) and Roy de la Cruz (redshirting at
TCU). Drexler had been hired recently as Cougars coach. Gervin, who
wasn't being heavily recruited at that time, talked to Drexler and
assistant Reid Gettys to set up an official visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was thrilled when Clyde got the job, but he left it up
to me,'' Gee said. ``He trusted me to make the right decision. I
felt it was an honor to play for Clyde Drexler. I ate that up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gee was growing up, tennis was his favorite game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get him off the court,'' his dad said.
</P>
<P>
   During his freshman year at San Antonio's John Marshall High
School, he tried out for basketball but was left on the junior
varsity because he was so small. Gee and his father began their
regimen of working on his game together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven hundred, 800 shots a day from all around the court,''
George Gervin said. ``You can do it in an hour and a half, two
hours, with somebody chasing the ball for you. I drilled him in the
summers. I told him to discipline himself, develop a passion for
practice and take it to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed getting to every class on time, getting to every
practice on time, and get your education. Without an education, no
matter how talented you are, you can't be a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for Clyde (a former NBA opponent). He has
a good sense for life and this game. These boys don't know how
lucky they are. These guys should bust their tails off to play and
learn from him.''

CHRISTOPH PREGARDIEN: A LIEDER SINGER WHO MATTERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Germany )   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &UR;  &LR; _ The German tenor Christoph Pregardien, who has
become one of the most essential of today's Lieder singers, was not
in his best voice for his recital on Sunday at Alice Tully Hall.
There was a little constriction in his mid-to-upper range, which
resulted in some overly forceful singing.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a testimony to Pregardien's artistry that his
less-than-top-notch vocal condition hardly mattered. The essential
sound of his voice is beguiling: a plaintive, flexible lyric tenor
with choirboy-clear high notes and surprisingly robust chest tones.
This is communicative, literate and affecting singing.
</P>
<P>
   His accompanist was his countryman Michael Gees, a remarkable
pianist, who was Pregardien's partner on his Lincoln Center recital
last season. Clearly, these two sympathetic artists bring out the
best in each other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pregardien's program was typically intelligent. The first half
offered songs by Schumann, Beethoven, Schubert, Wolf, and the
under-appreciated 19th-century Viennese composer Karl Loewe _ all
settings of poems by Goethe. The second half was devoted to
Schumann's seldom-heard songs to texts by the medical doctor and
poet Justinus Kerner, impassioned Romantic meditations on loss and
unrequited love.
</P>
<P>
   The Loewe songs were particularly special. The composer's
version of Goethe's ``Erlkoenig'' is, in its way, as ingenious as
Schubert's famous setting of the same text. Instead of the
insistently repeated octaves in Schubert's piano part, which evoke
the galloping horse, carrying the reassuring father and his young
son, terrified by the voice of the Erl-king, through the dark,
stormy forest, Loewe conveys the scene with trembling chords and
ominous low trills in the piano, and vocal lines of haunting power
and narrative vividness. Pregardien framed this song with
``Wanderers Nachtlied I and II,'' music of meditative beauty and
ineffable sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the recital, Gees' playing technically was
accomplished and musically exquisite. He is quite a presence at the
keyboard. Though 45, the trim pianist with his boyish face and long
curly hair looks no more than 25. His playing is reflective of his
appearance, combining youthful exuberance and mature insight. He
should come back to New York to give a recital some time. Surely,
he would do an elegant performance of a Schubert sonata.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three of Schumann's Kerner songs, music of
meditative stillness, the performers had the audience transfixed.
Naturally, encores followed, including, to put Loewe's
``Erlkoenig'' in context, a demonic performance of Schubert's
version. These satisfying musicians wanted to send you home with
something to think about.

FARSIGHTEDNESS CAN BE A DISTANT MEMORY WITH NEW LASER TECHNIQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As revolutionary as a laser procedure that vastly
improves nearsightedness, a newly approved technique now is
available to just about reverse farsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough surgery was perfected by a doctor during
clinical trials at his suburban Encino eye clinic and at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   After years of waking up to a blurry world, Kathy Redline wept
when she saw her face clearly in the mirror for the first time in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was putting makeup on and the whole time I was crying
because I could see what I was doing,'' said Redline, 54, a
suburban Newbury Park resident. ``And I can shave my legs. This
sounds stupid, but I can see what I'm doing in the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   The work by Dr. James Salz at Cedars-Sinai and the Freedom
Vision Laser Center, and by others around the country, led to
Federal Drug Administration approval in November for laser surgery
to correct farsightedness. And Salz and others are now conducting
trials to correct farsightedness complicated by astigmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Salz is working with 35 Southern California volunteers out of
200 cases nationwide for the astigmatism study, which he expects
will be done by August. The previous study, with about the same
number of patients, ran from February 1997 until FDA approval in
November.
</P>
<P>
   In 94 percent of those cases, patients were restored to at least
20/40 vision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearsightedness, or myopia, results when the eyeball is too
long, forcing light rays to focus in front of the retina instead of
on it. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the eyeball is too
flat, so light rays reach the retina before they come into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Astigmatism is an unequal curvature of the cornea, which can
cause further distortion beyond near- or farsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had long ago approved use of the laser to correct
nearsightedness, which affects about 60 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And with the federal approval, the 30 million farsighted people
in the country now have a chance to see without glasses that fog up
in the heat or get splattered in the rain, or contact lenses that
dry up in air conditioning or float away during a swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what if there's an earthquake and you can't get to your
glasses, or a fire?'' Redline said.
</P>
<P>
   Calliopi Ash of Encino constantly felt uncomfortable wearing
glasses or contacts. After her surgery in September, she said her
vision improved about 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see like I used to see when I was a young girl, but I
can see without the glasses,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   And suburban West Hills ophthalmologist Samuel Masket, who has
begun using the laser to treat farsightedness, said those people
``are among the happiest patients I've ever seen.'' His wife,
Barbara, will soon have the surgery herself.
</P>
<P>
   Nearsighted people can at least see at close range, Masket said,
but a farsighted person ``past a certain age doesn't have good
vision at any range.''
</P>
<P>
   Masket said about 5 percent of laser-surgery cases have
complications, which can include improper cuts or infections that
can result in a corneal ulcer. Permanent damage is extremely rare,
and the result of most complications is vision correction that
isn't quite as good as it should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Salz's laser research opened the door for two types of surgery
-- PRK and LASIK, both of which were already being used for
nearsightedness. Once the FDA approved the use of the laser to
correct farsightedness, ophthalmologists were free to perform
either type of work.
</P>
<P>
   With PRK, or photorefractive keratectomy, the surgeon cuts away
at the surface of the cornea. With LASIK, or laser in-situ
keratomileusis, the doctor shaves a flap from the surface of the
cornea, then uses the laser to sculpt the less-sensitive inner
cells of the cornea. So LASIK involves a slightly greater risk, but
results in a shorter recovery period and less chance of pain, Salz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are actually pretty similar,'' he said. ``People
obviously want the easy way out if they can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Myopia is easier to fix, because it involves shaving some tissue
off the center of the cornea, making it flatter. Fixing
farsightedness is a little tricker, as the surgeon must use the
laser to trim around the center of the cornea to make it steeper.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross don't cover the laser
procedures, which can cost between $2,000 and $3,000 per eye, the
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   But Redline and the other patients compared the cost to
continual replacement of eyeglasses or contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expensive, but then so too are a lot of things,'' Redline
said. ``It wasn't too much or I wouldn't have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the right tools and the proper training, the surgery isn't
very difficult, Salz said. But visions of someone cutting into the
eyeball like a butcher slicing luncheon meat, or incinerating part
of the cornea with a laser, can be a little intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a little brave,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient is awake during the entire procedure, which takes
only a few minutes. The only anesthesia is eye-numbing drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared, which I think is natural, because it's your
eyesight,'' said Redline. ``If you lose it, you don't get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the operation, ``they sit you up and you see. It's
instant. It's just amazing.''

   UNIONDALE, N.Y._ Bill Stewart has been successful everywhere he
has coached because of one constant: defense.
</P>
<P>
   For teams with limited talent, the trap is not only the best
strategy, it is the only strategy. It works for the Ottawa
Senators, and now it's working for the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since taking over behind the Islanders'
bench, Stewart's system was apparent Friday night against the
Phoenix Coyotes as the Islanders twice rallied from two-goal
deficits to earn a hard-fought 4-4 tie at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' aggressive forechecking, which created turnovers
in every zone, helped them to overcome a 4-2 deficit late in the
third period on goals by Zdeno Chara and Robert Reichel, who scored
with 1:52 left to send the game to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who are 2-0-1 under Stewart, outshot the Coyotes
3-0 in overtime and nearly came away with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   They turned up the pressure in the third period, first slicing
the Coyotes' lead to 3-2 on a goal by Trevor Linden at 5:56 and
later to 4-3 on Chara's first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers, forced by the Islanders' smothering forechecking,
were key , providing several prime opportunities to tie the score
against Coyotes' goalie Jim Waite.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Adams scored the Coyotes' fourth goal on a soft wrist shot
from the middle of the right circle to give the Coyotes 4-2 lead.
It was the second straight questionable goal allowed by Tommy Salo,
who started in the Islander goal again , ahead of Felix Potvin.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Corkum's second goal of the game gave the Coyotes a 3-1 lead
at 14:00 of the third period. On a 2-on-1 rush, Corkum beat Salo
through the pads from the top of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Islanders' goalie controversy settled, at least for
now. Salo has started three straight games and is expected to stay
in that role. But because Stewart has refused to commit on a No. 1,
that could change. Potvin has not played since Stewart replaced
Mike Milbury as coach eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Salo was excellent despite allowing a couple of
first period goals. Both were scored off rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Briere notched the game's first goal at 9:49. He was
standing at the right post when the puck squirted off Salo's stick
and onto his.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum put Phoenix ahead 2-0 at 12:41, whipping a wrist shot
past Salo, who was sprawled on the ice after stopping Juha Ylonen's
shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' hard work finally paid off in the second period
when Barry Richter finished off a 4-on-2 rush with a goal, cutting
the Phoenix lead to 2-1. Sergei Nemchinov led the Islanders' attack
down ice, dishing the puck to Richter in the slot. Richter, a
defenseman, banked the shot off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The Nemchinov-Claude Lapointe-Mark Lawrence line was the
Islanders' most productive of the night.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   MARIUSZ CZERKAWSKI &UR;  &LR; was benched for Tuesday's game against the
Boston Bruins because he arrived two minutes late for a 9:45
meeting, which violated one of Bill Stewart's rules of conduct:
don't be late. Czerkawski arrived at 9:20 this morning... . While
FELIX POTVIN, the goalie who has struggled since arriving from the
Toronto Maple Leafs in the Bryan Berard deal, sat on the Islanders'
bench for the third straight game, fans chanted, ``Heave-ho, Felix
must go!'' ... . ZDENO CHARA, the Islanders' defenseman who nearly
lost an eye last Tuesday when his face was cut by the skate blade
of an opposing player, played with a visor on his helmet... .
DALLAS DRAKE of the Coyotes left midway through the first period
with what appeared to be a shoulder injury.

LAPD'S PATROL-CAR CAMERA PROGRAM LOSING FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Touted as a deterrent to police brutality after
the videotaped beating of Rodney King, the police Department's
program to install its own video cameras in every police car began
with great promise but now lies in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, only 25 to 30 cameras of the 36 installed in
1993 are even working. And most beat officers don't know how to use
them because there are so few, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There's still no official policy on use and storage. The program
also has a long history of being ignored, critics assert.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, patrol officers like John Smith feel the
frustration, as on one recent afternoon as he struggled to get his
camera to work in suburban North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He played with the lens, fiddled with wires, tried to adjust the
camera's mount and tapped on a small video monitor. Still, it
wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are all falling apart, and the program has been
tied up in red tape for years,'' said Smith, who was instrumental
in getting the pilot program started. ``I hope the department does
something about this soon. We're losing out on a great way to
protect officers and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommended by the Christopher Commission after the March 1991
beating of King -- captured on videotape by a bystander -- the
cameras were touted as a cure-all for police misconduct because
they could help collect evidence, keep officers honest and resolve
conflicts between officers and residents. They also would save
millions of dollars in court costs, litigation and officer
misconduct claims, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the surviving cameras from the pilot program have proved
their value, recording incriminating comments from suspects inside
police cars and sending people to jail who made false accusations
of police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   But as far back as 1996, Los Angeles Police Department officials
reported to the Police Commission that the program was not meeting
its goals. Many cameras were broken and weren't being used
effectively, according to the report filed that year.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the manufacturer went out of business, so
replacement parts were difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   The commission at that time ordered LAPD brass to take immediate
steps to get the program back on track. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take is that the administration has instituted all of the
negative Christopher Commission recommendations against officers
and none of the positive stuff that would help them,'' said
Detective Gary Fullerton, a director of the Los Angeles Police
Protective League.
</P>
<P>
   Top police administrators concede the cameras have not been a
priority, but they say the push has been renewed under Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program should have been pursued much more aggressively
in the past,'' said LAPD Capt. Dan Koenig. ``Our responsibility now
is to do this and ensure that tax dollars are used wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief Parks has made the program a high priority, and he wants
them to be installed in units as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a new $7 million plan, the entire 1,170-car fleet will be
equipped by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD officials say cameras will be standard equipment in all new
police cars, and they could employ compact-disc technology instead
of videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go quickly, we're looking at a June rollout date,''
Koenig said. ``If we decide to go with CD technology, it could take
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say they aren't optimistic, especially if the
department's 1993 pilot program is any indication of what's to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration didn't make this a priority in the past,
and it should have been done a long time ago,'' Fullerton said.
`I'm very disappointed the department didn't go forward with this
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent high-profile case, the cameras helped convict
a North Hollywood apartment manager of manslaughter in 1997 after
he shot and killed a fleeing burglary suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The camera didn't record the shooting, but when Smith arrived in
his video-equipped patrol car he recorded the gunman, showing him
``visibly excited and highly agitated,'' a judge said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem for any police agency is getting at the
truth. If there's a dozen people at a scene, everyone has a
different story about what happened,'' Koenig said. ``It could be
differences in perception or their stories could be self-serving.
But the tape doesn't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The cameras also have captured officers' inappropriate behavior.
In 1994, Smith used his patrol car to nudge the bicycle of a drug
dealer who was refusing to stop.
</P>
<P>
   He thought the tactic was reasonable, but a supervisor saw the
tape and gave him a verbal reprimand. Smith accepted his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened, and I accepted the reprimand,'' he said. ``The
point is that if an officer -- and there are some bad ones out
there -- is being taped, he'll probably think twice before doing
something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's supervisor, Capt. Richard Wahler, said there has been a
misconception in the past that officers are concerned the cameras
will catch them in misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is the officers would love this technology,'' Wahler
said. ``They'll welcome any new technology that will help protect
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Police union leaders insist the lack of video cameras and
failure of the program is by design. It took no time for the LAPD
to create a system to track officer discipline history, Fullerton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the Christopher Commission's 120 recommendations
that would benefit officers, like periodic psychological
evaluations and the video cameras, have yet to see the light of
day.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig said the LAPD is now closer to action than it has ever
been. But there's still a catch.
</P>
<P>
   If the city decides to stick with video, it will send out bids
and start installing cameras in new squad cars by June, Koenig
said. At that rate, the entire fleet will have them by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But if the city decides to explore compact-disc technology, it
will have to ask companies to send proposals for different system
configurations -- taking the red tape back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to weigh the wait vs. the benefit,'' Koenig said.
``But if CD technology would be far greater than video, it might be
worth the wait.''

DON'T TELL THE NETS THIS ONE DIDN'T COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It will not count in the standings, and
in a few days no one will remember that it happened. But the Nets
will not belittle their 92-90 exhibition victory Friday night over
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   While they were not celebrating festively after the game, the
Nets were smiling and feeling good about themselves. To them, it
meant something. Not bragging rights until they meet for real, but
something.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Gill, who scored 14 points and sank a huge 3-pointer
from 25 feet in the fourth quarter, talked about the game as if it
were a midseason battle that had playoff repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the real thing,'' Gill said. ``You have everybody
hitting big shots and making free throws. You had the drama, the
cross-river rivalry. They beat us at their place and we beat them
at ours. I guess that's the way it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have started as a typical exhibition game, where
conditioning and execution were the chief concerns, but some time
before the half it became a battle that neither team wanted to
lose. There were bumps, flagrant fouls and the arguing of
officials' calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks wanted it just as badly as the Nets, but the Nets had
more at stake: it was their home court. The Knicks had edged them
by 88-87 on a free throw in the final moments in Wednesday's
exhibition at Madison Square Garden, and Friday night it was the
Nets' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get a win,'' said Nets Coach John Calipari, whose
club was led by Keith Van Horn's game-high 33 points. ``It doesn't
matter if it's preseason. You just want to get a win to get the
feeling of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets got that feeling when Chris Gatling scored the last of
his 18 points on a perfectly executed play with 21.3 seconds left.
Gatling, who exhibited a soft outside touch and smooth hook shot,
received a pass into the post from Lucious Harris, executed a spin
move and put in a jump hook.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley, who had played a physical style all night, fouled
Gatling, who hit the free throw to put the Nets ahead by 92-90. The
Knicks' two last-gasp 3-point attempts fell short.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had battled the Knicks throughout the game, just as
they have been battling injuries during the preseason. During
halftime Friday, Van Horn began complaining about spasms in his
left thigh. He tried to stretch and tried to play the third
quarter, but ended up hobbling to the Nets' locker room less than a
minute into the half.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Calipari was beginning to lament over yet another
injury to one of his players, Van Horn emerged from the trainer's
room with a smooth gait. Van Horn's injury was not serious, just a
cramped thigh.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the 6-foot-10-inch power forward returning to the
game with 6 minutes 39 seconds remaining in the third quarter was
more gratifying than the minor feelings of accomplishment that came
from this meaningless victory.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who sank a 12-foot jump shot 24 seconds after
re-entering, was outstanding in his first preseason game. After
missing three days of practice and Wednesday's contest against the
Knicks with food poisoning that took six pounds off his bulked-up
frame, he showed no loss of strength or finesse on powerful moves
to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn scored 17 of his points from the free-throw line. He
appeared rusty early in the game as he missed eight of his first
nine shots, but midway through the second period his game returned.
</P>
<P>
   A serious injury to Van Horn would have been enough to send
Calipari into a deep depression. Training camp has been more like
basic training at the club's Champion Center, as numerous Nets
players have pulled up lame since training camps officially began
eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles (bruised right knee) and Rony Seikaly (sprained
left ankle) sat out Friday's game and are not expected to return
for a few weeks, and Jayson Williams and Sam Cassell played
sparingly because of aches and pains. Williams, the hardy
rebounder, played only 16 minutes because of a sore right ankle he
turned Wednesday night _ he still grabbed nine rebounds _ and
Cassell, who has back spasms, was on the floor for only 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Nets' starting five was together for only 39
games, as Van Horn, Williams and Cassell missed key stretches with
an assortment of ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets proved their resiliency in making the playoffs, and
Friday night they showed that they have not lost that trait. With
Eric Murdock and Lucious Harris playing the guard spots for most of
the night, and Van Horn (nine rebounds) doing his best to make up
for Williams' absence on the boards, the Nets took the Knicks to
the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Knicks played all but seven minutes without
Patrick Ewing, who sprained his right knee. And the reserves Marcus
Camby (blister) and Dennis Scott (hamstring) missed the entire
game. But the Nets' casualties were probably more critical.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the Nets matched JAYSON WILLIAMS' $20,000
contribution to Continental Arena employees who lost money during
the seven-month lockout, bringing the total to $40,000.

THE VOLVO IN FORD'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest (but surely not the last) auto merger, with Ford
Motor Co. buying up Sweden's Volvo AB, poses an interesting
challenge for Ford: how to make it appear that the event has not
taken place. The world's second-largest auto maker cannot afford to
deprive Volvo of an essential characteristic: its uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely corporate perspective, the deal makes sense.
Volvo, for all its appeal as the builder of cars with high quality,
tasteful design, and good driving characteristics, was doomed by
its small size to an inferior position when competing with
American, European, and Japanese behemoths in an intensely
competitive industry. Speculation on some form of merger for Volvo
has piqued the financial markets for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Ford can use its great size to provide efficiencies that will
make Volvo more competitive and innovative in ways that will be
essentially invisible to consumers. It has taken an important first
step by saying it intends to treat Volvo as an autonomous operation
in Sweden _ much as it has done with its earlier acquisition of
another distinguished car maker, Britain's Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Current markets impose heavy burdens on auto makers worldwide.
Collectively they can turn out 60 million cars a year, but people
are buying only 50 million. Lower production costs are essential in
such circumstances to allow for more competitive pricing. The road
to those lower costs runs through consolidation so development and
capital costs can be spread over the broadest possible production
base. In such an environment, small may be beautiful, but it is no
guarantee of success _ even when small consists of building 400,000
cars a year, as Volvo does.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has more than 70 years' experience in Europe, where it
account for 10 percent of auto sales. This deal requires a
fascinating combination of the brute strength provided by Ford's
sheer size and the delicacy needed to maintain an operation with
Volvo's special identity.

THE LAST WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mayoral appointee in Washington, D.C., has lost his job
because he used the word ``niggardly'' to describe a budget he
administered. Any dictionary will show that the word means miserly,
parsimonious, stingy, or tight-fisted and has nothing whatever to
do with the unacceptable racial slur except that it starts with the
same four letters. Will the word ``niggling,'' as in, ``I have a
niggling suspicion that racial sensitivity has run amok in this
land,'' be next on the list of forbidden words?
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary, the foremost authority on
derivations of the language, notes that niggardly has obscure
origins but may be Scandinavian or Old French. It does not share
root words or other etymological connections with the racial slur,
which, like Negro and Nigeria, derives from ``nigrum,'' the Latin
word for black.
</P>
<P>
   These simple facts seemed not to matter to the cabal that called
for the ouster of the offending mayoral aide, David Howard, who
happens to be white. The newly elected mayor, Anthony Williams, who
happens to be black, was already under pressure from some black
activists who thought he was appointing too few people of color.
When Howard's comment started rumors _ completely unproved _ that
he had uttered the other N-word, Williams was only too relieved to
accept his aide's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   What Williams should have done is stand up for Howard, the
facts, and the English language, which is the envy of the world for
its richness and nuance. Poets and essayists have used niggardly or
a variation since Chaucer's time because it was just the word they
needed to convey their intent precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this from Samuel Richardson's ``Pamela,'' widely
believed to be the first English novel: ``What is my single
happiness if I suffer it, niggard-like, to extend no further than
to myself?''
</P>
<P>
   It is sad to think that a brave word could die from disuse
because of ignorance compounded by hair-trigger sensitivities,
leaving a vision that extends no farther than oneself. It's a view
of the world that is downright _ well, you know.

A POISED AND POTENT HINGIS GETS 3RD TITLE IN ROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TEN-AUSTRALIA) 
(js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Martina Hingis has a Rebound Ace court at
home in Switzerland, and perhaps that explains why she is equally
at home on that same surface here on Centre Court at the Australian
Open.
</P>
<P>
   One day after winning her third consecutive women's doubles
title in Melbourne, the Swiss teen-ager on Saturday won her third
consecutive women's singles title by defeating the unseeded
Frenchwoman, Amelie Mauresmo, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   It was a most convincing victory, accomplished in just over an
hour, and though Mauresmo saved six match points in the final game
of the match, Hingis' potent cocktail of baseline accuracy,
all-court coverage and tactical flexibility lent an air of
inevitability to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The two had played twice before, and on both occasions, Hingis
had won in three sets: first in the Fed Cup semifinals in
Switzerland in July and then in the third round of the U.S. Open in
September.
</P>
<P>
   But this encounter came on a much larger stage, and Hingis'
victory gave her a fifth Grand Slam singles title at age 18. She
has now won 21 singles matches in a row at Melbourne Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just played some awesome tennis, and it just brings some
good luck to me,'' the second-seeded Hingis said of the year's
first Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the kangaroo doll given to winners in Melbourne,
she said, ``that's six in a row, it's a real family.''
</P>
<P>
   The only set Hingis dropped in singles this year came in the
fourth round against 16th-seeded Amanda Coetzer. Her other
victories were utterly convincing, and it appears that her renewed
focus on her tennis has lifted her game in the first part of the
year. After losing to Lindsay Davenport in the final of the
tournament in Sydney that preceded the Australian Open, she never
got the chance for a rematch in Melbourne because Mauresmo upset
Davenport in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The French 19-year-old, who was the world's top-ranked junior in
1996, was not as poised or precise Saturday, but she will now jump
from 29th to at least 18th in the world rankings. Hingis will stay
at No. 2 behind Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can continue playing like this the whole year too.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a cool, breezy day, more like spring in Paris or Zurich
than summer in Australia, when Hingis and Mauresmo walked on Centre
Court together and posed for the customary pre-final photographs at
the net.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is 14 months younger than Mauresmo, Hingis has been
playing important matches in this evocative stadium for much
longer, but the reception for both players as they were introduced
was equally warm.
</P>
<P>
   The first set would quickly become a less balanced affair. The
French teenager looked understandably nervous in the opening game,
making two unforced errors off her forehand wing and
double-faulting to lose her serve. Hingis then took a 2-0 lead when
Mauresmo overhit a backhand which she was poorly positioned to
strike with such force.
</P>
<P>
   Judgment would prove a problem throughout the set for Mauresmo,
who often seemed to be guiding her groundstrokes, instead of
letting her racquet move freely through the ball. But then Hingis,
a power thinker instead of power player, knows how to get the worst
out of her opponents, and she had decided that the path to victory
lay along the backhand diagonal.
</P>
<P>
   While Mauresmo was occasionally able to overwhelm the Swiss from
the baseline or force her into awkward positions with her heavy
topspin, she was unable to sustain such shotmaking, and Hingis
broke her again in the seventh game and then served out the set.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Hingis formidable is her versatility. She is often
forced into the role of counterpuncher because of the taller,
stronger players, like Davenport and Venus Williams and Mary Pierce
who are now her primary challengers. But Hingis has not won the
last five Grand Slam titles in women's doubles (with three
different partners) by coincidence. She is very comfortable at the
net, and in the opening game of the second set, she proved it,
getting a break point with a lovely forehand drop volley and
getting the break with a crisp forehand volley crosscourt. Her
approach shots do not have the bite of Jana Novotna's, but the
element of surprise works in her favor, and by now it looked like
Mauresmo's first Grand Slam singles final would be a brief
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauresmo righted herself in the next game, taking a 0-40
advantage on Hingis' serve. Though the Swiss got back to deuce with
some more aggressive play, Mauresmo would hold firm for her first
break of the match.
</P>
<P>
   They would exchange breaks again to 3-3, but after Hingis broke
Mauresmo yet again in the seventh game, the French player would
prove incapable of returning the favor. She took a 0-40 lead, but
Hingis reeled off five consecutive points to go up 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   She soon had her first match point on Mauresmo's serve, but she
would need nearly seven more minutes to close out the championship,
as Mauresmo saved six match points, often with winners or forceful
shots. When Mauresmo saved the sixth with a backhand volley winner,
the increasingly frustrated Hingis leaned forward and shrieked in
the direction of the court that has been so good to her.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauresmo would miss her next two volleys into the net, and
Hingis raised her arms in the air and threw her racquets into the
crowd. She has won three Australian Opens, one Wimbledon and one
U.S. Open singles titles. All that she is missing is the French
Open. Perhaps it's time she ripped up the Rebound Ace in
Switzerland and replaced it with red clay.

<P>
   In its 5-4 ruling against the use of statistical sampling during
the next US census, the Supreme Court has imposed a heavy burden on
Congress and the Clinton administration to provide enough resources
to allow for the most aggressive head count possible. Even with
that head count, it is certain that thousands of people will go
uncounted, disproportionately the urban poor and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling, which did not turn on the constitutional
phrase ``actual enumeration,'' did approve use of statistical
sampling for purposes other than the apportionment of congressional
seats. Equity demands that Congress take advantage of this method
to make the fairest possible distribution of federal aid,
especially since undercounting tends to be highest among those most
in need of support.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer, in his dissent, made arguments for
statistical adjustments that may yet carry the day if the court is
asked to test the issue on constitutional grounds. Statistical
adjustments, he contends, ``would not substitute for, but rather
would supplement, a traditional head count and would do so to
achieve the basic purpose of the statutes that authorize the head
count _ namely, accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer took note of the fact that the Census Bureau has for
decades used some estimating techniques to improve census accuracy
_ notably the ``imputation'' of the number of residents in houses
where no one answers requests for information. This has the
misfortune of possibly over-counting wealthier households with more
than one dwelling and undercounting poorer ones, but it establishes
the principle of making common-sense adjustments to counts that
would otherwise be even less accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Counting 270 million or more noses in the year 2000 will not be
easy, but using a medley of techniques can produce a satisfactory
and useful result _ provided the Census Bureau is given enough
tools and enough personnel. The burden is now on Congress and the
administration.

   It would be nearly impossible to explain to a foreigner just
what Super Bowl Sunday is all about. The game plans concocted by
the coaches appear as intricate as the derivatives portfolio of a
high-flying hedge fund. Their terminology has followed psychobabble
and management-speak into dank caves of pretentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   But complexities of the bomb and the blitz are much easier to
elucidate than the anthropological meaning of this American ritual.
Why does everybody watch the game? What is it about this one
sporting event that induces a national communion? Why are the fates
of great corporations shaped by the commercials they sponsor on the
Super Bowl telecast?
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might say that the secret of Super Sunday, the reason
for the impassioning frenzy of fans and casual spectators alike, is
the genius of the point spread. In a society predicated upon the
investment ethic and the spirit of capitalism, there is no other
contest _ not even the Kentucky Derby _ that attracts so much
wagering. For one splendid Sunday, every citizen seems to have a
few bob riding on the outcome of the same game. As a Runyonesque
character once said: The greatest thing in life is to gamble and
win, and the next best is to gamble and lose.
</P>
<P>
   But an intelligent foreigner would still want to know why
America's heterodox population agrees to make such a fuss about
this one oversold, overpublicized televised sports program. Sad to
say, the best answer may be precisely that nobody wants to miss
what everyone is expected to see. In other words: Hype works.
</P>
<P>
   It would be dispiriting, however, to admit to a curious
outlander that we Americans are a society of hustlers and marks.
For some nations there is no indignity greater than being duped.
</P>
<P>
   Better to dwell on the balletic beauty of Denver Bronco blockers
knocking Falcons off their feet so Terrell Davis can cut back
against the flow of the defense. Under all the salesmanship is a
game both simple and subtle that has become, for many, the true
national pastime.

   A cheer went up from the couch last week with publication of the
latest exercise studies in the Journal of the American Medical
Association. The articles concluded that for the sedentary
individual, simple changes in lifestyle _ climbing the stairs
instead of taking the elevator, walking instead of driving, just
vacuuming the house _ are as beneficial as health club workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The report went straight to the truth of most health research:
People hate to exercise. Never mind the masochists on the rowing
machines and the runners in the rain; the average person would
rather do almost anything than put another ``have-to'' on the
schedule, especially if it involves heavy equipment and expensive
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The JAMA studies, while not intended to, have fed the fantasies
of people longing for the science that will tell them that staying
healthy is easy. They're figuring that if researchers are saying
it's OK to incorporate exercise into the daily routine and skip the
trip to the gym, then surely the study is not far off that finds
that punching a TV clicker vigorously from a prone position while
doing leg lifts is a respectable way to burn off the calories in
the bowl of chips on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with exercise is that it's such a long-term
proposition. It lacks the sizzle of instant gratification, the quid
pro quo that says, ``You sweat, now you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider how well that concept might work in a restaurant
aerobics room where patrons planning to indulge could pay up front,
calorically, so they might enjoy the rest of the evening with the
``No-Guilt Gourmet.'' A chef might even wheel the dessert cart
through the predinner exercise session to inspire another set of
jumping jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing stores could also cash in on a preshopping workout
area, where consumers would burn off pounds and more easily suck in
the gut before facing the dressing room mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting calisthetics directly with the temptations and goals
of life would make workouts more compelling. The sit-ups wouldn't
be any easier, but they'd sure seem that way.

UNFAIR FEES FOR WOULD-BE CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, February 1, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Money has become a bigger barrier to becoming a United States
citizen. On Jan. 15 the federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service raised the application fee for becoming a citizen from $95
to $225. In October the INS raised a host of other fees.
</P>
<P>
   The agency argues that the increases are needed because fees
didn't cover costs. It estimates that it is losing $17 million a
month, and fees haven't increased since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This argument makes sense within reason, but some of the
increases are unreasonably high. For example, the fee for a
petition to classify an orphan as a relative _ for international
adoptions _ went from $155 to $405. A husband and wife who want to
become citizens have to pay $500 _ $450 in application fees and $25
apiece for fingerprinting, a fee that went into effect last March.
</P>
<P>
   These fees have more than doubled in some cases for a
notoriously slow service that is making only modest improvements.
The INS has a backlog of 1.8 million citizenship cases _ down from
a high of 1.9 million _ and it can take two years or more for forms
to be processed.
</P>
<P>
   Over a year ago, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner promised that
the citizenship fee would not increase until the service was more
efficient. In early 1998 the average wait was 27 months. As of last
December it was 23 months. The INS hopes to reduce the wait to 12
months by the end of September and to six months a year after that.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the long delay and the new high prices threaten
low-income immigrants because national welfare reform has changed
the rules. Legal aliens are no longer eligible for such safety net
programs as food stamps and Social Security assistance. Some states
have stepped in to replace some of these programs. But in many
cases, immigrants get less money or must meet residency
requirements that exclude them.
</P>
<P>
   The INS should be able to cover its costs. But its sharply
higher fees unfairly pose sudden obstacles with only the
possibility of far-off improvements. America should embrace
qualified new citizens, not shackle them with burdensome fees
before they ever take the oath.

TOP LINE IS GOLDEN FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The worst team in the NHL put a scare into the
Stars last night _ one that was eventually overcome by the line of
Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   After the trio had a hand in three goals in the Stars' 4-1
victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning, coach Ken Hitchcock said
the team can't continue to rely solely on its top line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What won the game was talent,'' Hitchcock said. ``Our talented
players came to play tonight, but I thought some of our players
really struggled.'' Modano had a goal and an assist, Hull a goal
and an assist and Lehtinen two assists to help the Stars overcome a
slow start and push their league-best record to 29-9-7. The
Lightning fell to a league-worst 11-32-4, but didn't play that way
as they slammed bodies from the opening drop of the puck, scored
first on a power play and played inspired hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come out East and play teams once, when you're No. 1,
they're going to throw everything they've got at you,'' Hitchcock
said. ``It took us too long to wade into the game, far too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing under the experimental two-referee system, the first
period was wrought with eight penalty calls by officials Lance
Roberts and Brad Watson. That created problems for the Stars, as
they couldn't get their power play going and gave up an early goal
on the penalty kill.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning winger Wendel Clark deflected in a Petr Svoboda shot
at the 1-minute, 52-second mark of the first period, and the Stars
were climbing up a hill. On their way up, they also had to battle a
rugged effort from the Lightning, which recorded 31 hits to the
Stars' 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really came out hard and we were lucky we came out of the
period down just one,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars quickly made up that deficit when Modano, after
weaving through the slot, pushed home his own rebound 30 seconds
into the second period. Lightning replacement goalie Corey Schwab,
who relieved starter Bill Ranford in the first period after Ranford
suffered a cervical sprain, made some critical saves, but he
couldn't stop Hull and Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Hull then notched the game-winner, his team-leading 18th goal,
when Modano skated in hard on the forecheck, whipped a pass out of
the corner and found Hull in the slot. Hull lifted a slap shot
under the crossbar, which Schwab never saw and it was 2-1 at the
10:38 mark of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour performed magic in between, stopping 31
shots, including two without his stick. Belfour made a chest save
on Stephane Richer and then gloved the rebound shot off the stick
of Brent Peterson to freeze the puck at a time when the Lightning
looked dangerously close to seizing control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie played a great game,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen then set up Sergei Zubov for an insurance goal at the
7:27 mark of the third period, and the Lightning ran out of gas.
Hatcher earned his seventh goal of the season to complete the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But while the final score made it look like an easy Stars
victory, Hitchcock said the team has to play better at 6:30 tonight
when they visit the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who put us on our heels were our people, who should
be putting the other people on their heels,'' Hitchcock said of his
third and fourth lines. ``And it's going to be the same thing
against Florida. They've been sitting there two, three days getting
revved up for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the Panthers 3-0-1 since acquiring winger Pavel Bure in
a trade, Hitchcock will be sure to ask more from the Stars tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll get an earful of it,'' Modano said.

<P>
   DALLAS _ Mike Miller of Albuquerque, N.M., had the first-place
seed all but locked up before the position round of match play even
began at the Don Carter Professional Bowlers Association Classic
last night.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the only touring bowler with a thumbless delivery,
defeated Jason Couch in the final match-play game, 238-216, to keep
himself atop the field of 24 with a total pin count of 10,453at Don
Carter's All Star Lanes-West. Miller, who led the tournament since
game 13 of match play, dominated the field with a match-play record
of 20-3-1 _ a record Couch called ``unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The best match-play record in PBA history is 22-2, earned by
George Pappas in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get anxious in a situation like that,'' said
Miller of match play. ``You're ahead, things are going well and you
want sometimes for things to be over. I tried to be patient tonight
and let myself enjoy the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Couch, who finished third with 10,248 pins, are
joined by David Wodka, second at 10,250, Roger Bowker, fourth at
10,172 and Jason Hurd at 10,133 on the stepladder finals at 3 p.m.
today, which will be taped by ESPN and televised at 1:30 p.m.
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose last title came in Wichita in 1992, said this
tournament marks a comeback that has been building during the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years have been brutal,'' Miller said. ``I
had my head beat in week after week after week. It helps to have a
tournament like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller won't be the only player in the top five with something
to prove. Wodka, who moved past Couch by two pins with his
position-round victory against Bowker, has made six television
shows but has never won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping this will be the one,'' Wodka said. ``I'm going to
be loose, that's for sure. I won't lose because I'm tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch, who has five titles, has never won a tournament from any
position but the top seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to prove to myself that I can win from any position,''
Couch said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he liked his chances from the top seed. Of the two
titles he holds, he won one from the top seed and another from
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was on television \Rin November\S, I went out
there and I didn't play the lanes properly,'' Miller said. ``So,
\Rtoday\S, I'm going to look and see what's going on and make my
decisions more prudently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do what you can do and let God take care of the
rest.''

MAVS OPEN WALKER BIDDING AT $5 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks tendered a contract offer to power
forward Samaki Walker yesterday for four years and $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   But snags may be forthcoming, because Walker said he is seeking
a long-term contract in the neighborhood of $7 million to $8
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five million? I don't think so,'' Walker said when asked
whether he will sign for $5 million per season. ``I'm looking at a
lot of guys out there now that I know I've been able to accomplish
a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's ahead for Samaki Walker, and I think the
Mavericks do, too. If they want me here, I think we'll get a fair
deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said he wants the
6-foot-9, 258-pounder in the fold. But at what price?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd like to be here,'' Nelson said. ``It really just
depends on if the numbers can be worked out, and what he has in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we made him a very fair proposal. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has given teams until March 13 to sign players who will
be entering their third season and approaching free-agency status
after the 1999 season. Walker, who turns 23 on Feb. 25, falls in
this category.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said it won't be difficult for him to stay in Dallas if
he doesn't sign a contract by March 13. But if he isn't signed by
then, the Mavericks can't discuss a contract with him again until
July 1, when he becomes a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll give me a chance to go out and really prove myself
even more, which means it's a 50-50 situation,'' Walker said,
referring to if he misses the cutoff date. ``You can go out and
have a hell of a season, or you can go out and have a disastrous
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Walker's injury problems played a role in the
Mavericks' offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our kind of guy, a great guy, and perfect in the locker
room,'' Nelson said. ``There's only one thing. He's been
injury-prone from college all the way into his first two years
here. There's the physical things that we have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker missed the final 40 games last season because of a stress
fracture of his right foot. As a rookie two years ago, he missed 34
games with various injuries, including a loose bone chip in his
right foot and a second-degree sprain of his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Late in practice yesterday, Walker sprained his right ankle when
he was accidentally stepped on by center Shawn Bradley. He limped
off the court and is questionable for the preseason game against
the Phoenix Suns tonight at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Mavericks' highest-paid players are Bradley and guard
Michael Finley. Bradley played one season at Brigham Young and
signed an eight-year, $44.2 million contract with the Philadelphia
76ers after spending two years on a Mormon mission.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is in the first year of a five-year, $42 million contract
extension he signed before last season.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who had eight double-doubles last season, said he's not
asking for Bradley or Finley money. ``I'm not trying to compete
with Finley's contract,'' he said. ``I'm looking for the fairness
for Samaki Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finley is the straw here, he's established. If I'm going to be
the sidekick and the guy that's going to also be the foundation and
focus of this team, then that'll show.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker averaged 11 points and 8.4 rebounds and shot .504 from
the field in the 26 games he played last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make this a big rivalry between myself and the
Mavericks,'' Walker said. ``I want to get a deal done as soon as
possible, but I want it to be as fair as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the game is definitely won inside-out. And if
you've got a guy that can average a double-double night in and
night out, they should be rewarded for it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's top national security advisers
decided Friday that the United States should commit several
thousand ground troops to an international force in Kosovo to
monitor any eventual cease-fire there, according to administration
officials and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were promoting the plan around Capitol
Hill on Friday before discussing it with Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the United States and its allies, meeting in
London, on Friday ordered the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and leaders of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo to
sit down to a tight schedule of peace talks. NATO is expected to
vote on Saturday to authorize air strikes against the Serbs if they
do not agree to a political settlement of autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative plan, as outlined by administration and
congressional officials, would involve 2,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops
in a NATO force of more than 20,000 ground troops to monitor a
cease-fire in the separatist province of Kosovo, which has been
torn by warfare. Those troops could remain in Kosovo for as long as
three years under one of the proposals, according to a
congressional official.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the French and the British announced that they
would send ground troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case the administration is making is to say the Europeans
can't handle this themselves,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
``The larger question is whether we should commit troops. They want
to commit, but the mood of my colleagues is extremely skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   More meetings are scheduled through the weekend to refine
details of a possible NATO air strike and of the components of a
NATO ground force that would enforce a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect of another troop commitment in the Balkans,
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the new chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said he gave his full support to the
administration's plans when the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, telephoned him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where we have no choice but to commit
ground troops, and I'll have to lead that effort to convince the
Senate,'' said Warner, who added that he had been urging the
administration for weeks to make such a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made an enormous investment in Bosnia,'' he said, ``A
continuing destabilized Kosovo will put our people at risk and
bring to a halt the creeping progress being made there.''
</P>
<P>
   In this effort, the White House and congressional Republicans
have said they would prefer to have U.S. troops under U.S. command
within NATO, as has been the practice in the past in many
instances. But Pentagon officials indicated that they would be
willing to have a smaller role in the Kosovo effort, and allow
Europeans to command the NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong meeting Friday, the president's senior advisers
also discussed the immediate problem of how to persuade the two
warring parties in Kosovo to accept a cease-fire, according to P.J.
Crowley, spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   There are 700 unarmed monitors operating under the auspices of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on patrol
now in Kosovo. They will be especially vulnerable to being taken
hostage or being attacked during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But according to an administration official, the monitors could
be removed from the region within eight hours in the event of a
decision to carry out air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Kosovo continued unabated Friday. In Rogovo more
than 24 ethnic Albanians were found shot. Serbs said they had
raided a guerrilla group, but the ethnic Albanians said most of the
dead were civilians. Monitors said it appeared that the killings
were in revenge for the shooting of a Serbian policeman by the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern was behind the massacre at Racak two weeks
ago, where 45 ethnic Albanians were shot at close range by Serbian
forces after the Kosovo Liberation Army killed four Serbian police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition of such attacks, with the Serbian forces having
far superior weapons and numbers of policemen and soldiers, pushed
the NATO allies into seeking a speedy solution and backing it up
with the threat of force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was not impressed with the bombing proposals
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that the kind of air strikes that are being
contemplated would convince Milosevic to sign a cease-fire,'' he
said. ``They are not strong enough or sustained enough to inflict
significant damage on Milosevic's military capability.``
</P>
<P>
   The administration plans to formally present its plans for
troops to Congress once the president agrees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seven senators sent the president a letter Friday urging that
the United States, in concert with NATO, take military action
against Milosevic. It was signed by Evan Bayh of Indiana, Bob
Graham of Florida, Charles Robb of Virginia, Dianne Feinstein of
California, and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, all Democrats; and
by Richard Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, both
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The letter warned that a delay in action ``may result in more
innocent civilian casualties and in the questioning of NATO's
ability to preserve peace in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But those sentiments will be challenged by other senators who
remember the administration's earlier promises that the
peacekeeping effort in Bosnia, begun after the signing of the
Dayton accord, would have a definite ending _ a promise that was
repeated twice but has yet to be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton accords, will not
take part in the coming talks on Kosovo in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials say Holbrooke has been heavily
involved in helping shape U.S. policy in response to the recent
crisis in Kosovo, even as he has struggled to reach a settlement
with the Justice Department to end an ethics investigation that has
sidetracked his nomination to the position of chief delegate to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, Dick has been an important participant _
at least by phone _ in every major conversation on this subject
over the last two weeks,'' a senior administration official said.
``That cell phone is glued to his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they know of no plans for
Holbrooke, who is as close to Milosevic as anyone in the
administration, to travel to Belgrade to deliver an ultimatum. But
they say it is an option that will be considered if NATO gets much
closer to a military strike against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who lives in New York, where he is vice chairman of
the investment banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston, was
traveling Friday in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on private
business. Friends said he had no immediate plans to travel to the
Balkans and was expected back in the United States this weekend.

MISSING CANINE HELPER RETURNS TO DISABLED OWNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN and JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Five days of anguish ended in elation for Jeff
Horny when he was reunited with Tyler the golden retriever, his
companion and assistant for years.
</P>
<P>
   The dog somehow wandered off Monday from Horny's home on Blix
Street in suburban North Hollywood, leaving the quadriplegic
heartbroken and unable to perform many of the tasks that Tyler had
made possible.
</P>
<P>
   The reddish canine picks up Horny's keys, turns on lights and
even opens doors -- which is what the dog apparently did Monday
inside his home before wandering off through a gate that was left
ajar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Horny said after Friday's reunion. ``I'm going
to appreciate him much more, because you don't appreciate things
until they are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of speechless. I'm not going to let him leave my bed
because I'm going to sleep for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   First, however, Tyler will get a steak dinner, and Horny will
call off the bloodhounds -- literally.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Horny's dog had drawn national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathetic to his story, a producer from the TV show ``Extra''
was helping find a way to pay for a pet-tracking bloodhound named
Luca to search for Tyler. American Airlines donated a ticket to fly
the tracking dog and his handler from Dallas to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyler, it turns out, had trotted about three miles to North
Hollywood Park, where he befriended two teen-agers and followed
them home.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the mother of one of the teens saw a story about the
lost dog on television and got in touch with Horny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that we found the owner,'' said Connie Smith, whose
17-year-old son, Patrick, and his girlfriend found Tyler in North
Hollywood Park on Monday. ``We could have taken him to the dog
pound shelter, but we wanted to find the owner because the dog
looked very well taken care of and was very lovable. It wasn't just
any old dog.''
</P>
<P>
   First thing today, Horny said, Tyler will start wearing a tag
with his owner's name and phone number, which should have been done
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's priceless to me,'' the 26-year-old man said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescued about seven years ago off a freeway near San Antonio,
Texas, Tyler was professionally trained to assist disabled people.
The retriever was selected a few years later to pair up with Horny,
who broke his neck in a car crash caused by black ice on a Texas
roadway in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Horny, an actor, spent years training Tyler to do what most
people consider ordinary tasks, such as turning lights on and off,
opening doors, pulling away chairs for him and retrieving items
that he has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll grab whatever he can to get it to me,'' Horny said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler retrieves his owner's wheelchair if it slips away from him
as he gets into his vehicle, and also pulls his owner up small
hills.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's work gives Horny his independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to call someone to pick up my keys,'' he said.
``If I needed help up a ramp, I don't have to get somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The canine also travels with Horny in his sport-utility vehicle
to go to work auditions, run errands and eat at restaurants. He
flies with him on vacations and visits schools to educate children
about disabled populations.
</P>
<P>
   When his buddy was missing, Horny notified animal control
officials, most kennels in his neighborhood and the Los Angeles
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very important to him because he helps him out,'' said
Officer John Catalano of the North Hollywood Division.
</P>
<P>
   Horny's father, Ben Horny, flew in from Texas on Thursday night
and spent most of Friday tacking up more than 400 lost-dog fliers
around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm posting them every place I can find a tree, an empty hand
-- even the homeless,'' Ben Horny said during the search.
</P>
<P>
   Several people called to report they saw Tyler roaming the
streets blocks away from his home, his owner said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tyler has left his yard to nose around the alley
before, he had never run away, said Horny, adding: ``I don't think
he was meaning to leave. He's always sniffing around.''

   KOSOVO-TALKS (Paris) _ By summoning the fighting parties in

three years ago. By Jane Perlez.

   COLOMBIA-QUAKE (Armenia, Colombia) _ Desperate survivors of
Colombia's deadly earthquake raided relief centers and stores in
the battered provincial capital of Armenia on Friday, as security
forces struggled to stop a third day of looting. Thousands of

   SCHIZOPHRENIA-COPE (New York) _ Schizophrenia afflicts an
estimated 2.7 million Americans. It is an illness notable for its
laceration of consciousness, and for the terrible isolation it
imposes on sufferers. It also exacts a severe toll from family
members who often can do little but watch helplessly. The public,
however, usually hears about schizophrenia only in the context of
lurid headlines. And sensational news coverage reenforces the
mistaken belief that violence frequently accompanies the illness.

condemned capital punishment during his pastoral visit here, the

scholars to gather to start celebrating the 50th anniversary of her

week, they debated Beauvoir with a mixture of joy and reverence,
and at the end, their unsurprising conclusion was that ``The Second

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Whether it's inventing swear words on the
freeway or driving the lane, getting there with a stylish pair of
wheels is crucial in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Lakers will travel the road to what they
hope will be their next NBA championship on the back of a Diesel.
In a garage across town, the Clippers have decided to chug down the
road to respectability behind the wheel of a Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The roads intersected Friday at the Forum, where the overhauled
Diesel Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers ripped new coach Chris Ford
and the Clippers, 107-76, in a post-lockout friendly in front of a
non-paying 14,042.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the Lakers looked like a title work in progress,
while the Clippers just looked for any progress they could muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope your presence will make the situation better,'' said
Ford, the former Boston and Milwaukee coach whose presence looked
dandy when Clippers forward Lamond Murray opened this two-game
exhibition set by making two jumpers. ``We may struggle a bit
early.''
</P>
<P>
   And how.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-19 Lakers first quarter, the only Clippers points not
scored by Murray were contributed on two free throws by Stojko
Vrankovic. Why was Vrankovic out of his warm-up duds in the first
quarter? Well, Lorenzen Wright, who's keeping the center position
warm until Clippers franchise draft pick Michael Olowokandi is
ready, picked up two quick fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, by the way, arrived in L.A. on Friday, signed a
three-year contract, took a physical examination and will join his
new teammates at the Sports Arena for this morning's shootaround.
</P>
<P>
   At the 6:34 mark of Friday's fish-in-a-barrel shoot, the Lakers
had missed 10 of 12 field-goal attempts but still led, 10-9. What
occurred in the next 5:26 was gruesome for the Clippers, but not
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   There were two Eddie Jones dunks, a rousing ovation for the
first siting of nouveau riche substitute Kobe Bryant, and a
quarter-ending steal and layup by new/old free agent guard Derek
Harper.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Laker Girls appeared to be in fighting trim, the
Laker boys didn't seem too far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're looking through the eyes of a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too early,'' said Laker bench boss Del Harris, ``to
say where anybody is until we actually play some games.''
</P>
<P>
   If this was a test for the Lakers, take a look at some of the
answers:
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Harper should be capable of providing
stability during key moments in real games.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal will continue to be a misadventure at the free-throw
line.
</P>
<P>
   Elden Campbell remains the object of fans' scorn. Campbell still
throws down freaky dunks with his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant still doesn't look like the next Michael Jordan, but he
does look better than Jordan with hair.
</P>
<P>
   Starting point guard Derek Fisher won't push an official into
the scorer's table but seems content to push the ball on the break
and only shoot when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   A year in Boston with Rick Pitino doesn't seem to have ruined
Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon will show up for a game even when
the tickets are free.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Clippers at first blush:
</P>
<P>
   If Tim Duncan, last year's NBA rookie of the year, had been born
a year later, the Clippers would be in great shape.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Missing in action were Laker rookie guard Sam Jacobson
(hip flexor) and Clippers forward Maurice Taylor (strained right
quadriceps).... The two teams resume their exhibition feud tonight
at 7:30 at the Sports Arena.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Jelani Gardner was hyped up. Not just game day,
but all week.
</P>
<P>
   Emotion was a big part of his preparation, and, to his credit,
he realized afterward he allowed his emotion to run too far.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was ejected for a flagrant elbow to Kevin Hanson's jaw
with 2:57 to play, but by then another message was sent and
received.
</P>
<P>
   After being held to seven points by San Diego in the last
meeting, Gardner scored a game-high 19 points as Pepperdine
thrashed the Toreros 72-58 Friday in front of 2,155 at Firestone
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   However, as soon as the final buzzer sounded Gardner headed for
San Diego coach Brad Holland to offer an apology for his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for what I did,'' Gardner said. ``It was the
wrong thing to do, but in the heat of the battle a lot of things
happen. It's no excuse, but if you're watching I probably get hit
like that every time I run a play. But I had no intent of being a
dirty player.''
</P>
<P>
   No question the officials were paying close attention to any
type of physical play. Less than a minute early Gardner and San
Diego's Dana White were assessed double technical fouls after the
Waves' Kelvin Gibbs (13 points, 10 rebounds) was fouled on a layup.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most intriguing and exciting aspect of a game that
was one-sided from tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned many lessons this year, and that's what I've
told this team,'' Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar said. ``This is
another lesson. We lost our composure a little bit, and that just
can't happen, but I don't think we're going to let that overshadow
the effort we gave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've addressed it and it's uncharacteristic of our team to
react that way. The first year I was here we were 6-21 and we
didn't react that way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the only thing Gardner did remotely wrong on what was
otherwise a brilliant night.
</P>
<P>
   He hit 8 of 10 shots from the field, made all three of his
3-point attempts and had two rebounds, two steals and two assists.
Of his five turnovers, many were a result of a fumbled pass.
</P>
<P>
   The performance is customary for what the senior has done since
conference play began.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's led Pepperdine in scoring in six of the seven West
Coast Conference games its played, and is averaging 17.9 points in
league play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come out here and kill these guys because I had my
worst game last (Saturday),'' Gardner said. ``I couldn't think
about anything else all week but coming out here and proving what I
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth straight win for Pepperdine (15-7, 6-1 WCC) also
pushed coach Lorenzo Romar's career mark to 38-38. The third-year
coach, in the midst of rebuilding Pepperdine's tradition, can move
pst .500 for the first time with a win tonight against St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves should be well-rested because it didn't take them long
to put San Diego (12-7, 3-4) away, beating the Toreros in every
facet of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That was on display as Pepperdine used a 17-0 run that lasted
6:15 and enabled the Waves to take a 21-3 lead with 11:01 left in
the first half. San Diego, which went 7:58 without a field goal,
committed eight turnovers and attempted six shots during that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our intensity because if we jump on teams quick we're
a hard team to come back against,'' Gibbs said. ``We killed them in
rebounds the first half (18 to 9) and when we play teams that like
to transition, like us, that's good for us. I don't think there's
any team in this conference that can transition with us.''

DAVIS, ANDERSON PLAY GAME OF TAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For just a moment, forget that Sunday's Super Bowl is
(begin italic) the biggest football game in the world. (end
italic).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, think of it as a game of tag. That's what it will seem
like for defenders on both teams trying to catch Denver's Terrell
Davis or contain Atlanta's Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Let George Sefcik explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing tag around a tree when you were a kid,''
Atlanta's offensive coordinator said this week. ``If you're on one
side and the tree is your blocker, and if you can get the tagger to
lean around to one side, you're gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what trying to tackle Terrell and Jamal can be like,''
Sefcik said. ``They both have great vision. They both have great
balance. They both have great quickness. And just because a play is
called one way, that doesn't mean they'll end up running that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two guys are extremely good at playing tag.''
</P>
<P>
   It might sound simplistic, but it won't be simple for the
opposing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   To upset Denver, the Falcons must at least slow down the runaway
yardage machine that Davis has been. To defend their title, the
Broncos cannot allow Anderson to gobble up large chunks of yards
and the scoreboard clock at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No one ran for more yards in the regular season than Davis, who
became only the fourth player in NFL history to crack the
2,000-yard barrier. The only one who ran for more yards than
Anderson (1,846) was Davis.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first Super Bowl in history matching the leading rusher
in the AFC against the leading rusher in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, Davis has been even better, averaging 183 yards
in two games and 6.9 yards per carry. Anderson was held to 67 yards
in the NFC title game two weeks ago, but it was the Minnesota
Vikings' insistence on stopping him that helped quarterback Chris
Chandler become almost unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Anderson. Anderson and Davis. They have been on a
collision course all season.
</P>
<P>
   They come at a defense in different ways, creating different
problems. Davis is more of a slasher who can confound a defense by
cutting back behind his blockers. The 234-pound Anderson is more
powerful, pounding away and wearing down a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each brings something that is equally difficult to stop,''
said Broncos defensive end Neil Smith, who played against Anderson
last year but also has played against Davis while with the Kansas
City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get a few more people around Jamal to stop him
because he has a low center of gravity,'' Smith said. ``But to stop
Terrell, you have to get to him. He's very good at not allowing
that to happen until he's past the line of scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Incomparable, and difficult to compare. That's Davis and
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S BEHIND THEM
</P>
<P>
   Their backgrounds couldn't be more different.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, each was a low-round draft choice _ Anderson the 201st
player selected in 1994; Davis the 196th pick in 1995. Yes, each
grew up in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But their formative years were like comparing Wonder Bread and
stale crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's father, a retired police officer, was a bodyguard for
Muhammad Ali, Richard Pryor and Diana Ross, among others, and now
is chief of security for Mike Tyson. Ali was in the waiting room
the day Jamal was born, and Anderson remembers Sugar Ray Leonard
singing at one of his birthday parties. Anderson and his brothers
used to perform skits for the guests at the barbecues his father
would host for his celebrity friends.
</P>
<P>
   Just your typical childhood. Yeah, right, says the engaging grin
that spreads across Anderson's face. He credits growing up around
people who lived in the spotlight for his ease at basking in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I was raised around, most of the time they handled
the media really well and had a great relationship with them,''
Anderson said. ``So I'm just trying to be natural. It's no problem.
I try to have fun with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun is not a word that would be used to describe Davis'
childhood. He doesn't talk about it, but did write about it in his
autobiography, ``Dreams in Motion,'' which was released during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis told a tale of being 9 and having his father hold a gun to
his head to instill toughness in his sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't scared. I knew he wasn't going to kill us,'' Davis
wrote. ``He loved us too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Davis now looks at the world through eyes that
can be dark and distant, while Anderson's dance and dart the way
Ali used to in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IN FRONT OF THEM
</P>
<P>
   Each has an unbelievable future. But this is more about what is
immediately before them: Their contrasting offensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos come at a defense with the smallest offensive line
in the league, but also one of the most athletic. They attempt to
get a defender out of position or off balance, allowing Davis to
slice behind the mismatch and be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they try to push you one way, you immediately have to get
back on the other side because Terrell's going to read it,'' said
Falcons free safety Eugene Robinson, who played against the Broncos
in last year's Super Bowl while with the Packers. ``Last year, we
couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns in the Broncos'
upset of the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' line is bigger and more traditional. They are
looking to capture ground by exploding off the line and into
defenders. Then comes Anderson, running behind those big ``trees''
and daring you to tag him.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING
</P>
<P>
   It's called motivation, and each has it by the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Davis. He rushed for 1,750 yards last season and was
then MVP in the Super Bowl. This season? The 2,008 yards. The 23
touchdowns. The league MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play this game,'' Davis said. ``I don't try to
compare myself year to year. I go out there to clean the slate and
do something not totally different, but stick with the same game
plan. Doing the little things, it helps the bigger picture come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson ran for 1,000 yards in each of the past two seasons.
But this season, he set an NFL record with 410 carries, nearly
doubled his rushing output from 1996 and 1997 combined and scored
more touchdowns (14) than he totaled in his first four seasons with
the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading this magazine before the season where they
listed the Top 25 players in the league,'' Anderson said. ``I was
like No. 70. They had the Top 25 running backs. I was like No. 22.
I'm like, `Come on, guys. There are 21 running backs in this league
who are better than me? I don't think so.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I read and hear stuff like that and I love those little
motivating tidbits from extra-smart critics,'' he said. ``I'm
always out to prove somebody wrong.''

ELWAY NOT AT JORDAN'S EXIT DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There are plenty of differences between John Elway and
Michael Jordan, but let's start with the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Elway is not the barometer, pulse, heart, mind, body, soul,
marketing force or best player ever to play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   To the NBA, to the game of basketball, Jordan was all of that.
He was maybe even more than all of that, which we will all find out
starting this coming Friday, when the NBA ``season'' begins.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jordan, Elway is not even universally considered to be
the best at his position. Just this week, even Elway listed Dan
Marino, Johnny Unitas and Roger Staubach as his top three all-time
NFL QBs. Other than Marty Schottenheimer, who said Elway might be
the best QB ever, most football gurus merely listed Elway among the
top with Joe Montana, Unitas, Marino and Sammy Baugh.
</P>
<P>
   The point is: If Elway wins a second consecutive Super Bowl on
Sunday, why would he walk away from the game?
</P>
<P>
   Could he walk away, considering what dangles out there?
</P>
<P>
   No quarterback has ever won three straight Super Bowls. No team
has ever done it. And if it were at all possible to summon the
strength and determination to slog through a 17th season, Elway
would be in a position to elevate his status, perhaps so that he
eclipses all the others.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying it would be easy. But it is enough to wonder if a
competitive son of a quarterback like Elway could really walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll be back, too,'' Elway told offensive coordinator
Gary Kubiak after the Broncos' AFC win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the door is open slightly more now,'' coach Mike
Shanahan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Elways sees the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   And just maybe Falcons coach Dan Reeves did Elway a favor this
Super Bowl. Maybe by opening the old wounds and talking about their
embattled Bronco days, Reeves has steered some attention away from
a Super Bowl story line that says Elway, after Sunday, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Signs certainly do point to that: The victory lap at Mile High
Stadium two weeks ago; the talk among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something about Elway this past week that seemed
to hint that perhaps he is more ambivalent about this decision.
</P>
<P>
   He won't talk about retirement, mostly because he does not want
to detract from the team or the game. But perhaps he understands
that there are as many good reasons for him to stay another year as
there are reasons for him to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, while Elway must think first of his family and his own
health _ both things he wants to spend more time attending to _ he
does not have to grapple with the same issues Jordan had to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Let's refresh our memories as to why it was perfect for Jordan
to retire at this exact time:
</P>
<P>
   A. Jordan's league was in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   B. Jordan had already won two three-peats.
</P>
<P>
   C. Jordan had secured his sixth championship with the
game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   D. Jordan had long battled with his owner and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   E. Jordan's coach was no longer employed by the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   F. While claiming to be physically capable _ despite a cigar-cut
tendon in his finger _ Jordan said his mental energy had been
drained away, and, most important . . .
</P>
<P>
   G. Jordan had to leave a pretty, unspoiled, pristine last
impression.
</P>
<P>
   Elway does not have to worry about this. Already, Elway's skills
have slipped. The image of him is of a great athlete on the
downside of his career. Even he admits it.
</P>
<P>
   While a somewhat unsavory suggestion, Elway has heard the talk
that Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde was better than Elway in the
AFC championship game. Elway has heard talk that Falcons
quarterback Chandler is playing better than Elway
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we win, I don't care about quarterback ratings,''
Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   As for everything else surrounding Elway's decision, he has no
other reason to go, except if his body is too broken down or he is
too eager to spend time with his family. (Maybe Elway should wait
and talk to Jordan about the intricacies of car pooling and making
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the kids. It's not all it's
cracked up to be, at least not for more than two or three months.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Elway has a perfect relationship with his owner, who is
apparently considering offering Elway part ownership of the team.
Elway has a best friendship with head coach Mike Shanahan. He has a
team surrounding him that is, at least at this moment, poised to
make a run at football's grandest title: Dynasty. He has a
2,000-yard running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Terrell Davis has made me a genius,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe Elway does not have to go that far. But Elway does
grasp what an incredible situation he is in.
</P>
<P>
   After three disastrous Super Bowl losses that made it seem as if
he might have to leave the game with a sense of regret or failure,
Elway now is on the cusp of one of sport's most inspired
turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos were to lose Sunday, fine, he can still walk away
proud. Elway has made his donation to sports history with the
scrambling and the comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Broncos were to win a second consecutive Super Bowl,
who could blame or deny Elway if he woke up Monday morning with a
craving for a third?

   MALIBU, Calif. _ Frank Sanchez considers himself charmed.
</P>
<P>
   Not many, if any, coaches return to the dugout just five months
after having brain surgery, suffering paralysis and relearning how
to swallow. But there was Sanchez standing in the Pepperdine dugout
Friday watching the Waves open the season with a 6-2 victory over
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sanchez appeared relaxed as his 3-year-old daughter,
Lacey, sat on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now you'll stop writing about me and start writing about
the team,'' he said. ``Not that I'm complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   He has very little about which to complain. Starting pitcher
Brad Tucker pitched eight innings and gave up two runs and four
hits with six strikeouts and two walks. Only one hit came after the
second inning, when Nevada (0-1) scored its runs.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman G.J. Raymundo, who was expected to be out four to
six weeks with a hairline fracture in his right forearm, played,
hit a triple and scored two runs. And the team pounded out nine
hits using wood bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divine intervention,'' was what Sanchez called Raymundo's
appearance. But he could have applied the term to Tucker's pitching
after the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker wasn't finding the strike zone with his breaking ball or
change-up,so the Wolf Pack hitters waited on his fastball. An Arona
Taele second-inning single scored both runs for a 2-0 Nevada lead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the third inning, Tucker found his control. He couldn't
explain it, and neither could catcher Dane Sardinha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know,'' Sardinha said. ``I told him to keep on
throwing it. That was his No.1 pitch today.''
</P>
<P>
   With his pitching under control, Tucker, who led the Waves last
year with an 8-1 record, kept the Nevada hitters off-balance. He
faced the minimum in five of his last six innings and said he felt
stronger as the game progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez didn't let him finish because he was near his 100-pitch
limit. Jay Gehrke struck out the side in the ninth but not before
giving up a single and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy with the most experience,'' Sanchez said of
Tucker. ``He's the guy who did it for us last year. He's the guy
who from Day 1 showed he's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymundo is expected to be an offensive power, but not this
soon. Ten days after his forearm injury earlier this month, a
second X-ray revealed the fracture had healed enough that he could
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord healed it in 10 days,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves spread around their offense; five different people,
including El Camino Real graduate Woody Cliffords, drove in runs
off two Nevada pitchers. They had to use wood bats because they
weren't insured to use the new Louisville Slugger aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them,'' Raymundo said. ``It separates who can hit and
who can't.''

COMMENTARY: NIGGARDLY CITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once Ross Perot wanted to make the Patsy Cline song
``Crazy'' his campaign theme.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate things are deteriorating in our capital, we might
consider it for the national anthem. Cher could sing it Sunday at
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has wigged out.
</P>
<P>
   As though we didn't have enough problems with our president's
tortured wordplay, now the mayor of Washington is mired in an
etymological scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams accepted the resignation of a top aide,
David Howard, after Howard, who is white, used the word
``niggardly'' in a meeting, offending a black staffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have to be niggardly with this fund because it's not
going to be a lot of money,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's staffers apparently did not know that the word is a
synonym for ``miserly'' with no root connection to the similar
sounding racial slur. A rumor snaked around that Howard had used
the N-word, and when he offered to resign, the Mayor accepted,
lamenting that his friend had used poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a niggardly scandal, given former Mayor
Marion Barry's copious escapades with crack and women. But you have
to see it as subtext in the saga of racial tension in this city.
</P>
<P>
   The bow-tied, Harvard- and Yale-educated Williams is suspect in
the black community for not being ``black enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams is not a fellow who looks like he's spent a lot of
time hanging out with a bunch of black guys,'' says history
professor Roger Wilkins. ``There's not the lingo, there's not the
body language. He calls himself a nerd, and nerdishness is not a
part of the black culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the mayor is having a teensy-weensy identity
crisis, he should never have sided with ignorance or succumbed to
P.C. poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with Howard, who clearly has not learned the Clintonian
lesson that a cat who wants more lives must cling to that hot tin
roof. ``I should have thought, this is an arcane word, and everyone
may not know it,'' he said apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent blacks, like Julian Bond, call ``niggardly'' a
``perfectly good word.'' Others, like Wilkins and Jesse Jackson,
feel that Howard should get his job back, but that such a confusing
word could be avoided. ``You've got to be pretty heavy to get into
the Scandinavian roots of a word from two centuries ago,'' Jackson
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niggardly'' has a lot of resonance in Washington these days.
Despite a moving plea from Dale Bumpers and a biblical lecture by
Lawton Chiles' daughter, at a memorial service for the late Florida
governor and senator, Republicans and Ken Starr are showing no
mercy. Minginess and small-mindedness are rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The senators banned laptops from the floor, fearing it would
hurt decorum, but now they're eager to ponder Monica's gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing his prey may wiggle out of the trap with a Senate
acquittal, the independent counsel is mulling bringing criminal
charges against Clinton while he's in office. According to The New
York Times' Don Van Natta Jr., Starr has concluded he has
constitutional authority to indict Clinton before his term ends.
</P>
<P>
   This is all about ego, vengefulness and arrogance. The public is
begging for release from Monica madness, but all Ken Starr and the
Republican House managers want is to save their own heartless
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Starr forgoes a presidential indictment, he has lots of
other people on the hook. Clinton may have invented the permanent
campaign, but Starr invented the permanent prosecution. It's
impossible to keep track of how many times Webster Hubbell has been
indicted. We can look forward to yet another trial of Susan
McDougal. And Starr's office was in court last week trying to
muzzle poor Julie Hiatt Steele.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's wife has even joined the ranks of the niggardly. In an
interview with The Ladies Home Journal, she noted cattily: ``I'd
rather not be married to someone who doesn't love me enough to
remain faithful.'' Mocking Mrs. Clinton's tonsorial diversity, she
said: ``I admire all her hairdos. Personally I've had the same one
for the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to my dictionary, the word ``niggardly'' derives from
an old variation of a word meaning ``to scrape,'' as in the bottom
of a barrel, which is where we are now.

SPORTS COLUMN: THIS TIGHT END IS IN SHARPE FOCUS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Until the kickoff, the Super Bowl is always a talk show.
Yak, yak, yak. And Super Bowl XXXIII's most eloquent, or at least
its most voluble, talk-show guest has been Shannon Sharpe, the
Broncos' tight end. When asked anything, he always had something to
say, especially about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a good talker, I'm a great talker, because I do it so
often,'' he announced during the week. ``I think if you do
something well enough, you become great at it. When I was at
Savannah State, I'd get in the mirror 20 minutes at night before
I'd go to bed and talk to myself. I'd ask questions, answer
questions. I've kind of perfected it now.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, Sharpe has also perfected how to play tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a great run-blocking tight end,'' he said. ``I
want to be a great receiving tight end.''
</P>
<P>
   He even has perfected where he thinks he already rates among pro
football's all-time tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think I'm one of the best,'' he said. ``If you
look at Ozzie Newsome and Kellen Winslow, none of those guys ever
played in a Super Bowl. Here I am in my second one. I'll take my
numbers for nine years and put them up there with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, Sharpe has caught 529 passes for 6,759 yards
and 44 touchdowns, including 64 for 768 yards and 10 touchdowns
during the recent season, his seventh as a Pro Bowl selection.
</P>
<P>
   In the Super Bowl, the outcome is often in the hands of the
receivers. Three wideouts _ Lynn Swann, Fred Biletnikoff and Jerry
Rice _ have been voted the most valuable player, but a tight end
never has.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe could be the first, if only because the Falcons, like
almost every other team in the National Football League, do not
have a tight end in his class.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Santiago, the Falcons' tight end out of Whitby, Ontario, is
one of the NFL's few Canadian players, a third-round draft choice
from Kent State. At 6 feet 7 inches and 267 pounds, he's a tall
target, but in only his second season, he's still very much a work
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played the Broncos during my rookie year, it took me a
whole half to get some good blocks,'' Santiago said. ``I'll get
into this game a lot earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   But with only 27 catches for 428 yards and 5 touchdowns this
season, Santiago hardly creates the offensive problems that Sharpe
does with his deep-threat speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharpe is the more difficult matchup for us,'' said Rich
Brooks, the Falcons' defensive coordinator. ``Other tight ends
don't threaten you vertically.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``vertically,'' Brooks meant being able to go deep, which
Sharpe can do as well as Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey, the Broncos'
wide receivers. Cornelius Bennett, the Falcons' 33-year-old
linebacker, remembers Sharpe going deep during the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught a 65-yard touchdown pass right down the seam,''
Bennett said. ``On a busted coverage, he was running wide open. He
can catch the ball at any angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett sounded confident that ``my pass-covering skills will
match up'' with Sharpe, but Eugene Robinson, the Falcons'
experienced free safety, acknowledged that Sharpe ``on a linebacker
is a mismatch.'' Robinson ought to know. His 53 career
interceptions are the most among active defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's talent and trash talk have also contributed to Smith's
and McCaffrey's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the game I have has come from Shannon,'' said Smith,
who caught 86 passes for 1,222 yards and 6 touchdowns this season.
``He works so hard, he prepares for a game so hard. By
trash-talking so much, he puts pressure on himself and thrives on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And by trash-talking so much, Sharpe has taken some of that
pressure off McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really entertains me during a game,'' McCaffrey said. ``I
find it quite comical.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey was once a Giants wide receiver, while the Falcons'
wide receivers, Terance Mathis and Tony Martin, once were Jets
receivers. McCaffrey was cut by Dan Reeves, then the Giants' coach,
during the 1993 exhibition season _ something Reeves has since
described as his ``biggest mistake'' as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan told me, `We have enough receivers,''' recalled McCaffrey,
who caught 64 passes for 1,053 yards and 10 touchdowns for the
Broncos this season. ``I never took it personally. I considered it
a business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis joined the Falcons as a free agent in 1994 after four
seasons as a seldom-used wide receiver with the Jets. He caught a
total of only 93 passes for the Jets; his first season with the
Falcons he caught 111 in a run-and-shoot offense. This season he
caught 64 for 1,136 yards and 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets didn't think I could take the every-down pounding,''
Mathis said. ``I proved I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who caught 66 passes for 1,181 yards and 6 touchdowns
for the Falcons this season, was among the Jets' last cuts in 1989
when Joe Walton was the coach. The Jets wanted to put Martin on
their developmental squad, but he requested his release, signed
with the Dolphins and later moved to the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us,'' Martin said, referring to him and Mathis, ``will
have to come up with a big play in this Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the opposing wide receivers cancel each other out,
Shannon Sharpe is likely to come up with the biggest play. He's the
reason I like the Broncos to win, 31-28.

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM TRIAL BALLOON TO PART OF THE NATION'S FABRIC  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Super Bowl may indeed be the quintessence of American boys
behaving badly, but it has never pretended to be anything else.
Because it is the national holy day of a secular religion linked to
illegal gambling, domestic violence, steroid abuse and
institutional racism, it is beyond scandal and star-fall. We should
be particularly grateful in these days of Olympic disgrace and pro
basketball depression.
</P>
<P>
   I began appreciating the Super Bowl 30 years ago, at what was
then called the American Football League-National Football League
world championship. An evening before the game, I was offered a
glimpse into the future if I promised to keep it in ``deep
background.'' Even more easily seducible then, I soon found myself
rocking gently on a luxurious yacht, drinking with Commissioner
Pete Rozelle and several owners.
</P>
<P>
   Rozelle took me aside, murmured of his concerns that pro
football was becoming too big too quickly, too intrinsic to the
national fabric. Could it sustain? He was as serious as any head of
state dreaming of an empire. He went on to leak the legend, which
he would soon share with everyone, that the term ``Super Bowl,''
then coming into vogue, had been coined by the son of the Kansas
City Chiefs' owner, Lamar Hunt, who was playing with a high-bouncer
called ``the super ball.'' Rozelle, the public relations master,
told this story with such elaborate reluctance that, in retrospect,
it is clear he was releasing a trial balloon he figured the news
media would either shoot down or claim to have sent up.
</P>
<P>
   As New York fans were reminded recently, that game,
retroactively called Super Bowl III, helped bring us into this rich
new Jock Pop world in which the Olympics became just another
super-spectacle competing for the entertainment dollar and short
white men made hoopla dreams come true. I wish I had been smart
enough that balmy night off Miami Beach to see that the fix was
already in, that these guys knew what they were doing. The NFL and
its Super Bowl were about franchising and marketing, about cities
desperate to appear ``major league,'' about cars and beer for
18-to-34-year-old male viewers who needed to watch mostly faceless
big guys whomp the cartilage out of one another. This was a boy's
dream of studly quarterbacks and their loyal meatball guards,
``Braveheart'' without the blue paint, 60-minute wars without women
or the responsibilities of peace. And it was all under the benign
fatherhood of intense coaches who would make them men.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Olympics and the National Basketball Association
started to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Since the olive oil payoffs of ancient Greece (winners got sales
franchises despite the amateur rules), the Olympics have been a
model of hypocrisy, continually bending their own rules for the
sake of business. All was justified for the survival of a
``movement'' that was supposedly larger than nationalism. The
Olympics fed on nationalistic rivalry, especially when it could be
televised.
</P>
<P>
   This is why it is so hard not to enjoy certain aspects of the
current bribery scandal (which will turn out to be far more
systemic than first reported) in much the way that agnostics
enjoyed the fall of those television preachers who always knew so
much about sin.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics lost its last claim to specialness in 1992, when it
opened its arms to the Dream Team, the NBA's Roman legion, which
claimed the world in ways that even the late Commissioner Rozelle
probably envied. Basketball is more portable and exportable than
football, but perhaps more fragile. All its players have faces.
Because individual stars become larger than the game itself, the
game is more dependent on them. The process of replacing Michael
Jordan (perhaps by a whole team, a rookie class or the redemption
of Latrell Sprewell) has already begun, but until it is complete
the game will be in recession. But the Super Bowl, with its red
meat soul, its aroma of beer, cigars and new car leather seats,
prospers and rumbles on.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal football betting, from office pools to serious gambling,
has become intrinsic to the national fabric. The only important
players who were ever suspended for an entire season, Paul Hornung
and Alex Karras, were punished because they bet on games, giving
the appearance of being inside traders. The nastiest backlash I've
ever had from a story was when I offered anecdotal evidence from
hot-lines and women's shelters that big games, such as the Super
Bowl, provoked male-on-female domestic violence. Right-wing
commentators in particular seemed incensed at this assault on
American manhood.
</P>
<P>
   That every level of the game encourages football players to use
anabolic steroids and other drugs that enhance performance, build
muscle mass or aid strenuous training is no longer even
interesting; fascinating will be how the pharmaceutical companies,
in their rush to cash in on the current men's health boom, will use
the game's image of manhood to market drugs. The continuing, almost
perverse, refusal to promote black coaches seems like a
one-industry refutation of a century of progress. So does the
pigskin curtain on what seems like an epidemic of players with
police records. Is it the drugs, a shared psychological profile of
player and felon or a sense that the super ball has just bounced
out of sight of everyday morality?
</P>
<P>
   Beats me. All I know is that Sunday I will be grateful and pay
homage.

AFTER A LONG JOURNEY, CHANDLER FINDS SUCCESS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler was outside a
restaurant here this week when some autograph-seekers began
sticking small pieces of paper in his face. While Chandler politely
signed, one man watching the scene from several feet away, stared
with a puzzled look. Finally, he asked, ``Who are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the pinnacle of what has been, until now, a mostly
nondescript career, Chandler is not a household face, especially in
a Super Bowl in which he is facing the future Hall of Famer, John
Elway, in what most believe is Elway's final season.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why Chandler can blend into a crowd. With
thinning hair and the look of a man on the street, he seems more
like someone who plays pickup games than a quarterback going to his
second consecutive Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the season, when it counted the most, Chandler
was playing as well as any quarterback in the game _ and better
than Elway. Chandler was the offensive player of the month for
December after his 118.6 passer rating helped the Falcons go 4-0 in
the month and he finished the season with a rating of 100.9, fourth
highest in the league. Elway was one spot behind him with a rating
of 93.0.
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment of Chandler's career _ at least to this
point _ came two weeks ago in the National Football Conference
title game against the Minnesota Vikings. In overtime, the
more-heralded Randall Cunningham seemed jittery, but Chandler
showed no sign of nervousness. He completed passes of 15, 26 and 6
yards on a 70-yard, 10-play drive that set up the game-winning
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that game people were always asking me, `Do you have
anything to prove?''' Chandler said this week. ``I thought the only
thing I had to prove was that I could take a team on my back. That
last drive really helped me, confidence-wise. I think it changed my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Life has been good for Chandler in many ways this season. Three
days after the Falcons won the conference championship, his wife,
Diane, gave birth to their third daughter, Brynn Brodie Chandler.
(Diane is the daughter of the former San Francisco 49ers
quarterback John Brodie.) In September, Chandler signed a
five-year, $27 million contract that guaranteed him $8.3 million
this season. And a week after the Super Bowl, Chandler will become
the first Falcon quarterback to play in consecutive Pro Bowls since
Steve Bartkowski in the 1980 and 1981 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely on a roll right now that doesn't happen very
often to anybody,'' said Chandler. ``The way the season has gone,
just having a beautiful baby girl and then the Super Bowl. Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   His football career, though, has not always been a fairy tale.
It has more closely resembled a train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Tennessee Oilers traded Chandler to the
Falcons for the low price of fourth- and sixth-round draft choices.
That swap may go down as one of the most lopsided trades ever,
although it was not seen that way at the time. The Oilers had Steve
McNair, a young and talented player, and Chandler was seen as
expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons Coach Dan Reeves did not think he had acquired a star
player either. Reeves thought Chandler would be a stopgap until the
Falcons were able to draft a young thrower.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely underrated by me,'' Reeves said. ``I had no
idea he was as good a football player as he is. He's been a great
fit for us because he loves what we do offensively and we construct
a game plan around what he does well.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Falcons throw a lot of deep passes, something
Chandler excels at.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until this season, Chandler had always been seen as a
mediocre player. At one point in his career he played on five teams
in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was taken as a third-round draft choice out of the
University of Washington by the Indianapolis Colts in 1988 and won
the starting job as a rookie, but he has never stuck with a team
for as long as three seasons. After two seasons with the Colts, he
went from Tampa Bay to Arizona to the Los Angeles Rams to Houston
to the Falcons. Along the way, he has taken a beating from head to
toe, with at least three severe concussions and  &UR;  &LR; several knee
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He also ran into competition from quarterbacks who were
considered better. With the Colts it was Jeff George; with the
Buccaneers it was Vinny Testaverde; with the Oilers it was McNair.
With &UR;  &LR; Tampa Bay, Chandler began the 1990 season as the starter, but
the Buccaneers went 0-6 while he threw 14 interceptions and only 5
touchdowns. He was benched in favor of Testaverde and soon found
himself inactive for most games as the No. 3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably one of the worst times of my career,''
Chandler said. ``I wasn't sure where my career was headed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the NFL was mostly political,'' he said. ``It was
discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late 1991, Chandler was traded to the Cardinals, where
he came under the tutelage of quarterbacks coach Jerry Rhome, whom
Chandler credits with turning his career around. Rhome took a
bitter, discouraged quarterback and began working on improving his
mechanics and decision-making. The two watched hours of film
together, with Rhome pointing out what was good and bad about his
throws. In a matter of months, Chandler was reading defenses better
than he ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, instead of wasting precious seconds overanalyzing in the
pocket, Chandler was making quick decisions and throws. He became a
different quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris' biggest problem used to be he would outthink himself,''
Rhome said earlier this season. ``He played golf the same way. He'd
stand over the ball and say: `OK, it's 200 yards to the hole. The
wind is blowing 200 miles an hour to the right. There's a tree
branch hanging over.' I'd finally scream, `Just hit the darn ball.'
Same in football. If you see it and feel it, just throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Chandler has done with the Falcons. He is 17-4 in
games he has started and finished the last two years. This season,
he recorded career highs in passing yards (3,154) and touchdowns
(25) while throwing only 14 interceptions. In two playoff games, he
performed better, completing 40 of 62 passes for 509 yards, with 3
touchdowns and 1 interception. By contrast, Elway completed only 27
of 57 passes for 355 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has this been a dream season?'' Chandler asked. ``Well, we
have one more step to climb before I can really answer that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does win the ultimate game, maybe his face will start to
stick out in a crowd.  &QL;

SUPER KICKERS HAVE A HUNCH IT COULD COME DOWN TO THEM  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One is probably headed for nomination to the Hall of
Fame. The other has a shoe that will be going to the Hall of Fame.
That's just one of the striking differences between the
place-kickers in Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons' Morten Andersen also uses a custom-made
shoe for his field-goal attempts that cost $5,000 just to develop.
The Denver Broncos' Jason Elam relies on a 10-year-shoe that sold
for $8.99.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, in his 17th season, has an NFL-record 26 career
game-winning field goals, including the 38-yarder against Minnesota
that put the Falcons in the Super Bowl; Elam has 6.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Elam, a sixth-year pro, will be represented in the Hall of
Fame before Andersen. After next week's Pro Bowl, he will ship his
aging kicking shoe to Canton, Ohio, in recognition of his league
record-tying 63-yard field goal last October against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   It has been eight seasons since a Super Bowl was decided by a
field goal or a missed attempt, and there has been only one other
field goal-deciding game in the Super Bowl's 32-year history.
Still, Elam believes it may well happen on Sunday, especially with
the forecast of a 50 percent chance of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty close in talent all the way around,'' he
said. ``I don't think we're going to blow them out, and I don't see
them blowing us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Off this season's work, it's difficult to choose between the
two. Elam has made 27 of 31 field-goal attempts, including all four
of his tries in the post-season. Andersen is 28 of 33, including 5
of 5 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Both are deep into the mental side of handling the highs and
lows of being an NFL kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen said he seeks to practice in such a precise manner that
his training becomes a ``dominant response.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to rehearse so much that it becomes natural out there,''
he said. ``You remove all the variables _ remove all pressure and
everything you can't control _ and just focus on what you can
control. On the field, I let my skill take over. I try to kick
freely, meaning my mind is not cluttered. I'm just reacting, just
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam, a native Georgian and a childhood Falcons fan, said an
Atlanta sports psychologist has helped him grasp the mental part of
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a golfer,'' he said. ``You always have the
same little routine. There are all kinds of thoughts that can creep
into your head, so you try to keep those under control. And you
don't want to get caught up in the moment. I'd say kicking is
probably 90 percent mental.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have a healthy reverence for the damage a game-deciding
field goal miss can wreak.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen had trouble forgetting the 1996 miss that ended
Atlanta's season and catapulted Jacksonville into the playoffs.
Elam said he was still upset about an overtime miss against the
Raiders five seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Self-effacing remarks can help. Andersen said he is the answer
to a trivia question: Name a kicker who has made a 60-yard field
goal and missed a 19-yarder?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you've got to take the good with the bad,'' he said.
``You've got to study your history, so you don't repeat it. As
athletes, we don't need a lot of mental luggage. I try not to carry
a lot of kicks around with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam remembers the words of the former kicker Matt Bahr: The joy
of making a game-winning kick doesn't remotely compare to the
prolonged agony of missing one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can drive yourself crazy if you don't watch it,'' Elam
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both have plenty of empathy for the Vikings' Gary Anderson,
whose only field-goal miss of the season, in overtime against
Atlanta, cost them a Super Bowl trip.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen and Elam also are aware of Super Bowl history. How
Baltimore's Jim O'Brien won the 1971 game with a 32-yarder, and how
Scott Norwood's wide right 47-yarder cost Buffalo a victory over
the Giants in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, a Pro Bowler at the time, soon faded out of the league.
``You wonder if he had made that kick if he would still be kicking
today,'' Elam said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson noted that Elam, 10 years his junior at 28, has a
wonderful temperament, especially for a kicker still in his 20s.
``He doesn't take himself too seriously and he's able to laugh some
things off. He has a nice dose of self-confidence, but also a nice
dose of self-irony.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen said a trip to Nepal just five years ago with his
father _ he saw how calm the natives were _ helped him learn to
have more inner peace. And patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kicker spends 97 percent of his time on the sidelines,'' he
said. ``The way he uses that time on the sidelines is crucial to
his success or failure on the field. I let the game play me. I
don't try to force anything. I just patiently wait.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the divided generations of Irish before them, the two
opposing camps of contributors to America Online's discussion group
on Ireland rarely agree on anything. But when the world's leading
online service suspended their contentious electronic debate last
month, participants on both sides were united in their dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stop just to appease the AOL Thought Police,'' one
proponent of a united Ireland wrote to the Unionist contingent.
``I'd much rather have someone vehemently disagree with me than
know that anyone has been silenced!''
</P>
<P>
   America Online reopened its Irish Heritage discussion after a
17-day ``cooling off'' period, and if there was a strangely muted
quality to the contributions at first, things are mostly back to
normal. The politics folder, which now bears the slogan ``a place
for cordial political debate in the spirit of harmony,'' has
spawned more than 12,000 of the usual postings regarding British
treason and Sinn Fein terrorism since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the episode has fed a growing discomfort with the social and
political power America Online has come to wield by dint of its
surging popularity and its unusual purview over individual
communication. And it underscores the challenges the company may
face as it seeks with mixed success to maintain both civil
discourse and satisfied customers while presiding over 180,000
continuing conversations on topics from the teen-age idols 'N Sync
to Presidential impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing free expression with civility has always been a
struggle for America Online and other electronic publishers that
provide areas where people can voice their opinions by typing them
into the ether. But it is America Online's scope combined with its
editorial control that some critics say is cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 million subscribers, America Online is now the gateway
to cyberspace for more Americans than the next 15 largest Internet
service providers combined, according to a report released last
week by the International Data Corp., a market research firm. This
week, announcing strong earnings, the company said 1.6 million
accounts were added in the last three months of 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
   But some members have begun to chafe at its definition of
civility, or at least the way it seems sometimes arbitrarily
applied. And some civil liberties advocates are scrutinizing the
service more closely as a new breed of institution that governs
speech and yet is immune from First Amendment claims.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of recent clashes in discussion areas ranging from race
relations to fiction writing have served to heighten concerns over
the company's more subtle methods of monitoring the discussions on
its message boards _ the continuing discussions that subscribers
can follow and contribute to over time, as distinct from the
simultaneous and sometimes chaotic (but also monitored) exchanges
in what it calls chat rooms. In particular, some subscribers cite
the online service's practice of deleting message board postings
without explanation and of attaching the equivalent of demerit
marks to the accounts of individuals deemed to have offended
another subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, who gets to decide what's `offensive?''' says
Renee Rosenblum-Lowden of Riegelsville, Pa., who recalls being
cited for a violation for posting a message in a debate on abortion
advising an opponent, ``If you can't stand the heat get out of the
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Under America Online's contract, universally referred to among
members in both noun and verb form as TOS, for ``terms of
service,'' all subscribers promise not to ``harass, threaten,
embarrass, or do anything else to another member that is
unwanted.'' Often transgressions are reported to America Online
officials by other discussion group participants, whose identities
are not released to those they accuse. According to the company's
subscriber contract, three such violations may result in the
suspension or termination of an account.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenblum-Lowden _ whose screen name is now ``Prejteach 2''
because her ``Prejteach'' account was closed _ says she and a group
of other women who take part in discussions on the Women in Action
board have been picked as targets for complaints by those who
disagree with their liberal views. ``Unlike a court of law, you
don't face your accusers,'' she said. ``That gives people free
rein.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online officials concede that judging what is unduly
offensive in often-complex political disputes or long-running
personal battles can be tricky, especially given the volume and
range of messages. That is why the company has enlisted nearly
14,000 volunteers to patrol the boards, and employs a group of
about 100 known as the Community Action Team to determine when a
comment crosses the line.
</P>
<P>
   In intervening in conversations between its users, America
Online says its objective is to maintain a sense of community.
Although legal liability for libelous statements appearing on its
boards was once more of a concern, a provision of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 essentially grants online services
immunity from prosecution over such matters, characterizing them as
a ``common carrier'' like a telephone company _ simply a means by
which information is transmitted, with no responsibility for the
information itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most terms-of-service violations are handled case by case. In an
extreme case like the Irish board, where dozens of violations were
being reported every day by the most active participants, the
company said there were enough profane and offensive postings that
it became necessary to shut down the whole discussion. The
discussion archives, which sometimes remain on the service for
several years, were wiped clean during the weeks that the board was
shut down, so no trace remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of judgment required in situations on
whether something is particularly harassing or threatening of other
members,'' said Katherine Boursecnik, America Online's vice
president for network programming. ``That's where things get the
most difficult. We train people to be agnostic about the specific
content and to look more at things like tone: Is it threatening,
harassing, profane, vulgar?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But given the well-documented tendency of normally sober
citizens to act out on line, the problems of privacy protection and
threats to minors _ as well as Congressional efforts to regulate
online speech _ Ms. Boursecnik said the company's supervisory
policies were necessary to provide the open atmosphere its
customers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a service that prides ourselves on having a
wide-ranging appeal to a wide range of individuals,'' she added.
``But at the same time we're also a family service.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many subscribers, America Online's virtue is its
controlled environment. A members-only online service distinct from
the unfettered Internet, America Online has achieved market
dominance by promoting itself as a place where families and
first-time Internet users can feel comfortable. While members can
venture out into the World Wide Web and other parts of the Internet
from the online service, many seldom do, preferring America
Online's relative safety and familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   The service is far from the only Internet discussion area to
enforce its own standards of acceptable speech. Popular Web
destinations like the search and directory site Yahoo,
discussion-oriented sites like Theglobe.com, and sites operated by
traditional publishers (including The New York Times) reserve the
right to remove postings on the message boards they provide to
Internet users. And those who find America Online's terms
unacceptable can always go to another online service, or to the
Internet's entirely unmonitored forums called news groups.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online's extraordinary market dominance, critics
argue, makes it the only place in practical terms for a growing
number of people to speak their mind in cyberspace. Many Internet
users find the unmoderated news groups too technically complex to
use and too overrun with advertising to be productive for
discussion. Since it serves as an Internet service provider,
America Online has a far more potent enforcement mechanism for its
rules than most other discussion areas on the Web. Since
subscribers pay a monthly fee with a credit card, the company can
bar individuals from logging on _ thereby denying them, among other
things, access to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online is the operating system of the Internet,'' said
Andrew L. Shapiro, the First Amendment fellow at the Brennan Center
for Justice at New York University Law School, comparing the
service to the Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, which
runs on 90 percent of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved distressingly close to the model that the Internet
was supposed to replace, which is a couple of big companies having
a disproportionate amount of control over the information market,''
Shapiro added. ``A good argument can be made that AOL needs to take
on more responsibility for protecting free speech, whether courts
require it or consumers simply demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some subscribers, like John Navin, 38, of Mount Lake
Terrace, Wash., said he had dropped his America Online account to
protest the Irish board shutdown, others dissatisfied with its
interventions remain with the service out of choice, habit or
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheila Fahey found the Irish discussion shuttered last
month, for example, she and others tried to migrate their
discussion to a site on the World Wide Web called Ireland
Uncensored. But she found the forum confusing and too difficult to
follow. Instead, she says she and several other Irish nationalists
now screen each other's postings before making them public to vet
them for possible terms-of-service violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all learned not to use first-person pronouns,'' said Ms.
Fahey, 41, a paralegal in Chicago. ``If an English teacher looked
at some of our postings, they are so passive-language-filled they'd
have a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   (When the discussion was reopened, the monitor posted a message
pleading for harmony: ``We encourage you to make this a more
amiable place where any person, regardless of faction, can openly
discuss political issues and current events.'')
</P>
<P>
   For Robin Olderman, 54, a high school English teacher in
Houston, it means putting up with what she describes as feeling
like a kid in a playground whose friends go running to the teacher.

   ``I take issue with the way the rules are enforced
arbitrarily,'' said Ms. Olderman, who is currently operating under
a ``mutual nonharassment notice,'' an e-mail message from America
Online explaining that she and another subscriber are never to
speak to each other via the service again.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more disturbing to some subscribers is the removal of
postings from message boards. On the Writers Club board, which like
many areas of America Online is administered by a separate company
that contracts with the service, more than a dozen of the most
active participants over the last several years recently left en
masse after the board monitors began removing their postings and
reporting terms-of-service violations more frequently to the
Community Action Team.
</P>
<P>
   The writers now congregate on a board called ``Sanctuary'' in
the American Civil Liberties Union area on America Online, where
the terms-of-service rules do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   On the race relations message board, Jay Lutsky, 31, of Edison,
N.J., said he compared an active participant who accused everyone
on the board of being his enemy to Robespierre, the French Jacobin
leader responsible for the revolution's Reign of Terror. It was
removed by monitors after the other participant said it was
slander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it was opinion; I'm entitled,'' Lutsky, a teacher,
said. ``I understand AOL is a large private corporation, and I
guess it's technically their property, but I don't think it should
be allowed to interfere with the First Amendment rights of
people.''

   WASHINGTON _ The federal budget deficit is gone, transformed by
a strong economy into a string of projected surpluses that should
grow larger for years to come _ at least by the reckoning that
passes for fiscal forecasting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the deficit is hardly the end of the government's
financial troubles, however, and it marks the beginning of a new
debate over how fiscal policy should be used to shape the nation's
future.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a family that after spending more than it earns month
after month suddenly finds itself bringing in more than it spends _
great news, to be sure, but a turnaround that still leaves the
family with the debt it ran up during the hard times and the choice
of whether to pay it off.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was never in much danger of maxing out its credit
cards. But the national debt was built up over decades of deficit
spending _ the federal government has not run steady surpluses
since the 1920s _ and it remains an economic millstone of
considerable proportions. Only now do Congress and the White House
have the luxury of debating what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to complete the transformation of the Democratic Party's
tax-and-spend reputation into one of economic virtue, President
Clinton has already made debt reduction a centerpiece of his agenda
this year, saying it is the best way to insure that the country
remains prosperous and able to handle the strains the aging
baby-boom generation will place on the social welfare system. The
details of his plan are confusing, with some Republicans saying the
president is advocating a sophisticated shell game, but Clinton is
actively trying to recast an otherwise abstract goal in tangible
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we in the United States could actually be doing something
to pay down our debt while saving Social Security and Medicare,''
Clinton told a meeting at the White House last week, ``we would
keep these interest rates down, and it would be an enormous hedge
against whatever unforeseen future volatility occurs in the global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   All too aware that they are being painted by Democrats as
willing to risk Social Security's future for a burst of immediate
gratification, Republicans are nonetheless pressing ahead with
their calls to use the surplus for big tax cuts, saying there is
more than enough spare cash to clean up the nation's books, save
Social Security and return some money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Republicans say, debt reduction will never happen
because Democrats _ admittedly with some help from the other side
of the aisle _ will spend the surplus before it materializes. Since
the real choice then, in the Republican view, is between new
spending and tax cuts, the best course economically and politically
is tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debt reduction ultimately gets trumped in a political process
by government spending,'' said John Cogan, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and a former budget official in the Reagan and
Bush administrations. ``Achieving a sustained policy of debt
reduction is very difficult, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to measure the national debt, but the
most meaningful is to look at the debt held by the public _ the
individuals, Wall Street firms and banks from around the world that
buy the bonds sold by the Treasury Department. There is currently
$3.7 trillion in public debt outstanding, which is equal to 45
percent of the economy's total output.
</P>
<P>
   In those terms, the debt peaked at the end of World War II, when
it hit 108 percent of the gross domestic product. Its recent high
was in 1993, after a decade of growing deficits, when it hit 50
percent. Should all of the surpluses projected for the next decade
be used for debt reduction, the debt would decline to below 10
percent by 2009, its lowest level since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In economic terms, the question of whether debt reduction should
be a higher priority than tax cuts or spending increases is an easy
call. Most economists agree that paying down the national debt is
the surest way to spur more savings and investment, create more
jobs, improve productivity and generally enable the economy to grow
faster.
</P>
<P>
   After all, every dollar the government has to borrow to pay for
fighter jets or new education programs is a dollar not available to
a promising but cash-starved technology company or to a
manufacturer eager to invest in new equipment that would enable it
to compete more effectively in cutthroat global markets.
Competition from Washington for capital also drives up interest
rates for mortgages and car loans as well as for corporate
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   And every dollar that Washington has to spend making interest
payments is a dollar the government does not have available for
other uses _ say, shoring up the Social Security system.

   ``Reducing the federal debt to the public at this stage is
unquestionably the most important thing that I believe that we can
do if meeting the future needs of the economy is the standard,''
said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week.
</P>
<P>
   To some people there is also a moral dimension to the issue.
Debt, in their view, is just plain wrong, an obligation that needs
to be paid off as soon as possible, whether it is owed by a farmer,
a company or the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the abstract we think of it as fiscal sin,'' said Robert
Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, quickly
adding that ``rather than repent we charge yet again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is on the political level that the issue gets messiest.
</P>
<P>
   While members of both parties pledge allegiance to austerity and
the long-term benefits it promises, history suggests that the
short-term drive to survive the next election leads to some degree
of profligacy. Last year Republicans as well as Democrats hailed
Clinton's call to save ``every penny'' of the developing surpluses
for Social Security. By the end of a year in which they agreed on
very few things, lawmakers from both parties agreed to a
budget-busting highway and mass transit bill and to $20 billion in
extra spending out of this year's surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Using the surplus for tax cuts or popular programs is just too
much of a temptation for politicians. However virtuous it might be
to forswear spending money that could otherwise go to debt
reduction, said Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional
Budget Office, ``You can't go home to your district and have a
ribbon cutting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for both political and policy reasons, Clinton has
wrapped himself in the mantle of debt reduction. It is a measure of
his political dexterity that even as he sets out sweeping new
spending initiatives in the budget he will send Congress on Monday,
he may well succeed, as he did last year, in using fiscal rectitude
as a blocking maneuver against the Republican tax-cutting drive.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan bitterness that has emerged over the impeachment
also suggests there is little chance of any deal between the White
House and Congress on Social Security, tax cuts and spending.
</P>
<P>
   But in economic terms such an impasse might not prove to be such
a bad thing. Gridlock amounts to a policy decision by default
because running a surplus is synonymous with paying down debt; it
automatically reduces the government's borrowing needs. All of
this, of course, assumes that the economy and the stock market
remain strong enough that the surplus actually materializes.

ONE DEFENSE AGAINST QUAKES: BUILD HOMES OF WOOD

By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Americans viewing the devastation caused by last
week's earthquake in Colombia might be tempted to knock on wood.
Wood-frame houses, the type generally built in the United States,
can stand up far better in quakes than the outwardly solid masonry
homes that crumpled so quickly in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But even wooden homes can fall down, and each new earthquake
adds to the understanding of what more could be done to make
residential housing more quake-proof. Indeed, the last major
temblor to hit a U.S. urban area, the Northridge quake of 1994 in
the Los Angeles area, prompted a re-evaluation of building codes
when wood-frame buildings suffered far more damage than had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northridge showed they don't perform as well as we thought,''
said Bob Reitherman, executive director of California Universities
for Research in Earthquake Engineering, a consortium of eight
schools. In that and other quakes, he said, ``some of them are
falling down and all of them are getting more damage than we
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The haunting pictures from Colombia, where the official death
toll was near 1,000 and could go much higher, showed wide swaths of
row houses in the town of Armenia flattened to rubble. But nearby,
seemingly identical houses remained standing. Surprising as that
may be to an ordinary newspaper reader, that phenomenon is familiar
to any earthquake expert, since it demonstrates the capriciousness
of earthquakes. Two identical homes can be affected differently
based on the behavior of the soil beneath them or on how they are
hit by the earthquake shock waves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, home construction makes a big difference. In Colombia and
other developing nations, homes are often made of unreinforced
masonry, adobe or mud, and there are few residential building
codes. Homes in wealthier parts of Armenia, presumably with better
construction, did better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That disaster was due to poor construction, not to the size of
the earthquake,'' said George Housner, emeritus professor of
earthquake engineering at the California Institute of Technology.
``That earthquake, had it occurred near Pasadena, would not have
been a disaster at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, wooden frames tend to do better in quakes because
they have some flexibility. ``If the structure doesn't give during
the earthquake then it tends to be completely destroyed,'' said Tom
Henyey, a geological sciences professor at the University of
Southern California and director of the Southern California
Earthquake Center. ``Ductility is really the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But merely having a wood frame isn't enough, experts say. In
Kobe, Japan, which suffered a huge quake in 1995, many older houses
with wooden frames collapsed because they were not built to
withstand lateral forces and had extremely heavy roofs made of
traditional Japanese tiles.
</P>
<P>
   To better withstand a quake, experts say, homes need to have
what are known as shear walls, which are normally made from plywood
fastened between the upright wooden beams to help withstand
side-to-side forces. The frame of the home should also be bolted to
the foundation to make sure it doesn't slip off. And upper floors
and roofs should be securely attached to floors below.
</P>
<P>
   ``If built to code properly, the house should go through a
sizable earthquake fairly well,'' said Do Kim, director of
engineering at the Institute for Business and Home Safety, a
Boston-based nonprofit organization set up by the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim also said that while the code seems to be enforced well
in California, there are other parts of the country in which
builders frequently get waivers, even though earthquakes have
occurred there in the past. These, he said, include the New Madrid
zone in and near Missouri, and the area around Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to keep home costs low is clearly a reason,
though some experts insist that quake-proofing adds only 5 percent
or so to the cost of a newly built home. Richard Cardoza, director
of architectural production at Kaufman and Broad, the largest
homebuilder in the West, said that complying with the latest Los
Angeles earthquake codes might add between $1 and $2.50 per square
foot to the price of a home, which translates into an extra $2,000
to $4,500 to the cost of a typical new three-bedroom home of 2,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Existing homes can also be retrofitted, at various costs. Some
older masonry homes in Los Angeles have had steel rods put through
them from wall to wall between stories. But simple and inexpensive
steps like strapping the water heater to a wall can also make a big
difference, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even adherence to building codes is no guarantee. For one
thing, the codes are generally designed to prevent loss of life by
keeping buildings from collapsing. They are not meant to prevent
all damage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each earthquake seems to show that the existing code
is inadequate. ``Each time we have an earthquake we learn more''
said Dr. Henyey. Building codes have been strengthened in light of
the Northridge quake, which had a magnitude of 6.7. Reitherman said
that of 10,193 buildings deemed unsafe to occupy after that quake,
91 percent were made of wood.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most of the 25 deaths from building damage (there
were 61 deaths overall) were at apartment buildings, particularly
two- or three-story structures in which the first floor was used
for parking. In such buildings, the bottom floor was not sturdy
enough to support ones above once shaking began. But single family
homes still suffered more damage than expected. The Institute for
Business and Home Safety estimates the insurance industry has paid
$15 billion in claims, far higher than it had foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Reitherman's consortium recently embarked on a three-year, $6.9
million study, most of it financed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, to find ways of designing safer wood-framed
buildings without substantially raising the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Reitherman said that most wood-framed buildings are designed by
architects rather than structural engineers. And tools for
analyzing the forces on wood-framed structures are not very
advanced. That is because good as wood might be in quakes, it is
steel and concrete, used in the expensive commercial buildings,
that get all the engineering attention.

   LOS ANGELES _ Americans viewing the devastation caused by last
week's earthquake in Colombia might be tempted to knock on wood.
Wood-frame houses, the type generally built in the United States,
can stand up far better in quakes than the outwardly solid masonry
homes that crumpled so quickly in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But even wooden homes can fall down, and each new earthquake
adds to the understanding of what more could be done to make
residential housing more quake-proof. Indeed, the last major
temblor to hit a U.S. urban area, the Northridge quake of 1994 in
the Los Angeles area, prompted a re-evaluation of building codes
when wood-frame buildings suffered far more damage than had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northridge showed they don't perform as well as we thought,''
said Bob Reitherman, executive director of California Universities
for Research in Earthquake Engineering, a consortium of eight
schools. In that and other quakes, he said, ``some of them are
falling down and all of them are getting more damage than we
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The haunting pictures from Colombia, where the official death
toll was near 1,000 and could go much higher, showed wide swaths of
row houses in the town of Armenia flattened to rubble. But nearby,
seemingly identical houses remained standing. Surprising as that
may be to an ordinary newspaper reader, that phenomenon is familiar
to any earthquake expert, since it demonstrates the capriciousness
of earthquakes. Two identical homes can be affected differently
based on the behavior of the soil beneath them or on how they are
hit by the earthquake shock waves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, home construction makes a big difference. In Colombia and
other developing nations, homes are often made of unreinforced
masonry, adobe or mud, and there are few residential building
codes. Homes in wealthier parts of Armenia, presumably with better
construction, did better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That disaster was due to poor construction, not to the size of
the earthquake,'' said George Housner, emeritus professor of
earthquake engineering at the California Institute of Technology.
``That earthquake, had it occurred near Pasadena, would not have
been a disaster at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, wooden frames tend to do better in quakes because
they have some flexibility. ``If the structure doesn't give during
the earthquake then it tends to be completely destroyed,'' said Tom
Henyey, a geological sciences professor at the University of
Southern California and director of the Southern California
Earthquake Center. ``Ductility is really the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But merely having a wood frame isn't enough, experts say. In
Kobe, Japan, which suffered a huge quake in 1995, many older houses
with wooden frames collapsed because they were not built to
withstand lateral forces and had extremely heavy roofs made of
traditional Japanese tiles.
</P>
<P>
   To better withstand a quake, experts say, homes need to have
what are known as shear walls, which are normally made from plywood
fastened between the upright wooden beams to help withstand
side-to-side forces. The frame of the home should also be bolted to
the foundation to make sure it doesn't slip off. And upper floors
and roofs should be securely attached to floors below.
</P>
<P>
   ``If built to code properly, the house should go through a
sizable earthquake fairly well,'' said Do Kim, director of
engineering at the Institute for Business and Home Safety, a
Boston-based nonprofit organization set up by the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim also said that while the code seems to be enforced well
in California, there are other parts of the country in which
builders frequently get waivers, even though earthquakes have
occurred there in the past. These, he said, include the New Madrid
zone in and near Missouri, and the area around Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to keep home costs low is clearly a reason,
though some experts insist that quake-proofing adds only 5 percent
or so to the cost of a newly built home. Richard Cardoza, director
of architectural production at Kaufman and Broad, the largest
homebuilder in the West, said that complying with the latest Los
Angeles earthquake codes might add between $1 and $2.50 per square
foot to the price of a home, which translates into an extra $2,000
to $4,500 to the cost of a typical new three-bedroom home of 2,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Existing homes can also be retrofitted, at various costs. Some
older masonry homes in Los Angeles have had steel rods put through
them from wall to wall between stories. But simple and inexpensive
steps like strapping the water heater to a wall can also make a big
difference, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even adherence to building codes is no guarantee. For one
thing, the codes are generally designed to prevent loss of life by
keeping buildings from collapsing. They are not meant to prevent
all damage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each earthquake seems to show that the existing code
is inadequate. ``Each time we have an earthquake we learn more''
said Dr. Henyey. Building codes have been strengthened in light of
the Northridge quake, which had a magnitude of 6.7. Reitherman said
that of 10,193 buildings deemed unsafe to occupy after that quake,
91 percent were made of wood.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most of the 25 deaths from building damage (there
were 61 deaths overall) were at apartment buildings, particularly
two- or three-story structures in which the first floor was used
for parking. In such buildings, the bottom floor was not sturdy
enough to support ones above once shaking began. But single family
homes still suffered more damage than expected. The Institute for
Business and Home Safety estimates the insurance industry has paid
$15 billion in claims, far higher than it had foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Reitherman's consortium recently embarked on a three-year, $6.9
million study, most of it financed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, to find ways of designing safer wood-framed
buildings without substantially raising the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Reitherman said that most wood-framed buildings are designed by
architects rather than structural engineers. And tools for
analyzing the forces on wood-framed structures are not very
advanced. That is because good as wood might be in quakes, it is
steel and concrete, used in the expensive commercial buildings,
that get all the engineering attention.

   The trouble began when Bobbie Gallagher noticed that her
2-year-old daughter was behaving strangely, obsessively spinning
and scrupulously setting her toys in rows. Alanna Gallagher turned
out to have autism, a rare neurological disorder of unknown cause.
</P>
<P>
   So did Alanna's little brother. So did about 40 other children
who lived in the Gallaghers' town of Brick, N.J., near the
seashore.
</P>
<P>
   The parents in Brick were alarmed. On average, 1 child in 500 is
autistic; in the town, the figure is about three times that.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it mean? Does Brick have toxic chemicals in the
water, pollutants in the air?
</P>
<P>
   The problem, scientists say, may be impossible to resolve. It
was yet another instance of a phenomenon that makes many
statisticians shudder. It was a disease cluster _ the Boy Who Cried
Wolf of epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a disease cluster turns up, communities worry,
scientists scramble for a cause and, as in the new movie based on
Jonathan Harr's 1995 book, ``A Civil Action'' (Random House), about
a leukemia cluster in Woburn, Mass., lawyers start suing. Yet over
and over again, despite years _ sometimes decades _ of efforts to
link the disease with a cause, scientists usually come up empty
handed.
</P>
<P>
   It can sound paradoxical. Here are unusual numbers of people
with a disease. Toxic chemicals are everywhere, and many of them
cause cancers and other diseases in laboratory animals. Why should
it be so hard to find a cause?
</P>
<P>
   Some disease clusters have been successfully linked to toxins:
Coal miners got black lung disease; asbestos workers got
mesothelioma. Workers cleaning containers where polyvinyl chloride
was synthesized, breathing in fumes, got cancer of the blood
vessels of the liver until machines replaced them.
</P>
<P>
   But these examples of proven cause and effect are the rare
exceptions, statisticians say. And they have two things in common:
The chemical exposure was enormous, and the disease was
extraordinarily rare.
</P>
<P>
   Most disease clusters are very different. Autism, breast cancer
and leukemia are fairly common. And even when there does seem to be
an unusually high incidence of a disease, the search for a chemical
basis usually turns up minute amounts of toxic substances that also
are found in other places where there are no clusters. In other
words, linking the suspect chemicals to the disease can be very
hard. It can also be difficult to know if a cluster is anything
more than a chance occurrence. And chance is hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters will naturally appear even when events occur at random,
said Dr. Persi Diaconis, a statistician at Stanford University.
``There was a famous example of this when bombs were hitting London
during World War II,'' he said. ``People were sure they were
targeting individual places and they made up the most elaborate
scenarios'' to explain how the bomb targets were selected. But in
the end, when the pattern was analyzed, the bombing turned out to
be random.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is how to draw the boundaries of a cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Robins, a statistician at Harvard University's School
of Public Health, said it is a natural tendency to draw boundaries
around groups of events to make clusters happen. If there are three
children with cancer on a single block, you may draw your circle
around the block _ making that a cluster _ rather than around the
town as a whole, which may show no cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Say you do find a cluster. Unless you identify, say, black lung
or mesothelioma, statisticians say, the next question is: How can
you decide if the cluster was caused by blind random clumpings of
cases, with no environmental cause, or by a toxin in the
environment?
</P>
<P>
   Why would only one town have a disease cluster, some experts
ask, while other places with the same pollutants in the air or
water do not? One possibility might be an unidentified chemical in
a mix of pollutants that is unique to the town. But that, of
course, raises questions of how to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the indirect exposure problem. If there is no
direct link between chemicals and a disease, the tendency is to
look for other exposures. Could the fathers, for example, have had
their sperm affected when they were growing up? Or could the
mothers have been exposed to chemicals during pregnancy? Some
statisticians say that if people look hard enough and slice the
data enough ways and an association will emerge. What it means is
another question.
</P>
<P>
   Others are optimistic. Suzanne Condon, the director of the
bureau of environmental health assessment at the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health, said that in an unpublished study her
department found that in the Woburn case, women who drank water
from certain wells when they were pregnant were more likely to have
children who developed leukemia. ``We believe this sheds a lot of
light on what happened in Woburn,'' she said. W.R. Grace, which was
accused along with Beatrice Foods of dumping chemicals in a way
that allowed them to reach the water supply, paid $8 million into a
settlement fund. Both companies agreed to finance an expensive
cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts' health department, however, warned on its Web
page, ``Findings should be interpreted with caution due to the
limitations of conducting statistical analyses on small
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be what people want to hear, statisticians concede.
``People _ and I, too _ find it hard to accept that it is just
random chance that brought this horrible consequence,'' said Dr.
David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Some statisticians ask whether it is worthwhile to keep pouring
money and effort into searches for clusters and searches to explain
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, at what point do you say we've see too many
like this?'' Robins asked. ``Huge amounts of money'' have gone to
study disease clusters where the suspected cause was tiny amounts
of chemicals, he added, and so far, ``nothing has come of it.''

   ROME _ It seemed like a season for traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   First came the Vatican declaration last November that in
celebration of the third millennium of Christianity believers will
be offered a wider array of indulgences, ways to earn amnesties
from various forms of punishment in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the announcement just before Christmas that Padre
Pio, the celebrated Italian mystic and healer who is a hero of
traditionalist Catholics, would be beatified this May, the final
step before canonization. (Pope John Paul II has made 270 saints,
more than any other pope in history, and has beatified almost 800
people.)
</P>
<P>
   And last week the Vatican published a revised Catholic rite for
exorcism, the ancient ritual for expelling demons, reaffirming for
doubters that the Devil does indeed exist and is very much at work
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   More is coming. Later this year the Vatican will publish an
updated martyrology, the list of the 10,000 or so recognized saints
and martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   All these practices are subjects of debate among Catholics and
between Protestants and Catholics. Since the Second Vatican
Council, which concluded in 1965, the church has sought to shift
emphasis from some of them. Liberal Catholics are uneasy about
religious customs that appear to reflect older, legalistic
approaches to achieving salvation. The Protestant Reformation
disdained the cult of saints, and many Catholics are uncomfortable
with the idea of indulgences, which appear to offer a shortcut to
heaven. Most of all, though, talk of driving out demons evokes for
many images of ``Rosemary's Baby'' and ``The Exorcist'' rather than
profound spiritual values.
</P>
<P>
   As the pontificate of 78-year-old John Paul II enters its third
decade, the Vatican appears to be pursuing divergent goals. The
mandate of the Second Vatican Council to bring the church up to
date has been taken seriously. But at the same time, John Paul
clearly rejects wholesale change. He clings, for example, to the
notion of priestly celibacy just as firmly as he bans even
discussion of the ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Vatican, under his aegis, continuously enacts lesser
changes designed to make ancient customs compatible with the spirit
of the times. The Vatican struggles, experts say, to take into
account the sensibilities of a widely varying membership in broadly
differing societies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Catholics have faced wrenching changes, large
and small. ``Whatever happened to Limbo?'' older Catholics may ask.
The church once taught that it was the place where unbaptized
infants went when they died. It's still around, goes the new
thinking, but it's empty. It is now believed to have been the state
of natural bliss enjoyed by the just, like Abraham and Moses, who
died before the Ascension of Christ to heaven. The Ascension
brought them to heaven as well, and the babies got there too.
</P>
<P>
   Many familiar symbols of devotion, like the scapular, once worn
around the necks of millions of schoolchildren, are much less
common now. Pieces of wool encased in plastic with iconic pictures,
scapulars were believed to confer spiritual benefits much like
indulgences. Some varieties were supposed to insure salvation if a
person died wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   But exorcism, rather than fading away, has seen a revival among
a segment of Catholics. Though ancient and widespread, the practice
of exorcism and belief in demons are, for many Catholics, more
science fiction than reasoned spirituality. The vast majority of
Catholic theologians, said Fordham University sociologist Michael
Cuneo, regard exorcism as ``utter foolishness.'' The Vatican
itself, in proposing the revised rite, took pains to draw
Christians away from notions like those spread in popular
literature and films like ``The Exorcist,'' while at the same time
holding firm to belief in devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a PR man for the Devil,'' said the Rev. John Navone,
a Jesuit theologian at the papal Gregorian University in Rome.
``But belief in higher spirits is pre-Judaic and pre-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the Vatican's reaffirmation of the Devil and exorcism
may be designed for the church in developing countries, where
belief in spirits is widespread. ``Christ's victory is power over
those spirits to protect people, so you don't have to live in
fear,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America magazine in
New York. ``In that case, declaring Christ's victory over Satan is
a sign of hope rather than fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in countries that view themselves as sophisticated,
like the United States, there is a flourishing market for exorcism.
``People are looking to be delivered of demons of alcoholism,
demons of marital infidelity, demons of depression,'' Cuneo said,
``and exorcism winds up the quick-fix solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, there was one official exorcist in the American
Catholic church; now there are 10. In addition to official
exorcisms, many such rites are performed clandestinely, he said,
often by priests ``with traditionalist leanings.'' And the renegade
exorcists are every bit as vexing to the Vatican as are attacks on
belief in spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Vatican again urged bishops and priests not to
confuse psychological suffering and possession, and to seek medical
help while at the same time offering spiritual consolation. ``You
rule out the possibility of an organic problem, of hysteria,''
Cuneo said, ``and this is consistent with a long line of Vatican
thinking.''

   First came the Vatican declaration last November that in
celebration of the third millennium of Christianity believers will
be offered a wider array of indulgences, ways to earn amnesties
from various forms of punishment in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the announcement just before Christmas that Padre
Pio, the celebrated Italian mystic and healer who is a hero of
traditionalist Catholics, would be beatified this May, the final
step before canonization. (Pope John Paul II has made 270 saints,
more than any other pope in history, and has beatified almost 800
people.)
</P>
<P>
   And last week the Vatican published a revised Catholic rite for
exorcism, the ancient ritual for expelling demons, reaffirming for
doubters that the Devil does indeed exist and is very much at work
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   More is coming. Later this year the Vatican will publish an
updated martyrology, the list of the 10,000 or so recognized saints
and martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   All these practices are subjects of debate among Catholics and
between Protestants and Catholics. Since the Second Vatican
Council, which concluded in 1965, the church has sought to shift
emphasis from some of them. Liberal Catholics are uneasy about
religious customs that appear to reflect older, legalistic
approaches to achieving salvation. The Protestant Reformation
disdained the cult of saints, and many Catholics are uncomfortable
with the idea of indulgences, which appear to offer a shortcut to
heaven. Most of all, though, talk of driving out demons evokes for
many images of ``Rosemary's Baby'' and ``The Exorcist'' rather than
profound spiritual values.
</P>
<P>
   As the pontificate of 78-year-old John Paul II enters its third
decade, the Vatican appears to be pursuing divergent goals. The
mandate of the Second Vatican Council to bring the church up to
date has been taken seriously. But at the same time, John Paul
clearly rejects wholesale change. He clings, for example, to the
notion of priestly celibacy just as firmly as he bans even
discussion of the ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Vatican, under his aegis, continuously enacts lesser
changes designed to make ancient customs compatible with the spirit
of the times. The Vatican struggles, experts say, to take into
account the sensibilities of a widely varying membership in broadly
differing societies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Catholics have faced wrenching changes, large
and small. ``Whatever happened to Limbo?'' older Catholics may ask.
The church once taught that it was the place where unbaptized
infants went when they died. It's still around, goes the new
thinking, but it's empty. It is now believed to have been the state
of natural bliss enjoyed by the just, like Abraham and Moses, who
died before the Ascension of Christ to heaven. The Ascension
brought them to heaven as well, and the babies got there too.
</P>
<P>
   Many familiar symbols of devotion, like the scapular, once worn
around the necks of millions of schoolchildren, are much less
common now. Pieces of wool encased in plastic with iconic pictures,
scapulars were believed to confer spiritual benefits much like
indulgences. Some varieties were supposed to insure salvation if a
person died wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   But exorcism, rather than fading away, has seen a revival among
a segment of Catholics. Though ancient and widespread, the practice
of exorcism and belief in demons are, for many Catholics, more
science fiction than reasoned spirituality. The vast majority of
Catholic theologians, said Fordham University sociologist Michael
Cuneo, regard exorcism as ``utter foolishness.'' The Vatican
itself, in proposing the revised rite, took pains to draw
Christians away from notions like those spread in popular
literature and films like ``The Exorcist,'' while at the same time
holding firm to belief in devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a PR man for the Devil,'' said the Rev. John Navone,
a Jesuit theologian at the papal Gregorian University in Rome.
``But belief in higher spirits is pre-Judaic and pre-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the Vatican's reaffirmation of the Devil and exorcism
may be designed for the church in developing countries, where
belief in spirits is widespread. ``Christ's victory is power over
those spirits to protect people, so you don't have to live in
fear,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America magazine in
New York. ``In that case, declaring Christ's victory over Satan is
a sign of hope rather than fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in countries that view themselves as sophisticated,
like the United States, there is a flourishing market for exorcism.
``People are looking to be delivered of demons of alcoholism,
demons of marital infidelity, demons of depression,'' Cuneo said,
``and exorcism winds up the quick-fix solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, there was one official exorcist in the American
Catholic church; now there are 10. In addition to official
exorcisms, many such rites are performed clandestinely, he said,
often by priests ``with traditionalist leanings.'' And the renegade
exorcists are every bit as vexing to the Vatican as are attacks on
belief in spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Vatican again urged bishops and priests not to
confuse psychological suffering and possession, and to seek medical
help while at the same time offering spiritual consolation. ``You
rule out the possibility of an organic problem, of hysteria,''
Cuneo said, ``and this is consistent with a long line of Vatican
thinking.''

<P>
   When New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced a
tough new plan in January to seize the vehicles of drunk drivers,
he might have had a talk first with Dick Weart.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Weart was the ombudsman for the federal
government's zero-tolerance drug crackdown. From his desk in
Washington, he fielded frantic telephone calls from customs
inspectors all over the country who had just turned up a few
marijuana seeds or the burnt end of a marijuana cigarette in a car
or boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the phone from seven in the morning to seven at
night,'' he recalled. ``There were times when I was pulling my hair
out.'' Every case, it seemed, had extenuating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Such crackdowns have been highly popular with politicians and
law-enforcement officials, but after the the klieg-light hype, the
programs are usually quietly dumped or throttled back.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's program, a model of the genre, was
announced in 1988 by Customs Service Commissioner William von Raab.
``There will be no mercy,'' he vowed. And for a while, that seemed
to be true. His inspectors, sometimes with the help of the Coast
Guard, confiscated thousands of cars and boats from people caught
with small amounts of drugs, regardless of whether they were the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But within 18 months, the program had been revised three times,
evolving into a relatively lenient approach in which people were
cited and released without any confiscation of their property.
(Federal agents still use forfeiture laws, but mostly against large
scale drug dealers and money launderers.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a chaotic time, Weart recalled. ``The simplest incident
could evolve into something very serious,'' he said. One incident
involved a college student who had driven his father's Ferrari to a
party in Mexico, he recalled. Trying to reenter the United States,
the student realized that the small amount of marijuana in the car
might be enough to get it seized. So he tried to evade inspectors
by roaring through the Customs entry lanes. ``It matured into
something very serious,'' Weart said, including charges of
marijuana possession and endangering a federal agent.
</P>
<P>
   When applied to boats, the policy seemed to exaggerate the
disparity between the seriousness of the crime and the severity of
the punishment. Within weeks of the introduction of the policy,
authorities had seized the Ark Royal, a $2.5 million yacht, after
finding less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana on board.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, federal agents confiscated the country's
premier research vessel, the Atlantis II, owned by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, because the Coast Guard
had found a tiny amount of marijuana in a crew member's shaving
kit. The boat was not formally returned to Woods Hole for two
months.
</P>
<P>
   And a multi-million-dollar vessel owned by the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in California was seized after dogs
found a small amount of marijuana hidden in the berth of a
low-ranking crew member.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other high-profile seizures brought as much attention
to the zero tolerance, as criticism. But notwithstanding the
problems, Weart said, the program sent a strong message. It pleased
criminal-justice conservatives, but enraged scores of motorists and
boat owners _ not to mention civil libertarians _ who made the same
criticisms that are now being raised about New York's policy. They
complained that such Draconian steps entangle law-enforcement and
court personnel in time-consuming wrangles when they could be
better deployed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since the nation's earliest years, federal authorities have used
forfeiture laws to seize the property of people who violated
Customs and tax laws, said Sandra Guerra, a professor at the
University of Houston Law Center. Later, they were used against
people who made liquor during Prohibition, she added. But in
applying the law to drunk drivers, she said, officials may be
imposing a punishment disproportionate to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said the crackdown may never make it through the
New York courts. ``I think people who drive drunk and hurt people
should be punished,'' said Steven Kessler, a New York lawyer and an
expert on asset forfeiture in the state. ``Unfortunately, the
Administrative Code as written doesn't permit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir defended the program, saying that seizing the vehicles of
drunk drivers means taking a weapon out of the hands of potential
criminals. ``I can't tell you how many times I've been to the scene
where somebody was killed, and the drunk driver had been arrested
three or four times before,'' he said. ``Nothing is perfect,
nothing is going to solve the problem totally, but we believe this
is a very good start.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy would be administered ``reasonably,'' he said, and
exceptions will be made when drunk drivers are operating someone
else's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are lots of people who will think twice about
drinking and driving if they think they are going to lose their
car,'' he said. ``I really do.''

REPUBLICANS FACE IDENTITY CRISIS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With great confidence and some justification,
Republicans have long proclaimed that theirs is the party of ideas.
So it seemed quite a turn when Rep. Steve Largent, R-Wash., in the
Republicans' response to the State of the Union address, found
himself having to pose this question: ``What does the party of
Lincoln and Reagan stand for today?''
</P>
<P>
   The question confounds Republicans at every gathering. At a
meeting of the national party the other day, Jim Nicholson was
re-elected chairman not because he had a fresh agenda. Rather, his
backers persuaded party members that _ as the person who nominated
him put it _ it was not his fault that ``we lack a coherent
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded in a speech in
January that after his party recaptured the House in 1994, ``we
were not able to create a second agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   For a generation, Republicans have been the tribune of a
resurgent American conservatism. Republicanism not only brought
electoral success, it changed the way Americans thought of their
government and of themselves. There were divisions in the party and
tensions between social and economic strains of conservative
thought, but nobody doubted that Republicans had an agenda or that
the party's world view was ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, the definition of conservatism is up for grabs.
With the budget balanced, crime down, the welfare rolls and divorce
rates shrunken under a Democratic president, the line between
Democrats and Republicans can be hard to find. So Republicans find
themselves defined by impeachment, by their argument that the
president represents a nation in moral decline and must be removed.
Republicans have found that Americans are leery of a party that
appears to be pressing for moral cleansing _ whether it is about
Clinton, abortion or the rights of homosexuals _ and may be
offended by the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Republicans seem so headless is because they have
this enormously important issue in front of them _ the impeachment
of the president _ but they don't want to acknowledge that it is
their most important issue,'' said David Frum, a conservative
theorist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, Democrats have an advantage because
Clinton's pragmatic politics fit the public mood. ``This is a very
conservative age, but not in an ideological sense,'' Frum said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have embraced Clinton's popular notion that people do
not want grand schemes as much as practical solutions to smaller
problems. (It is no accident that the man who wants to succeed
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, recently unveiled a slogan of his
own, ``practical idealism.'')
</P>
<P>
   That leaves conservatives competing to reinterpret
Republicanism, to try to make it popular again. The struggle is
complicated because, as the 2000 campaign gets underway,
presidential candidates are molding their appeals to the narrow
base that is important in the primaries while Republicans in
Congress are trying to fashion their own post-impeachment agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Like Democrats, Republicans are a big, messy, contradictory
coalition. While many in the party agree on a broad set of issues,
the challenge is settling on which to emphasize. Here are three
approaches:
</P>
<P>
   Moralists
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives such as former Education Secretary William
Bennett and Gary Bauer, a prominent Christian conservative who is
running for president, think the party should be unapologetic about
emphasizing its outrage at Clinton's behavior and what they see as
the nation's moral decline. In polls, Republicans are consistently
viewed as having higher ethical standards than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger is that beyond hard-edged conservatives, many
voters wince at the notion of politicians dictating moral behavior.
After years of accusing Democrats of being wedded to big
government, Republican proponents of a moral crusade risk appearing
as if they are espousing government as a means of enforcing a moral
code. Clinton and his advisers are mindful of polls showing that
over the last two decades, more and more Americans _ Democrats
included _ have come to favor a more limited role for government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment and the trial of the president seem to be their
unifying theme right now,'' said Paul Beck, chairman of the
political-science department at Ohio State University. ``But there
is this curious contradiction: Republicans are saying, `Let's get
the government out of your pocketbook and wallet but into your
bedroom.' The public may be thinking, `Who are you to tell us what
the standards of morality should be?'''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans believe that the party should stick to its
bedrock issues _ shrinking government, fighting crime and cutting
taxes _ while neither emphasizing nor ignoring touchy social issues
like morals and abortion. They argue that the party has faltered
not because these issues are no longer winners, but because the
party has not pushed them aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us now is to lay out a clear agenda that focuses
on our core issues: tax cuts, smaller government, welfare reform
and strong defense,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. ``The
problem we had in the last election was it looked like we were
abandoning those ideas to simply focus on an impeachment vote.''
McIntosh warned: ``We shouldn't be drawn into fights that the
president wants. In health care, he will always have a
better-sounding proposal if we accept his premise that the
government should run the health-care system.''

viewed as having higher ethical standards than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger is that beyond hard-edged conservatives, many
voters wince at the notion of politicians dictating moral behavior.
After years of accusing Democrats of being wedded to big
government, Republican proponents of a moral crusade risk appearing
as if they are espousing government as a means of enforcing a moral
code. Clinton and his advisers are mindful of polls showing that
over the last two decades, more and more Americans _ Democrats
included _ have come to favor a more limited role for government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment and the trial of the president seem to be their
unifying theme right now,'' said Paul Beck, chairman of the
political-science department at Ohio State University. ``But there
is this curious contradiction: Republicans are saying, `Let's get
the government out of your pocketbook and wallet but into your
bedroom.' The public may be thinking, `Who are you to tell us what
the standards of morality should be?'''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans believe that the party should stick to its
bedrock issues _ shrinking government, fighting crime and cutting
taxes _ while neither emphasizing nor ignoring touchy social issues
like morals and abortion. They argue that the party has faltered
not because these issues are no longer winners, but because the
party has not pushed them aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us now is to lay out a clear agenda that focuses
on our core issues: tax cuts, smaller government, welfare reform
and strong defense,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. ``The
problem we had in the last election was it looked like we were
abandoning those ideas to simply focus on an impeachment vote.''
McIntosh warned: ``We shouldn't be drawn into fights that the
president wants. In health care, he will always have a
better-sounding proposal if we accept his premise that the
government should run the health-care system.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In their State of the Union response, Largent and Rep. Jennifer
Dunn, R-Calif., infuriated many moralists who are indignant about
Clinton's conduct; the lawmakers played down the scandal and
underscored the bedrock Republican issues. ``Our country is not in
crisis,'' Ms. Dunn said. ``There are no tanks in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovators
</P>
<P>
   They argue that Republicans cannot simply repeat the party's old
rallying cries. ``Anybody who says that the Republicans should run
on welfare reform or on balancing the budget or having a
middle-class tax cut has a backward view,'' said Jeff Bell, a
conservative thinker. ``You have to move to a daring set of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the party cannot be timid about playing on Clinton's
turf. From Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin to John Engler of Michigan,
many governors have sought to play down divisive social issues.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is considered the leading
presidential contender should he run, has tried to put a friendly
face on traditional party issues with the term ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, a conservative public-relations operative, cited
polls suggesting that the party can broaden its appeal among
blacks, Hispanics and Catholics by pushing tax breaks for sending
children to private schools. ``A lot of Republicans are chicken to
talk about Social Security, education and health care, where these
have the potential to be positive issues for Republicans,'' Mueller
said. And they are too quick to cede those matters to the White
House, he said. ``There's a mentality that we don't have the bully
pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
   These competing strains are reminiscent of what Democrats
endured in the 1970s and 1980s, when the outspoken left wing
prevented its leaders from settling on an agenda they could ride to
the White House (except for Jimmy Carter's razor-thin victory in
1976.)
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sosnik, one of Clinton's closest aides, argued that
confusion is inevitable for any party that does not have a
president to rally around. ``No leader has earned the right to tell
the rest of the people in the party what it means to be a
Republican,'' he said. Many Republicans say the same thing _ and
pin their hopes on the prospect that their party will be rescued by
a popular, charismatic standard bearer in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That may be wishful thinking. The last two Republican nominees,
Bob Dole and George Bush, failed to sell a new definition of
conservatism. The man who succeeded was Bill Clinton.

ASCENDANT A DECADE AGO, EUROPEAN CONSERVATISM IS NOW IN DISREPUTE

<P>
   BERLIN _ If the waning years of this decade have produced a
dirty word in Europe, it is perhaps ``conservative.'' The
right-of-center ideology that played an important role in stripping
European states of vast industrial holdings, advancing the market
economy and facing down the former Soviet Union with medium-range
missiles has fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, conservatives were in charge or on the rise in
most places in Europe, but today there is hardly any country where
that is true. In Germany, France, Britain and Italy, moreover,
parties of the right are in disarray, casting around for a
persuasive electoral message at a time when such traditional
backbones of conservatism as ``the nation,'' ``the family,'' ``the
church'' and ``the communist enemy'' have changed or lost their
meaning and the moderate left has occupied the political center.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from Bill Clinton, center-left politicians like British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
have seized the political initiative with white-toothed smiles and
cleverly spin-doctored images of modernity, economic efficiency and
social compassion. In response, amid peace and moderate prosperity,
the right has found itself clutching at straws.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these right-wing parties cried `Victory' as the Berlin
Wall came down, but they did not see that they had lost the force
against which they defined themselves,'' said French political
scientist Pascal Perrineau. ``And they have been unable, since
then, to come up with a message that does not seem regressive,
nostalgic, outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the right has two essential incarnations: the
free-market ideology once embodied by Margaret Thatcher in Britain
and the more socially conscious conservatism of the German
Christian Democrats, among others.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the problem for both, it seems, lie two victories
that seemed to assure the right's future. One was over communism
and the division of Europe, the other over the excesses of
state-run economies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these triumphs, the specter of Marx and the spur
of the market lost their potency as conservative rallying cries.
</P>
<P>
   The effect has been devastating. In Italy, the Christian
Democrats, long the main center-right party and bastion of
U.S.-backed efforts to block communism, simply disintegrated.
Elsewhere, the right abruptly found itself in a world dominated not
by strategic blocs but by the economic forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   And Europeans, in large numbers, reacted to global free-market
forces not with outright enthusiasm but with calls for safeguarding
and even reinforcing their social-security systems.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that these systems are often too expensive to survive
indefinitely in their present form. Politically, a message that
pays has been one that says: Rely on us to protect you from
cutthroat capitalism, displaced factories and global storms. In a
Europe of high unemployment, the left has proved nimbler in
purveying this slogan than the center-right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of an unstoppable global economy dislocating
societies has been hard for the right to exploit because it has
generally stood for free markets and non-interference,'' said
Jonathan Eyal, a British analyst, ``And the new centrist left
quickly occupied the broad election-winning ground: acceptance of
the market tempered by social concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep changes in the very nature of European societies have also
militated against the right. Appeals to the family and to tradition
often seem outmoded, or in need of recasting, in countries where
single-parent homes have become commonplace, divorce rampant,
church-going more unusual and a multicultural environment the norm.
European conservatives, like their American counterparts, have
denounced such changes, but the response from the European
electorate has been muted.
</P>
<P>
   The German weekly Die Zeit recently observed that ``the
middle-class entrepreneur of the 1950s who wanted his children to
inherit his company regarded the linkage of business and family
values as something quite natural.'' That attitude, it added, no
longer prevailed for ``the owner of a bunch of shares.'' And so,
``the links between the market and morality, between ownership and
middle-class values, which were embodied by the Christian
Democrats, are strained and ready to burst.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the links that long bound the right to patriotic
visions of the European nation state. The fact is that this year's
introduction of a common European currency, the euro, marked the
biggest voluntary and peacetime surrender of sovereignty by a group
of states in history. Center-right parties are still grappling with
the enormity of this shift. For what should a conservative message
be in a Europe where nations exist in name but rather less in
substance?
</P>
<P>
   An answer appears elusive. In France, no less than seven
right-wing political groupings are putting forward candidates for
European Parliament elections later this year. They include three
pro-European movements, two anti-European centrist groups, and two
nationalistic platforms from the now-splintered extreme-right
National Front. ``It's mad,'' said Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist.
</P>
<P>
   But the madness reflects real differences. Some Gaullists favor
European integration; others equate it with the end of ``la
France.'' That is a very basic divergence to accommodate within a
single party.
</P>
<P>
   On the extreme right, both Jean-Marie Le Pen and his challenger,
Bruno Megret, call for the rebirth of ``national values'' and
attack ``the disappearance of European races through general
miscegenation.'' But such messages, while they rouse 15 percent of
French people, do not win elections. They help divide the right.

   In Germany, where the 16-year era of Helmut Kohl ended last
year, Kohl's Christian Democratic Party has been organizing a
petition to contest the Schroeder government's plans to introduce
new citizenship laws that would allow many of the country's 7
million foreigners to become Germans. Behind the petition, a
nostalgia for a certain idea of the German nation clearly lies, one
where only German blood gives the right to nationality. Also
evident is real hostility to the ideas of what the right calls the
``multicultural left.''
</P>
<P>
   But, again, it is far from clear that this sort of initiative
can win what Eyal called ``the critical broad church of the
center.'' For Germany is now a mixed society, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   So, what to do? Clearly, in Britain and Germany the thirst for a
change after long periods of right-wing rule has played a big role
in the popularity of center-left parties. But the success of the
center-right prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, in Spain, after
years of socialist rule suggests there is nothing irreversible
about the right's decline.
</P>
<P>
   David Willetts, a Conservative member of the British Parliament,
said the key to success lay in underlining the themes of freedom
and prosperity against the ``more regulated economy and nannying
government'' put forward by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Lellouche, the Gaullist, said the right must renew its
leadership and unite around the themes of toughness against crime,
strong defenses, skepticism about immigration and economic
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, conservatives have suggested all sorts of themes:
personal responsibility, ecological concern, radical economic
reform favoring initiative over social protection. But for the
moment, the Christian Democratic Party is plainly at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one powerful example of a successful conservative society
exists: the Bavaria fashioned by Edmund Stoiber, the leader of the
Christian Social Union, the Christian Democrats' sister party.
There, unemployment is 7 percent, compared to a national average of
more than 10 percent, high-tech companies are thriving, prosperity
is widespread, and Stoiber never tires of extolling beer-swilling
``Bavarian traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon may well be peculiarly Bavarian. But Horst
Teltschik, who served as national security adviser to Kohl and is
now on BMW's board, said the message could have a wide appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. Stoiber has done is convince people they are safe at
home and fit for the world,'' he said. ``He has turned Bavaria into
a modern, high-tech state, while keeping its values. People feel
secure, prosperous and ready to look outward: that can win
elections.''

NFL POLICY ADDRESSES VIOLENT CRIME BY PLAYERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In recent months the National Football League,
embarrassed by its players being involved in violent episodes, has
been zealously enforcing its new policy on violent crimes. While
critics at first said the policy was nothing more than a
public-relations move, it turns out that the program has teeth, and
some players believe it could significantly curb the violent acts
committed by players.
</P>
<P>
   There have been about a dozen violence-related arrests of NFL
players in the last year, and almost all of those players have been
ordered to undergo counseling, according to team officials. And for
the first time, a player was fined by the league after an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The policy applies not only to players, but to any league
employee. A small number of team front-office personnel, as well as
coaches, have undergone counseling as part of the program, said
team officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The policy began in earnest last July 1 as a way to combat what
seemed to be an increasing number of problems involving players and
violence off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, any player who is arrested for a violent
crime, must be evaluated to see if anger-management counseling is
necessary. In most cases, players receive such counseling.
</P>
<P>
   If the player is convicted of the crime, or makes a plea
bargain, the player is fined by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. The
amount of the fine is up to Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner has wide latitude to define what violent crime
is, but it generally includes assault, domestic violence and
weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players who has received counseling under the program
is Cornelius Bennett, the Atlanta Falcons linebacker who will play
in Super Bowl XXXIII on Sunday night. Bennett pleaded guilty last
year to sexual abuse and served a 35-day jail term. Because
Bennett's crime occurred before the implementation of the policy,
he was not fined by the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the policy is a very good one,'' Bennett said this
week. ``I think it will truly keep some guys in line. Fine guys,
suspend them, and get them help, and the crimes will stop, or at
least be reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   The only player to be fined in the seven months since the policy
became active is Keith Poole, a wide receiver with the New Orleans
Saints. In November, he was sentenced to two-months' probation for
attacking a man with a golf club. Earlier this month, Tagliabue
fined Poole $4,500, according to team officials. If Poole is found
guilty in another violent incident, he could be fined a more
substantial amount and suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Other players, already receiving counseling, could be fined in
the coming weeks if they are found guilty or reach a plea bargain
in pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   On average, according to team officials, 10 to 12 players are
arrested each year for violent crimes, ranging from bar fights to
domestic violence. Often, charges are dropped for a variety of
reasons, but a player who has been required to undergo counseling
would have to continue it.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Henderson, the league's executive vice president of labor
relations, and Lem Burnham, its vice president of player and
employee development, oversee the policy.
</P>
<P>
   One criticism of the program is that the league does not
publicize it enough. Players need to be reminded about it
constantly, some team officials feel.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of training camps this season, the league put
information about the policy into the playbook of each player.
League officials also met with every team to explain how the policy
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violent crime policy is something that players pay
attention to,'' Bennett said. ``It seems to have gotten the
attention of a lot of players. I hope it stays that way. Maybe it
will keep some guys from getting into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Assistants Seek Benefits &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Early last year at an NFL-sponsored coaching symposium in Miami,
a small group of assistant coaches staged a walkout, protesting
what they felt were declining life-style conditions for the
hundreds of assistants who compose the bulk of the league's staffs.
Tagliabue called the protest ``silly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the walkout may have been effective after all. It
gave the coaches publicity, and let owners know they were serious.
Now, months later, assistant coaches and owners are on the verge of
an agreement that would give the coaches, some of whom are at the
bottom of the football food chain, some much needed security.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League Coaches Association, headed by the
long-time assistant coach Larry Kennan, has been fighting for
better medical benefits and a more reasonable retirement age for
the 400 assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan has been negotiating directly with members of the
league's benefits committee, and Kennan said he is hopeful an
agreement can be reached in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks that way, but I'm not going to count on anything
being done until it's done,'' he said. ``The best I can say is we
dealt with them in a professional manner. I think they wanted us to
go away, but we weren't going to do that. But also, there are some
fair-minded owners who wanted to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Most head coaches are millionaires with long-term contracts, and
if they are fired, they still get paid. There are also highly-paid
assistant coaches like the Jets' Bill Belichick, who can earn
$200,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the assistants earn much less and usually do not
have long-term contracts. Some make as little as $20,000 a year,
and it is not unusual for as assistant to be fired twice in five
years. It is these assistants, Kennan said, who need to have a
voice.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kennan, the highlights of the coaches association's
latest proposal include:
</P>
<P>
   _The lowering of the age at which an assistant can claim a
pension. The current age is 65, and though neither side will say
what the new age will be, it could end up anywhere from 50 to 60.
</P>
<P>
   _Improved medical coverage and standardized health care.
Coverage now varies from team to team, with some programs being
good and others quite inadequate, according to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   _A standard coach's contract, similar to the one given players.
Contracts for assistants also differ between teams, coaches say,
and again some are better than others.
</P>
<P>
   _Severance pay. Kennan said game officials, for example, are
paid a year's salary if they are fired, while assistant coaches are
not.
</P>
<P>
   There are potential problems, and the progress the two sides
have made could evaporate. Still, the coaches have established
themselves as a formidable bargaining entity and the NFL, to its
credit, is recognizing that some things need to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Upshaw Foresight Credited &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If a poll were taken of players regarding Gene Upshaw, executive
director of the National Football League Players Association, his
approval ratings would be sky-high. After watching professional
basketball players go through a destructive lockout, football
players have been privately thanking Upshaw for avoiding any major
conflict with the owners over the last collective bargaining
agreement, signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   This coming season, the salary cap will increase $5 million to
$57.5 million a team, which means more money for players. That is
another reason they are happy with Upshaw.

BRONCOS' COMMITMENT CAME FROM CELEBRATION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Twelve months ago, the Denver Broncos had been Super
Bowl champions for a matter of minutes when, in the midst of the
celebration, Coach Mike Shanahan warned them of how difficult it
would be to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded our guys there is only one chance to get back to
the Super Bowl, and that is to have a better off-season workout
program than we did the year before,'' Shanahan recalled this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Broncos will be playing for a second consecutive
championship in Super Bowl XXXIII. Just to get to that point,
Shanahan said, players had to come to training camp with ``a sense
of urgency, some resolve that we weren't there as Super Bowl
champs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there as a team that was unproven and the one thing
that mattered is what we did this year _ not what we had done in
the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The off-season weight-lifting program was the start; more
players attended it than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they have been on a mission. Much of Shanahan's
efforts have been geared to learning why teams do not repeat, and
what must happen for that rare twin to be accomplished. Only six
teams have repeated as Super Bowl champion, the last being Dallas
five years ago. No team has ever won three straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of focus,'' suggested Ed Donatell, the coach of
the Broncos' defensive backs. Like all the other position coaches
on the defending champions, he spent time with his players
discussing the philosophy of how you return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you win, everyone's after you,'' Donatell said. ``We talk
about it in our room all the time _ great teams keep getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Broncos see it, the fact that they did not go undefeated
has actually helped them, has positioned them to win this Super
Bowl. They won their first 13 games of the season. Then they lost
on the road to the Giants and at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undefeated season was wearing on this team,'' Donatell
said. ``But the road losses refocused us. Personally, I wouldn't
want to have come here unscathed. I'd rather it doesn't come up in
a playoff situation. After we lost to the Giants and Miami, we
said, `Hey, back to the drawing board.'''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Falcons Coach Dan Reeves' ninth Super Bowl as a
player or coach, and his fourth as a head coach. His first three
appearances as a head coach came with the Broncos, all losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys forget the price they had to pay to get back,'' Reeves
said. ``I think it's a lot easier for a losing team to get there.
Winning teams forget. Mike's done a great job to get the Broncos
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested to Shanahan, he has an advantage this year over
Reeves. His team has been there, and the Falcons have not been to
the playoffs since the 1995 season and have never been to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say it's an advantage,'' said Shanahan, whose
Broncos faced a Green Bay team that was trying to repeat last year.
``Some people said we were at a disadvantage last year against
Green Bay, and that made us a little hungrier. When you talk about
those things, it comes down to how you play on Sunday. If you've
been there, or haven't been there, all that's thrown out to me.''
</P>
<P>
   John Elway is back for a fifth Super Bowl. Elway, who is
expected to retire after this season, returned for a back-to-back
attempt. He even wanted to retire before last year's Super Bowl. In
the week before the conference championship game last season, he
held a vote at the dinner table. Should he play in 1998? He voted
no, but was overruled by his wife, Janet, and their four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' he said, ``I can never get my wife and kids in
the same place. They're always out. So there will be no vote _ and
no absentee ballots.''

CATCH THEM IF YOU CAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant is not going anywhere for at least five years,
remaining with the Lakers in Los Angeles until at least 2003. The
same goes for Allen Iverson in Philadelphia, Shareef Abdur-Rahim in
Vancouver and Antoine Walker in Boston. The rash of young stars
signing lucrative extensions with their original teams has curbed
player movement and may signal a new era in the National Basketball
Association _ one with fewer monster deals but more permanence on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly how Commissioner David Stern and the National
Basketball Association owners had hoped the new collective
bargaining agreement would work _ and exactly how player agents
hoped it would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that Antoine Walker, Allen Iverson, Zydrunas
Ilgauskas, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Kobe will be staying with their
teams is something very positive,'' Stern said on Friday. ``The
movement that tends to occur at that age is not happening, and
that's immediate dividends for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not talking about how much more Allen Iverson and
Antoine Walker could have gotten,'' Stern added. ``They're talking
about signing the largest contracts in the history of the 76ers and
Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no doubt that Kobe, Iverson, Walker and
Shareef lost considerable dollars under this deal, it just can't be
disputed,'' said Bryant's agent, Arn Tellem, after the 20-year-old
signed a six-year, $70 million extension with the Lakers. ``I don't
think the money they've lost has shifted to the middle class. It's
remained in the owners' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a big-picture perspective, they're just fine,'' he added.
``But there's no doubt that they're getting less than what the
market will bear for their services.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant joined Iverson, Abdur-Rahim and Walker _ the first, third
and sixth picks in 1996 _ and the Cavaliers' Ilgauskas in receiving
enormous deals since the opening of camps last week. All signed
six-year contracts worth a reported $71 million, the maximum
allowed under the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But lost in the shuffle are a few players who cannot possibly
receive their fair market value: Jimmy Jackson, Dennis Rodman and
Rod Strickland, unsigned veterans hoping to hook on with a team.
</P>
<P>
   Because teams have few exceptions to offer, Kevin Johnson and
Rodman may have to retire. Many teams with salary-cap room spent
most of their money on one player, causing a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   After Houston acquired Scottie Pippen from Chicago in a
sign-and-trade deal, Charles Barkley was forced to play for the $1
million exception in Houston with the hope that he will be
compensated in a year. The acquisition of Vlade Divac in Sacramento
forced Corliss Williamson to play for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   While several middle-class players have benefited from the deal
_ Matt Geiger got a $54 million windfall from the 76ers and Charlie
Ward and Chris Dudley signed close to $30 million deals with the
Knicks _ guys like Sherman Douglas are still looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Williams for Alderman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams never understood why his peers holed up in their
hotel rooms and avoided the masses when they could have been trying
out new material on fans. He paraded around Manhattan during the
All-Star weekend last February as if he was running for office.
During the lockout, he was a one-man media conglomerate, appearing
on network and cable television and any 1,000-watt radio station
that had an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   His message: We need to think about our fans before ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the league has finally taken his lead. A kinder,
gentler NBA is emerging from the lockout. If it's not the free
scrimmages and the subsequent autograph sessions, it's the players
passing out signed basketballs before preseason games. In Portland,
Rasheed Wallace and teammates gave away hot dogs for an hour behind
a concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how long the goodwill will last and
whether or not it's merely designed to win fans back after the
messy labor dispute. But it's a drastic change from the slew of
scorned kids who chased athletes to their cars and through the team
hotels to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond strengthening the drug agreement, the N.B.A. has
implemented several marketing strategies to improve the league's
relations with its fans. Aside from an ``I Still Love This Game''
ad campaign, a few surprises are still expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sensitive to closing up the heretofore wide gap
between players and fans,'' David Stern said. ``The union and the
league felt it was time for the players to stress responsibility
and commitment to their teams and fans. Watching the players the
past few weeks has been as encouraging as watching the fans'
reaction to the open scrimmages. I suppose the fair question to ask
us is, `What took you so long?' Well, we knew this issue was coming
and we've tried to take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, incidentally, donated $20,000 of his new contract to
workers at Continental Arena Friday night during halftime of the
Nets preseason game with the Knicks. It was his way of saying
thanks to the parking attendants, concessionaires and ushers at the
arena.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Man of His Word &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Buck Williams' good name prevents him from pulling a Rodman,
retiring and unretiring within a span of 24 hours. But the 17-year
veteran, who said goodbye to the NBA and the Knicks during a
touching press conference on Wednesday, actually had a chance to
play for someone other than the Knicks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone asked Williams through intermediaries to come to
Utah and play for the pro-rated, mid-level exception salary of
$1.75 million. The Jazz, in its quest to win a title, needed a
decent veteran off the bench after the loss of Antoine Carr via
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have known about that before I retired, I might
have given it a little more consideration,'' Williams said. ``But I
gave my word.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Around the League &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones have seemingly been going
everywhere the past few weeks, except staying with the Lakers. The
newest rumor is Orlando, where Horace Grant would become expendable
if Dennis Rodman decides to play for the $1 million exception.
Since that may not happen, the Lakers are still shopping the two
players to Charlotte and Miami ... Vinny Del Negro is close to
signing a multi-year deal with Milwaukee... LaPhonso Ellis is
leaning toward signing for a mid-level exception in Atlanta ...
Talk about Knick curiosity: Latrell Sprewell's debut at Madison
Square Garden received a 4.1 rating on the MSG Network, meaning 4.1
percent of all television households were tuned in to the preseason
game with the Nets. The average regular-season rating for a game is
around 2.4.  &QL;

DAVIS MAKES LATE PICKS PROUD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Jan. 30 _ Terrell Davis, like Jamal Anderson, was nearly
a forgotten man when his time arrived for the National Football
League draft. Anderson was overlooked in 1994 _ 200 players were
selected before him. And the following year, Davis lasted until the
sixth round and was the 196th player chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal was in the same situation, and to come in from a late
draft pick and and do the things that we're doing right now, it's
great,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to go out there and play well so that people
that are drafted in the late rounds aren't discouraged about coming
into this league. At least they know that even if they are drafted
late, they can come in and contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Contribute?
</P>
<P>
   Few could match Davis's run. Davis, 26, was named most valuable
player of Super Bowl XXXII last year in his hometown of San Diego.
Through 18 games this season he has rushed for a league record
2,374 yards. He has played seven post-season games in his career;
he has rushed for more than 100 yards in each. His playoff average
is a league-record 148.3 rushing yards a game and 5.8 average yards
a carry. He rushed for 199 yards against Miami and 167 against the
Jets in his two playoff games this year.
</P>
<P>
   This guy shows big all the time. He shows even bigger in big
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at any sport, it's imperative that if you want to
put your signature on it, you have to win championships,'' Davis
said. ``That's the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,'' Davis
added, ``you look at Emmitt Smith, you look at the people that won,
Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, all these people have won championships.
And that's what it takes to really put your signature on the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis played for George Allen at Long Beach State. He struggled
with injuries and struggled proving himself after transferring to
Georgia. But in Denver he has found a home.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dorsett is the player Davis wanted to emulate. And Davis
has begun to do that on and off the field in production and in
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   His dream run in Super Bowl XXXIII?
</P>
<P>
   ``The perfect run would be some sort of dive play,'' he said.
``I break a few tackles and outrun a guy into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it would be the play to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   No question, Davis could do it. &QL;

gentler NBA is emerging from the lockout. If it's not the free
scrimmages and the subsequent autograph sessions, it's the players
passing out signed basketballs before preseason games. In Portland,
Rasheed Wallace and teammates gave away hot dogs for an hour behind
a concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how long the goodwill will last and
whether or not it's merely designed to win fans back after the
messy labor dispute. But it's a drastic change from the slew of
scorned kids who chased athletes to their cars and through the team
hotels to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond strengthening the drug agreement, the N.B.A. has
implemented several marketing strategies to improve the league's
relations with its fans. Aside from an ``I Still Love This Game''
ad campaign, a few surprises are still expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sensitive to closing up the heretofore wide gap
between players and fans,'' David Stern said. ``The union and the
league felt it was time for the players to stress responsibility
and commitment to their teams and fans. Watching the players the
past few weeks has been as encouraging as watching the fans'
reaction to the open scrimmages. I suppose the fair question to ask
us is, `What took you so long?' Well, we knew this issue was coming
and we've tried to take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, incidentally, donated $20,000 of his new contract to
workers at Continental Arena Friday night during halftime of the
Nets preseason game with the Knicks. It was his way of saying
thanks to the parking attendants, concessionaires and ushers at the
arena.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Man of His Word &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Buck Williams' good name prevents him from pulling a Rodman,
retiring and unretiring within a span of 24 hours. But the 17-year
veteran, who said goodbye to the NBA and the Knicks during a
touching press conference on Wednesday, actually had a chance to
play for someone other than the Knicks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone asked Williams through intermediaries to come to
Utah and play for the pro-rated, mid-level exception salary of
$1.75 million. The Jazz, in its quest to win a title, needed a
decent veteran off the bench after the loss of Antoine Carr via
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have known about that before I retired, I might
have given it a little more consideration,'' Williams said. ``But I
gave my word.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Around the League &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones have seemingly been going
everywhere the past few weeks, except staying with the Lakers. The
newest rumor is Orlando, where Horace Grant would become expendable
if Dennis Rodman decides to play for the $1 million exception.
Since that may not happen, the Lakers are still shopping the two
players to Charlotte and Miami ... Vinny Del Negro is close to
signing a multi-year deal with Milwaukee... LaPhonso Ellis is
leaning toward signing for a mid-level exception in Atlanta ...
Talk about Knick curiosity: Latrell Sprewell's debut at Madison
Square Garden received a 4.1 rating on the MSG Network, meaning 4.1
percent of all television households were tuned in to the preseason
game with the Nets. The average regular-season rating for a game is
around 2.4.  &QL;

AUTOMATIC PUPIL PROMOTION: MOTIVATOR OR DETERRENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., Ill)   (bl) 
By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is not on the standard list of childhood
phobias, but an overblown fear of being kept back and made to
repeat a grade afflicts almost every member of Bonnie Kornblatt's
fourth-grade class at Meredith Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid worries about it,'' said Diva, a fourth grader who
shakes her short black curls nervously as she contemplates the idea
of retention. ``You wouldn't be with your friends, you'd be with
younger kids. They'd tease you and call you names and think you
weren't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, said Damon, adding: ``I had a friend who got left down
and he said it was really embarrassing. You feel stupid. And my
sister says if you stay back once, you'll never go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear of being kept back is intense these days, and not just in
Ms. Kornblatt's class. Nationwide, many schoolchildren either heard
or heard about President Clinton's State of the Union address in
which he advocated federal financial rewards for schools that end
the policy known as social promotion, or moving children from grade
to grade regardless of their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, like Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities, is
already moving in that direction, adopting tougher standards for
promotion as part of an overall effort to raise academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   But while politicians decry social promotion, many education
experts say the real problem is that huge numbers of children are
already being kept back _ to their detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, by the time they are 15 to 17, 40 to 50 percent of
black and Hispanic children, and 25 to 35 percent of white children
are not at the grade you would expect for their age,'' said Robert
Hauser, a University of Wisconsin demographer who was co-editor of
a recent National Academy of Sciences report on testing and
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our report finds that all the available evidence shows that
retention leads to lower academic achievement and increases the
likelihood of school dropout,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at their reading tables, in groups of five or six, the
Meredith fourth graders came up with all the policy arguments that
grown-ups have invoked in the long debate over promotion and
retention. They try to balance the blow to self-esteem and the
possibility that children will become too discouraged against the
need to master the basics of education before going on to more
advanced work, to establish that promotion and standards count for
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cool thing to stay back,'' Julian said. ``Kids
really tease you, and treat you like you don't know anything. But I
think you should be left back if you really need to. Like if you
never know your times tables, you'll never catch up. You'll just
fall more behind. You could be in trouble if you don't know a lot
of multiplication.''
</P>
<P>
   And, being children, the fourth graders had some unusual ideas.
``I don't think it's good to keep kids back,'' John said, ``because
you might get addicted to your teacher if you stay for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most education experts, the Meredith fourth graders said
that children having trouble in school should first be offered
summer school, tutoring and after-school programs, with retention
used only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather go to summer school than stay back,'' Doug
said. ``The kids at summer school wouldn't tease you because that's
why they'd be there, too. And nobody else would know.''
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone thought it would be a social disaster to be
kept back, some said that academically, it might be a motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good to make kids stay back if they don't get the
work the teacher assigned you,'' Jennifer said. ``Because the next
year, it's just going to be harder work, and how are you going to
keep up? You've got to learn. You've got to get an education.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the school board is planning to hold summer
school for about 10,000 children who have done poorly in 3rd, 7th
or 11th grades. And next year, those who do not meet the benchmark
standards for promotion from 4th, 8th and 12th grades will be made
to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Philadelphia, 5.3 percent of all kindergarteners
through eighth graders _ 6,813 children _ were held back, a
retention rate typical of many urban school districts.
</P>
<P>
   But schools have had great discretion in making those decisions,
and at Meredith, principal Stuart Cooperstein said that only one
child out of 250 had been kept back last year.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, though, the new policy will impose citywide
standards for promotion, so that, for example, those finishing
fourth grade in June 2000 will have to pass language arts,
mathematics, science and social studies, and achieve certain scores
on reading and math tests, to go on to fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the bogyman is already at the door. In January,
letters went out to parents of pupils at risk _ about 50 at
Meredith _ warning of the possible consequences of academic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A review of ----'s work this far,'' the letters say,
``indicates the possibility that he may not be promoted at the
close of this school year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with their school's low retention rate, all the students at
Meredith seem to know someone, in their family or their
neighborhood or their class, who had been held back _ and they
consider it an all-too-vivid possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really scared about it,'' Karen said. ``You want to make
your parents proud, and they'd be so disappointed. You'd be
embarrassed, and if you're 12 years old and you're in fifth grade,
kids would be calling you names all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think children should get help so they don't have to stay
back. Children who aren't so good at reading should get more help
than other children, because they need it. My mom said she'd try to
get me someone to come to my house and help with my homework, when
she's working.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials agreed to allow interviews of Meredith pupils
in the fourth and seventh grades on the condition that they be
identified only by their first name _ and by no name at all when
they talked about school difficulties they or their relatives
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to my cousin,'' said one wide-eyed fourth grader.
``She had to stay back and she was so scared how much the kids
would tease her that she didn't go to school for the first two
days. She was so embarrassed to be older than the others. She felt
so stupid. But it made her work harder, so it wouldn't happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another child, however, said his older brother had stayed back,
and although he was promoted the next year, he is still not doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   While some children, especially younger ones, thought staying
back motivated students to work harder, others who had experienced
it themselves or through relatives said the strategy could easily
backfire. ``I think you'd be so ashamed you might not go back to
school anymore, and then you'd drop out,'' said one. ``You feel
like you've already failed, so you give up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, studies show that most children kept back more than
once drop out of school before graduating, and the current
Philadelphia policy _ but not the new one _ says no child may be
kept back more than once in kindergarten through eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh graders, who will have to meet the new standards
next year, had their own fears about being kept back, even though
none of those interviewed in Chuck Brenner's math class had heard
anything about the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be summer school for seventh graders who
aren't doing well?'' said Catie, in some surprise. ``OK, I better
start working harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they had always worried about being kept back, so
the policy would not have any effect on them. ``My grandparents
tell me all the time, if I get a bad grade on a test, that I better
get to work, or I might have to stay back.'' Morgan said. ``I'm
already scared enough.''
</P>
<P>
   One seventh grader, hearing about the new policy, looked
stricken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This already happened to me,'' he said. ``When I was in third
grade, I wasn't doing so well and they wanted to hold me back. I
remember when they told me, I just went and sat down for a long
time. Then I asked my mom if I could go to summer school. My
parents were kind of disappointed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   How is he doing now? ``Not so well, really,'' he said. ``But I'm
trying.''

CLINTON SEEKS STRONGER STATE ROLE ON ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore., Wash., Mass., Fla., Ind., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The environmental proposals that the Clinton
administration is sending to Congress in its budget request for the
year 2000 include new ways for delivering money to state and local
governments to spend as they see fit, a sign that environmental
power-sharing is taking a firmer hold than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is seeking to spend $34 billion on
environmental programs in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, a
5 percent increase over the amount Congress approved for the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the White House is seeking expanded grants
of conservation funds to states for purchasing ecologically
sensitive lands; federal payments to cities for controlling the air
pollutants that cause global warming; tax credits to make it
cheaper for local authorities to issue bonds for environmental
purposes, and bigger federal contributions to state revolving funds
that pay for municipal water treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money is aimed at specific states for particular
purposes, like a program announced last week that would help
California, Oregon and Washington protect the habitat of endangered
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But if Congress agrees with these plans, the states and the
cities would compete for most of the money and would largely
control how it is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the pattern showed a
heightened commitment to shifting more power over environmental
programs away from Washington, meeting a goal long cherished by
local officials and a policy frequently urged by Republicans in
Congress. This approach also carries significant political
advantages for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the budget are ideas that include a new financing tool
called ``better America bonds,'' which would use $700 million in
federal tax incentives to help generate $9.5 billion in bond
authority over the next five years. States that borrowed this money
at subsidized interest rates could choose to spend it to create
parks, protect water quality and clean up the abandoned industrial
sites known as ``brownfields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big turning point,'' said Carol Browner,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. She said it
grew from the agency's past efforts to encourage local governments
to clean up brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the brownfields program, EPA never wrote a single rule or
regulation,'' Ms. Browner said. ``EPA never said, it is this
property and that property that qualify. And in the better America
bonds program, EPA will allot the tax incentives, but EPA will
never make the decisions that it is this green space or that green
space that qualifies.''
</P>
<P>
   The state role in environmental programs is not completely new.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as one federal law after another set national
environmental standards, the states have assumed much of the
responsibility for carrying out the mandates under federal
supervision. And that trend has been accelerating for years: By
1998, the EPA had delegated responsibility to individual states for
managing 757 environmental programs, an increase of 323, or nearly
75 percent, from five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Local revenues provide 80 percent of the money that they spend
in their own environmental budgets, according to the Environmental
Council of the States, which consists of the heads of the states'
environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But for a number of reasons, some pragmatic and some political,
the administration seems to be emphasizing the states' role in the
new budget.
</P>
<P>
   First, it might help ease the strains between states and federal
authorities over environmental priorities, chiefly how strictly to
enforce national environmental laws. This has been a constant
source of friction.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it might help persuade Congress to increase overall
environmental spending, an area of the budget in which the White
House has fought bitterly year after year with appropriations
committees controlled by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it might make some specific administration initiatives
more palatable to foes in Congress. An example is the program to
fight global warming by controlling the waste gases that scientists
say threaten to disrupt the planet's climate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, expanding federal spending in states, cities and
counties from coast to coast is an obvious tool for Vice President
Al Gore, the administration's point man on matters environmental,
to highlight his accomplishments in campaign stops as he runs for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Several state officials said they were very pleased by the
trend, especially the emphasis on the state and local role in a $1
billion land conservation initiative that is the centerpiece of the
administration's environmental budget.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative includes $150 million from the federal land and
water conservation fund for matching grants to states for land
purchases; $50 million for planning to control urban sprawl; $80
million for acquiring land to protect endangered species; $50
million for conservation easements on privately owned forest land;
$40 million for wooded urban areas; $50 million to help protect
farmland from urban encroachment, and a few smaller initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   David Struhs, who left his job last week as Massachusetts'
environmental commissioner to take a similar post in the new
administration of Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, said he believed
the administration was ``on the right track'' for both substantive
and political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that the Clinton administration does better than
most is they make sure they have truth-tested these things in the
public opinion polls before they roll them out,'' Struhs said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the governors are hearing the same messages,
especially on conservation of lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you actually listen to and read the rhetoric of Al Gore on
these issues and compare it to Gov. Paul Cellucci in Massachusetts
and Gov. Jeb Bush in Florida, there are remarkable parallels in
where they see environmental policy going,'' Struhs said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other political figures, though, were more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little ambivalent when the government creates what are
sometimes irrational requirements for cities, then gives them a
little money to help deal with them,'' said the Republican mayor of
Indianapolis, Stephen Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., the chairman of a subcommittee of
the Senate Appropriations Committee that deals with environmental
programs, said he had always supported generous financing for the
state's revolving funds, which pay for many clean air and water
programs, but that he did not yet know enough about the
administration's new programs to endorse them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration, like the other administrations before it,
has had a habit of creating a whole bunch of boutique programs each
year, and taking a few dollars for this and a few dollars for
that,'' Bond said. ``I have generally opposed creating more
boutique programs until we can fund the ones that already exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new programs is a ``clean air partnership fund'' that
will provide $200 million to states and localities to reduce both
so-called greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants that come
from automobiles and coal-powered electric plants. The money can be
used to provide low-interest loans or matching grants, potentially
increasing the amount of investment flowing from the relatively
small federal contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, $100 million sought for the year 2000 in new
assistance to state, local and tribal governments would be matched
dollar for dollar by local governments willing to spend the money
to protect salmon habitat by buying conservation easements,
planting trees along river banks and taking similar steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year from now, a substantial part of the Northwest,
including large urban areas near the Puget Sound, are going to be
endangered salmon habitat,'' said George Frampton, acting director
of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ``Regulation
alone, listing the salmon as endangered, isn't going to get the
salmon restored to health. It is going to take a partnership of the
counties, the mayors, companies like Boeing and Microsoft, and the
federal government to address this problem.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Expect styles that are scrappy and clever and then look
for fighters and holders and even biters when the Denver Broncos
and the Atlanta Falcons meet in Super Bowl XXXIII on Sunday at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This game will be all about grit. It starts, where all games do,
at the point of attack. Along line play. It will get nasty in
there. Downright dirty.
</P>
<P>
   And because Denver and Atlanta insist on physical, run-oriented
football and because each defense swears that the other side will
not be allowed to trample it with the run, something has to give.
Something has to break.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what happens during most of Super Bowl XXXIII, all of it
is set up to deliver the running game. See that 50-yard bomb?
Somebody's trying to set up some runs. See that fancy screen pass
right? The quick-trap running play is next. Run, run, run.
Play-action pass. Then more run, run, run.
</P>
<P>
   This Super Bowl pits the top rusher from the American Football
Conference, Denver's Terrell Davis, against the top runner from the
National Football Conference, Atlanta's Jamal Anderson. It is only
the second time this has happened in 33 Super Bowls _ the first
coming in Super Bowl XXVIII, when Buffalo's Thurman Thomas went
against Dallas' Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   These are two teams that run it till they drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta defense knows what is ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you are running, that is where you are going to find
us,'' said Don Blackmon, the Atlanta linebackers coach, of the
Falcons' run defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Crockett, a Denver cornerback. said: ``We will play this
game with all 11 players on the field involved in the run defense.
And if we could use 12 or 13, we would.''
</P>
<P>
   What's at stake in stopping the run? Well, you don't want to get
soaked. It's as if you have new shoes and you don't want to spill
water on them. Then you go outside and step into a puddle. Then it
begins to rain. A spill becomes a misstep, and then comes the
downpour.
</P>
<P>
   The team that kicks its running game into gear will most likely
kick its entire game into gear. All things flow from the run. Fancy
passes. Ball-control offense. A worn and tired defense for the
other side. A fresh one for you.
</P>
<P>
   And the effect on the other team? Soaked.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there will be plenty of fireworks in the passing game and
sparks in special teams play, but the running game is Super Bowl
XXXIII's backbone. Both teams have built themselves this way,
relying on effective offensive lines, dynamic backs and persistent
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The glamour guys are Davis and Anderson. Davis rushed for 2,008
yards, averaged 5.1 yards per rushing attempt and scored 21
touchdowns in the regular season. Anderson rushed for 1,846 yards,
averaged 4.5 yards per carry and scored 14 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, Terrell Davis could have rushed for 2,500 yards this
season,'' said Bill Kollar, Atlanta's defensive line coach. ``There
were a lot of games where he ran for so many yards and Denver was
up by so much that they sat him down way early and just let him
rest. He's powerful and explosive and he breaks tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is powerful, too, but he dances more, jigs a little,
bounces inside and outside. This is unusual, especially considering
that both players stand 5 feet 11 inches, but Anderson weighs 234
pounds, 24 more than Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The lighter guy, not the heavier one, should do the dancing,
right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we've played a guy who like Terrell is so
determined and confident at running back,'' said Maa Tanuvasa,
Denver's right defensive end. ``He's got spin moves and can juke
you, but he doesn't mind pinning his ears back and running over
you. We understand that like Terrell, he is a special player.''
</P>
<P>
   Two special players who run behind two splendid offensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gibbs, the Broncos' offensive line coach, keeps pressure on
his players. He is vocal and intense. His linemen play that way.
They are quicker and lighter as a group than most pro lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is not necessarily to blow guys 10 yards back off the
line of scrimmage,'' said Dan Neil, the Broncos' right guard.
``Sometimes all we need to do is get movement one way or the other
and create a seam. Terrell has great vision. He has a great feel
for defensive linemen. He reads them and then gets by them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos ask everyone to block. Even John Elway occasionally
throws a chip block on a defender. Denver's run assignments are so
intricate that one man who is imprecise can ruin the entire play.
</P>
<P>
   Denver loves to find or create a gap for Davis' quick-hitting
runs. And the line is wonderful at creating a wash, when defenders'
movements are used to wash or sweep them out of a play, forcing
them to overpursue and leave cutback lanes open for Davis. That is
one of the tactics Davis best employs: cutting back against the
grain and flow of the defense. He is often aided on cutbacks by his
receivers' blocks, especially those by the 6-5 Ed McCaffrey, who is
savvy at plucking off safeties.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and the Falcons approach the run game more simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Shanahan's history is to spread you out and get a couple
of quick scores and later give you a heavy dose of Terrell,'' the
Falcons' Blackmon of the Denver head coach. ``Our offense is
disciplined and hard-nosed. We play a power game.''
</P>
<P>
   One that says: Here comes the Atlanta offensive line. Here comes
Anderson. Stop it if you can.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson likes to cut back, too, but he runs behind a line that
is bigger than Denver's and that loves to drive block. Both
offensive lines are taught to finish their plays and to communicate
tirelessly. The tight ends _Shannon Sharpe for Denver and O.J.
Santiago for Atlanta _ both are adept at run-blocking. And the two
teams enjoy running from a double tight end formation, so expect
plenty of that on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Each star back is aided by a bruising, lead-blocking fullback.
For Denver it is Howard Griffith. For Atlanta is Brian Kozlowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to pack the mail and somebody's got to deliver
it,'' Griffith said. ``The blockers pack it. Those guys deliver it.
The main keys for me are creating angles for Terrell and getting
myself out of the hole so he can see clearly and more easily make
his decisions on where he will go. In our jobs as blockers, you've
got to check your ego at the door. I could catch 40 passes and run
for 800 yards in a season, but that way this team is not going to
the Super Bowl. I know that.''

 MIAMI: know that.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, how will the running games be defended?
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami, the first time they played Denver, held Terrell to 29
rushing yards,'' Blackmon said. ``They stunted a lot on defense and
based those stunts on Denver tendencies. They created disruption
with run blitzes into the Denver offensive line. They held them
down and won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rematch, Miami came back and tried the same thing. But
Denver changed everything around. Miami was blitzing and stunting
to the wrong holes. And when you do that, play the guessing game
and guess wrong against that line and Terrell, you are hurting your
team. We won't live on that. It's too risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta wants to play gap control, center its defense on the
idea that each player must stand tall in his area of responsibility
and not float. In essence, the Falcons' defense is based on an
imaginative triangle scheme. The three players who form the
triangle are tackles Travis Hall and Shane Dronett and middle
linebacker Jessie Tuggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the NFL holds _ they do it a little better than
most,'' Rich Brooks, Atlanta's defensive coordinator, said of the
Denver offensive line. ``So, we have talked a lot about not only
maintaining gaps but also shedding blocks. Our defense is
predicated on the two tackles, Travis Hall and Shane Dronett, and
the middle linebacker, Jessie Tuggle. We work from the middle to
the outside toward both ends. All defense begins with defending the
middle. It's going to be very interesting what happens in the long
running game. We have allowed only three runs all season of 20
yards or more; they have 17 of those. Who's going to win that
battle?''
</P>
<P>
   Three important Denver defenders against the run are left tackle
Keith Traylor and linebackers Bill Romanowski and John Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traylor can make the big hit,'' said Greg Robinson, Denver's
defensive coordinator. ``Romanowski is a hitter in the run and pass
game. Mobley moves sideline to sideline and makes effort plays. We
need all 11 in the run game, but these guys have the ability to
really get us going.''
</P>
<P>
   The running game is a product of discipline and desire.
Execution. Commitment. One team will most likely win this Super
Bowl by rushing. The other will finish all wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it personally upon myself to lead in our defense
against Terrell Davis,'' Tuggle said. ``I did not come this far to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' Crockett countered: ``The desire on our team is
crazy. We have a chance to put ourselves in history as one of the
greatest teams ever. We can become the sixth team in Super Bowl
history to win back-to-back championships. That's something special
to shoot for. We're going to take our best run at that.''

<HEADLINE>
BAYLOR HAS SOME INDIVIDUAL HITTING PROJECTS FOR THE BRAVES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Don Baylor suddenly became open to job offers last
September after his dismissal as manager of the Colorado Rockies,
he had a host of opportunities, but one clearly stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of the World Series,'' Baylor said. ``When I
looked at the options I had, Atlanta was the choice for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In this last decade of baseball's century, the Braves have
played in the World Series four times, twice as often as any other
team. But their critics point out that they have won the World
Series only once and, with seven successive division championships,
they have squandered three other opportunities to reach the World
Series by losing in the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their October failures, the Braves have had far more
success than any other team in Atlanta. The Falcons, who have a
football game against the Denver Broncos Sunday night, are in the
Super Bowl for the first time. But their coach, Dan Reeves, can
relate to the criticism the Braves and their manager, Bobby Cox,
have endured because in the span of four seasons he took a team,
the Broncos, to the Super Bowl three times and lost each time.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Falcons lose, Reeves will again hear the cries that
he cannot win the ultimate game. Even though the Braves won
baseball's ultimate series in 1995, Cox has been maligned for not
engineering more championships. But if the Falcons lose, Reeves and
his team, unlike the Braves, will not have a guarantee that they
will be back in the playoffs next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves do not actually have a guarantee; it is just that
they are a good team that is the class of the National League East.
The Mets have made a flurry of moves this winter in an effort to
catch the Braves, but the Braves have made some moves intended to
correct the flaws that have undermined their previous post-season
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Using a piece of the strongest element of the team, the starting
pitching, the Braves traded Denny Neagle to Cincinnati for Bret
Boone, who is one of the league's best hitting and fielding second
basemen. Then they signed Brian Jordan to play right field and add
even more hitting to an offense that had four players slug more
than 30 home runs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are two real good defensive players, plus they
have an attitude about them,'' Baylor said of Boone and Jordan.
``They're not your briefcase-carrying guys. They're blue-collar
type of guys that they probably need in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have also shaken up their coaching staff, which is
why Baylor now works for them. He has replaced Clarence Jones, who
for the past 11 seasons was their hitting coach. Baylor's
credentials for the job are exemplified in the six-and-a-half-year
success of Andres Galarraga, the Braves' first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   As the St. Louis hitting coach in 1992, Baylor rejuvenated
Galarraga and salvaged his career, turning him into a .300 hitter
with power and exceptional run-producing ability, which Baylor used
in Colorado for five years. As the Braves' hitting coach, Baylor
wants to address several aspects of the team's offense. For one
thing, he wants to slash the number of strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years they've had over 1,000 strikeouts,'' said
Baylor, whose Rockies were the only NL team under 1,000 last
season. ``That told me a little something about their troubles in
the playoffs. It seems to me they didn't make an adjustment in
their approach to how they were being pitched. You have to have a
thought process: hit the ball the other way, cut down on
strikeouts, put the ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Braves tied a major league record last season by
hitting home runs in 25 consecutive games, Baylor said: ``You get
to the point where you hit a home run and strike out three times
and say, `I went one for four with a home run; that's OK' That's
not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   As potent as the Braves were offensively, Baylor sees some
individual projects that could produce even more runs with a more
versatile offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko: ``I want to see his left-handed bat be what Fred
McGriff was for that team,'' Baylor said. ``He can be one of the
premier guys in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones: ``With Chipper getting better every year, I'd
like to see what the deal is with his right-handed stroke, why
that's such a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones: ``He's one of those guys who tries to pull
everything. What he can do power-wise, there's so much potential
there. He had a real good second half. He's still young and
learning the league.''
</P>
<P>
   In getting hitters to be more disciplined at the plate, to
change their all-or-nothing approach, Baylor hopes to have the
Braves manufacture more runs as well as producing them with home
runs. If good pitching, which the Braves see in the playoffs, shuts
down the long ball, a team has to be able to score with singles and
sacrifice bunts, ground balls to the right side of the infield and
sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   The method does not guarantee a spot in the World Series, but
the Braves, like their critics, are not satisfied with all of the
results in their decade and will keep making changes until they get
it right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Andro Noose &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is in no hurry to make a decision on the
status of androstenedione, the testosterone-producing pill that
Mark McGwire turned into a household name. The last thing officials
want to do is tarnish McGwire's superhuman feat last season by
labeling the pills off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   But however long officials take to settle andro's status and
whatever they decide, minor league players could be confronted with
a problem during the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Because professional baseball players will be permitted to play
in the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, next year, minor leaguers who
are not on the 40-man rosters of major league teams will be
eligible for the United States team and the teams of other
countries. But if they use andro, they had better beware.
</P>
<P>
   The pill is on the Olympics' banned list, and all athletes face
the possibility of being tested for prohibited substances. The
company that manufactures andro has said that at least 100 players
in the minors and majors use it. If any of those wind up on
Olympics teams and test positive for andro, they will be banned
from the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in July will serve
as the regional qualifying tournament for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Learned Dr. Tewksbury &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Tewksbury has ended his 11-year pitching career, but his
campaign against the designated hitter goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a handful of classes to complete his work for a college
degree, Tewksbury took a course in the history of sports at New
England College this winter and carried his opposition to the d.h.
into the classroom. Not surprisingly, he concluded in a paper that
the d.h. has not achieved what the American League hoped it would
when the position was introduced in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In his paper, Tewksbury argued that the d.h. has not only
eliminated game strategy but has also slowed the pace of games and
lengthened them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it is documented that this increase is just a few
minutes,'' the 38-year-old retiree wrote, ``the lack of strategy
makes it feel like a much longer experience. My recommendation is
that the American League hand out free packages of No-Doz to
prevent their fans from falling asleep during AL games.''
</P>
<P>
   Tewksbury, who began his professional career in the Yankees
organization in 1981, has long criticized the use of the d.h., even
though he himself was not much of a hitter. He batted .132 in his
career, striking out 118 times in 380 times at bat. He also drove
in 19 runs, scored 19 and walked 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a worse feeling in the world than going up against
Pedro Martinez and knowing you don't have a chance,'' he said.
``But there's no better feeling than bunting someone over and
having the next guy drive him in.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Crawling After Clemens &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As long as owners grovel to players, as Drayton McLane Jr. keeps
doing with Roger Clemens, they will never have the upper hand in
the salary escalation game that they are losing badly.
</P>
<P>
   McLane, the Houston Astros' owner, apologized last month to
Clemens for comments made by the team's general manager, Gerry
Hunsicker, about Clemens and the new contract he was seeking in the
event the Toronto Blue Jays traded him to the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Last week McLane said he was looking forward to seeing Clemens
at a Texas sports function because he wanted to apologize to him
``for what transpired in December.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane obviously would still like to have Clemens, but Hunsicker
was more forthright when he said the player's contract demands were
outrageous. If McLane really wants Clemens to play for the Astros,
he should sell the team to the pitcher's agents, Alan and Randy
Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   In his Toronto contract, Clemens had a clause in a side
agreement, since ruled illegal, that said he could request a trade
to the Astros after any season. The agreement did not spell out the
reason behind the provision, but people who know the reason said
the clause was included in case the Hendricks brothers, who live in
Houston, bought the team.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his questionable apologies, McLane likely violated
baseball's tampering rules when he said of Clemens, ``We still
would love for him to be a Houston Astro.''

L.A. PARK BOND PRIORITIES HIJACKED FOR PET PROJECTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Despite promises of dozens of new parks for
at-risk youths, the Los Angeles City Council and its staff wants to
seize control of spending a $750 million parks tax, delaying many
high-priority projects while putting their own pet programs on a
fast track, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commission President Steve Soboroff has been removed from
the steering committee picking new projects, and planning decisions
are now being made by a group of three top bureaucrats led by Chief
Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton, the City Council's top appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal that could go before the council next month,
projects that were not part of planning at the time of the 1996
Proposition K property tax assessment would leapfrog over dozens of
promised park developments.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fast-track projects are a new children's museum,
undeveloped land in the Santa Monica Mountains and programs at the
zoo and observatory in Griffith Park, while promised recreational
and park facilities from Hansen Dam and the Sepulveda Basin to
greenbelts along the Los Angeles River are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to sell $30 million in bonds against future Proposition
K revenues to finance seven projects comes out of City Hall, though
Deaton said various citizen constituencies pushed it. Only one San
Fernando Valley project, a $2.1 million North Hollywood child-care
center, would be included in the fast-track plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 34 Valley recreation and park projects worth more
than $60 million in Proposition K dollars are among dozens of
projects citywide that will get little or no funding for at least
the next five years under the current scenario, according to
Recreation and Parks Department records.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do this, they will be making the advisory committees
meaningless because we haven't seen this, we haven't approved this,
and we won't have had a decision in this,'' said Bruce Bialosky, a
CPA and chairman of the Valley Regional Volunteer Neighborhood
Oversight Committee, one of three committees that were supposed to
look out for voters' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is beyond my comprehension, unless someone muscled these
projects in. It is an improper way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills homeowner leader Gordon Murley said he signed the
ballot argument against Proposition K because he didn't trust City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what they put down in the ballot would be changed to
suit their political agenda, which is why we opposed it,'' he said.
``We knew they could change it at any time and that they were using
the kids as a reason people should vote for it when it was for
their own political ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff said parks tax funds have been so completely taken over
by the council and its staff that the department cannot do the
things it wants to do, which is to quickly complete dozens of park
and sports facilities voters were promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 40 or 50 projects that are ready to go, that voters
expect,'' Soboroff said. ``Every project should be bonded. I want
to see all these projects get going.'''
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff and others had planned to raise a lot of money by
selling bonds upfront against the 30-year revenue stream to provide
a citywide crash program for at-risk youths.
</P>
<P>
   That process was backed by Esther Feldman, a leading bond-issue
expert and author of two county recreation bonds totaling over $1
billion, who said cities throughout the United States often bond
against revenue from property assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``By dribbling it out, you're going to end up with a lot of
parks in disrepair, while if you yell loud enough, you get
something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Deaton has thwarted that effort, saying tax assessments are
inadequate to cover all the costs, so general fund money would be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   He said the steering committee _ constituting himself, Chief
Administrative Officer Keith Comrie and the city engineer's
designee, Brad Smith _ decided bonds would only be issued for
projects that could bring in matching funds from other sources. The
current list represents those parties who said they had access to a
match, Deaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Deaton said Soboroff and others should not have raised public
expectations and made it clear to voters that improvements would
take 30 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the seven projects on the current list were not among
those proposed prior to the 1996 ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   They came up among the proposals for the 20 percent of the
Proposition K money that was set aside for competitive grants.
Still, they didn't win the grant derby and were only brought into
the picture when funding questions reached City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of those projects, worth more than $14.4 million,
are tied to City Hall political figures.
</P>
<P>
   The projects include $9.4 million that would be bonded for a new
children's museum in Griffith Park. The president of the nonprofit
museum's board is Doug Ring, husband of Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski. The museum would need to come up with just over $2
million for its match, which Ring said he believes it can do.
</P>
<P>
   The other is $5 million for land acquisition in the Santa Monica
Mountains. All or a portion of that money is under consideration to
buy about 237 acres in Mandeville Canyon owned by police
commissioner and Valley businessman Bert Boeckmann. The Santa
Monica Conservancy or some other source would need to fund about $1
million of the total.

AMERICANS AT U.N. SEEK SCHOOL GRANTS FOREIGNERS GET 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A group of American citizens working for the
United Nations in professional-level jobs is preparing to step up a
fight to receive the same education grants for their children that
foreign officials get in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement more than 50 years old, foreign professionals
working at U.N. headquarters as specialists in a range of fields
including economics, political affairs and technical or financial
services receive more than $15,500 a year for each child in school
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not get the grants, which were intended to allow
foreign families to pay for a private education in the language or
culture of their home countries, so that the children could return
comfortably to those nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be so bad if it were used for the purpose
intended,'' an American working here said. The reality, this
official and others from various countries said, is that the grant
buys entry to the best private schools and colleges for children
who may have been born in this country, have an American parent or
be part of a family settled here. Since 1994, U.N. officials may
apply for permanent residency after 15 years of work at the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it so unjust is that many of these children are
Americans like our children,'' an American parent said, adding that
no effort is made to weed out dubious cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans _ about 108 officials with a total of more than
170 children _ want help from U.S. representatives in the U.N.
committee that determines these grants, said Stephen Baldwin, who
recently retired as an official in the Department of Economic and
Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Baldwin was among a group of Americans who petitioned
the U.N. Administrative Tribunal, the organization's highest
judicial panel, for equal treatment. They were turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin suggested in an interview this week that the General
Assembly, the group of 185 nations that formally sets the grant
levels, could freeze new increases until the Americans could be
brought into the program. This would not add costs to the
organization's already hamstrung budget.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, unlike many other nations, is perennially
reluctant to become involved in the cases of Americans working for
the United Nations, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very helpful to us if our own representatives were
to take up this case and say this isn't a level playing field,''
Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another parent, who did not want to be named, said that the
American government's attitude ``represents the low esteem with
which the United Nations is held in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials have recommended abolishing the grant
entirely, but Baldwin said that this would be politically
unrealistic and ``draconian,'' since many families are involved who
do send their children to foreign-language schools and need
financial help living in New York. Average salaries for these
professional-level jobs hover around $75,000 to $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   The education grant has become an untaxed windfall for
foreigners, augmenting their salaries substantially, American
professionals say.
</P>
<P>
   The grants apply only to U. N. officials, whose salaries and
benefits are set or reviewed by the General Assembly and the
International Civil Service Commission. The supplements do not
apply to diplomats based in foreign missions in New York, though
they may qualify for other programs through their respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Americans in U.N. service are eligible for the grants when they
are sent abroad. But many U.N. officials spend a large part of
their careers at the headquarters here, where city neighborhood
schools may have problems and private education is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Americans, who already have
lower net salaries than many foreigners because they are required
to pay Social Security taxes to the United States, say that they
often cannot afford the private schools to which their foreign
counterparts send their children.
</P>
<P>
   The supplements were originally for children up to the age of
11, who would then return to their home countries for secondary and
higher education. They are now being used up through university
level.
</P>
<P>
   The grants can easily be misused, U.N. employees say. A Canadian
reported cases of children from extended families being brought to
New York to raise the number of supplements added to an official
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarried employees also say that they watch married colleagues
increase their incomes substantially with the education grants as
their families grow, while single officials live on flat salaries
at a time of financial crisis in the organization. ``Morale is
bound to suffer,'' a European said.

LOS ANGELES: of the total.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deaton said the steering committee relied on citizen input, not
politicians or others with vested interests in considering which
projects to bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think there was (political pressure),'' Deaton
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Doug Ring, it's the children's museum that pushes the
project. It's not surprising it's a high priority. The K in Prop. K
was for kids. And the Boeckmann property has long had a high
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum and Santa Monica Mountains acquisitions, however,
were not on the Recreation and Parks Department's priority list,
according to Ann Kerman, director of resource development. Nor was
$10 million proposed to be bonded for a children's discovery area
at the zoo, she said, though it was listed in the ballot proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The other four proposed bond projects are $5 million to the
Cabrillo Aquarium, $7.4 million to the Griffith Observatory, $2.1
million to build a child-care center in North Hollywood and $1.4
million for sports fields at Washington Irving Middle School in
Glassell Park.
</P>
<P>
   The department's goal was to give the entire city as many new
parks, sporting facilities and child-care centers as possible,
while targeting a couple of regional projects, including the
observatory and aquarium, that were ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in many cases where land has already been purchased,
the lack of parks tax money is stalling projects, Kerman said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, property has been purchased for the Riverside
Performing Arts Center along Riverside Drive, but its $3 million in
bond money is nowhere on the radar through 2004, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Land also has been bought for a Branford Recreation Center in
the Northeast Valley, but none of the nearly $2 million needed is
budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sepulveda Recreation Center pool is closed while
it awaits $800,000 in Proposition K money that won't materialize
until sometime after 2004 under the current plan, according to
Kerman and records.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what was envisioned by the proposition,'' Soboroff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the list of seven projects did not receive unanimous
support from the Central Regional Volunteer Neighborhood Oversight
Committee, the citizens group that represents the region with the
bulk of the projects on the bond list.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Smith, a central committee member, said she was opposed to
including the mountains purchase. She said the expenditure would
cut too deeply into the budget for parkland acquisition elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the rest of the city, the need for little parks
all over, for kids to be able to sit and play in open spaces. That
opportunity should not be lost,'' said Smith, a Lincoln Heights
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with Soboroff on overall spending, Miscikowski said
that all the projects should get to compete for fast-track
financing by bonding against future revenues. She said there should
be a level playing field for all projects, not just those that can
pay to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   She called the current process ``clearly inequitable'' and said
she did not influence the placement of the children's museum on the
list of bond projects. She added the Santa Monica Mountains
acquisition proposal came out of the steering committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ring said the museum competed with other agencies for funding,
and he doesn't know how the final selection process worked. He said
the museum needs most of its money upfront to proceed with a
relocation from downtown to Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the children's museum has to wait 10 years, it will be
someone else building it,'' Ring said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is for the good of the community and the city's
children, not for himself or his wife, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Boeckmann said he never asked anyone to put his project on a
fast-track list, but that the city must decide soon whether to
purchase his property. Otherwise, he said he may develop it since
the costs associated with additional delays are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mayor Richard Riordan and then-Councilman Marvin Braude
originally approached him about selling the land for what he said
would have been far less than it was worth. Boeckmann said he
agreed and later said OK to another reduction to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The property is gorgeous, he added. ``It's a hell of a deal, in
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, he said that Miscikowski, who succeeded
Braude, met with him to discuss the property's acquisition.
Boeckmann said his position was that he couldn't wait forever, that
he'd already spent more than $1 million on the property and that
the project needed to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonably, this has already gone on too long,'' Boeckmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the seven projects moved quickly through the process and
into official city planning documents, many other projects
floundered, and applicants were never told how to appeal when they
lost out, said Smith of the central committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that were politically well-connected ... appealed, but
the mom-and-pop groups didn't know they could,'' she said. ``There
was a lot of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Several council members said they were surprised that a
mechanism had been devised for moving some projects ahead more
quickly, while others would have to wait to get cash directly from
assessment revenues or else find funds from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset that we're not following a more equitable process,''
said Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the Northwest Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In Bernson's district, Mason Park, the Northridge Recreation
Center, Parthenia Park, Stetson Ranch and the Winnetka Recreation
Center are all on the slow track, with little or no funding
scheduled through 2004, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Michael Feuer's district has little Proposition K
funding scheduled for four projects, including a Studio City gym
and the Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks recreation building.
</P>
<P>
   While it makes sense to bond some projects, Feuer said
``well-heeled projects'' should not be the only ones that can get
bonding to move quickly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez, Proposition K's author, said his goal
was not to finance major land acquisitions in the mountains or to
tie up lots of money in big projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to tie up so much money this way,'' he said.
``While certain projects might justify some bonding, I have a hard
time justifying all of these.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, he said, is small parks, recreation centers and
other projects to help kids throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a city have an obligation to do this faster,'' he said.

FORMER NUN LOOKS BACK ON CAREER SERVING L.A.'S POOREST
</HEADLINE>

By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Margaret Rose Welch grew up poor, as did Sergio
Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch entered a convent and the Immaculate Heart Community,
while Cruz joined a gang and got in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives crossed on Blythe Street, where the 74-year-old
Welch helped pull 35-year-old Cruz into a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one great worry when I became a nun _ &UR;  &LR; that I'd be
bored,'' Welch said one recent morning on Blythe Street, an
impoverished neighborhood in northeastern Los Angeles, ``and I
haven't been bored _ and certainly not on Blythe Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Welch will retire as director of Casa Esperanza, or Hope
House, which is the center she created to provide health care,
employment and an array of other social services for Blythe Street
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Though gangs and drugs have not been completely eliminated from
Blythe Street, Welch said she will leave having come full circle on
the goals she set out to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz is one of her legacies.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot, busted by police and sent to prison before he
realized he wanted to turn his life around. But with a record,
finding a job was no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's employment program takes grants and works with such
employers as Mission Community Medical Center and others to train
and place Blythe Street residents.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect fit for Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting Welch, he had applied to six jobs and was turned
down six times. With no resume and a felony on his record, finding
a job was impossible until Welch hired Cruz as her personal
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just need a helping hand, and she was that angel
that gave me that help,'' Cruz said. ``Since I've been working with
Sister Margaret, it's been a blessing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch taught Cruz how to use a computer, and today he types up
job listings for other residents. He also runs Casa Esperanza's
weekly clothing giveaway program out of a tiny garage near the
center, which is housed in an apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of my job,'' said Cruz, as he sorted through
boxes of clothing. ``I love to work with people. I've been learning
how to work with people. People are poor here, but before, I didn't
care. Now, it's different. I care about them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Welch, the obstacles faced by Blythe Street residents are
familiar: She grew up poor, the daughter of a mining superintendent
father and a mother who was a teacher. She entered the convent
determined to help others and has since dispensed of her vows after
her religious order broke away from the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has battled with the Los Angeles Police
Department over their enforcement of an injunction for gang
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the critical thing is that you respect a gang member
as a person because they have value as a person, though you may not
respect everything they do,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the gold heart pin Welch wears on the lapel of her jackets,
her kindness and generosity are more than just for show, said
Maritza Artan, who will take over as director of Casa Esperanza on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when a family is in a tight spot, Margaret has
always been there to help,'' Artan said.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo removal program, the domestic violence workshops and
the English as a second language classes Welch has created compare
little to the small acts of compassions she exhibits daily, Artan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Esperanza stocks up on baby formula and canned goods to
help residents in need, but Welch is known to take residents
personally to the store to buy groceries in emergency situations,
Artan said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's deeds don't go unnoticed. On a recent day, Blythe Street
resident Gloria Estrada stopped by Casa Esperanza and grasped
Welch's hands to thank her for the food and clothing she gave
Estrada's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved to the neighborhood, and we didn't have anyone
to help us,'' said Estrada, who is jobless and caring for her
17-year-old son plus two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no food, no nothing, and they really helped,'' Estrada
said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's concern for the downtrodden was rooted in the strong
sense of compassion her mother exhibited for others.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy of the Immaculate Heart Community _ composed of
former nuns who continue religious teachings as lay people _ is to
foster people's access to truth, dignity and full human development
and to work to change conditions that hinder that access.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy has always guided Welch's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Margaret does is talk to residents and find out what
their needs are, and she tries to address those,'' said Albert
Melena, youth director of San Fernando Valley Partnership, an
agency that has worked with Welch to create youth programs on
Blythe Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been dedicated,'' Melena said. ``And if you look at Casa
Esperanza's longevity, they've made the commitment to be there. And
Casa Esperanza will probably be the last ones there.''

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Everyone knows that Shakespeare artfully used
royal intrigues and jealousies to weave tales almost dizzying in
scope. But however much he invented dialogue and situations, people
have always suspected that when it came to the motives and
character of kings and queens, Shakespeare got it right. He showed
royalty to be larger than life, but in the end very human.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, comes evidence to
support that proposition: a most extraordinary document in the
voice of a modern-day king struggling with his own mortality as he
grapples with issues that were the stuff of the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The document is a letter sent Jan. 25 by King Hussein of Jordan
to his brother, Prince Hassan, the longtime heir to the throne. It
was written in Arabic and distributed in translation by the royal
palace. In pained but regal tones, often blunt and sometimes
rambling, the letter reveals the intensely personal nature of the
king's decision about who should succeed him. It also shows what
went into that choice: grand strategy, pride, respect for law,
emotion, the weight of tradition and rumors of treachery.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, absolute power has always been lonely _ King
Hussein's own 1962 autobiography was titled ``Uneasy Lies the
Head.'' And of all the responsibilities a king has, choosing the
next king may be the heaviest. Consider the case of a predecessor
across the Jordan River, the biblical King David, who chose not his
eldest son, as would have been customary, but Solomon, the son of
his favorite wife.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four years ago, King Hussein too bucked convention by
designating his brother Hassan as crown prince, and until last week
that decision seemed unshakable. But as he tells Prince Hassan in
the letter, he questioned that choice as he lay ill with cancer
last year in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. When Hussein returned to
the kingdom, he made his choice known. Then he returned to
Minnesota for more cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the king's telling, it is an epic tale.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters: Hussein, the gravely ill King of Jordan;
his 51-year-old brother, Hassan, who had ruled the land as regent
for six months; Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah, about to turn 37;
Hussein's fourth and current wife, Queen Noor; Hussein's younger
son, Hamzeh, 18; various unnamed court figures and
behind-the-scenes plotters.
</P>
<P>
   _ By DOUGLAS JEHL
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Hassan was designated crown prince in 1965,
when the king's own oldest son was 3 and the country was in peril:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I entrusted you with the post of crown prince and I was, with
the will of God, responsible for that decision at the time, at a
time when the eldest son of the King has not reached the age
defined by the constitution to allow him to assume responsibility
in case the king had died by the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, a dark atmosphere was affecting the whole nation
because dangers, rumors and speculation were rife concerning the
imminent end of Jordan, a country with a mission, principles and
morals, and a true affiliation to the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE)Over time, the king had heard of words
directed against him, from within the crown prince's own circle.
But he could not believe that his brother would have been disloyal.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   My small family was offended by slandering and falsehoods, and I
refer here to my wife and children. When I heard this most of the
time, I attributed it to the tendency towards rivalry among those
who pretend to be faithful to you.
</P>

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Everyone knows that Shakespeare artfully used
royal intrigues and jealousies to weave tales almost dizzying in
scope. But however much he invented dialogue and situations, people
have always suspected that when it came to the motives and
character of kings and queens, Shakespeare got it right. He showed
royalty to be larger than life, but in the end very human.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, comes evidence to
support that proposition: a most extraordinary document in the
voice of a modern-day king struggling with his own mortality as he
grapples with issues that were the stuff of the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The document is a letter sent Jan. 25 by King Hussein of Jordan
to his brother, Prince Hassan, the longtime heir to the throne. It
was written in Arabic and distributed in translation by the royal
palace. In pained but regal tones, often blunt and sometimes
rambling, the letter reveals the intensely personal nature of the
king's decision about who should succeed him. It also shows what
went into that choice: grand strategy, pride, respect for law,
emotion, the weight of tradition and rumors of treachery.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, absolute power has always been lonely _ King
Hussein's own 1962 autobiography was titled ``Uneasy Lies the
Head.'' And of all the responsibilities a king has, choosing the
next king may be the heaviest. Consider the case of a predecessor
across the Jordan River, the biblical King David, who chose not his
eldest son, as would have been customary, but Solomon, the son of
his favorite wife.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four years ago, King Hussein too bucked convention by
designating his brother Hassan as crown prince, and until last week
that decision seemed unshakable. But as he tells Prince Hassan in
the letter, he questioned that choice as he lay ill with cancer
last year in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. When Hussein returned to
the kingdom, he made his choice known. Then he returned to
Minnesota for more cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the king's telling, it is an epic tale.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters: Hussein, the gravely ill King of Jordan;
his 51-year-old brother, Hassan, who had ruled the land as regent
for six months; Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah, about to turn 37;
Hussein's fourth and current wife, Queen Noor; Hussein's younger
son, Hamzeh, 18; various unnamed court figures and
behind-the-scenes plotters.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Hassan was designated crown prince in 1965,
when the king's own oldest son was 3 and the country was in peril:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I entrusted you with the post of crown prince and I was, with
the will of God, responsible for that decision at the time, at a
time when the eldest son of the King has not reached the age
defined by the constitution to allow him to assume responsibility
in case the king had died by the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, a dark atmosphere was affecting the whole nation
because dangers, rumors and speculation were rife concerning the
imminent end of Jordan, a country with a mission, principles and
morals, and a true affiliation to the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE)Over time, the king had heard of words
directed against him, from within the crown prince's own circle.
But he could not believe that his brother would have been disloyal.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   My small family was offended by slandering and falsehoods, and I
refer here to my wife and children. When I heard this most of the
time, I attributed it to the tendency towards rivalry among those
who pretend to be faithful to you.

his countrymen. I have been touched by his devotion to his country
and by his integrity and magnanimity as he stayed beside me.''

on the American-born Queen Noor. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   She brought happiness to me and cared for me during my illness,
with the utmost loving affection. She, the Jordanian, who belongs
to this country with every fiber of her being, holds her head high
in the defense and service of this country's interest. She is the
mother who devotes all her efforts to her family. We have grown
together in soul and mind, and she has had to endure a great deal
of hardship to ensure that I was being attended to. And she, like
me, also endured much anxiety and many shocks, but always placed
her faith in God and hid her tears behind smiles. She also has not
escaped the attempts of criticism. Why not? (Because there are)
climbers who want to reach for the summit, and when the fever was
getting high some people thought it was their chance.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And then, while the crown prince acted as

</P>
<P>
   I have intervened from my sickbed to prevent meddling in the
affairs of the Arab army. This meddling seemed to be meant to
settle scores, and included retiring efficient officers known for

reproach.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Finally, the king had asked his brother to

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) So, to the unkindest cut: Hassan is
deposed. Long live Abdullah bin Hussein! (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have found that to take a decision, I must refer to the
original constitutional rule, where I find that all conditions that
originally dictate the exception [to the rule of selecting the
king's eldest son as heir) have passed, and that therefore, His
Royal Highness Prince Abdullah would, in such a case, immediately
assume all duties as Crown Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan.

   So it has come to this. The essay, the great literary art form
that Montaigne conceived and Virginia Woolf carried on, that the
writer Edward Hoagland likens to jazz or a butterfly's flight, has
sunk to a state where someone thinks it is a bright idea to ask a
computer if an essay is any good.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer, which is called e-rater (sort of like
In-Sink-Erator, the company that makes machines to grind up kitchen
garbage), will be used along with a trained human to grade the two
essay questions on the Graduate Management Admission Test taken by
200,000 business school applicants each year.
</P>
<P>
   E-rater's interest is not exactly that of Addison and Steele or
E.B. White. Humor is outside its jurisdiction, as are irony and
surprise. E-rater likes subordinate and complementary clauses and
words like ``however'' and ``therefore'' that some people think
suggest a tidy mind.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when essays were thought to be more than the
sum of their therefores. They were distinguished by their
originality, insight and personal voice, by their graceful style,
lack of affectation and willingness to meander. Instead of stomping
toward a conclusion, many never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A genuine essay is ``the movement of a free mind at play,''
writes novelist and critic Cynthia Ozick; it is ``a stroll through
someone's mazy mind.'' The essayist is free ``to hop from thought
to thought, to begin with the finish and finish with the middle, or
to eschew beginning and end and keep only a middle.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, Samuel Johnson and other great essayists were
used as models to teach theme writing in schools. But in the
factory of freshman composition, the meaning of ``essay'' has
eroded to a point where it is almost equivalent to any old hunk of
prose. As a result, shortly after Robert Atwan started editing his
annual book series, ``The Best American Essays'' (Houghton
Mifflin), a dentist sent along an article on root canal that he had
published in a dental journal and said was the best essay he had
ever written.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signs of a bad essay are at least as familiar as
the virtues of the great ones. There is the obligatory ``thesis
statement,'' Atwan says. Then come three paragraphs of exposition,
then a concluding paragraph summarizing the preceding three, along
with the phrase ``Thus we see that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to forget the school essay before they can
write,'' said Ian Frazier, the writer. ``They have to forget `not
only but also' constructions. That's dead. Nobody wants to read
that, not even teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the e-rater.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse behind e-rater was not, of course, doing Max
Beerbohm one better. The idea was to cut costs, among other things.
Instead of two people grading each essay, the Graduate Management
Admission Council, which administers the test, could have one
trained human and one machine.
</P>
<P>
   And what a machine! E-rater is ``the most highly developed,
holistic electronic writing assessment application to date,'' said
Frederic McHale of the admission council. It is a computer bulked
up on a high-protein diet of high-scoring answers to past
admission-test essay questions.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Burstein, a scientist at Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J., who led the team that invented e-rater, says the
computer looks for what she called syntactic variety, such as
different kinds of clauses. It also looks for words associated with
organization of ideas, such as ``first,'' ``second'' and ``third.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not trained to score Montaigne,'' she said. ``It's not
designed to score creative writing and irony and metaphor and
poems. It's designed for a specific purpose, to score the kinds of
essays we see on standardized tests.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible (therefore!) to say how Montaigne might have
fared. He never did have to analyze the annual report of Olympic
Foods or agree or disagree with a statement like, ``Nations should
cooperate to develop regulations that limit children's access to
adult material on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Much business writing seems to aspire to little more than
lowest-common-denominator order and clarity. And, with home
computers already editing for gender neutrality and pointing out
when sentences exceed 31 words, why not let e-rater be the enforcer
of corporatese?
</P>
<P>
   ``For business letters, I think it's OK,'' Ms. Ozick conceded in
an interview. ``On the other hand, this is no way to teach somebody
to think. If an essay represents thinking at its purest and most
original, this is a terrible template to put over the human mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, however, said he understands the impulse. Strangers
keep cranking out manuscripts on computers and shipping them off to
him. ``It would be great if one machine wrote it and another
machine read it,'' he said, ``and we would all be free to go about
our business.''

   It is impossible (therefore!) to say how Montaigne might have
fared. He never did have to analyze the annual report of Olympic
Foods or agree or disagree with a statement like, ``Nations should
cooperate to develop regulations that limit children's access to
adult material on the Internet.''

<P>
   Much business writing seems to aspire to little more than
lowest-common-denominator order and clarity. And, with home
computers already editing for gender neutrality and pointing out
when sentences exceed 31 words, why not let e-rater be the enforcer
of corporatese?
</P>
<P>
   ``For business letters, I think it's OK,'' Ms. Ozick conceded in
an interview. ``On the other hand, this is no way to teach somebody
to think. If an essay represents thinking at its purest and most
original, this is a terrible template to put over the human mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, however, said he understands the impulse. Strangers
keep cranking out manuscripts on computers and shipping them off to
him. ``It would be great if one machine wrote it and another
machine read it,'' he said, ``and we would all be free to go about
our business.''

<P>
   It is hard to see why economics is called the dismal science
when the title is so much better deserved by evolutionary biology.
</P>
<P>
   For biologists, the human race is being loaded down with bad
mutations, the more so as medical advances thwart the scythe of
natural selection from culling the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that bugs biologists is sex. Like James Thurber,
they have long asked why it is necessary. Yeah, babies, but you
could make them much more easily by parthenogenesis _ virgin birth
_ the mode of procreation favored by stick insects and other
sensible creatures.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sexual intercourse, the biologists stand
foursquare with Lord Chesterfield, who advised his son that ``the
pleasure is momentary, the position ridiculous and the expense
damnable.''
</P>
<P>
   The biologists' two interests, doom and sex, have intersected in
a new report that shows there is indeed a purpose to sex: to sweep
away the bad mutations that would otherwise drag us toward terminal
degeneracy.
</P>
<P>
   Two British biologists, Adam Eyre-Walker and Peter Keightley,
came up with an ingenious way of estimating the number of bad
mutations that have flowed in and out of the human genome during
the 6 million years since we and chimpanzees stopped calling each
other cousins. They found that at least 1.6 and probably 3
mutations per person must have been eliminated in each generation.
</P>
<P>
   This is an amazing number when you consider that a mutation can
only disappear through a ``genetic death'' _ when its owner, or
child or grandchild, dies without progeny.
</P>
<P>
   ``That implies three genetic deaths per person!'' said
population geneticist James Crow of the University of Wisconsin in
a commentary on the new study. ``Why aren't we extinct?''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently we manage to beat the odds somehow or other. Last week
Service Corporation International, a major operator of funeral
homes and cemeteries, forecast meager earnings because of reduced
mortality rates, a grim outlook that resulted in a 44 percent
tumble in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   What magic draught cleanses us of bad mutations without
demanding one life for each?
</P>
<P>
   Now you begin to see how sex works. If we bred like stick
insects, our children would have the exact same faults as their
parents, knowledge of which would destroy all respect between
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In sex, however, life's biggest non-regulated lottery, one's
genes first get shuffled among themselves and a random assortment
is then cut into someone else's deck. Bad mutations get left on the
cutting room floor, or if they combine in a fetus, their
synergistic effect will probably cause a speedy death, eliminating
many mutations at once.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the gamble of sex beats death. By not acting like
stick insects, we escape extinction. Maybe those evolutionary
biologists aren't such dismal killjoys after all.

SUPER BOWL MEMORIES BY THE NUMBERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FISCHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Catches in Percy Howard's National Football League career.
Howard, a rookie wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, scored a
Super Bowl touchdown on his only NFL reception, a 34-yard pass play
from Roger Staubach late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl X.
</P>
<P>
   2. Men who have earned Super Bowl rings as a player, assistant
coach and head coach. Tom Flores was a backup quarterback for the
Kansas City Chiefs in IV and an assistant for Oakland in XI, and,
as a head coach, led the Raiders to victory in XV and XVIII. Mike
Ditka, who had been a player and an assistant coach on championship
teams in Dallas, led Chicago to victory in Super Bowl XX.
</P>
<P>
   3. Super Bowl titles won by Washington Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs
with as many different starting quarterbacks (Joe Theisman in XVII,
Doug Williams in XXII and Mark Rypien in XXVI). And linebacker Matt
Millen is the only player to earn Super Bowl championship rings
with three different teams: the Raiders in XV and XVIII, the San
Francisco 49ers in XXIV and the Redskins in XXVI.
</P>
<P>
   4. Receptions by the Green Bay Packers backup receiver Max McGee
during the 1966 regular season. McGee then made headlines in Super
Bowl I by hauling in seven passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns,
including the first score in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   5. Quarterbacks that Joe Namath said were better than Earl
Morrall before Super Bowl III. Namath said that in addition to
himself, the American Football League quarterbacks superior to
Morrall were Oakland's Daryle Lamonica, San Diego's John Hadl,
Miami's Bob Griese and Babe Parilli, Namath's backup.
</P>
<P>
   6. Super Bowl appearances by Don Shula, a record for a head
coach. Shula led the Colts in III, and the Dolphins in VI, VII,
VIII, XVII and XIX (two victories, four losses).
</P>
<P>
   7. Super Bowls among the 10 most-watched television programs
(total number of viewers), including the top four: Super Bowl XXX,
Dallas versus Pittsburgh, 138.5 million; XXVIII, Dallas versus
Buffalo, 134.8 million; XXVII, Dallas versus Buffalo, 133.4
million; XX, Chicago versus New England, 127.0 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. Number of astronauts who took part in a pregame tribute to
NASA and the Kennedy Space Center before Super Bowl XXIII in Miami.
Astronauts representing four phases of America's space program _
Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and the space shuttle Atlantis _ appeared
along with a lunar rover.
</P>
<P>
   9. Number of Super Bowl games, a record, in which Dan Reeves has
participated. Besides guiding the Atlanta Falcons in Sunday's game,
Reeves was a running back for Dallas in Super Bowls V and VI; a
Cowboys assistant in X, XII and XIII; and the Denver Broncos' head
coach in XXI, XXII and XXIV.
</P>
<P>
   10. Record number of turnovers committed by the Baltimore Colts
and the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. The mark was equaled by the
Denver Broncos and the Cowboys in Super Bowl XII. Craig Morton
committed 7 of the 20 turnovers in the two games, throwing three
interceptions while playing for Dallas in 1971 and four more while
playing for Denver in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   11. Plays called by Joe Montana in marching San Francisco 92
yards for the winning score with 34 seconds remaining in Super Bowl
XXIII against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   12. Most common number worn by winning Super Bowl quarterbacks.
Starting quarterbacks who have worn No. 12 have won 10 of the 18
games in which they appeared. The winning No. 12's are Joe Namath,
Ken Stabler, Bob Griese (twice), Roger Staubach (twice) and Terry
Bradshaw (four times). The losers are Staubach (twice), Griese, Jim
Kelly (four times) and Stan Humphries. If Chris Chandler leads the
Falcons to victory today, he will become the 13th. John Elway wears
No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   13. Years between Gene Upshaw's first Super Bowl appearance
(1968) and his last (1981). Upshaw, a Hall of Fame guard for the
Raiders, also played on the winning team in 1977. He is the only
player to participate in Super Bowls in three different decades.
</P>
<P>
   14. Passes completed by Miami's Griese in the Dolphins'
back-to-back Super Bowl triumphs of 1973 and '74. Griese completed
8 of 11 pass attempts in VII and six of seven passes in VIII.
</P>
<P>
   15. Points scored by Green Bay kicker Don Chandler in Super Bowl
II. His point total (four field goals, three extra points) was 1
more than the entire Oakland team scored. Still, no place-kicker
has won the Super Bowl most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   16. Rushing attempts by Oakland running back Clarence Davis in
Super Bowl XI. In one of the most underappreciated performances in
Super Bowl history, Davis gained 137 yards for an 8.6-yard average.
He had runs of 20, 35, 13, 18 and 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
   17. Yards gained by the Minnesota Vikings' rushers in Super Bowl
IX. Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain defense held Chuck Foreman, Fran
Tarkenton and Dave Osborn to an average gain of less than 1 yard
per carry.
</P>
<P>
   18. Offensive plays needed by Washington to score five
touchdowns in Super Bowl XXII against Denver. The 35-point outburst
in the second quarter is the best performance in one quarter in
Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   19. Time, in seconds, needed by Pittsburgh to score two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XIII against Dallas.
Scores by Franco Harris and Lynn Swann (following Randy White's
fumble of a short kickoff) turned a 21-17 Pittsburgh lead into a
35-17 cushion that held up for the Steelers in their third Super
Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   20. Cost, in dollars, of the highest-priced ticket to Super Bowl
XI. The price rose to $75 by Super Bowl XXI, and soared to $275 for
Super Bowl XXXI. This year's top price was $400.
</P>
<P>
   21. Height, in inches, of the Lombardi Trophy, presented each
year to the Super Bowl winner. The trophy is made of sterling
silver and weighs seven pounds three ounces. A stylized football of
regulation size sits atop a three-sided base. Each trophy, created
by Tiffany, is valued at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   22. Players on the Giants' Super Bowl XXV roster with previous
Super Bowl experience. The wily Giants controlled the clock against
Buffalo's hurry-up offense, setting a Super Bowl record for
possession time (40 minutes 33 seconds).
</P>
<P>
   23. Size of William (Refrigerator) Perry's ring, which he
received for being with the winning Bears in Super Bowl XX. An
average man's ring size is 10. The 40-diamond, 10-karat gold ring
weighs two and a half ounces and is big enough to allow a silver
dollar to pass through.
</P>
<P>
   24. People who have attended every Super Bowl game. This group,
dubbed the Super 32 Club, includes 10 writers (Larry Felser, Jerry
Green, Jerry Izenberg, Dave Klein, Will McDonough, Norman Miller,
Bob Oates, Edwin Pope, Cooper Rollow and John Steadman), six
photographers (John Biever, Vernon Biever, Walter Iooss Jr., Mickey
Palmer, Dick Raphael and Tony Tomsic) and eight others: Don Weiss,
Lamar Hunt, Jack Steadman, Ed Sabol, Steve Sabol, Art Speiler, Tex
Schramm and Lee Remmel.
</P>
<P>
   25. Length, in miles, of electrical cable needed for Super Bowl
XXXII (compared with just nine miles of cable in 1988).
</P>
<P>
   26. Players on Washington's Super Bowl XVII roster who were
obtained as free agents; 14 of them were not even drafted by NFL
teams. The Hogs, the Smurfs and the Fun Bunch helped John Riggins
outgain the entire Miami offense.
</P>
<P>
   27. Members of the silver anniversary Super Bowl team: Vince
Lombardi; coach; Joe Montana, quarterback; Franco Harris and Larry
Csonka, running backs; Lynn Swann and Jerry Rice, wide receivers;
Dave Casper, tight end; Art Shell and Forrest Gregg, tackles; Gene
Upshaw and Jerry Kramer, guards; Mike Webster, center; L.C.
Greenwood and Ed Jones, defensive ends; Joe Greene and Randy White,
defensive tackles; Jack Lambert and Mike Singletary, inside
linebackers; Jack Ham and Ted Hendricks, outside linebackers;
Ronnie Lott and Mel Blount, cornerbacks; Donnie Shell and Willie
Wood, safeties; Ray Guy, punter; Jan Stenerud, kicker; John Taylor,
kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   28. Years in which the Super Bowl stock market indicator has
been ``correct.'' This theory holds that a victory by a National
Conference team or an original (pre-1970 merger) NFL team _ the
Browns, the Colts or the Steelers _ points to a bullish market
during the calendar year. But a victory by an American Conference
team indicates a drop in the market by the end of the year. From
1967 to 1997, the theory worked 87.5 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   29. Yards lost by the Dolphins' Griese when sacked by Dallas
tackle Bob Lilly in Super Bowl VI. Some reporters called the sack
(for the most yards in Super Bowl history) Miami's finest example
of open-field running. The Dolphins lost, 24-3, becoming the only
Super Bowl team to go without a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   30. Length, in seconds, of a television commercial during the
Super Bowl. The cost of a 30-second commercial in 1967 was $37,500.
This year, the average cost of a 30-second spot is $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   31. Points scored by the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII, the most by
any losing team. (The Steelers scored 35 to win.) The
Pittsburgh-Dallas contest was the first Super Bowl rematch
(Pittsburgh won, 21-17, in Super Bowl X).
</P>
<P>
   32. Weight, in tons, of the stage used during the halftime show
in Super Bowl XXXII. The 5,000-square-foot structure, the world's
largest portable stage, was put up and disassembled by 500 workers
in less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   33. Number of seasons the Atlanta Falcons' fans have waited for
the team to reach its first Super Bowl.

<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ Death has begun to imitate life out here on
the East End of Long Island, where the rich, the gifted and the
beautiful gather each summer to calibrate status. The most
fashionable place to be dead in the Hamptons is fully booked.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations to rub shoulders for eternity with famous artists
and writers like Jackson Pollock and A.J. Liebling are no longer
being taken, unless you know the right person.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Courtney Sale Ross, widow of Steven Ross, the
entrepreneur who built a family funeral parlor business into Time
Warner Inc. When Ross died of cancer in 1992, his widow bought 110
grave plots, at a cost of $77,000, at Green River Cemetery in the
East Hampton hamlet of Springs. Her expressed purpose: to provide
plots for generations of Rosses to come.
</P>
<P>
   Only one deceased person without a reservation has got into
Green River in the last eight months. Mrs. Ross gave a plot to the
family of Alan Pakula after the award-winning film director died
last year in a freak accident on the Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just gave the grave site to a friend,'' said Bert Fields,
a lawyer for Mrs. Ross. ``I don't think she wants to start giving
them out to strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ross purchase _ a graveyard echo of land grabs that have
been rattling the Hamptons for decades _ gobbled up about a quarter
of the burial space then available in the three-acre, nonprofit,
nondenominational cemetery. Since then, all the remaining plots
have been sold. Cemetery managers from across the United States
describe the size of the Ross buy as extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I have never heard of such a thing in such a small
cemetery,'' said Dick Fisher, publicity director at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park, the burial complex with more than a half-million
graves in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ross Domain,'' as some here call the family's graveyard
spread, has become a symbol of how the Hamptons elite, often
without meaning to do so, can stir up deep-rooted resentment among
locals of lesser means.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is animosity,'' said Deanna Tikkanen, a past president
of the Green River Cemetery Association. ``People with money are
buying up the plots and they are not leaving anything for the local
people.'' She said she quit her unpaid position with the cemetery
because wealthy summer people kept calling and pestering her for
plots.
</P>
<P>
   Green River Cemetery, created in 1902 as a modest burial ground
for families of local fishermen, farmers and tradesmen, ran out of
space last year. The cemetery became chic in the years after
Pollock, the abstract expressionist painter and longtime resident
of Springs, was buried there in 1956. It took 85 years for the
cemetery's original two acres to sell out. But when an extra acre
was added in 1987, it was snapped up in just 11 years. Mrs. Ross
took by far the largest single slice.
</P>
<P>
   While the East End has many cemeteries with space available, any
resident of Springs without a prepurchased plot must now be buried
outside the community, said Freston ``Pete'' Anderson, the current
president of the cemetery association.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on unlocking the graveyard once again for locals, the
cemetery is buying another acre, said Anderson, who works for the
Town of East Hampton as a member of the bay patrol. He said that
cemetery trustees, a group of local volunteers who serve two-year
terms, passed a new bylaw last fall to limit the purchasing power
of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ross rule,'' as Anderson called it, limits any buyer to no
more than eight graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an old-fashioned local cemetery,'' said Anderson,
whose parents and grandparents are buried there. ``I think the
community really did want to hang the previous trustees who sold so
many plots to Mrs. Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ross declined to be interviewed for this article. But her
lawyer, Fields, said she bought so many graves because she had a
difficult time selecting an ``appropriate burial place'' for Ross
and, in the future, ``she didn't want anyone in her extended family
to go through that anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was thinking ahead, which is characteristic of her,'' he
said. ``She always thinks three or four generations ahead. It is
all so the family can be together. Keep in mind they live in East
Hampton. They are not just weekenders.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Mrs. Ross ``was not aware she was monopolizing the
remaining grave sites, and certainly would not want to antagonize
anyone at a difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of the graves was negotiated by Edward Blier, a
Time Warner executive who worked for Ross for many years. Blier
said Mrs. Ross chose the cemetery because she knew and admired many
painters who were buried there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking about a smaller number of graves, then Mrs.
Ross said, `So, let's just have a lot more space so it can be
landscaped and have other family members,''' Blier said. ``It was
unusual, but it seemed entirely normal because the cemetery seemed
to have a lot of space at the time.'' Blier added that he remembers
no disagreement at the time among cemetery trustees about the
wisdom of selling so many graves to one person.
</P>
<P>
   A former cemetery trustee who attended meetings on the Ross
purchase agrees. The former trustee, Tim Miller, a surveyor in
Springs, said there were no objections at the time because the
cemetery wanted to raise a sizable sum of money to buy more land.
Only later, as the cemetery quickly began to fill, Miller said, did
local people and new trustees begin to grumble about the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Blier, who has owned a home in East Hampton for 39 years, said
that reports of class resentment over the cemetery were
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody started a class war out there,'' he said. ``It is a
simply wonderful place, and was discovered. It is nobody's fault
that artistic people have come out and they have attracted money
people. There is a certain inevitability of change anywhere in the
world. The art is to manage the change graciously.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Management of change in the Hamptons is, however, rarely
gracious.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's because there is so much of it to manage. The
number of permits last year for new houses in East Hampton jumped
32 percent over the previous year. If the current pace of
development continues, the South Fork of Long Island will be
``built out'' in less than 10 years, according to the Group for the
South Fork, a land preservation fund.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of who is being managed and of how rich
and litigious many of them are.
</P>
<P>
   Protests over large houses, like the 72,000-square-foot mansion
being built by the industrialist Ira Rennert in Sagoponack, led the
neighboring town of East Hampton to pass an ordinance last year
that limits new houses to no more than 20,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   While squabbles over Hamptons real estate are usually among the
rich, the dispute over the Ross purchase at Green River Cemetery
tracks a different, and much less publicized, fault line of
conflict. It is the animosity that many working-class residents
feel toward the summer people whose expensive cars paralyze traffic
on Montauk Highway and whose indifference to prices has driven up
the cost of everything from groceries to gasoline to parking
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local people think, why should they have so much and I
work very hard and I can't even afford to take a vacation or have
medical insurance,'' said Mrs. Tikkanen, the past president of
Green River Cemetery. Her family has lived in East Hampton for 13
generations and she works in the family awning and boat-cover
business.
</P>
<P>
   Green River Cemetery hardly looks like a Hamptons hangout. Much
of it is a lichen-covered confabulation of disordered headstones
surrounded by a white rail fence badly in need of paint. The
graveyard existed in uncrowded and contented obscurity until
several years after Pollock was buried there beneath a 50-ton
boulder.
</P>
<P>
   But since then about 30 notable painters and writers have joined
Pollock, some with little or no connection to either Springs or
East Hampton. When the writer John O'Hara was buried in the
cemetery in 1966, Pollock's widow, Lee Krasner, who was also a
celebrated painter and was later buried there, protested, ``He's
not even a summer rental,'' according to two biographies of
Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   The Ross property in the cemetery lies behind Pollock's grave.
Set well away from the knot of other graves, almost as if buffered
by a moat of grass, Ross' headstone is a small and tastefully
unobtrusive boulder. It seems to echo the larger Pollock stone.
</P>
<P>
   The only other nearby graves are those of Ross' parents, Max and
Sadie. Their bodies were moved to the cemetery after Ross died.
Pakula is buried in a far corner of the Ross property.
</P>
<P>
   A man who pays careful attention to the distribution of space at
Green River is Donald Ferriss, who lives next to the cemetery and
who sold it the land where Ross is buried. Ferriss, a real estate
agent, said he sold the acre at a below-market price of $60,000 out
of a sense of responsibility to the community where he has lived
for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ferriss said he was ``disappointed'' when he learned that he
had, in effect, helped subsidize the plots purchased by Mrs. Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't why I got involved in this,'' Ferriss said. ``I
don't bear the Rosses any ill will, and I'm not trying to turn it
into class warfare, but I would have preferred that it was handled
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferriss is selling the cemetery another acre, this time for
$120,000, to again create space for local people. He said he
heartily approves of the new ``eight is enough'' rule limiting the
buying power of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no public announcements of the sale or
of the availability, after it is cleared, of more graves. The
president of the cemetery association said he was not looking
forward to making the announcement that the graveyard is once again
taking reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put in the paper that there is going to be a new
section, the phone is going to ring off the hook,'' Anderson said.
``I just know it is.''

HE LIKES ATTENTION, AND CARRIES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Jamal Anderson strolled with relative ease through the
weeklong blitz of anticipation for Super Bowl XXXIII. He smiled a
lot. Talked a lot. Smiled some more. Quite charming. Easy.
Reflective. Enlightening in his conversation. Easy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he can only run the football that way against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can run the ball against anybody,'' Anderson said. ``No
question. They've played really well. But it's the same for both
defenses. When you play well against the run, you build up a lot of
confidence. So the first quarter, the first half, is going to be
really important. Not only for Jamal Anderson, but for Terrell
Davis against our defense, because both of us have excellent
run-stopping defenses and they pride themselves on shutting down
the running back.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished. Smiled some more. Easy. Talked some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to act natural,'' Anderson said. ``I'm having fun
with all of the attention. I have fun doing my job. I'm just
relaxed and am doing my thing. People keep saying that I'm a ham,
but I'm not a ham, I'm just being natural.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a ham.
</P>
<P>
   He is a good ham.
</P>
<P>
   He is 26. In 1994 he was a seventh-round pick from Utah, the
201st player selected in the National Football League draft. He
attended high school in El Camino, Calif. He grew up watching his
father work in security and he was always around boxing stars
including Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard and Mike Tyson and other
stars like Diana Ross, Donna Summers and Richard Pryor .
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Anderson learned how to be a ham from some of the biggest
hams.
</P>
<P>
   He also, obviously, learned toughness and fortitude, how to turn
a shaky start into a solid finish. This is a strong, durable
running back. He can squat 670 pounds and bench press 465 pounds.
He carried the ball an NFL-record 410 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, just to think about the fact that nobody's carried this
many times,'' Anderson said. ``The significant thing is I didn't
sustain a major injury. I've been playing since I was 7 and I've
been getting pounded every year since then. I had 410 carries this
season but I don't feel it. I feel 100 percent fresh. People talk
about the residual effect, the wear and tear on your body. But
that's 10 or 20 years. I'm only in my fifth year and realistically,
I didn't even play my first two years, so this is really my third
year. So, I've got seven or eight more years of dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   What a ham. A good ham.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday, one day of dominance from Anderson will do. &QL;

   Pope's Plea for Clemency Spares Prisoner's Life
</P>
<P>
   When the ailing Pope John Paul II briefly visited St. Louis on
his fifth U.S. trip, high on his agenda was to urge the nation's
often restless Roman Catholics to follow Vatican teaching more
closely. In a special plea, he called the death penalty ``cruel and
unnecessary,'' even for ``someone who has done great evil.'' And he
didn't balk at specifics, asking Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan to
spare the life of Darrell Mease, a triple murderer set to die Feb.
10.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who has approved 26 executions in six years, commuted
Mease's sentence to life in prison. ``I was moved'' by the pope's
concern, Carnahan said, though he stayed firm in his support of
capital punishment.

   NATO Issues Kosovo Threat

   The NATO alliance threatened warring Serbian and ethnic Albanian
forces in Kosovo with military action unless they agreed to a call
by the United States, Russia and four of the European allies for
peace talks on autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it was prepared to bomb Serb military targets and take
action against Kosovo Liberation Army rebels unless they began
peace talks near Paris by Feb. 6 and worked out an agreement within
seven days after that. France and Britain, which will lead the
talks, said they were willing to provide peacekeeping forces if
needed to reinforce a settlement.

   A Warning on Social Security
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to shore up Social Security is to use the
federal budget surpluses now anticipated by both parties. But
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress and the
administration that the surpluses are not a sure thing. If
Washington really wants to be sure of putting the retirement system
on a sound footing, Greenspan said, it will probably have to do it
the old fashioned way, through politically painful tax increases
and benefit cuts.

   First U.S. Hand Transplant
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons in Louisville, Ky., performed the first hand transplant
in the United States, and the world's third. The recipient of the
donor hand was Matthew David Scott of Absecon, N.J., who lost his
own in a firecracker accident in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity of hand transplants largely reflects an ethical
controversy over the benefits of a procedure that is not essential
to life and results in a lifelong need for anti-rejection drugs,
which can lead to infection and other illnesses. But if recipients
regain sufficient use of their new hands, such transplants might
become more common.

   Newswoman Wins Bias Case
</P>
<P>
   Janet Peckinpaugh, once the top-rated anchorwoman in
Connecticut, had set out to become an avenger for women denied the
chance to grow gray on the air. Instead, a federal jury in Hartford
found that the city's CBS station had let her go because of her sex
_ not her age _ and awarded her $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict resulted from the station's ritual pairing of a man
and a woman at the anchor desk, a practice as basic to local news
as zippy music and cheery banter. In 1994, Ms. Peckinpaugh's
station had a stable of three anchorwomen and two anchormen, and
wanted to cut that to two pairs. Witnesses said the women had to
audition, while the men had a free pass. Ms. Peckinpaugh, now 48,
became the odd anchor out.

   Introducing La Nina
</P>
<P>
   El Nino, the big pool of warm water that appears from time to
time in the tropical Pacific and disrupts weather patterns around
the world, became a household word a year ago. Its opposite number,
La Nina, which makes the tropical Pacific colder than normal, may
be less familiar but is solidly in place now, Federal scientists
say, altering atmospheric circulation in a different way than El
Nino did.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results, they say, have been record snows in Buffalo
and Chicago, record numbers of tornadoes in the nation's
midsection, all-time low temperatures in Indiana and Maine and an
extremely wet and unusually warm second half of January in New
York. La Nina is expected to stick around until May or June.

   Ford Buys Volvo Car Unit
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford took pride in building Model T's that the common man
could afford. But the market for basic transportation is
increasingly unprofitable as manufacturers in places like South
Korea churn out lots of cheap cars. So Ford Motor Co. has announced
that it will also try to become a larger maker of luxury cars by
buying the car operations of Sweden's Volvo for $6.45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it would keep Volvo's research, design, management and
much of its manufacturing in Sweden, and would not change the cars.
Ford gives its luxury divisions a lot of independence. How many
Americans know that Ford has already bought Jaguar and Aston-Martin
in the last decade?

   Hubbell Tax Case Reinstated

<P>
   When a federal judge threw out a tax fraud case last year
against Webster L. Hubbell, it was a signal defeat for Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. The judge described Starr in terms that
delighted his enemies, calling him a runaway prosecutor. But there
was redemption for Starr when a divided appeals panel reinstated
the case, allowing him to continue his campaign to press Hubbell to
provide damaging information about his longtime friends, President
and Mrs. Clinton.

   Monday it's February. If traditional patterns hold, half the

words, don't rush to quit the gym, but if you do, there are
moderate alternatives.

   The Growing Lexicon of Offense
</P>
<P>
   Another word died last week, said Sol Steinmetz, a New York
lexicographer.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was in an uproar about whether the new mayor was
right to accept the resignation of a white aide who had offended a
black colleague by using the word ``niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams said the aide, David Howard, had used
poor judgment even though the word has no racial links; it comes
from a Scandinavian word for ``miserly,'' which predates the slur
it sounds like by several hundred years. (Now the mayor is in
trouble with some activists who, like Howard, are gay _ another
word that has been through some changes in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   After the smoke clears, there will be agreement on one thing,
predicted Steinmetz: ``No one is going to risk using that word
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, linguists are finding an expanding list of benign words
shunned because they either sound offensive or might otherwise be
misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   Chicanery _ deception by trickery, from the Old French chicaner,
to quibble _ is sometimes avoided as an affront to Hispanics
because it closely resembles the word chicano. Terms like queer the
deal, chink in the armor and nip in the air are also on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Another phrase in full retreat is ``to call a spade a spade,''
first used by Plutarch and once synonymous with ``to call a bucket
a bucket'' _ meaning to call things by their true names or to be
straightforward to the point of rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Not all misunderstandings involve such sensitive matters as race
or ethnicity, of course. And some perfectly innocuous-sounding
words have acquired a bad reputation unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Sheidlower, senior editor in the Random House reference
department, said ``picnic'' has recently come under suspicion
because of an untrue story that it refers to parties in the
countryside where black children were ``picked'' and assaulted.
(The known parentage of the word goes back to mid-18th-century
French pique-nique, but beyond that, its roots are unclear.)

   With Sweets, It's Nurture, Not Nature
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientific studies have demonstrated what
everyone else has always known: Women love chocolate. In study
after study, women rate this most irresistible of sweets as their
No. 1 food craving. So intense is this peculiarly female devotion
that scientists have suggested a woman's burning desire for
chocolate might have a biological basis. Researchers have even
suggested that opiates or other chemicals in chocolate thought to
be capable of mimicking the brain chemistry of a person in love
might be what makes women reach for that extra truffle.
</P>
<P>
   But the days when science provided sweet comfort for female
chocolate addicts may have ended. According to a study to appear
later this year in the journal Appetite, researchers report that
not all women are so obsessed. Spanish women who crave sweets were
considerably less attached to chocolate and no more enthralled by
it than Spanish men.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that American women adore chocolate, researchers
suggest, is that people tend to crave and enjoy familiar foods.
American women, drowning in a chocolate-saturated culture, can't
help but learn their naughty little addiction.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't American men go wild for their Ghirardelli as well?
Researchers suggest that in a culture in which gals pop bonbons and
guys carve up steaks, chocolate, along with quiche, may be one of
those foods that real men just won't eat.
</P>
<P>
   This theory also suggests that women could, by repeated
exposure, teach themselves to crave other foods instead, like
sweetened rice cakes. Until researchers come up with a more
palatable hypothesis, women chocoholics will have to seek
reassurance elsewhere, possibly the nearest chocolate shop.

   The Growing Lexicon of Offense
</P>
<P>
   Another word died last week, said Sol Steinmetz, a New York
lexicographer.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was in an uproar about whether the new mayor was
right to accept the resignation of a white aide who had offended a
black colleague by using the word ``niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams said the aide, David Howard, had used
poor judgment even though the word has no racial links; it comes
from a Scandinavian word for ``miserly,'' which predates the slur
it sounds like by several hundred years. (Now the mayor is in
trouble with some activists who, like Howard, are gay _ another
word that has been through some changes in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   After the smoke clears, there will be agreement on one thing,
predicted Steinmetz: ``No one is going to risk using that word
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, linguists are finding an expanding list of benign words
shunned because they either sound offensive or might otherwise be
misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   Chicanery _ deception by trickery, from the Old French chicaner,
to quibble _ is sometimes avoided as an affront to Hispanics
because it closely resembles the word chicano. Terms like queer the
deal, chink in the armor and nip in the air are also on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Another phrase in full retreat is ``to call a spade a spade,''
first used by Plutarch and once synonymous with ``to call a bucket
a bucket'' _ meaning to call things by their true names or to be
straightforward to the point of rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Not all misunderstandings involve such sensitive matters as race
or ethnicity, of course. And some perfectly innocuous-sounding
words have acquired a bad reputation unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Sheidlower, senior editor in the Random House reference
department, said ``picnic'' has recently come under suspicion
because of an untrue story that it refers to parties in the
countryside where black children were ``picked'' and assaulted.
(The known parentage of the word goes back to mid-18th-century
French pique-nique, but beyond that, its roots are unclear.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to accept the fact that some words are of
unknown origin,'' Sheidlower said. And that's how rumors about
words get started.

   WASHINGTON _ The cameras were yanked, the lights unplugged and
the doors slammed against the public and the press last week,
leaving the country's premier deliberative body to deliberate by
itself. The Senate had concluded that the only way to resolve
several thorny procedural issues surrounding President Clinton's
fate was to seal itself off.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Democrats voted to keep the sessions open, they
showed little outrage after they lost. And once the sessions began,
some of them dared to see some virtue in the closed-door process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with what Louis Brandeis said: `Sunlight is the
strongest disinfectant,''' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``And
the public has a right to know about things as important as this.
On the other hand, the fact of the matter is when you close a
proceeding, you get more interactive dialogue because people are
just talking to one another, as opposed to talking to a much larger
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was one of six Democrats who voted
with Republicans to close the discussion on whether to call
witnesses in the impeachment trial. ``Most proceedings ought to be
open,'' he said. ``But I felt there was a capacity in a closed
session for this particular issue to be more frankly discussed and
to become less polarized quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that when the Senate votes, perhaps in two
weeks, on whether to hold its final deliberations in secret,
Democrats will vote to close the doors. But it does recognize the
hazards of governing in the age of television: Politicians love the
camera, but alas, they say, they can't speak freely in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   This produced the conundrum last week of senators popping out of
their closed sessions to say that they were so statesmanlike inside
it was too bad the public couldn't see them. It seemed to matter
little that by the end of the week, whatever understanding had been
reached in private had vanished as a politically cleaved Senate
voted strictly along party lines to take videotaped depositions
from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate first convened in 1789, its members assumed that
they would conduct their business in private. The Continental
Congresses had been closed. The Constitutional Convention had the
windows nailed shut when it met in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, the Senate gave way to public sessions; it
changed its rules in 1929 to make secret sessions the exception
rather than the rule. Since then, the Senate has conducted 45
secret sessions, most of them involving national security. The last
three were to discuss the procedures for Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
   The real action of governing takes place out of camera range
anyway. Spending bills are drafted in secret, proposals are floated
in private huddles, deals are hatched in hideaways. By the time
these items come up for a vote, most Senators have made up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the year, the Senate chamber is a pretty lonely place,
with senators speechifying for the cameras and little real debate.
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., one of only three Republicans who voted
to keep last week's sessions open, said the most amazing thing
about the sessions was not that they were closed but that all 100
senators attended. Normally when a senator speaks on the floor,
Specter said, ``it's like a tree falling in the forest.'' Closing
the doors, he said, forced the rare moment when ``all of your
colleagues are listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras in the chambers only give the illusion of openness, says
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. ``We've created a
public arena in which we offer conclusions, but we don't show the
process of getting there,'' Ms. Jamieson said. The question is how
to create a public forum for thoughtful exchange, she said, in
which a politician would not be hurt politically for speaking
frankly, conceding points to opponents or mulling complex thoughts,
which senators say they can do behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to secrecy on pain of expulsion, senators couldn't say
exactly what they had accomplished last week, but their
generalities demonstrated the gulf between private discourse and
public. ``There were some things that were said on both sides,''
noted Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., ``that you could not have said
if it was in front of the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN chief executive Brian Lamb disagreed. ``It's a lot easier
for all of us to make decisions behind closed doors,'' he said,
``but I don't see any evidence that this is more efficient or
better. These are very talented, rough-and-tumble people who were
elected in a very open process out there. They ought to be able to
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Senate meet in private, it did not even debate
why it should do so, sparing members the lasting televised images
of anyone on the floor arguing to exclude the public. This left
Lamb lamenting that the lockout had generated so little concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't care because they're sick to death of the
subject,'' he said. ``They're pounded to death with it every night.
They have heard every argument, watched every possible scenario.
You can see why people are starting to say we have too much
openness. But democracy was never a pretty picture.''

   WASHINGTON _ The president of the United States springs the
nation's top communist from jail. Behind the president's back,
America's top spymaster swaps secrets with the Soviets. The
secretary of commerce bares his soul to Moscow's station chief in
Washington. Meanwhile, federal agents are hunting down communist
file clerks and coatholders.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America _
The Stalin Era''(Random House) offers a new look at what communist
spies were really up to in this country before and during World War
II. It is a staggering account of sloppiness and stupidity among
the Soviets and their American agents.
</P>
<P>
   And it underscores how much the most powerful people in
Washington freely gave Moscow when faced with a common enemy in
wartime. On balance, it appears that Moscow gained more from its
open alliances with the United States than from its secret American
underground.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of ``The Haunted Wood,'' Allen Weinstein, the
founder of the Center for Democracy, a Washington foundation, and
Alexander Vassiliev, a Russian spy turned reporter, hoped for
revelations when they burrowed into the archives of the chief
Soviet foreign intelligence service, the KGB, which granted (and
then withdrew) access in exchange for cash from Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the history of war and diplomacy without secret
intelligence files is like building a house without a blueprint:
The angles go awry, the foundation tilts. With the files, history
can outstrip any novelist's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But not all was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   If the late Alger Hiss indeed spent a decade as a Soviet agent,
as is now generally thought by Cold War scholars, what did he
actually do? No answers came; they may reside in the still-closed
files of another bureaucracy, the Soviet military intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   The files that were opened showed that Soviet espionage in the
United States was clearly less than masterful under Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present we don't have any agents'' in Washington began one
plaintive message from the Soviets' New York station. One Soviet
station chief in Washington spoke no English, which somewhat
limited his ability to move in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Purges and paranoia in Moscow put some of the best operatives in
prison or the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets did eventually acquire networks of agents in the
United States, some of whom thought they were working for the
Communist Party of the United States and its boss, Earl Browder,
and some of whom realized that their true masters were in Moscow.
The agents penetrated the Justice Department and the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The files show that they even had an agent in Congress: Rep.
Samuel Dickstein, who represented a swath of Manhattan's Lower East
Side and was generally useless to his Soviet paymasters.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike their British counterparts, the American agents of
the international communist conspiracy were ``as sloppy as you can
get,'' Weinstein noted in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Americans working for the Soviets in the United
States eventually were done in by their own clumsiness or betrayed
by their colleagues. The main reason they survived as long as they
did was incompetent (or nonexistent) American counterintelligence
before Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, they did more for Moscow than any spy network.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt granted diplomatic recognition,
which gave the Soviets embassies to use as spy stations in the
United States. And he gave amnesty to Browder, a valued spy for
Moscow who had been jailed for passport fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like so many others, he was purged by Stalin. ( Browder's
downfall alienated a key American spy for the Soviets, Elizabeth
Bentley, who turned informer. Her testimony led to a confession
from another Russian agent, Whittaker Chambers. Chambers later
testified as the key witness in the government's perjury
prosecution of Hiss. In intelligence, as in biology, everything is
connected to everything else).
</P>
<P>
   William Donovan, the head of the Office of Strategic Services,
the wartime spy organization, undertook deep exchanges of
intelligence with the Soviets, sometimes exceeding his instructions
from Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   He even returned to the Soviets a crucial code book captured by
Finnish spies (but he secretly kept a copy, which eventually helped
the United States decode Soviet cables and helped break the Soviet
spy rings).
</P>
<P>
   And Henry A. Wallace, Roosevelt's vice president and Truman's
commerce secretary, had a remarkable breakfast with the Soviet
station chief in Washington in October 1945, offering insights and
seeking support for his political ideas, like placing custody of
atomic weapons with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Had a petty bureaucrat undertaken such a rendezvous and been
caught, he might well have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1946, almost every member of the Soviet spy network
recruited in the United States before and during World War II was
out of business. They were disaffected, or they had defected. They
awaited arrest or had already been arrested. They were exiles and
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   While the House Committee on Un-American Activities was setting
up shop, the Soviet station in Washington was a shell, its spies
reduced to clipping newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruined lives of those who spied for the Soviets are
testimony to the perfidiousness of intelligence services
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers put it best in describing his testimony against Hiss.
In a letter to a friend, he said, ``It was all for nothing, that
nothing had been gained except the misery of others.''

   And it underscores how much the most powerful people in
Washington freely gave Moscow when faced with a common enemy in
wartime. On balance, it appears that Moscow gained more from its
open alliances with the United States than from its secret American
underground.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of ``The Haunted Wood,'' Allen Weinstein, the
founder of the Center for Democracy, a Washington foundation, and
Alexander Vassiliev, a Russian spy turned reporter, hoped for
revelations when they burrowed into the archives of the chief
Soviet foreign intelligence service, the KGB, which granted (and
then withdrew) access in exchange for cash from Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the history of war and diplomacy without secret
intelligence files is like building a house without a blueprint:
The angles go awry, the foundation tilts. With the files, history
can outstrip any novelist's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But not all was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   If the late Alger Hiss indeed spent a decade as a Soviet agent,
as is now generally thought by Cold War scholars, what did he
actually do? No answers came; they may reside in the still-closed
files of another bureaucracy, the Soviet military intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   The files that were opened showed that Soviet espionage in the
United States was clearly less than masterful under Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present we don't have any agents'' in Washington began one
plaintive message from the Soviets' New York station. One Soviet
station chief in Washington spoke no English, which somewhat
limited his ability to move in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Purges and paranoia in Moscow put some of the best operatives in
prison or the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets did eventually acquire networks of agents in the
United States, some of whom thought they were working for the
Communist Party of the United States and its boss, Earl Browder,
and some of whom realized that their true masters were in Moscow.
The agents penetrated the Justice Department and the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The files show that they even had an agent in Congress: Rep.
Samuel Dickstein, who represented a swath of Manhattan's Lower East
Side and was generally useless to his Soviet paymasters.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike their British counterparts, the American agents of
the international communist conspiracy were ``as sloppy as you can
get,'' Weinstein noted in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Americans working for the Soviets in the United
States eventually were done in by their own clumsiness or betrayed
by their colleagues. The main reason they survived as long as they
did was incompetent (or nonexistent) American counterintelligence
before Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, they did more for Moscow than any spy network.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt granted diplomatic recognition,
which gave the Soviets embassies to use as spy stations in the
United States. And he gave amnesty to Browder, a valued spy for
Moscow who had been jailed for passport fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like so many others, he was purged by Stalin. ( Browder's
downfall alienated a key American spy for the Soviets, Elizabeth
Bentley, who turned informer. Her testimony led to a confession
from another Russian agent, Whittaker Chambers. Chambers later
testified as the key witness in the government's perjury
prosecution of Hiss. In intelligence, as in biology, everything is
connected to everything else).
</P>
<P>
   William Donovan, the head of the Office of Strategic Services,
the wartime spy organization, undertook deep exchanges of
intelligence with the Soviets, sometimes exceeding his instructions
from Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   He even returned to the Soviets a crucial code book captured by
Finnish spies (but he secretly kept a copy, which eventually helped
the United States decode Soviet cables and helped break the Soviet
spy rings).
</P>
<P>
   And Henry A. Wallace, Roosevelt's vice president and Truman's
commerce secretary, had a remarkable breakfast with the Soviet
station chief in Washington in October 1945, offering insights and
seeking support for his political ideas, like placing custody of
atomic weapons with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Had a petty bureaucrat undertaken such a rendezvous and been
caught, he might well have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1946, almost every member of the Soviet spy network
recruited in the United States before and during World War II was
out of business. They were disaffected, or they had defected. They
awaited arrest or had already been arrested. They were exiles and
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   While the House Committee on Un-American Activities was setting
up shop, the Soviet station in Washington was a shell, its spies
reduced to clipping newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruined lives of those who spied for the Soviets are
testimony to the perfidiousness of intelligence services
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers put it best in describing his testimony against Hiss.
In a letter to a friend, he said, ``It was all for nothing, that
nothing had been gained except the misery of others.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 31, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For a generation,
Republicans have represented resurgent American conservatism. But
now, with the budget balanced and significant reductions in crime,
welfare, divorce and single motherhood, Republicans find themselves
defined by impeachment and their argument that President Clinton
represents a nation in moral decline. They are also finding that
Americans are leery of a party that appears to be pressing for
moral cleansing. By Richard L Berke. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW (Berlin) _ If the late '90s have
produced a dirty word in Europe, it is perhaps `conservative.' The
right-of-center ideology that played an important role in
privatization, advancing the market economy and facing down the
Soviet Union has fizzled. At the beginning of the decade,
conservatives were in charge or on the rise nearly everywhere in
Europe, but today there is not a single major country where that is
true. By Roger Cohen. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ZERO-TOLERANCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Zero-tolerance'' policies of
seizing cars, boats and other property of persons suspected but not
convicted of drug trafficking or other offenses pleased
criminal-justice conservatives, but enraged scores of motorists,
boat owners, civil libertarians and policy analysts. Critics
complained that draconian steps tie up enforcement personnel better
deployed elsewhere, swamp overburdened administrative systems and
worse, provide little if any deterrence. By David Johnston. (`a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-RITUALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Although resisting major
change, the Catholic Church has been enacting lesser changes in
ritual and practice designed to render ancient religious customs
compatible with the spirit of the times. In much of this, experts
say, the Vatican struggles to take into account the sensibilities
and convictions of a widely varying membership in broadly differing
societies. A recent statement on exorcism is an example. By John
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   DISEASE-CLUSTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Disease clusters are
concentrated areas in which an unusually high percentage of people
succumb to some type of illness, possibly caused by local
environmental conditions. Every time a disease cluster turns up,
communities worry, scientists scramble for a cause and, as in ``A
Civil Action'' lawyers start suing. Yet over and over again,
despite years _ sometimes decades _ of efforts to link the disease
with a cause, scientists usually come up empty-handed. By Gina
Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-DEBT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The end of the annual budget
deficit is hardly the end of the government's financial troubles,
and it marks the beginning of a new debate over how fiscal policy
should be used to shape the nation's future. The cumulative the
national debt built up over decades of deficit spending remains an
economic millstone of considerable proportions. And only now do
Congress and the White House have the luxury of debating what to do
about it. By Richard W. Stevenson. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   EARTHQUAKE-HOUSES-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Americans viewing the
devastation caused by the earthquake in Colombia might be tempted
to knock on wood. Wood-frame houses, the type generally built in
the United States, can stand up far better in quakes than the
outwardly solid masonry homes that crumpled so quickly in Colombia.
By Andrew Pollack
</P>
<P>
   SEX-MUTANTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Evolutionary biologists have long
wondered why sexual reproduction took precedence over asexual
reproduction. Now, a new report shows there is indeed a purpose to
sex: to sweep away the bad mutations that would otherwise drag us
toward terminal degeneracy. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Much of the Senate debate
during the impeachment trial has been over to the degree to which
the proceedings should be conducted publicly or in closed session.
A look at the background of Senate secrecy and openness. By
Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-ESSAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ So it has come to this. The
essay, that great literary art form, has fallen to a state where
someone thinks it is a swell idea to ask a computer if an essay is
any good. The new computer, which is called e-rater, will be used
along with a trained human to grade the two essay questions on the
Graduate Management Admission Test taken by 200,000 business-school
applicants each year. By Janny Scott.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOVIET-ESPIONAGE-REVIEW (Washington) _ A new book, `The Haunted
Wood: Soviet Espionage in America _ The Stalin Era,' offers a new
look at what communist spies were really up to in this country
before and during World War II. It is a staggering account of
sloppiness and stupidity among the Soviets and their American
agents. And it underscores how much the most powerful people in
Washington freely gave Moscow when faced with a common enemy in
wartime. On balance, it appears that Moscow gained more from its
open alliances with the United States than from its secret American
underground. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HUSSEIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Shakespeare showed royalty to
be larger than life, but in the end very human. Now, from the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, comes evidence to support that
portrayal: a most extraordinary document in the voice of a
modern-day king struggling with his own mortality as he grapples
with issues that were the stuff of the 16th century.

ISRAEL'S NEW CENTRIST LEADER BOWS TO RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Roni Milo, the former mayor of Tel Aviv, is Israel's
Mr. Secular. A former member of the conservative Likud Party, he
founded the political center last spring partly to create an
enlightened middle-of-the-road movement that would not capitulate
to religious coercion by strictly Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, though, when his brainchild, the center party, had
its debut, Milo was No. 4 on the party ticket. The party leader,
Yitzhak Mordechai, the newly ousted defense minister, was wearing a
yarmulke, quoting from psalms, and kissing his own fingertips after
gently tugging the beard of a strictly Orthodox rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   These things were symbolic, meant to signal from the start that
the Kurdish-born Mordechai, who does not normally wear a skullcap,
wanted to be the candidate of his people, the Sephardic Jews who
happen to comprise a crucial constituency of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mordechai went on to cast the deciding vote in
Parliament on a contentious bill sponsored by the strictly
Orthodox, that struck at the core of the party's fledgling identity
as it heads toward the May 17 elections here. The Parliament was
deadlocked on the bill, which intended to bypass a Supreme Court
order to integrate the all-Orthodox religious councils by including
Reform and Conservative Jewish members. At the last minute,
Mordechai swept onto the floor and broke the tie with his vote
against religious pluralism, a triumphant look on his face as he
hugged Aryeh Deri, the leader of Shas, the religious Sephardic
party.
</P>
<P>
   In one fell swoop, Mordechai cost the center some of its support
among secular Israelis and raised howls of criticism from Jews
abroad. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the No. 2 man in the party, was in the
United States trying to raise funds for the new center party at the
time of the vote; Milo was on his way. They were put in the
position of trying to explain exactly where the party stands on the
secular-religious divide when Mordechai seemingly betrayed them by
voting his conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mordechai is trying to court the Shas vote, that is crystal
clear, but it seems that this time he has just gone too far,'' said
Chemi Shalev, a political analyst for the Maariv newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The potential trade-off seems clear: traditional Sephardic
voters for center-left voters. But whether Mordechai will be
successful in winning over Shas voters is uncertain. It depends on
the rabbi whose beard he tugged.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of Shas, dictates whom
the party endorses, and he criticized Mordechai for leaving Likud
and joining forces with the secular Milo, whom the strictly
religious see as Public Enemy No. 1, according to the Shas
newspaper. But the same newspaper indicated that Mordechai still
stands strong because he is Sephardic and traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu came under fire last week from within his own party
because he no longer has a Sephardic minister in the top ranks of
his Cabinet since he dismissed Mordechai last weekend. Now
Netanyahu is flanked by two elite old-timers _ Ariel Sharon, the
foreign minister, and Moshe Arens, the new defense minister. Most
of the field workers for the Likud Party are young and Sephardic,
and some believe a leadership team consisting of Netanyahu and two
Ashkenazi men over 70 could be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   When Mordechai cast his vote on the religious council's bill,
the Labor Party jumped right on it. ``The new center party
presented itself to the public just last night speaking of its
desire to create a new political culture of reconciliation,'' it
said in a news release. ``Apparently this doesn't apply to the
religious community, at least in so far as Reform and Conservative
Jews are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   On the left and the right, the two major parties are flummoxed
by the entrance of Mordechai into a race where the traditional
political dynamic is in constant flux. Both Netanyahu and Ehud
Barak, the Labor Party leader, are banking on the hope that
Mordechai and his party will stumble and fade because of
inexperience and incongruities among them.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the concerns of last week highlighted the constituent
and personality politics that seem to be dominating this volatile
election season. So busy were the politicians talking about
themselves that no one seemed to notice that a key day had come and
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was supposed to have marked the completion of the
implementation of the Wye peace accord. But the peace effort is in
the deep freeze, and forgotten in the electoral fuss. Nobody
mentioned it.

   ENVIRON-POWERSHARE (Washington) _ The new environmental
proposals that the Clinton administration is sending to Congress in
its budget request for the year 2000 include new ways to deliver
money to state and local governments to spend as they see fit, a
sign that environmental power-sharing is taking a firmer hold than
ever before. Among other things, the White House is seeking
expanded grants of conservation funds to states for purchasing
ecologically sensitive lands; federal payments to cities for
controlling the air pollutants that cause global warming; tax
credits to make it cheaper for local authorities to issue bonds for
environmental purposes; and bigger federal contributions to state
revolving funds that pay for municipal water treatment. By John H.

Online is now the gateway to cyberspace for more Americans than the

   SCHOOL-PROMOTION (Philadelphia) _ Fear of being kept back in
school is intense these days. Nationwide, many schoolchildren
either heard, or heard about, President Clinton's State of the
Union speech in which he advocated federal financial rewards for
schools that end the policy known as social promotion, or moving
children from grade to grade regardless of their performance. Most
education experts say social promotion has not been widespread for
years. Philadelphia, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and other cities,
is already moving in that direction, adopting tougher academic
standards for promotion, and creating programs as part of a
comprehensive policy to phase in higher academic standards. By

HAPPY HOMEOWNERS AT NEW YORK CITY'S LONE TRAILER PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Griswold!'' cried Bill Henrich. ``You know they
don't like loose pets!''
</P>
<P>
   The dog scurried back onto the porch, having run up against one
of the many rules that regulate Henrich's pristine community: Dogs
must be leashed inside the premises. Lawns must be kept mowed. Cars
cannot be repaired in the street. Drivers must obey the
seven-mile-per-hour speed limit. Potential residents must undergo
strict financial scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Such strictures are common to co-ops, gated communities and
similarly elite, and expensive, housing. But Henrich, a 47-year-old
bus driver at La Guardia Airport, lives in a mobile-home park _ the
city's only one _ perched on the far western edge of Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular imagination, the term ``trailer park'' suggests
downward mobility, the back end of the American dream. In fact,
over the last few decades federal regulations have raised the
quality of mobile homes, now known formally as manufactured
housing. To many Americans, they represent the first rung of
homeownership.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly true for some of the 128 homeowners who live
in the Goethals Garden Homes Community, a semirural slice of land
near the Goethals Bridge. And to working-class New Yorkers, for
whom a tight housing market often means choosing among overpriced
and unattractive options, the lure is particularly powerful: The
mobile homes offer more space for less money than do most
apartments, as well as privacy and a peace hard to come by
elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats anywhere,'' said Lourdes Espinoza, who between rent
for the land and the mortgage on her three-bedroom mobile home has
been paying $700 a month. Her family is growing, so she is planning
to move, but for young couples with small families, or retirees,
the park is ideal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The park may seem to be an experiment worth duplicating in a
city ever in search of creative housing solutions, but that seems
unlikely: Zoning regulations passed in the early 1960s ban trailer
parks. So, while the state now has 1,985 registered trailer parks
containing 86,737 units, New York City has exactly one.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-acre Goethals park was established in 1969 by two
brothers, Fred and Frank DeDomenico, who took advantage of a zoning
loophole permitting mobile-home parks on land zoned for
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   After the brothers had started developing the site, the City
Planning Commission closed the loophole, and they had to file suit
to continue. After five years, they won, and in the early 1980s
tenants began moving in.
</P>
<P>
   The location has its drawbacks: The park lies in a flight path
and next to the Staten Island Expressway, and its back end abuts a
mosquito-friendly marsh. Smells from the Fresh Kills landfill and
industrial areas occasionally waft over the park, Ms. Espinoza
said. And many residents face a long commute: It can take Henrich,
for example, up to two hours to get home from work.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the rules. One relatively new resident, who would
not give his name during an recent interview, complained that he
was not allowed to lay a concrete path outside his door or install
a wood-burning stove, and he had to keep the wheels of his trailer
covered.
</P>
<P>
   But most residents say the rules have helped save the place. In
1995, the park was more than half-empty, and the community was
crumbling. A rent strike had soured relations between the owner at
the time and tenants. Many of them, fearing that the park would be
sold, panicked and moved out. Maintenance and sanitary conditions
were on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Seventh Garden Park Limited Partnership bought
the park, and Garden Homes Management Corporation, which owns 70
trailer parks in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, took over
management. Garden Homes put several hundred thousand dollars into
upgrading the park, said Helene Stancato, director of the company's
manufactured-housing division, repaving the roads, adding street
lights and ``heavily'' upgrading the sewage treatment plant. It
also lowered the rent, which is now $410 a month including sewage,
garbage and water service; taxes, and grounds maintenance.
(Residents own their homes but lease the land.)
</P>
<P>
   And it established, in a park where homes are about 25 feet
apart, what Ms. Stancato calls ``reasonable rules for community
living,'' rules like, ``You can't let dogs poop on other people's
places,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the park is full and the bad feelings are gone.
Maintenance problems are quickly dispatched, residents say, and the
grounds are nearly immaculate.
</P>
<P>
   The determination to preserve order is visible at the park's
front edge, where signs on the fence list the various regulations
about dogs and cars and decorous signs announce, ``E-F Row,'' ``G-H
Row'' and so on. Each row consists of perfectly aligned homes of
virtually identical rectangular contours, all with clapboard siding
and pointed shingle roofs. The visual effect is that of a small
Levittown.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their prefabricated nature, the homes have been
inimitably individualized. Some have open porches, some have
screened porches, and some have small storage sheds in the rear.
They have been painted yellow or blue or beige or white, and the
small lawns are bedecked with dolls or animals or Madonnas or
``Welcome'' signs. Some have little fountains and fish ponds in the
front. The park is relentlessly cheerful, and almost eerily
tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For many residents, that is the lure.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Soto, 35, moved to Garden Homes two years ago, after 15
years in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. There, life was full
of noise and commotion, and enough danger to make his children
virtual prisoners in their apartment, he said. A few years ago, on
the Fourth of July, the children looked out the window and saw a
shooting. ``My wife said, `It's time to get out of here,''' said
Soto, a doorman in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At Garden Homes, his two boys are free to ride their bikes along
the paved roads. He has a porch, and a shed he built himself; next
season, he wants to add a deck. Inside, the Sotos have a washer and
dryer, a big closet and more space _ including three bedrooms and a
300-square-foot living room _ than they could afford in Sunset
Park. The total price: $43,000, including taxes. The requirement
that residents own, not rent, keeps things orderly, he said. ``When
you own, you take care of things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another relative newcomer from Brooklyn is Raymond Morales, 56,
who moved from Canarsie a year ago with his wife, Olga, and their
15-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said: ``People say, `You live in a trailer park,' like
it's a slum. It's mostly professional, hard-working people.''
</P>
<P>
   A security officer for Citibank in Brooklyn, Morales was paying
rent of $1,200 a month in Canarsie. ``I said, `Let me buy my own
thing,''' he recalled. He spotted the park from the road while
driving by.
</P>
<P>
   For $47,500, he bought a home. He has his own driveway to park
his three cars. He has central heat and air conditioning, two
bedrooms, one-and-a-half bathrooms, a washer and dryer, a spacious
living room and a kitchen. His mortgage is $275 a month; his rent
$410, bringing the total to $685.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' he said. ``We are out of the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wildrick, 66, has watched the park sag and then rebound
from the front porch of the mobile home he moved to 16 years ago. A
former typewriter mechanic _ ``I worked on every typewriter in the
book'' _ he gave up his two-story home elsewhere on Staten Island
after he was struck by a degenerative muscle disease. He now uses a
motorized scooter to get around.
</P>
<P>
   The strike and associated court battles were a ``regular
mess-up,'' he said, speaking in his faux-wood-paneled living room,
pink curtains catching the light behind him. The lesson, he said,
was that ``here, people have to work together a little.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the park's residents seem to have knit a workable
community fabric, in which families largely keep to themselves but
respect each other's differences. Henrich noted that the park
accommodates a surprising diversity of residents. ``Blacks, whites,
all kinds of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it should be,'' he said, adding, ``Not that I'm
a liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Henrich's parents were among those who fled after the rent
strike; they took their mobile home to New Jersey. But Henrich
liked the park, so he bought his own home and stayed behind. He
said he would stay in the park as long as he could.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard rumors that the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey might take the land to build a second Goethals bridge, but
Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the authority, said a new span would
not affect the Garden Homes property.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for Henrich. ``I don't know where I could
go,'' he said. ``I don't know what else I could afford.''

CLEMENCY FOR KILLER SURPRISES MANY WHO FOLLOWED CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REEDS SPRING, Mo. _ For three days, hiding in a hunting blind,
wearing camouflage and face paint, the killer lay in wait. Then, on
a gravel path snaking through the dense woods of this hilly Ozark
town, he saw the victims and he pounced.
</P>
<P>
   He ambushed them as they trundled down the path on their
all-terrain vehicles _ a 69-year-old man who the authorities say
was the killer's former drug partner, the man's 56-year-old wife
and the couple's 19-year-old grandson, a paraplegic who had to be
tied to his vehicle to drive it.
</P>
<P>
   The killer, Darrell Mease, shot all three with a shotgun from
about 30 feet away and then, for good measure, he got up very close
and shot each one in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Folks around here say there has rarely been a more cold-blooded
killing in this part of Missouri, a rustic stretch of country just
over the Arkansas border.
</P>
<P>
   And so it seemed all the more unusual that Gov. Mel Carnahan, a
proponent of capital punishment, would allow himself to be swayed
by a request from the visiting Pope John Paul II and decide to
commute Mease's sentence to life without parole just two weeks
before he was to die by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of the defense lawyers who has been handling the legal
appeals of Mease's death sentence could not conceal his surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, this case was probably one of the weaker
clemency cases,'' said the lawyer, Kent Gipson. ``In this case
there were no real claims of mental illness, no question of guilt.
It was a triple murder. He had one argument dealing with
post-traumatic stress from Vietnam, but really he had a snowball's
chance in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gipson said he could name ``lots of others,'' including people
already executed, who were much more sympathetic candidates for
clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess timing is everything, huh?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mease's unwitting good fortune began in November when the
Missouri Supreme Court scheduled him to die on Jan. 27, which would
have been the second day of the scheduled two-day visit to St.
Louis by the pope, the leader of a church whose doctrine staunchly
opposes the death penalty. A few days after it set the execution
date, the court abruptly changed it to Feb. 10. The court offered
no explanation, but the move was widely interpreted as a way to
avoid such a glaringly uncomfortable coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in St. Louis, the pope urged Carnahan, in person
and through an aide, to spare the life of Mease, who is 52, and
also made public appeals against the death penalty. And Carnahan,
who has approved 26 executions since he took office in 1993, said
he was so moved by the pope's entreaties that he decided to make
one exception.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the decision was not very popular among
those who knew the victims, Lloyd and Frankie Lawrence and their
grandson, William, who lived in the town of Shell Knob, about 25
miles southwest of Reeds Spring.
</P>
<P>
   George Marion, who described himself as one of Lloyd Lawrence's
``closest buddies,'' said that if he could get close enough to the
pope, ``I'd cock him straight and sure in the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lawrence, son of Lloyd and Frankie, said that what upset
him was not that Mease's life was being spared; he was angry that
no official had called to inform him of the change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, we told the jury that we'd be fine with
whatever they worked out, whether it was death or life in prison,''
Lawrence said. ``What bothered us is that we did not hear from
anyone. As far as I'm concerned, the governor and the pope are
showing more mercy towards a convicted killer than towards us.''
</P>
<P>
   But here in Reeds Spring, where the population of 411 has been
preoccupied lately with the indictment of the mayor on charges that
he persuaded a 15-year-old girl and other minors to engage in
sexually explicit conduct while he photographed them, people seemed
more astonished than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so amazing that someone would be in prison for
murder from such a small place as Reeds Spring, and then the pope,
from Rome you know, would be here and all these events would come
together,'' said Terry Teague, 41, who owns a sign shop in town.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in this part of Missouri are Roman Catholic; many are
of fundamentalist Christian faiths. And like many people here,
Teague described himself as a supporter of the death penalty but
said that because he knew Mease's family, he sympathized with them.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that sometime before the 1988 murders, Mease, a
carpenter and handyman, had begun working for the elder Lawrence,
whom they described as one of the region's primary makers of the
drug methamphetamine. Lawrence, who owned wooded property in Reeds
Spring, also ran illegal cock fights.
</P>
<P>
   James Justus, the Taney County prosecutor on the case, said that
Mease got involved in Lawrence's drug operation, but that the two
had a falling out and Mease stole six two-liter Pepsi bottles full
of methamphetamine worth thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Justus said, Mease fled, believing Lawrence had put
out a contract on his life. But he got tired of running, Justus
said, and decided to come back and kill Lawrence and take over the
drug business himself.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1988, Mease hiked into the woods on Lawrence's property
and ambushed the Lawrences. Mease, whose girlfriend testified
against him, confessed to the murders, but on appeal said his
confession had been obtained illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Justus said he supported the governor's right to commute a death
sentence, but was disappointed that he chose this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hard decision to go for the death penalty,''
Justus said, adding that in the 20 murder cases he has tried, he
has asked for the death penalty in only one case besides the Mease
case, and his request was not granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made that decision and convinced 12 jurors and a judge it
was the right decision,'' Justus said of the Mease case. ``We've
also spent the last nine years arguing his appeals and have
convinced every one of them it was the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In Reeds Spring, Mease's mother, Lexie, who described herself as
a devout Pentecostal, said she believed all along that her son's
sentence would be commuted, ever since he had a conversion soon
after his arrest. She also believes he will be let out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to be in the position he was in so he can come out and
do God's work,'' Mrs. Mease said. ``By being there, he can
understand what it is to be in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mease had apparently believed he would be spared, deciding
not to make funeral plans to avoid suggesting he did not have faith
that God would save him.
</P>
<P>
   But Mease's younger brother, Larry, 51, said his own convictions
had been less sure. Until his brother was on death row, Larry Mease
had been a death penalty proponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was looking at the victims' side,'' he said. ``It's
different when you're on the other side.''

GOP LEADERS HOPE PLAN FOR TAX CUT WILL UNITE PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Minn., Mo., Mich.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In placing income-tax reductions at the heart of
their agenda this year, Republican leaders are hoping to rally
their fractious party around an issue they have long believed is
economically sound as well as politically appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stars in many ways are lined up in the Republicans'
favor _ the federal government's coffers are overflowing _ they
face a difficult battle to enact their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some Republicans acknowledge that their real goal this
year is to force a debate on a big tax cut, pass it even if
President Clinton is sure to veto it, and use the issue to define
what their party stands for heading into the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will lose if we don't have an agenda that includes bold
examples of economic common sense,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican
pollster who has long argued that taxes are the most powerful issue
available to the party. ``This is not only good politics but
honest, good Republican principle.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing over fiscal policy as the nation moves from an
era of huge budget deficits to one of projected surpluses will
intensify on Monday, when Clinton sends Congress his budget
proposals for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The president has framed the debate in a way that suggests
cutting taxes would imperil efforts to ensure the viability of the
Social Security and Medicare systems, a political maneuver that
Republicans say is misleading but that nonetheless could be hard
for them to counter.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also say that an across-the-board reduction in the tax
rate would favor the rich over the middle class, a longstanding
argument but one that continues to put Republicans on the
defensive. Moreover, Democrats have their own agenda of narrowly
drawn tax cuts intended to help specific groups like parents with
children, an approach they hope will neutralize the political
advantage Republicans have long held on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   There are encouraging signs for the Democrats. A survey this
month by the Pew Research Center asked which party had the best
ideas on tax cuts. The Democrats were favored over Republicans, 45
percent to 32 percent, roughly the same breakdowns as on
traditional Democratic issues like education, Social Security and
patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public overwhelmingly favors saving Social Security to tax
cuts and prefers targeted tax cuts as a means of solving problems
to across-the-board tax cuts,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic
strategist. ``The basic fact is that the Republicans have run out
of compelling things to say to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Confident that tax-cutting remains a potent issue for them,
Republicans are piecing together their initial legislative
tax-cutting proposals. Republican aides said Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, would
introduce a plan soon under which income-tax rates could be cut as
much as 14 percent across the board over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the cuts would be phased in slowly. For next year, the cut
would probably be no more than 1 percent, building to as much as 4
percent in 2002 and 14 percent in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The Domenici plan is based on estimates of budget surpluses
released on Friday by the Congressional Budget Office. Those
estimates showed that the government would have an overall surplus
of nearly $2.7 trillion from this year through 2009. Most of the
surplus is accounted for by excess payroll-tax revenues that are
earmarked for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in 2001, the government will begin running a
surplus even without relying on revenues from the Social Security
payroll tax, money that Republicans say makes it possible to cut
taxes without endangering Social Security. Under that accounting,
the budget surplus over the next decade that does not come from
Social Security taxes would be nearly $800 billion, and Domenici is
considering using about $640 billion of that to reduce income-tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota is working on a 10 percent
across-the-board rate cut that could be phased in more quickly than
Domenici envisions. Former Vice President Dan Quayle advocates a 30
percent across-the-board rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   Enacting a 10 percent across-the-board reduction would reduce
the current top rate of 39.6 percent to 35.6 percent, and the 28
percent rate to 25.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Income-tax rate reductions across the board are one of the few
issues on which economic and social conservatives are united,
Republicans said, and one of the best ways for the party to hammer
home its message that the government should be smaller and less
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The across-the-board tax cut says Washington doesn't have all
the answers,'' Grams said, ``and it ensures that your family's
dollars are spent on family priorities, not on Washington's
spending schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic argument over income-tax rate reductions centers on
whether it is fair to low- and middle-income workers, and on
whether tax cuts are the best way of bringing more economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   A study this month by Citizens for Tax Justice, a
liberal-leaning research organization, found that 62 percent of the
benefits of a 10 percent across-the-board income-tax reduction
would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of the population. The bottom
60 percent would get less than 10 percent of the benefits of the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than embracing the administration's plan for saving
Social Security now and strengthening Medicare,'' said Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House,
Republicans are intent on pushing through ``a massive GOP tax cut
for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were resigned to similar Democratic
attacks throughout the debate. But they said there is a strong case
to be made that an across-the-board rate cut would be a good thing
for the economy, as it would stimulate more consumption and
savings. And they said tax cuts would surely be fairer and more
productive than allowing Democrats to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When, if not now, would we cut taxes?'' said Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich. ``If we can see trillions of dollars in surplus in
the years ahead, when will we ever have a day in which there isn't
some new program or old program, or some new idea that somebody
comes up with, that somehow warrants keeping the money here.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Republicans have been united in rallying
around an income-tax cut. But their tax-cutting agenda fell victim
last year to squabbling within the party's ranks, and some
Republicans remain wary of Clinton's ability to maneuver them into
a situation in which they do not manage to pass the kind of big tax
cut they are discussing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one risk for Republicans, and it's a significant
one,'' said Luntz. ``That is to promise the public a tax cut and
then not deliver. It's one thing for Bill Clinton to veto it. It's
another to talk about it and then not pass it.''

HONG KONG RULING MAY OPEN DOOR FROM CHINA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a landmark decision that could open this enclave
to thousands of mainland Chinese, a court ruled Friday that four
children born in China to Hong Kong parents have the right to live
here.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing the children to stay, Hong Kong's Court of Final
Appeal asserted that local laws take precedence over mainland
Chinese laws, which make it extremely difficult for people born in
the mainland to move to Hong Kong, even if their parents are
residents of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Chinese fit that definition. And officials
here said they expected a flood of mainland residents would now try
to enter Hong Kong, either by legal means or by sneaking across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means, potentially, the pool of persons in the mainland
eligible for right of abode in Hong Kong will be substantially
greater than our original estimate,'' said Regina Ip, the secretary
of security.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong became part of China on July 1, 1997, the
territory remains off limits to most mainland Chinese. China and
Hong Kong impose strict immigration laws because both sides fear
that Hong Kong, with its high wages and living standard, will
become a magnet for people from the poorer mainland. People who
travel between Hong Kong and China must still pass through
checkpoints that bristle with guards, searchlights and razor-sharp
fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 1.2 billion people north of the border, at least
200 million of whom would love to live here,'' said Michael
DeGolyer, a professor of government at Baptist University in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Before the handover, though, Hong Kong made an exception to its
rules for children of Hong Kong residents who were born on the
mainland. Under the terms of its constitution, the Basic Law, Hong
Kong granted those people the right to live in the territory. More
than 40,000 people _ the majority of them children _ moved here and
claimed residency.
</P>
<P>
   That loophole was closed after the handover, when China
dissolved Hong Kong's democratically elected legislature and
replaced it with a Beijing-appointed assembly. Among the new
legislature's first acts was to tighten the immigration
regulations, so that children of Hong Kong parents would have to
apply for permission to live here from the mainland Chinese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the children, who range from 8 to 20 years old, sued
the Hong Kong government _ contending that the new rules violated
the Basic Law, which guarantees the territory a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Friday, Hong Kong's highest court struck down the
rules, which means the children do not have to return to China.
Moreover, children of Hong Kong parents who currently live in China
can apply to courts here rather than in China for the right to move
to the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy leaders applauded the ruling as a ringing
affirmation of Hong Kong's judicial independence, at a time when
other recent cases have raised fears that the courts here were
surrendering their authority.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Researchers fight to stay a step ahead of the
AIDS virus' ability to take on new forms
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago, Bruce Almond learned he was out of
options.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Inman Park resident, who tested positive for HIV
in 1990, underwent a test in January 1997 that indicated he had
developed resistance to just about every AIDS drug on the market.
In other words, they would no longer work.
</P>
<P>
   But Almond was optimistic. He had never progressed to full-blown
AIDS. The amount of virus in his blood was reassuringly low. He was
healthy and vigorous; he could have passed for someone 10 years
younger.
</P>
<P>
   So he and his doctor decided he would stay on his HIV
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor didn't really change the cocktail around,'' Almond
said. ``He said, `Let's just stick with what we've got.'''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS virus is clumsy. And that may be one of its greatest
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   When HIV copies itself, as it endlessly does in the human body,
it is liable to make mistakes. These mistakes change the virus'
genetic blueprint ever so slightly _ enough to create a
drug-resistant version of the virus, much harder to treat.
</P>
<P>
   This genetic sleight of hand is nothing new to doctors, who face
it with other infectious diseases. What dismays AIDS specialists
and their patients, though, is the frightening swiftness with which
HIV can mutate and shield itself against anti-HIV drugs. Just a few
missed doses can allow a person's infection to resurge _ often in a
less vulnerable form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the resistance issue is a major one, and will remain
a critical one for a while,'' said Dr. Mark Feinberg, associate
director of AIDS research at Emory University's Rollins School of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   HIV resistance will be a major topic at this week's Conference
on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago, where more
than 3,000 AIDS doctors and researchers will discuss advances and
obstacles in HIV treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the discussion will focus on a relatively new tool, HIV
resistance testing, and whether it can help physicians predict the
success or failure of drug treatment. Genetics laboratories and
pharmaceutical firms are pushing the technological envelope in
developing and honing these resistance tests, which they say could
_ and should _ become a routine part of HIV care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet AIDS specialists are divided over the usefulness of these
tests. They do agree on one thing: Once resistance begins,
patients' options diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical roulette
</P>
<P>
   When a person taking anti-HIV drugs develops drug resistance,
the virus is no longer held in check. Mutated, resistant forms of
HIV quickly proliferate. If enough resistant virus is present, the
patient may have to change drugs _ if other drugs still are
options.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 anti-HIV drugs have Food and Drug Administration
approval. Optimally, the drugs should be taken in combinations of
two, three or more. But resistance to one anti-HIV drug often
confers cross-resistance to other drugs in the same class, further
reducing options.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had hoped that protease inhibitors, the powerful class
of drugs that revolutionized HIV therapy a few years ago and led to
dramatic drops in U.S. AIDS deaths, wouldn't show significant
cross-resistance. But they do.
</P>
<P>
   Now, doctors and patients must play a perilous game of chemical
roulette, switching drugs to find a regimen that the patient can
tolerate and that HIV can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic theme is, the more drugs a person has been treated
with, the less likely he will respond,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Because even a brief halt in drug therapy, via missed doses, can
allow resistance to develop, patients must follow strict dosing
routines. That can be difficult because a typical regimen can
require five separate doses with numerous pills, some to be taken
on an empty stomach, others with meals. The drugs also have severe,
sometimes intolerable, side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors frequently pin drug resistance on non-adherent patients,
which frustrates people who have followed their regimens. ``I've
never missed a dose, ever,'' said Brandon Abernathy, 38, of East
Point, who has been HIV-positive for at least 17 years. He recently
changed his therapy after being tested for resistance. ``I've never
been more than an hour late, and I can count those times on one
hand. I eat when I'm supposed to. I'm educated about this disease.
That's why I've lived so damn long.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially frightening is that people are starting to become
infected with HIV strains already resistant to several drugs. ``You
can imagine how terrible a situation that is for someone,'' said
Feinberg. ``Not only are you infected, but most of the drugs we
have won't work for you. It puts us back where we were 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A 'show-me field'
</P>
<P>
   HIV resistance tests fall into two categories. Genotypic tests
genetically map part of the particular strain of HIV infecting a
person and look for key mutations believed to correlate to
resistance against specific drugs. Phenotypic tests assess how
various drugs directly perform against particular viral strains.
The tests cost hundreds of dollars, and none has been approved by
the FDA, so insurance companies won't always pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that perform resistance tests say they should be a
vital tool in formulating ``drug cocktails'' for people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many physicians are extremely good at almost intuitively
knowing what to give the patients,'' said virologist Paul Feorino,
who is the laboratory director at Applied Sciences in Norcross,
which performs genotypic resistance testing. ``Now we give them the
tool so they can make the rational choice, rather than trying to
guess from their experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many noted AIDS physicians, including Feinberg, dispute the
tests' worth. They say the tests aren't sensitive enough, that not
enough is known about how HIV's genetic mutations translate into
real-life clinical outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resistance testing would be useful if you could reliably
predict whether someone is going to respond to a different
combination of drugs than the one they're being treated with,''
Feinberg said. ``But even if it were to prove to be useful, you
still need drugs to switch people to,'' he continued. ``You want
people to be healthier and live longer. You don't want to document
helplessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors don't need resistance tests to determine whether a
patient's drugs have quit working. An increasing viral load _ or
worse, an AIDS-related illness _ is a good indicator. The doctor
then must come up with alternatives, which may not exist.
</P>
<P>
   And this may be why AIDS doctors haven't fully embraced the
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut reaction is that we're much better off knowing the
patient's resistance profile,'' said Dr. John Mellors, an AIDS
expert from the University of Pittsburgh. ``But proving that has
yet to be done in a trial. There has to be a strong correlation
between resistance testing and response to the therapies. This
field is a show-me field.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies to be presented at this week's conference on
retroviruses may help establish that correlation. Visible Genetics,
the parent company of Applied Sciences, believes research data are
solid enough to support FDA approval for its test, said Robert M.
Lloyd Jr., Applied Sciences' scientific director.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who already have developed total drug
resistance can't wait for the next new AIDS drug, but must make do
with what they have. ``Even someone who gets a resistance test that
says they're not going to respond to a given combination of drugs,
and that's the last combination available, I'm sure every physician
in their right mind would give them a chance and try them,''
Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, a wait for new drugs
</P>
<P>
   Almond's luck didn't last. Recently, he sipped Ensure to try to
restore some of the 40 pounds he lost during his first AIDS-related
hospital stay, over Christmas and New Year's. He suffered a staph
infection, pneumonia and peripheral neuropathy, which causes
numbness or intense pain in the hands and legs. ``I didn't even
want to look in a mirror for a while,'' Almond said, his voice
shaky but cheerfully determined. ``But I think I'm on the mend.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been off anti-HIV medication for more than a month, on
doctor's orders, because in his weakened state he couldn't bear the
drugs' side effects. Now, he wants to go back on medication and be
retested for drug resistance. ``I feel like that's too long for me
to be off anti-retrovirals,'' Almond said. ``The virus might be
going wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have developed multi-drug resistance anxiously await
new HIV drugs, several of which are on the horizon. There's no
guarantee the drugs will work for them, but with AIDS, no one
expects guarantees. ``If you're almost dead, they'll try
anything,'' Abernathy said. ``They'll do anything.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: `I didn't know a man could get breast cancer'
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A bruise, maybe a burn. It had to be one
or the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd, comes-and-goes annoyance in any case: A bit of
soreness in the chest that didn't hurt much unless you poked it or
rolled over on it. Not the sort of thing a man worries about. Not a
busy man like Ron Stickney.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, the guy never stops.
</P>
<P>
   He volunteers with the Red Cross, rides with the Citizens
Observer Patrol. He serves on the altar every Sunday morning at
Mary Immaculate Catholic Church, and calls bingo every Monday night
at his community clubhouse. Plus all those Moose, Elks, Eagles and
Knights of Columbus meetings.
</P>
<P>
   That's how so much time passed in a flash after his early
retirement as production supervisor at the GM radiator plant in
upstate New York (35 years and never sick a day).
</P>
<P>
   It was three years before he got around to finding a doctor near
his Cypress Lakes home just outside West Palm Beach. He remembers
the date of that routine checkup: Dec. 16, 1996. He was 59 years
old. He waited until the very end of the exam to mention the
soreness that had started a month before.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered: Could it have anything to do with the oddly
inverted nipple he noticed, oh, six months or so back?
</P>
<P>
   It took three days to get the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advanced breast cancer,'' Stickney says, still sounding
amazed. ``I didn't know a man could get breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like most of the 1,600 American men who will get the same
news this year. He had three weeks to absorb the meaning of
``malignant neoplasm of the male left breast'' before surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part: In and out of the hospital in one
morning, Jan. 7, 1997. A simple scar; one nipple gone. You'd hardly
look twice.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part was getting at the cancer below that had already
invaded the bone and moved on: Six months of chemotherapy, 28
radiation treatments for the chest, 47 more for the ribs, back and
right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stickney did his best to keep up his usual pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cancer can really prey on you, boggle the mind,'' he
says. ``If you keep busy, you keep your mind off it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely. He wanted to know more about the disease, but
everything he read was written for women. ``It was pretty
frustrating,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered if there was some way to help spread the word. Soon
after his surgery, under heavy chemical and radiation bombardment,
he read about Race for the Cure, the annual fund-raiser for the
South Florida Chapter of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd like to be part of it,'' he says. ``But the more
I read, the more I thought that was all about women, too. I decided
to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It came back to him, though, when he read about this year's
race. He's 61 now and feeling a lot better _ a little weak, a
little puffy from steroids and other medicine, but strong enough to
be out on the neighborhood track every day for a brisk, four-mile
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about this year's Race for the Cure, I really got
engrossed by the idea,'' he says. ``So I called, and they were
really encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to get Jan. 30 penciled in to Ron Stickney's
busy schedule. He'll join the 5K Walk down Flagler Drive today and
then gather with other breast cancer survivors. At least a couple
of the others will be men.
</P>
<P>
   Stickney can't wait for people to ask him about his experience.

<P>
   ``I'm not a bit embarrassed,'' he says. ``There are probably a
lot more cases out there. Men don't know it can happen so they let
it go. I want to tell them not to wait, like I did.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: `I didn't know a man could get breast cancer'
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A bruise, maybe a burn. It had to be one
or the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd, comes-and-goes annoyance in any case: A bit of
soreness in the chest that didn't hurt much unless you poked it or
rolled over on it. Not the sort of thing a man worries about. Not a
busy man like Ron Stickney.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, the guy never stops.
</P>
<P>
   He volunteers with the Red Cross, rides with the Citizens
Observer Patrol. He serves on the altar every Sunday morning at
Mary Immaculate Catholic Church, and calls bingo every Monday night
at his community clubhouse. Plus all those Moose, Elks, Eagles and
Knights of Columbus meetings.
</P>
<P>
   That's how so much time passed in a flash after his early
retirement as production supervisor at the GM radiator plant in
upstate New York (35 years and never sick a day).
</P>
<P>
   It was three years before he got around to finding a doctor near
his Cypress Lakes home just outside West Palm Beach. He remembers
the date of that routine checkup: Dec. 16, 1996. He was 59 years
old. He waited until the very end of the exam to mention the
soreness that had started a month before.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered: Could it have anything to do with the oddly
inverted nipple he noticed, oh, six months or so back?
</P>
<P>
   It took three days to get the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advanced breast cancer,'' Stickney says, still sounding
amazed. ``I didn't know a man could get breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like most of the 1,600 American men who will get the same
news this year. He had three weeks to absorb the meaning of
``malignant neoplasm of the male left breast'' before surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part: In and out of the hospital in one
morning, Jan. 7, 1997. A simple scar; one nipple gone. You'd hardly
look twice.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part was getting at the cancer below that had already
invaded the bone and moved on: Six months of chemotherapy, 28
radiation treatments for the chest, 47 more for the ribs, back and
right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stickney did his best to keep up his usual pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cancer can really prey on you, boggle the mind,'' he
says. ``If you keep busy, you keep your mind off it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely. He wanted to know more about the disease, but
everything he read was written for women. ``It was pretty
frustrating,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered if there was some way to help spread the word. Soon
after his surgery, under heavy chemical and radiation bombardment,
he read about Race for the Cure, the annual fund-raiser for the
South Florida Chapter of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd like to be part of it,'' he says. ``But the more
I read, the more I thought that was all about women, too. I decided
to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It came back to him, though, when he read about this year's
race. He's 61 now and feeling a lot better _ a little weak, a
little puffy from steroids and other medicine, but strong enough to
be out on the neighborhood track every day for a brisk, four-mile
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about this year's Race for the Cure, I really got
engrossed by the idea,'' he says. ``So I called, and they were
really encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to get Jan. 30 penciled in to Ron Stickney's
busy schedule. He'll join the 5K Walk down Flagler Drive today and
then gather with other breast cancer survivors. At least a couple
of the others will be men.
</P>
<P>
   Stickney can't wait for people to ask him about his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bit embarrassed,'' he says. ``There are probably a
lot more cases out there. Men don't know it can happen so they let
it go. I want to tell them not to wait, like I did.

   HEALTH/SCIENCE: Early tests of anti-depressants seem promising
for dogs
</P>
<P>
   WITH ART on Cox WAN
</P>
<P>
   By Christi Mays
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ After at least a dozen trips to the veterinarian
to get stitches, Barry and Eva Vokes knew they had to do something
to keep their two Doberman pinscher dogs from continually hurting
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time Rex and Prince were loving house dogs who
couldn't stand to be apart from the other. Then, out of the clear
blue, a vicious fight would erupt and the blood would flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, there was no problem at all,'' Barry Vokes
said. ``But more often than we would like, they would go at each
other and we never have been able to figure out what set them off.
One minute they're just peacefully lying there and the next minute,
they're going at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vokeses found themselves in the emergency room of their vet,
Dr. Layne Gregory of Hewitt Animal Clinic, at all hours of the day
_ and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very expensive patching them up,'' Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian put the dogs on an anti-depressant drug called
amitriptyline, also known as Elavil. The drug is similar to a newly
labeled anti-depressant drug the federal government approved
recently for dogs called Clomicalm by Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a definite improvement,'' Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dogs were put on the twice-daily medication, there
have been no major fights and no midnight trips to the vet, Eva
Vokes said. The only visit the Vokes have made to the vet has been
for checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've been giving it to them, the skirmishes are few and
far between,'' said Gregory, an 18-year veterinarian. ``They
haven't been depressed, sedated or changed in personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't affected them at all that we can tell,'' Barry Vokes
added.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-depressant also has helped curb Rex's compulsive
chewing, Eva Vokes added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chewed on a lot of things,'' she said. ``Without the
medication, the walls got holes in them and the chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gregory, veterinarians for years have been
prescribing anti-depressants such as amitriptyline and Prozac to
dogs and cats with anxiety disorders and behavior problems, such as
aggression, fear and inappropriate waste elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's five or six drugs that work well,'' Gregory said.
``All seem to have a good track record. What's good about them,
they do help these guys live a happier life. It can get them over
some rough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   The approval to label Clomicalm as a drug that relieves
separation anxiety in dogs has drawn considerable publicity and
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hot topic of vet meetings for years,'' said Dr.
Robert Barkley, owner of Animal Clinic and a vet for 25 years.
``(Clomicalm) is kind of controversial right now between doctors
and drug companies because it stimulates an unbelievable amount of
interest and questions, which is good because everybody needs to be
educated on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that there's a drug labeled as an animal anti-depressant
that will help with behavioral problems, such as separation
anxiety, some fear owners and even some veterinarians will be
looking for a ``quick fix'' for an unruly pet.
</P>
<P>
   Before any drugs are administered, Barkley and Gregory agree,
that all other options should be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   If pet owners are having problems with a dog or cat, they also
need to examine any changes that might have upset the animal's
life, such as a recent move, a new baby in the household, a
divorce, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason for separation anxiety in dogs is that
owners don't spend enough time with their pet, Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, don't expect a pill to solve a problem of owners not
spending enough time with their dog,'' he said. ``No. 2, if we use
medicine or an anti-depressant, use it after we've ruled out
internal physiological problems and medical problems and use it in
combination with behavior modification. . . Many times, these drugs
are supposed to be used in combination with behavior modification.
That's a biggy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some veterinarians will be reluctant to jump on the
Clomicalm bandwagon until other vets have paved the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see me practicing on my clients until
there's been a million doses given,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Having been a vet for 25 years, he said he's used new drugs and
procedures that have later come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play this very cautiously,'' he said, explaining that
sometimes a new cure can relieve one symptom but cause other
problems in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Both veterinarians said dogs and cats are usually tapered off
antidepressant drugs after a couple of months and many never have
to be placed on them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually these kinds of problems are more short-lived,''
Gregory said. ``This simply helps the animal feel more normal.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are times he's seen these drugs fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they just don't work at all,'' he said. ``Just like
with people, sometimes they don't work every time. But it seems
like the failures are the exception rather than the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, anti-depressant drugs have been the only solution
that saved a dog or cat's life, Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some animals can be such a problem, their owners were going to
take them to the pound or put them to sleep, he said. ``I've seen
these drugs save a lot of dogs and cats and get them out of a bad
situation.''

 &HT;    Fishing schools in session
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rich Tauber, the energetic professional bass fisherman
from Woodland Hills, Calif., quickly rigs a soft plastic bait Texas
style, the silhouette of his tying projected overhead for the 200
knowledge-thirsty anglers in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Tauber, noted for his mastery of finesse fishing and other
techniques born out West, swings the lure in front of a man sitting
in the front row and jiggles it at eye level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, my man,'' Tauber says, ``How long can you put up
with me shaking this in your face like that?''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupts in laughter, but Tauber's point is well-made.
This ``doodling'' technique _ dropped straight down into a brush
pile _ is murder on Kentucky bass, known as spotted bass on Lake
Lanier, where they are most abundant in Georgia. ``Just think what
it does to those Kentucky bass,'' Tauber continues. ``I'm talking
about those bass can't stand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending last Saturday's sessions of the BASS
Fishing Techniques Institute '99, sponsored by the Bass Angler's
Sportsman Society and hosted by Kennesaw State University, tried
feverishly to follow Tauber's presentation, watching the overhead
projector and Tauber while keeping notes at the same time. Some
even glanced over the shoulder of the next person to see what he
wrote down, almost like cheating on a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of ideas from the West, completely new ways of
fishing,'' said James Clark of Suwanee, a former Memphis
firefighter who's new to Atlanta and to Lake Lanier. ``The
doodling's got me curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauber was one of six professionals-turned-instructors for the
two-day bass class, held last week at the Wyndham Garden Hotel in
Marietta, which attracted anglers of all skill levels, from the
beginner to the budding pro. Tauber joined other well-known pros
Alton Jones, Jack Hains, Larry Nixon, Greg Hines and Gerald
Swindle, to give tips on all facets of bass fishing in a
classroom-like atmosphere. The class, one of nearly 50 such
seminars held around the nation through the winter months, cost
$89, laughter included at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys aren't just instructors, they're entertainers,''
said Terry Faust, director of student financial aid at Kennesaw
State, a volunteer in running the seminar and an avid bass
fisherman on Lake Allatoona. ``This has been as much fun as
informative.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was well attended despite the severe weather last week.
The strongest storms roared through Georgia early Saturday morning,
forcing many of the attendees to drive through wind and rain, which
shows how serious some people are about catching bass.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Higdon and his 10-year-old son Josh got up at 4:30 a.m. to
drive the three-plus hours from Oldfort, Tenn., right through the
teeth of the storms. The heavy rain slowed them to 25 mph several
times, but the trip was worth the hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh is just getting into fishing,'' said Allen Higdon, who
frequently fishes the Tennessee River system. ``This will help him
learn to catch more and maybe help keep him out of trouble.'' Josh
then joked he can catch more fish than his dad. ``Son, you're going
to need more than this class to whip me,'' the father said
</P>
<P>
   Josh later added, ``I could do this class five days a week,
seven hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The class had several husband-wife duos, taking advantage of the
half-price deal for family members. Allen and Janice Cronan of
Cumming were hoping to figure out what went wrong on a recent trip
to Lake Okeechobee, Fla., during which they basically were shut
out. ``We didn't do so well,'' Allen said, to which Janice added,
``Obviously, our techniques are lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Cronan, a longtime bass fisherman and a member of the
Southern Anglers Bass Club, was surprised by how much he learned in
the seminars, even the basics. ``I learned I was setting the hook
totally wrong,'' Cronan admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Sharri Hickey, empty-nest parents of five children,
attended the seminar as they embark on a hobby they can share
together. ``She's new to fishing. I'm new to this type of
fishing,'' said Jack, a live-bait angler who has mainly fished for
catfish and bream. ``We just bought our first boat now that our
kids are gone, and we're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the pros learned a few things. ``One thing I like about
these is to come and listen to Jack and Rich,'' said Jones,
referring to Tauber and Hains, the other two instructors Saturday.
``Overall, I think doing these makes me a better fisherman. To help
people learn, we're forced to think out and analyze what we're
trying to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Hains, the 1975 BASS Masters Classic champion, added, ``From Day
1, it's about the basics. That's what we teach. That's what we
shouldn't take for granted.''

 &HT;    Bulldogs waiting on committments
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's recruiting efforts have picked up steam, but
the next few days will determine just how high the Bulldogs' class
will rank on the national level.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who added Middle Georgia Junior College linebacker
Kendrell Bell, wideout Michael Johnson of Tulsa, Okla., and
All-America offensive lineman Alex Jackson of Quincy, Fla., are
still waiting on a handful of nationally ranked prospects.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of that list are three players who could help fill
Georgia's biggest need _ running backs Bruce Thornton of LaGrange,
Nick Maddox of Kannapolis, N.C., and Cedric Cobbs of Little Rock,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, a 5-11, 182-pound Super 11 choice by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, will announce his choice between Georgia and
Tennessee on Monday. Thornton, who rushed for 1,920 yards and 28
touchdowns as a senior, eliminated Florida and Auburn, where he
visited this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, ranked the nation's No. 1 tailback prospect by some
recruiting services, made an official visit to the Georgia campus
this week. Maddox, who rushed for 2,574 yards and 34 touchdowns as
a senior, visited Florida State this weekend. He'll choose from
among Georgia, FSU, Florida and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbs, a 6-1, 217-pound Parade All-American, has narrowed his
list to Georgia and Arkansas. Cobbs, who rushed for 2,043 yards and
15 scores last season, is expected to announce his decision on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan also is eagerly awaiting announcements
from wideouts Reggie Brown of Carrollton and Durrell Robinson of
Duncan, S.C. Brown, the Journal-Constitution player of the year,
will choose from among Georgia, Ohio State and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who had 73 catches for 1,386 yards and 28 touchdowns
as a senior, has narrowed his list to Georgia and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs also are hoping for offensive lineman Kevin
Breedlove of Clemson, S.C., who visited Florida this weekend. He
also is considering UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker for Jackets
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech is expected to receive a commitment from Early
County linebacker Recardo Wembush, who also visited Florida,
Florida State and Alabama. Wembush, who had 165 tackles and three
interceptions as a senior, is regarded as the state's top
linebacker prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets lost offensive lineman Ronald Samuel, who
decommitted to Tech and says he'll sign with Auburn on Wednesday.
Tech hosted defensive lineman Greg Gathers of Reserve, La., who
also is considering Southern Methodist and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Americus package for FSU?
</P>
<P>
   Americus High coach Don Ragle said defensive lineman Alonzo
Jackson will announce his commitment Monday. Both Jackson and
quarterback Fabian Walker are believed to be leaning toward Florida
State over Georgia. Walker, who broke the state's all-time passing
mark, also is considering Florida, but he must improve his
standardized test score.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetness for Miami
</P>
<P>
   Miami has landed quarterback Jarrett Payton of St. Viator High
in Arlington Heights, Ill., the son of NFL Hall of Fame running
back Walter Payton. The younger Payton passed for 973 yards and
rushed for another 1,400. He picked the Hurricanes over Indiana,
Penn State, Notre Dame and Wisconsin. ... Memphis got running back
B.J. Edwards of Memphis. ... Ole Miss got Marietta tight end Lee
Jackson and Appling County linebacker Lanier Gothie. ... The
defection of quarterback Chris Simms from Tennessee to Texas might
be just what Creekside defensive end Charles Roberson needed. The
Vols now have a scholarship open, and that might go to Roberson,
who also is considering Mississippi State. ... Westlake receiver
Detronn Harris is visiting Auburn this weekend, and will choose
from the Tigers, Arkansas and SW Louisiana.

 &HT;    Duval's '99 pace is upshift in gear that has PGA trailing his
wake
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something looked strangely familiar to Johnny Miller
last Sunday as he watched television scenes from the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic of David Duval's amazing 59 and second win in as
many 1999 starts. Somewhere in the moderately distant folds of his
brain, Miller, who won 11 times over a 24-event stretch in 1974-75
and sent golf's other major stars reaching for extra buckets of
range balls, remembered how it was to lap PGA Tour fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded me a lot of me,'' Miller, 51, said by telephone
this week from Napa, Calif. ``When you're playing like that, it all
seems so easy. It's like a walk in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Miller was the last fellow to clang a golf ball against
this many flagsticks. To collect tap-in birdies with such insane
frequency. To over a couple of seasons so dramatically dominate the
game. To experience confidence overflowing like the foam from a
beer mug. Duval, with his nearly surreal Sunday at the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic, has won nine times in 28 events.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger who?
</P>
<P>
   Although golf's idiotic Official World Golf Rankings still leave
Duval at No. 2 and looking up at Woods, who has one PGA Tour win
(Atlanta's BellSouth Classic) since July of 1997, Miller has no
doubt about the former Georgia Tech player's status:
</P>
<P>
   ``He might say to Tiger, `See you. You thought you were the man,
but I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in 1997 when it appeared as though Woods would
earn an oversized cardboard paycheck every time he planted his
spikes into the ground. Now Duval has that same magic, and more.
Granted, with the PGA Tour's ballooning purses, the money earnings
are now impossible to compare, but in two events the 27-year-old
from Jacksonville Beach, Fla., already has passed $1 million and is
13th on the all-time earnings list with nearly $7.5 million.
Clearly, his colleagues must think they are playing with Wiffle
balls. Once, Duval did not know how to win. It took 86 events and
seven runner-up finishes to break through. Now he looks like he
can't lose. Surely, it can't last, but you can't erase being
52-under par for his first eight rounds of the year.
</P>
<P>
   When Duval arrived at the Phoenix Open this week, Justin Leonard
said, ``I was shocked he missed a putt. I think it was the first
putt I've seen him miss since (the President's Cup at) Melbourne.''
</P>
<P>
   The 59 was such an incredible feat for a final day that to watch
it unfold seemed as mind-boggling as the Falcons finding themselves
in a Super Bowl. Golf's historians and observers will argue for
Miller's 63 at Oakmont in the 1973 U.S. Open. Or then-46-year-old
Jack Nicklaus' 65, with a back nine of 30, at the 1986 Masters. Or
Arnold Palmer's 65 at Cherry Hills in 1960 to snag a U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   That they happened in major championships will always allow them
special treatment. That is, perhaps, until Duval starts chewing
through the upcoming Grand Slam schedule.
</P>
<P>
   There had been two other 59s registered in PGA Tour competition,
but they were yawners compared with what Duval accomplished Sunday
in the Bob Hope, assembling a round of golf that bordered on the
ridiculous. Nobody's ever sizzled a Sunday with a 59, coming from
seven shots behind to win a tournament. Nobody in a couple of
decades has put together such a flag-rattling performance with his
iron game. On 17 holes, the former Georgia Tech player had a putt
for eagle or birdie. His longest birdie putt was 10 feet. Of the
other 10 birdies, five were no more than 36 inches and three were
five feet or closer.
</P>
<P>
   That opened Miller's mental scrapbook, too. In the Sunday 61 he
shot to win the Tucson Open in 1975, Miller missed two five-foot
putts. His back-to-back wins at Phoenix and Tucson were by 14 and
nine strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same thing,'' Miller said. ``People that year were
saying I was the best player in the world. But it was almost
sacrilegious for somebody to say you were better than Jack
Nicklaus. Kind of like it was before with Jack and Arnie. I'm a
nice guy, but not everybody liked me because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller calls the normally stoic Duval ``a modern-day Ben
Hogan,'' describing a player whose facial expressions could not
allow a 66 to be determined from a 76. The on-course Duval is a
striking contrast to his in-the-locker room or on-the-range
personality, where a belly laugh is as likely as a laser 2-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind those Oakleys (sunglasses) he doesn't show any
emotion,'' Miller said. ``I guess it took winning by one and
shooting 59 to get him excited. . . . He's a nice guy. I don't
think he's the life of the party, but he doesn't mind being at the
party. I think when a round is over, David is as happy as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Odder than anything was Duval's ability to make the 59 seem
almost routine. Striking a 218-yard 5-iron to six feet at the 18th
for eagle appeared as mechanical as a 150-yard 7-iron to the middle
of a giant green. If the round had been of the pleasure variety
with friends, many of the birdie putts would have been gimmes.
</P>
<P>
   As an overwhelmed Jeff Maggert noted, ``Normally when there's a
guy shooting 59, he's making all these long putts all day. But most
of these were three or four feet. It was a 59 that looked
effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Phil Mickelson said, ``It was amazing _ it seemed like he
was a foot (from the pin) every hole. He never had to use his
putter. I thought it was an amazing day of ball-striking. It was
just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   As dumbfounded as the rest of the world was about the radar game
he displayed, Duval said, ``It was like pitching a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever fully appreciate what happened on
Sunday,'' said Duval, who fist-pumped his way around the green in
an uncharacteristic display of jubliation. ``Maybe in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Roberts said, ``I don't know how you couldn't rank him as
the No. 1 player in the world right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson said, ``I don't know how the rankings are done, but it
doesn't make any sense to me for anybody else other than David to
be on top.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion is not limited to American shores. A month away
from the first World Golf Championship, which will pay $1 million
to the winner, it seems we already have a recognized leader in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has caught Tiger Woods right now, which is good for the
game of golf,'' Scotland's Colin Montgomerie said. ``No one in golf
has ever perfected this game, and no one ever will. But I think 59
is damn near perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're not trying,'' Mickelson said. ``But the
level of play has certainly increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago during Atlanta's BellSouth Classic when a Golf
World cover proclaimed him as ``America's Best Player,'' Duval was
clearly embarrassed. Now the statement doesn't cover enough global
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's real important whether I feel that or
not,'' Duval said. ``You know, it doesn't help you once you start a
tournament. It doesn't do anything for you. I think it's a
reasonable conclusion to draw based on the past however many months
. . . but I'm not putting a whole lot of stock in that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval knows one thing very clearly. In his own mind, regardless
of the mammoth pile of money that's building before his Oakleys, he
will not feel fulfilled until he finds a major championship. That
he could not hold a three-shot lead on the back nine at Augusta
last April is a demon he cannot wait to exorcise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to win one major,'' Duval said. ``I would like
to win a couple or several.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the spring and summer are concerned, Miller cannot
wait to sit back and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majors are really going to be interesting,'' he said,
``because the Masters is perfect for David.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Mickelson is drawing something from Duval's success.
Taking in the Fiesta Bowl before the Mercedes Championships, the
two players decided that if either of them won, he would pick up
the tab for their chartered plane to Hawaii. Armed with $468,000
from the Mercedes win and still awaiting the air fare bill, Duval
then lost his bet with Mickelson on the Fiesta Bowl, giving
Tennesseee and 3 1/2 points. Mickelson got to pick a five- or
six-night trip anywhere in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty juiced,'' Duval said. ``He found a $7,000-a-night
place in Aspen, (Col.), but he's since located a house for a dollar
a square foot in Vail, (Col.). It's 11,000 square feet.''

 &HT;    More money doesn't mean more wins, Canadiens say
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``CH'' on the jerseys doesn't quite stand for
``Canadiens Happy,'' especially in light of plunging revenues, a
massive tax migraine and a 2-1 loss at Florida on Wednesday that
illustrated continuing offensive problems.
</P>
<P>
   But at least ``CH'' no longer stands for ``Canadiens Hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   After an 11-game winless streak that enabled general manager
Rejean Houle and coach Alain Vigneault to carve out an inglorious
place in franchise history, Montreal is nearing respectability
again. The Canadiens hired former coach Jacques Lemaire as a
consultant and, by coincidence or not, won four straight games and
had a 10-4-1 streak going into Saturday's game against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal allowed only 1.87 goals per game during the span, a
full goal less than during an 8-18-7 start (2.88) that had Quebec
natives dreading Houle as much as the English language.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say what they think they have to say,'' Houle said.
``All we're trying to do is win more games. When you're not
winning, people ask questions. Do you have the right coach? Do you
have the right general manager? Did he make the right move? When we
start winning, they say, `The players are playing better.' The
focus is on the players. When you're losing, the focus is on the
coach and the general manager. I don't think it should work that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Montreal, we have so many experts. They will always
challenge the decision of the general manager. They will challenge
the team, too, because hockey is a part of their life. But we are
doing the best we can. We don't want to lose, I can tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Houle said the Canadiens ``have enough money in the budget to
win,'' but the financial picture has cast doubt they will be able
to retain high-salaried players like Mark Recchi. Molson, which
owns the team, showed a $6.63 million profit in its hockey
operation in 1996-97 but had a $2.34 million loss last season.
Problems range from the devalued Canadian dollar (worth
approximately 65 U.S. cents) to annual property taxes of $6.24
million at the $178 million Molson Centre to $5.2 million in
interest payments on the arena debt. The six teams in Canada do not
get the tax breaks that the 21 franchises in the United States do.
</P>
<P>
   But, Houle said, ``If we had another $10 million, it doesn't
mean we will win more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to win in Montreal is as great as for any team in the
four major sports. Winger Shayne Corson said, ``When you don't play
well, you hear a lot of noise. When you do play well, you hear a
lot of noise. It's just a different kind of noise. But all we can
do is control what we can control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens have received excellent goaltending from Jeff
Hackett, who was acquired in a goalie swap with Chicago for Jocelyn
Thibault, and defense. Montreal could use more help up front, but
Houle said, ``This is our team for now.''
</P>
<P>
   He is being aided in personnel matters by his former Canadiens
roomate, Lemaire, who had been in semi-retirement after resigning
as New Jersey's coach but staying as a consultant after last
season. Lemaire remained under contract to the Devils, but general
manager Lou Lamoriello let him out of the deal without compensation
from Montreal on the understanding that Lemaire would not coach.
Lemaire then signed a three-year deal with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Lemaire's arrival fueled rumors he would replace Houle as
general manager, but Houle said, ``It was my idea to bring Jacques
in. I'm not paying attention to what anybody else thinks.''

 &HT;    Retirement time for Gretzky?
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that Michael Jordan has retired from basketball,
hockey fans hope their sport won't have the same kind of giant void
to fill. Wayne Gretzky means as much to the NHL as Jordan did to
the NBA. ``Because of my situation, because of my age, I guess I'm
always going to be asked `When are you going to retire? When are
you going to be done?''' said the New York Rangers center, who
turned 38 Tuesday. ``And it's going to happen. I'm going to have to
retire, but I haven't thought a whole lot about it. . . . The end
of the season, I'll sit down and make my decision on what my future
is.'' Atlanta fans hope Gretzky will stay around at least another
season so they can see him in person against the Thrashers. Gretzky
celebrated his birthday with three assists in a 4-1 win over
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Confident Carolina
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Pavel Bure, Florida is the trendy choice to
catch Carolina in the Southeast Division. But Hurricanes general
manager Jim Rutherford still thinks his team is stronger. ``Our
experience will keep us at the top of our division when the season
ends,'' Rutherford said. ``But it's good to know that the first
half we had has forced other teams to get better.'' Carolina stayed
out of the bidding for Bure because Rutherford was skeptical of his
commitment. ``He's a player who walked out on his team,'' said
Rutherford, overlooking his own October 1996 acquisition of Keith
Primeau, who held out for three weeks until the Red Wings traded
him to Hartford for Brendan Shanahan. ``A guy like Bure is not
going to disrupt anything, but I don't know if he's going to give
(the Panthers) their money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden Quinn
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Maple Leaf coach Pat Quinn got the golden parachute when
he was fired as president and general manager of the Vancouver
Canucks. Financial documents of Canucks parent Orca Bay Hockey
Holdings showed that Quinn pocketed $887,500 in his settlement
before signing a three-year deal worth $1.1 million a season to
coach Toronto. Quinn, a former Atlanta Flames defenseman, is a
leading candidate for coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Bruin teammates continue to marvel at the endurance of
defenseman Ray Bourque. ``He's 38 and playing 30 minutes. I don't
know how he does it,'' said Kyle McLaren. ``I'm 21 and barely
getting 25 (minutes). And I'm very tired after games. He's a
machine.'' . . . Flyers winger Dainius Zubrus, upon being
misidentified as Mikael Renberg in photo captions in both
Philadelphia papers after a recent game: ``I'm much better looking
than him. I should take him to court.''

 &HT;    Meetings bring GMs onto ice, two-referee system onto agenda
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General manager Don Waddell will attend this week's GM
meetings in Palm Springs, Calif. Among the items on the agenda is
the two-referee system that has been utilized for several games
this season. Reviews of the system generally have been positive,
and it's expected the GMs will recommend to the owners that two
referees be used in playoff games. . . . Waddell will participate
in his first GMs hockey game Monday at the meetings. ''I had to get
my skates sharpened,'' he said. ''I haven't played in a while.''
Among the GMs is Philadelphia's Bobby Clarke, a Hall of Famer who
gave out his share of cheap shots in his career. Waddell: ''I'll be
looking out for him.'' . . . The team is at least two weeks away
from finalizing its negotiations for a practice site, most likely
to be the IceForum in Duluth. ....Team jerseys are also likely to
be unveiled some time in February.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Before Pavel Bure made his home debut for the Florida Panthers
Wednesday, team president Bill Torrey said, ''Pavel won't just put
fans in the seats, he'll pull fans out of them, too.'' Turns out
Bure not only is pulling fans out of their seats, he's helping pull
wallets out of their pockets. The Panthers have been selling
authentic Bure Panthers jerseys for $324, replicas for $199,
plaques for $70 and glossy photos for $6. Imagine the sales blitz
when the team can manufacture Bure buttons, pucks, pins and
T-shirts. ''It's the greatest thing to hit South Florida since they
brought hockey here itself,'' fan Tony Jones told the Miami Herald.
Prior to 19,250 fans jamming the new National Rental Car Center for
the Florida-Montreal game Wednesday, owner Wayne Huizenga said Bure
''brings a new level of excitement into a new building. While it's
exciting to be in a new building, you need something different,
something we've never had before. You can see it tonight. We've got
a full house and everybody's talking about it.'' The Panthers and
Bure's agent, Mike Gillis, are putting the finishing touches on a
five-year contract extension expected to be worth $47 million.

 &HT;    Conflicts of interest long IOC way of life
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob Helmick remembers talking to Juan Antonio
Samaranch in the IOC's suite at the plush Lausanne Palace about a
U.S. vacancy on the committee. It was 1986, and Julian K.
Roosevelt, a New York yachtsman and a relative of two U.S.
presidents, had died recently.
</P>
<P>
   Helmick, himself selected for IOC membership a year earlier,
pushed for Donna de Verona, a former gold medalist swimmer. At the
time, the independent-minded de Verona worked the Olympics as a
color analyst for ABC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch immediately said she could not be in because she had
a connection with ABC,'' Helmick recalled. ``The other reason he
said was, `Donna will not be able to be controlled.'''
</P>
<P>
   From selecting its members to choosing Olympic host cities, the
IOC long has operated in a capricious manner, making up the rules
as it goes along _ if there are any rules to begin with. To his
credit, Samaranch is beginning to streamline the process for cities
to bid for the Games. Four members that he appointed to the IOC
have been forced to resign for having their palms out to the Salt
Lake group that won the 2002 Winter Games under suspicious
circumstances. Five others have been asked to quit. Reforms have
been put in place to curb abuses in deciding on the site for the
2006 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But with other IOC doings, conflicts of interest and
questionable business practices remain. Overlapping relations
involving people with connections to the IOC and the outside sports
world create these apparent conflicts, according to critics who ask
whether the Olympic ideals are attainable without a complete
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilady connection
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gilady is an IOC member from Israel. He also is a senior
vice president of NBC Sports, which has a contract to carry the
next three Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
   For years, all major networks were invited to submit bids to the
IOC for coverage of the Games. But when NBC surprisingly locked up
five Olympiads through 2008 in two separate deals, the other
networks were locked out of the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports officials wonder if Gilady's insider status didn't
kill their 1995 efforts to secure the Sydney Games in 2000, which
the network dearly wanted because they will be in the homeland of
network owner Rupert Murdoch. Two days after Fox privately made a
proposal of $701 million, NBC met with Samaranch and offered a
take-it-or-leave-it $1.27 billion deal for Sydney and Salt Lake.
The IOC took it.
</P>
<P>
   No other network was allowed to beat the NBC offer. CBS, which
paid $913 million for rights to the 1992, '94 and '98 Winter Games,
didn't even know the bidding had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been with CBS, having invested close to $1 billion in
rights fees for three Olympics, I would have been very upset that
we didn't get the opportunity to at least continue the CBS Winter
Games coverage,'' said Neal Pilson, former president of CBS Sports.
Still, he would not accuse NBC or the IOC of wrongdoing. ``That is
a decision for the Olympics to make, and that is a private
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmick was more critical, although with good reason. He was
forced to resign from the IOC over conflict-of-interest charges
involving side business deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilady is on the payroll at NBC,'' said Helmick. ``I had my
five or six clients who had no ties to the IOC... and I was forced
to resign. The inconsistency is enormous.'' NBC acknowledged
Gilady's connections with the IOC and international sports
officials. Gilady has sat on the IOC Radio/TV Commission since
1985, and Samaranch picked him for IOC membership in 1994. He
joined NBC in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that I became a member of the IOC and suddenly NBC
says, `Wow, we can jump on this occasion and make him work for
us,''' Gilady said. ``I was working for NBC (13) years before the
IOC invited me to join them, because the IOC thought I could help
in my areas of expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time he was hired, ABC was the American network
synonymous with the Olympics, and they had European-based
executives that nurtured relationships with the IOC,'' said NBC
spokesman Ed Markey. ``NBC had virtually no profile with the IOC.
So one of the main responsibilities for Alex was to help build a
real presence in the international sports community... (and)
bolster NBC's profile, specifically in the Olympic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue he's filled his role too well.
</P>
<P>
   John Boulter, a former top official with longtime Olympic
sponsor Adidas, spoke well of Gilady, but added: ``You have to say
there is a little bit of an apparent conflict of interest. He's not
president of the IOC, but if he was, he could almost sign both
sides of (TV) the contract. It must be a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential conflict involves Manolo Romero, a Spanish
broadcasting executive with close ties to the IOC. Romero received
a contract with the Salt Lake Olympic organizers to supply TV for
the international networks covering the Games _ for which he is
well-qualified, having done so in Atlanta. But his bid was not the
lowest and the Salt Lake offer was based on a recommendation from a
panel that included three business associates _ including Gilady _
according to the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us, `He's the guy the IOC likes to work with,''' Ken
Bullock, a board member of the Salt Lake committee, told the
Journal. ``It was kind of an insider-trading thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga veteran at exerting leverage
</P>
<P>
   The IOC family consists of Olympic committees from individual
nations as well as individual sports federations. Many IOC members
rose to power in sports through those organizations, some of which
tend to conduct business in the same vein as the IOC did with Salt
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Sun reported that one IOC member named in the Salt
Lake scandal, along with another official with ties to the
international track and field federation, sought $1 million to
support Toronto's bid to host the 1993 world indoor championships.
The bid group declined and later was awarded the event, according
to the newspaper, which did not name the two.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime president of the Association of National Olympic
Committtees of Africa is IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga, who
allegedly accepted $216,000 in goods and services from the Salt
Lake group. He first made headlines at the 1976 Montreal Olympics
by orchestrating the African boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga took advantage of the tangled web that connects big
players in the Olympic movement. Early on, he forged a relationship
with the late Horst Dassler, who owned Adidas and ISL, the IOC's
marketing partner. Ganga struck a deal for Adidas to outfit his
track athletes in the economically deprived Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Boulter suspects that Ganga benefitted personally from some of
the Adidas goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew (the Congo was) going to send five athletes (to the
Olympics), but you get an order for 50 track suits, 100 pair of
shoes. You wonder what's happening with it. One looks at the good
way Jean-Claude lives, and you wonder how . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Boulter witnessed a comical effort by Ganga in the late 1970s to
call an African boycott at Wimbledon. Boulter recalled Ganga saying
at a dinner with David Grey, then secretary of the International
Tennis Federation, ```You in tennis, you are the worst for
discriminating against us poor Africans. You have to change this
and give us Africans a chance. If not, you saw what we did in
Montreal. We shall boycott Wimbledon.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was a short pause, and David said, `Jean-Claude, remind me
how many Africans took part in Wimbledon last year?' And the answer
was zero.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Wimbledon setting, Ganga had no leverage. Not so in the
Olympic arena, where he practices the craft as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Track's Nebiolo has powerful sway
</P>
<P>
   One of the system's best manipulators is Primo Nebiolo, powerful
head of the international track and field federation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Nebiolo and leaders of the
boxing and swimming federations held the local organizers hostage
during the scheduling of events for the Games. The federation
chiefs knew thatNBC wanted to shift starting times of some events
so they would be shown in prime time in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field leaders conducted at least five negotiating
sessions with South Korean officials before a deal was struck in
1986. In the end, Nebiolo's representative was told NBC wanted 20
track events to be shown live in the United States. A price of $1
million per event was agreed upon, and a South Korean company paid
a sponsorship fee _ not so coincidentally of $20 million _ to
Nebiolo's federation. It used the money to set up a foundation
that, among other things, pays for an annual gala to honor athletes
and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Helmick, who headed the international swimming federation then,
got wind of the track deal and pursued his own negotiations. First,
he said, he discussed it with Samaranch and Gilady. ``Gilady told
me what the value was, and what Primo was doing,'' Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
   After the swimming federation decided a schedule change wouldn't
hurt its athletes, Helmick approved the shifting of several events
to late morning. His federation was paid $4 million, which he said
was deposited into an account that later funded athletes' travel to
world championships. Helmick said he took nothing for himself but
believes the track federation chief profited from his own deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the distinct impression that I could personally get 5
percent of it,'' Helmick said. ``I got the distinct impression that
that is what Primo was getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmick concluded, ``This activity has been going on for
years.'' He believes nothing less than Samaranch's ouster can save
the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely. Samaranch approved the selection of all but
23 of the IOC membership, now at 110. And in 1995, the body raised
the IOC's mandatory retirement age from 75 to 80.
</P>
<P>
   Why? To allow the president, now 78, to serve another term.

 &HT;    Roy a rich goalie
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patrick Roy, the one free agent that the Atlanta
Thrashers might have been interested in spending big bucks on, is
off the market. The two-year contract extension he signed with the
Avalanche will pay him $7 million next season and $7.5 million in
2000-2001. The goalie, who makes $5.1 million this season, also
will receive a $500,000 signing bonus. With Roy taken care of,
Colorado's next challenge will be finding a way to re-sign center
Peter Forsberg, eligible to become a restricted free agent after
this season. The Avalanche will get a financial boost next season
when Colorado opens the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   Flurry of Fleury rumors
</P>
<P>
   Now that Pavel Bure finally has been traded, attention turns to
the Theo Fleury auction in Calgary. ``The latest rumor is I'm going
to Washington for Monica Lewinsky,'' Fleury joked. Among teams
interested in Fleury are the Flyers, Maple Leafs, Red Wings and
Coyotes. Fleury will be an unrestricted free agent after the
season, and has said he will test the free-agent market this
summer. Fleury wore No. 74 for North America in the All-Star Game
because Detroit's Brendan Shanahan has seniority over him for No.
14. The same situation occurred when the two played for Team Canada
in the Olympics last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chelios loves Chicago
</P>
<P>
   If Chris Chelios has his way, he'll retire from the Chicago
Blackhawks. That's what he says. ``I swear on four of my kids'
heads that . . . I have no interest in being traded anywhere,''
said Chelios, who turned 37 Monday. ``As bad as things are right
now, I want to be here when this thing turns around and lead the
charge. I want to stay in Chicago. I don't know how I can put it
any simpler. Things are going bad here, but I'm not the type of
player that is going to quit or ask to be traded. . . . My heart is
in Chicago, and it's always going to be in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation was high for Vancouver signing Marc Crawford,
still under contract with Colorado, to replace fired coach Mike
Keenan. Colorado will get at least $200,000 and a second-round
draft choice. The pick could become a first-rounder, and the payout
increases with any playoff success Vancouver may have. . . .
Crawford is the Canucks' fifth coach in the last four years. Keenan
lasted 14 months. . . . Darren McCarty on the disappointing Red
Wings: ``Right now, we're Team Schizophrenia. We stink.'' Detroit,
which won the Stanley Cup the last two seasons, is 9-13-2 on the
road, including a loss at expansion Nashville. . . . The top rookie
scorer is Vancouver's surprising Bill Muckalt, who had 14 goals and
13 assists in the first half. Drafted 221st overall in 1994, he
played the last four seasons at the University of Michigan.

 &HT;    IRS wheels into towns to help residents file income taxes
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you live more than 40 miles from the nearest
Internal Revenue Service, the IRS may be coming for a neighborly
visit to help you file your 1998 income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic. They're not coming to your house but, beginning
Monday, the IRS will send vans with tax workers to 24 cities in
Georgia that are more than 40 miles from the nearest IRS office.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the vans will visit the first three of the cities:
Elberton, LaGrange and Tifton.
</P>
<P>
   Tax workers on the WOW (``We're on Wheels'') vans will help
people prepare 1040EZ, 1040A and simple 1040 forms with itemized
deductions. They will also answer questions and provide forms to
taxpayers who want to prepare their own returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This service is unique to Georgia,'' said Eric Roberts,
spokesman for the IRS district office in Atlanta. The vans will be
staffed by IRS workers each day, from about 2 to 8 p.m. The hours
will vary some from site to site, but you may call 404-388-7691 for
each site's time.
</P>
<P>
   The van service is one of several steps the IRS is taking around
the nation to fulfill the congressional mandate of the IRS
Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 that directed the IRS to
improve its service to taxpayers.

VIOLENCE BY MUSLIM MARAUDERS ERASES INDONESIAN VILLAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMBON, Indonesia _ The village of Benteng Karang, established in
1962, population 1,360, is dead now.
</P>
<P>
   The former residents of the once-bustling hillside community,
too traumatized to return, live under blue tarpaulin sheeting in a
local army camp, the victims of five days of violence that set
once-peaceful Muslim and Christian neighbors against each other the
week before last.
</P>
<P>
   The village, about 17 miles northeast of Ambon, is one of
several closely knit hamlets shown on local maps as Telagakodok.
</P>
<P>
   Laurens Saropy, a 53-year-old farmer, and a handful of other
evacuees said they were forced to flee for their lives when a mob
of several thousand Muslims stormed through the village, hacking to
death at least 15 people and setting homes and a church on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first warnings came not long after the Muslims arrived at
Telagakodok,'' said Saropy, a Christian. ``A police patrol came and
told us we had to get out. They only said, `Get out, get out!' They
didn't protect us. They ran too because the mob was too big.''
</P>
<P>
   A single criminal act _ the robbery of a Christian bus driver by
Muslims _ set off the violence, which started with riots in Ambon
and then spread over the next several days. The death toll in Ambon
officially stands at more than 50, but credible accounts put the
number of dead as high as 100.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery, in a suburb of Ambon, led to fights and
shop-burnings by the bus driver and a group of supporters. It did
not help that the robbers were alleged to be immigrant Muslims from
South Sulawesi, who control much of the local pedicab business, a
source of resentment among many Christians.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, with the army and the police standing on the
sidelines, the lawlessness intensified with Christian mobs
attacking Muslim businesses in the town center and along the
harbor-front, the scene of some of the worst violence.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that police say two young women were dragged from a
karaoke bar and hacked to death; their bodies were thrown into the
sea. A pair of German travel writers said they saw the bodies of
two elderly Muslims lying outside their hotel, battered and stabbed
to death. One victim was decapitated.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Cornelius Bohm, who has lived in the area for 32 years,
said rabble rousers on both sides inflamed the situation by burning
churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as churches and mosques are burnt, it is almost
certain to be 100 percent war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of another Muslim was found stuffed down a well that
was later sealed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the riots in Ambon the mobs arrived at Benteng
Karang from nearby Muslim communities, Hitu, Mamala, Morela and
Kaitetu.
</P>
<P>
   One of the evacuees, Margareta Masansoni, 65, said she was
warned by her children that people armed with gasoline bombs were
attacking the village. ``I went out of the house and saw people
standing nearby with knives,'' she said. ``I don't know what caused
it. They were stealing, and killing people. I am certain there was
a woman raped _ 40, maybe more, died in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My children wanted me to run,'' she continued, ``and they
helped me but I only wanted to walk and asked for help from God.''
Then she broke down crying: ``I don't even have a single rupiah.
It's too difficult to go back and build again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saropy, the farmer, said relations with the Muslims have not
always been bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to come and go between the Muslim villages,'' he said.
``There was always a good relationship. We don't wish to have a
dispute with the Muslims because not all people are good and not
all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had lived in the village for more than 30 years, but
was now contemplating a government offer of resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've no money to start again,'' he said. ``These are the only
clothes I have. I could only come out with a few things _ my
village is finished.''

 &HT;    `Disturbing' stats show racial disparity in test scores among
teacher candidates in Georgia
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Black teacher candidates failed a teacher licensing
exam almost four times as often as their white peers since the
state instituted the test in mid-1997, according to new statistics
from the commission that certifies Georgia teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The black failure rate at some historically black colleges in
Georgia is more than 80 percent. Statewide, nearly 57 percent of
black test-takers failed the exam, compared to 15 percent among
whites.
</P>
<P>
   The results raise hard questions about whether the education of
black children in their earliest years has been so weak that it
creates a vicious cycle: poorly prepared students go to college and
end up teaching the next generation of poorly prepared students.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and researchers debate the racial disparity, but some
of the explanations that emerge include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Teachers of all races tend to have lower expectations of black
students in elementary and secondary school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Black students taking standarized tests perform worse when
they feel anxious about representing their race.
</P>
<P>
   _ The overwhelmingly white, female teaching corps in elementary
and secondary schools lacks the ability to relate to black children
and to have black children relate to them in a way that makes
learning relevant and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparity in the test results shadows what other
states have experienced for decades, and to a slightly less extent
what Georgia experienced with the previous teacher licensing test.
But because the new test is tougher, it has approximately doubled
the failure rate for all groups, making the racial disparity far
more troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disturbing report,'' Clark Atlanta University
education Professor Evelyn Gilliard said after learning that her
campus's failure rate was 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that black children are more likely to become
engaged in learning if they have at least some black teachers. But
with a school-age population that is 37 percent black, Georgia has
a teacher corps with a black ratio that is stagnant at 19.7 percent
_ and the new exam could lower that percentage even further in the
short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some areas we need to put more emphasis on,'' said
Ruth Pace, an elementary education professor at the historically
black Morris Brown College, which had 28 of 38 test-takers flunk
the latest exam, even though the private Atlanta school has a
history of placing highly successful African-American graduates in
Georgia classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   After attending a workshop on the test last week, Pace concluded
that Morris Brown students need more instruction on how to teach
children reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
   The new statistics are related to a statewide failure rate
reported last month. But now, for the first time, the statistics
have been broken down by race for each of the 34 public and private
campuses with teacher-training programs. The test, called Praxis
II, is a set of national subject-matter exams considered much
tougher than the state-designed Teacher Certification Test it
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher candidates may re-take the test an unlimited number of
times, but they cannot be certified _ and in some education
programs cannot even graduate _ until they pass the test.
</P>
<P>
   The new report covers the first seven administrations of the
test through last September. Among students who indicated they were
in Georgia education programs, 24.1 percent of about 7,200 students
failed; among another 2,969 test-takers not affiliated with Georgia
colleges but seeking state certification, 28 percent failed.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators find the results deeply disturbing for a variety
of reasons: _ The failure rate among African-Americans threatens to
discourage prospective teachers at a time when more black teachers
are badly needed in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some educators say students who have spent four years passing
courses, paying tuition and receiving decent grades _ or even HOPE
scholarships _ should not now be excluded from the teaching
profession because of a new test. This is like changing the rules
halfway through a race, they say.
</P>
<P>
   _ The test represents a bold and necessary rise in academic
standards for Georgia's future teachers, many say, but it fails to
factor in the importance of subtle values such as social skills,
commitment to teaching and an ability to make children want to
learn.
</P>
<P>
   Questions revolve around who is to blame for high failure rates.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that weaknesses among black education students must
be viewed in a larger context that includes the elementary, middle
and high school ``pipeline'' that delivers black students to
college and education programs. ``What does (the Praxis II data)
say about African-American students who are passed on, who are not
held to high standards throughout their elementary, middle and
secondary schools?'' asked Jacqueline Irvine, an education
professor at Emory University who served on the Diversity Issues
Advisory Group that oversaw release of the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to colleges and universities and they come right
smack in the face with this issue of, `I have not been taught this;
my work has not been critically reviewed; I have not been given
honest feedback about my performance,''' Irvine said.
</P>
<P>
   Minority parents have long criticized the low expectations set
for their children, goals that experts say result in watered-down
curriculum and low standards of behavior, even as inflated grades
allow for college admission.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at historically black colleges agree the problems
start before college.
</P>
<P>
   Since 83 percent of white test-takers at historically black Fort
Valley State University passed Praxis II, in contrast to an overall
school pass rate of 36 percent, ``obviously the material is being
covered,'' said the education dean, Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, pass rates of black students at larger, more
diverse schools also are lower than the pass rates of whites. At
Georgia State University, for example, the pass rate for blacks was
58 percent, not much more than the black pass rate reported for
highly selective, historically black Spelman College, where all
five white test-takers failed. The pass rate for GSU whites was 94
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributing factor, which may affect black scores on
SAT tests as well, is cultural, experts say. While testing
companies such as Educational Testing Service, which designs the
Praxis series as well as the SAT, have largely eliminated biased
questions through scientific statistical techniques, black students
tend to be less tutored in test-taking tricks and can be affected
by psychological pressure. One study found that female and black
test-takers do worse when given psychological cues emphasizing
their gender or race, such as filling out demographic information
before taking the test.
</P>
<P>
   But some black student-teachers have little patience with such
excuses. ``I don't object to the test,'' said Sheila Raper, 24, a
Georgia State University education senior who recently took the two
portions of Praxis II required for middle school certification.
``If I do bad, I'll take it again. I'll work on my weak areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Adkins, 29, a black early childhood education student at
Clark Atlanta University, was more emphatic. After hearing
classmates complain that Praxis II was intimidating other black
education students into changing fields, Adkins declared, ``If you
fail, you take it again.'' Adkins passed the Praxis II content-area
``exercises'' for elementary education _ mostly an essay test _ but
will re-take the elementary curriculum and instruction multiple
choice test in March. If a person is truly committed to the
profession, she said, ``You do whatever is necessary to become a
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Dandy, an education professor at Armstrong Atlantic State
University who runs a minority-recruitment education program called
Pathways to Teaching Careers, said Georgia needs more black
teachers with a strong commitment. Not that black students can't
thrive with white teachers, she said, but too many black males now
go through school, especially in rural areas of Georgia, without
ever having a black teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine,'' Dandy said, ``going through 12 years of school
without (an adult) who likes the same role models, who listens to
the same music, who laughs at the same riddles, who eats the same
foods, who worships in the same kind of worship service, who has
the same culture as you.''

 &HT;    Libertarian alternative appeals to some
 &HT;    By Julie Kemble Borths
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As long as the U.S. Congress is tied up in the
impeachment trial against President Bill Clinton, the people who
gather each month in Tom Brown's living room are happy. Not that
they have anything against Clinton in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only time we're safe, when the Legislature is not
in session,'' said Jack Matheney of Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Brown agreed. ``At least safe from new harmful legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Matheney are members of the Libertarian political
party _ a group they say is a growing force in American politics
with about 300 elected officials nationally claiming affiliation
with the party.
</P>
<P>
   Matheney said the party wants government to play a smaller role
in people's lives, taxes to be more tied to direct services and
fewer ``entitlement'' programs. Libertarians, he said, belong to
``a party of individual liberty and responsibility . . . a party of
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something members don't see much of right now in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more concerned with Bill Clinton's inappropriate
relationship with the Constitution than with any woman,'' said Bob
DeBrosse.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Matheny said, in Clinton's speeches lately ``he's
talking all these new programs that are (not in the) Constitution.
He's going to steal the money for it from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to discourage many who want the government to do
less, not just talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're true believers,'' Matheney, 53, said. ``We don't live by
the whims of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBrosse is a Piqua city commissioner and a Libertarian. As an
elected official, he is part of a ``farm team'' being built by the
party. And, he said, residents have supported his views.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about two years ago the city commission disagreed
on whether to change electrical permit regulations to allow
property owners to do their own work even if they did not live in
the building. When they did not change the law, voters did. Such a
change reflects the Libertarian view that property owners should
have more freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Many Libertarians look at the two-party system as ``one beast
with two heads,'' DeBrosse, 45, said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling them the ``dempublicans,'' Brown said most elected
officials keep trying to use the same ways to solve the same
problems. As a result, he said, voters are staying away from the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   And some are finding a place with the Libertarian party. In the
last two years, the national Libertarian Party organization claims
a 12.3 percent jump in membership; there are 182,481 members
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Jay J. Krull, 34, of Kettering, said he was ``disgusted'' in
1996 by the ``failure'' of the Republican revolution and became a
Libertarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Democrats and Republicans, you're not going to see
wholesale change in government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That change won't be easy but Ron Williamitis, 47, said it's
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working for a playing field where everyone can
compete,'' he said. ``Where you can be responsible for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Jeff Zweber, 30, cited the computer industry.
Left to its own devices ``because Washington didn't understand
it,'' the field ``created more wealth than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most national problems, Krull said, are caused by the laws
created in Washington. ``The right hand causes it and then the left
hand offers a solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time to be a Libertarian,'' Zweber said. ``People
are getting the message.''

 &HT;    Modern two-way radio links families
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you think you need a bit more than a pager to
keep in touch with family members but you don't want the expense of
equipping everybody with cellular telephones, Cobra Electronics
might have a solution for you.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra offers a whole line of small, relatively inexpensive
two-way radios that can be clipped onto a belt like a pager. The
Microtalk radios sell for as little as $100 a pair at electronic
retail and sporting goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way radio is a popular way of communicating on worksites,
but it's generally been considered impractical for family
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra's basic Microtalk radios are 4 inches high and weigh less
than 8 ounces. They transmit up to two miles in open country or a
mile in a residential neighborhood. You can use them around home,
in an amusement park, a shopping mall or anywhere else where the
family is spread out over a small area.
</P>
<P>
   The base model units can transmit on any of 14 channels. The
next model up in the line adds message-scrambling capability to
keep outsiders from overhearing your conversations.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the line is a two-way radio that adds a weather
monitoring function. Cobra said that model, which will sell for
about $169 when it hits the market this summer, is designed for
hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Microtalk radio line won an Innovation Award for product
excellence at the 1999 International Consumer Electronics Show held
in Las Vegas earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find Microtalk in stores, check the Cobra Web site
at cobraelec.com/index.html for more information.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook came
here Saturday to tell Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian leaders that
they must appear in France on Feb. 6 to negotiate effective
self-government for Serbia's battle-ravaged Kosovo province or face
NATO bombing and other military action to force them to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic received Cook for what the
British minister called a ``business-like'' meeting of some 35
minutes. As usual, Milosevic did not appear in public himself
Saturday, letting other Serbian leaders express wary willingness to
attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Serb forces in Kosovo continued to hit the
ethnic-Albanian fighters hard, to seize as much ground as possible
before negotiations begin, Western diplomats here said, while there
was a grenade attack on a Serbian cafe in the Kosovo capital,
Pristina, and another reported attack on a Serbian couple in a
fiercely contested village.
</P>
<P>
   Cook acted on behalf of the six nations of the Balkan Contact
Group _ the United States, Britain, France, Russia, Germany and
Italy. He said Milosevic supported a peaceful solution and promised
a speedy response to the Contact Group demands.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said he stressed to Milosevic the need to reach a
settlement in February and the unity of the international demand
for Kosovo's self-government within the Yugoslav Federation, which
is made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and not in
Serbia itself, as Milosevic wants.
</P>
<P>
   Cook then flew to Skopje, Macedonia, where he is scheduled to
meet with three ethnic-Albanian leaders, including Ibrahim Rugova,
the nonviolent elected leader of the Albanians, and Adem Demaci and
Bujar Bukoshi, who have connections to the armed Albanian rebels of
the Kosovo Liberation Army. Cook was expected to give them the same
marching orders: go to France at the end of next week prepared to
negotiate on an interim settlement that will let Kosovo run its own
affairs, but not give it independence, with Kosovo's future status
to be determined after three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Serbian officials close to Milosevic said he was likely to send
a delegation to the talks. He would not go there himself, but
instead probably send Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, a
Milosevic loyalist, whom Cook also met Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is said by these officials to resent the pressure of
the West to sacrifice Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo, which was
the heart of the Serbs' medieval empire and is the cradle of
Serbian nationalism, and to fear that he could be arrested on a
secret indictment for war-crimes charges if he leaves Belgrade now.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is widely considered the main architect of the Bosnian
Serbs' aggression during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, but Western
leaders have never given any public indication he could or would be
called to account for alleged war crimes there by facing the United
Nations' tribunal for war crimes in The Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian officials, insisting on anonymity, said that
Milosevic was likely to concede only when pressed very strongly by
NATO and its bomb threats, so he can explain his concessions to his
people without paying a significant political price.
</P>
<P>
   The same officials noted that Kosovo is a political and
financial drain for Belgrade, and if NATO is willing to take
responsibility for restraining the rebels and keeping Kosovo from
independence for three years, Milosevic may see that as an
advantage. This would be especially true if he can also win a
lifting of harsh international economic sanctions against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, state television in Belgrade showed Milosevic
telling the visiting Russian Communist Party leader Gennadi
Zyuganov that Yugoslavia ``advocates a peaceful solution to the
problems in Kosovo through direct political dialogue with
representatives of national communities in Kosovo and state
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, in an interview Saturday,
said ``there is no reason for us to say `no' now.'' He noted,
though, that the federal government and Milosevic had not yet made
a decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic, a recent addition to the Milosevic government who
describes himself as a nationalist democrat, said that
international law, which recognizes Serbian sovereignty over
Kosovo, ``must be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he favored a negotiated solution, but with these
preconditions: that there be ``no independent Kosovo, no `greater
Albania,' and no equal status for Kosovo as a third republic within
Yugoslavia _ that is a secret name for an independent Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also important, Draskovic insisted, to guarantee equal
rights to all citizens of Kosovo, including the minority Serbs, who
make up only about 10 percent of the 2 million people estimated to
live in the province.
</P>
<P>
   There should also be no independent state institutions set up by
the ethnic Albanians, Draskovic said. That means, he said, no
separate Albanian police force, for instance, but only a state
police force that could contain a large majority of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo now, the minority Serbs hold every major position of
power, even in cities where they represent less than 1 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   But the ethnic Albanian leaders all seek independence, and the
Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for it. The Albanians are
finding it hard _ even under strong Western pressure _ to unite
under one negotiating position and one delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians insist that Belgrade respect a cease-fire and draw
its troops and special police forces down to levels agreed on last
October. That is also a demand of the Contact Group. But the
Albanians find it much harder to renounce, as the Contact Group
insists, their goal of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Pleurat Sejdiu, a rebel spokesman based in London, reacted
cautiously to the Group's demands, saying: ``We are not rejecting
the Contact Group statement. We just can't say anything positive
about it. This is not the time to talk. The fighting has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, another 24 Albanians, three of whom were dressed in KLA
uniform, were killed by the Serb police. International monitors
said a number of them appeared to have been shot in the head at
close range. The monitors' leader, U.S. diplomat William Walker,
said in an interview Saturday that an investigation into the deaths
was in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday night, six Serbs were badly wounded when a grenade
exploded outside a Pristina cafe owned by Serbs. In Pristina, the
Serb Media Center on Saturday said a Serb civilian was killed and
his wife seriously wounded when assailants threw a grenade into
their bedroom. The attack occurred in the contested northwestern
Kosovo village of Rakos.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the 30-page Contact Group proposal offered the
population of Kosovo, which is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
self-government, stability, democracy and control of their own
police force and legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Belgrade it offers an opportunity to get themselves out a
conflict that they cannot win,'' he said. ``It is in the interest
of both sides that they accept this offer and that within the very
tight timetable we have set they get down to reaching an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were backed Friday night by the United Nations
Security Council, where the Russians also went along, and NATO
countries were meeting Saturday in Brussels to authorize
Secretary-General Javier Solana to launch air strikes if the
parties _ especially Milosevic, Western officials make clear _ do
not comply or negotiate in good faith.

HOLOCAUST DEATH CLAIM AGAIN INSURER PROCEEDS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mor Stern, a wine and spirits maker in Hungary who
was sent to Auschwitz in World War II, died at the hands of Nazi
Germany but left behind insurance policies that would have taken
care of his survivors. His heirs, who say they have been trying to
collect on those policies for more than 50 years, are taking the
case to court.
</P>
<P>
   But they are doing so on their own, in a private lawsuit,
eschewing two class-action lawsuits over the issue in New York, and
an international commission led by former Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger that was formed to help settle such claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterns' case against Assicurazioni Generali SPA is an
indicator that as the debate continues over the best method to
resolve as many as 6,000 Holocaust insurance claims in California
and 60,000 throughout the United States, a third, much smaller but
significant vehicle is emerging: private, individual lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Those suits got a lift last week from a California state court
judge, who ruled that the Sterns' case against Generali could
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get the suit dismissed, Generali had argued that
the insurance policy required any litigation to take place in a
Czech court, and that California courts did not have jurisdiction
over the company because the claim did not arise out of business
Generali does in the state. But Los Angeles County Superior Court
Judge Florence-Marie Cooper ruled that California courts can
exercise jurisdiction, under emergency legislation signed into law
last year, because Generali does a significant amount of business
in California: it earned $27 million in insurance premiums here in
1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Generali has withdrawn the $100 million offer it made last year
to settle a class-action Holocaust insurance suit in New York. In a
statement, the company said it intended to appeal the California
ruling and thought the best venue to resolve Holocaust claims was
through the international commission. Eagleburger, who was
secretary of state in the final months of the Bush administration,
is the chairman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But William Shernoff, a lawyer who represents the Stern family
and about 30 other plaintiffs in 15 lawsuits in California, said
some Holocaust victims and heirs wanted to go their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really knows for sure the viability for the class
action or what this commission is going to do,'' Shernoff said.
``People just don't seem to have a really good handle on what
they're going to do and when they're going to do it. So we're just
proceeding with our lawsuit hoping the court will give speedier
relief and more equitable relief.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer in one of the New York class-action lawsuits, Rene
Siemens, and Elan Steinberg, the executive director of the World
Jewish Congress, say private litigation is not contrary to what
they are trying to achieve, though it is one element of the issue
that will have to be resolved to reach an overall settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But a person close to one of the insurance companies involved in
the Holocaust claims, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,
questioned the wisdom of pursuing individual claims, saying it
could interfere with the commission's work and lead to large
differences in the amount of money received by individual
plaintiffs, compared with people in class-action suits or settling
through the commission.
</P>
<P>
   And though Neal Sher, the commission's chief of staff, stopped
short of criticizing the private litigation route, he said of the
commission, ``Obviously, we believe this is the appropriate
method.''
</P>
<P>
   The California decision is the first to affirm that claims
against foreign companies over events half a century old can
proceed in the United States. In one previous case, a federal judge
in Los Angeles dismissed a case against Victoria Life Insurance Co.
of Germany because it did not do a significant amount of business
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Stern family and others involved in Holocaust
litigation say the recent ruling has the potential to sway judges
in other jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very favorable ruling,'' said Siemens, a lawyer
in the first New York class-action case, filed in March 1997. ``I
think this line of reasoning is something we'll put in front of the
judge in New York, if the issue ever comes up again.''

FLU EPIDEMIC PUTS NYC HOSPITALS TO THE TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City hospitals are struggling to manage a widespread
flu epidemic that is stretching their emergency rooms and wards to
overcapacity and forcing workers to ratchet up the overtime,
doctors to cancel some elective surgeries and administrators to air
out unused wards for patients who are flowing through the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
reported only sporadic outbreaks of flu around most of the country,
but it cites New York as one of a very few areas where the illness
is extensive. ``New York is definitely different from the rest of
the nation,'' said Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the centers.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the strain of the virus most prevalent this season
appears to be causing higher temperatures in patients and longer
periods of coughing, vomiting and general misery than in years
past. ``This high fever is not typical of other flus,'' said Dr.
Sigurd Ackerman, the president of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center. ``This one makes people feel sicker, quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who are particularly suffering, many doctors said, are
young children, whose bad flus quickly lead to ear infections and
respiratory difficulties. Pediatricians around the city said in
interviews that their offices had been overwhelmed in January, and
hospital emergency rooms are reporting a higher than normal number
of children seeking treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen it this bad since 1989,'' said Kenneth Raske,
president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most hospitals have been begging ambulance services
to divert patients elsewhere and are resorting to desperate
measures to house those who do come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people double- and triple-parked in the ER on
stretchers,'' said Dr. Elliot Friedman, the associate director of
emergency medicine at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens,
echoing stories told by other emergency room doctors around the
city. ``And there have been times when upwards of 40 people have
been admitted but are waiting for someone to be discharged, so we
can quickly clean a room and refill it. And every time you turn
around, someone else is pulling another ambulance in while someone
else is heaving into a bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the flu does not automatically mean a trip to the
emergency room, many of the city's uninsured seek all their health
care through the ER. Also, severe dehydration and other symptoms,
especially among children and the elderly, sometimes create a need
for emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   Although no epidemic has been reported in the rest of the state,
hospitals upstate have also had a tough January, aggravated by an
ice storm that overwhelmed many emergency rooms with cases of
broken bones at the same time that flu patients were arriving at
the wards.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital advocates are quick to point out that some of the
overcrowding may be a result of centers' closing up beds in recent
years to become economically efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chickens have come home to roost,'' said Jeannie Cross, a
spokeswoman for the Healthcare Association of New York State, a
trade group representing hospitals in the northern part of the
state. ``Downsizing, taking beds out of service and so forth to
adapt to competition are fine when the weather is good and there
isn't a flu epidemic and ice storm.''
</P>
<P>
   At both hospitals run by Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx,
wards that were either long closed or under renovation were quickly
reopened and staffed to deal with the influx of patients. A corner
of one emergency room was turned into an intensive-care unit to
serve five patients on respirators. Still others were sent to open
beds on the oncology ward, and some patients awaiting elective
surgeries were steered to the ambulatory units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are operating above 100 percent capacity,'' said Dr. Brian
Currie, the medical director of the acute-care division of both
Montefiore hospitals. ``We want patients to realize that the
exasperating delays that seem like operational inconveniences are
the same everywhere. We are trying really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side, the tales of woe
have been similar. ``This is the most significant sustained volume
I have seen in my 10 years of doing this,'' lamented Dr. Michael
Marin, chief of emergency services there. ``This is the busiest
January we have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the hospital postponed renovation of a 14-bed unit
and reopened it, filling its emergency rooms with additional
workers, in part to keep up with the heavy flow and in part to take
the place of doctors and nurses who have come down with the illness
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And at the city's public hospitals, officials said that flu
cases had risen anywhere from 33 percent to 240 percent when
compared with last year, with Elmhurst Hospital Center suffering
the most.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, conditions should not be this bad. The most common
bug medical workers are seeing is the Type A Sydney variety, the
sort that causes respiratory problems. That strain was contained in
the flu shot, which gives immunity to 75 percent of those who take
it, said Dr. Ilya Spigland, Montefiore's director of virology.
</P>
<P>
   The ``stomach flu,'' which is not a flu at all, according to
information from the Centers for Disease Control, has also hit many
people this year, landing them in the emergency rooms, too.
</P>
<P>
   Virology experts seem to agree that it is more or less
impossible to predict the route a virus will take, or to say why it
is prevalent in one area over another. ``I don't know what the
reason is,'' Spigland said. ``Perhaps it is because New York is a
dense urban population with people exposing each other, and it is
also very possible that the increase in respiratory infections may
not be due to the flu.''
</P>
<P>
   But the misery it causes is never ambiguous. Yolanda Lopez found
herself Wednesday night in the emergency room waiting area of New
York Methodist Hospital in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. Ms.
Lopez, a 42-year-old maintenance worker, said that after two days
of fevers and vomiting, she had decided to come by. After waiting
more than six hours she still had not seen a doctor. Her
15-year-old daughter, Kathy, had been admitted to Methodist on
Sunday and released Wednesday after her own bout with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get sick,'' Ms. Lopez said. ``I've been vomiting,
running fever, I have a pain in my stomach. It's been terrible. My
boss told me, `Don't come back until you get better.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are not the only ones under strain. Pediatricians
around the city have said they cannot wait for this season to end.
``It seems to be much worse than last year,'' said Dr. Alessandra
Zullo, of West 11th Street Pediatrics in Manhattan. ``We gave the
shots, but they keep coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Saken, a partner in the Soho Pediatrics Group, said
he had to hospitalize some children for dehydration. ``It was
surprising to me how sick they got and how quickly it happened,''
he said. ``It has been horrible. The kids are having really high
fevers and coughing like crazy and then the parents get sick and it
is stressful for everyone.''

LEWIS J. GORIN JR., INSTIGATOR OF A 1930S CRAZE, DIES AT 84
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lewis J. Gorin Jr., a Princeton-educated, Harvard-trained lawyer
who had a long, respectable and thoroughly obscure career as a
business executive, gentleman farmer and amateur military
historian, died on Jan. 1 at his home in Louisville, Ky. He was 84
and all but forgotten as the man who had tickled a dispirited
nation's funnybone in 1936 with a tongue-in-cheek tour de force
that created a brushfire national student movement and made Gorin
the most famous collegian in America who did not actually play
football.
</P>
<P>
   If Gorin's 1936 achievement is hardly remembered, there is a
reason. For if fame is fleeting, so is innocence, and World War II
is no longer the laughing matter it could still be in March 1936,
when as a Princeton senior Gorin founded and became the first
national commander of the Veterans of Future Wars, an organization
formed expressly to obtain an immediate $1,000 bonus for each of
the 15 million young Americans who were sure to serve in a war that
had not even started.
</P>
<P>
   As Gorin deadpanned at the time, with war in Europe clearly
imminent and with eventual American involvement a foregone
conclusion, the future veterans wanted their bonuses while they
were still young and healthy enough to enjoy them _ and (as he made
clear in a follow-up satiric book, ``Prepaid Patriotism,''
published two months later) while the nation still had enough money
to pay them before greedy World War I veterans succeeded in
squeezing the country dry.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when there was widespread resentment against the
American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars for having
browbeaten Congress into passing, over President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's veto, $2 billion in accelerated bonuses for four
million World War I veterans, most of whom had never made it beyond
stateside training camps, Gorin's inspired spoof had far-reaching
resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Gorin, who said he got the idea while drinking tea at a campus
coffee shop, had no intention of forming an actual organization
until a friend, Robert G. Barnes, bet him $5 that he could get the
group national publicity if it had a program. Barnes, who happened
to be the campus correspondent for The New York Times and The
Associated Press, won the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Within days after Gorin, Barnes and a handful of others had
founded the organization and published a manifesto in the student
newspaper on March 16, the movement had generated reams of
headlines, spread to scores of campuses across the country,
enlisted tens of thousands of members, and spawned a women's
auxiliary, the Association of Future Gold Star Mothers. Instead of
bonuses, the women demanded free trips to Europe to view the future
graves of their unborn sons.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the spirit, students elsewhere added wrinkles. At
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Future Profiteers demanded
advances on future war contracts, and Sweetbriar College students
formed a chapter of Future Golddiggers ``to sit on the laps of
future profiteers while they drink champagne during the next war.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was amused. James E. Van Zandt, national commander
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, denounced the Gorin group as ``a
bunch of monkeys,'' and declared they would never be veterans
because they were ``too yellow to go to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, including some who saw the Veterans of Future Wars
as pacifists and others who viewed them as communists, Van Zandt
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   A descendant of the Revolutionary War general Artemus Ward and a
man who was later active in the Sons of the American Revolution,
the Society of the Colonial Wars and the Society of the Cincinnati,
Gorin saw himself as the consummate patriot, one who would
willingly answer his country's call in time of war, accept his
soldier's pay, then return to civilian life without feeling
entitled to further feedings at the public trough.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1936, with Gorin at Harvard, the country
distracted by a presidential campaign and the gifts that had kept
the group's headquarters humming now drying up, the joke was over.
The Veterans of Future Wars suspended operations, revoking the
charters of 500 posts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, as a young lawyer in Louisville, Gorin was
among 21 civic leaders who signed an ad calling for an end to
American neutrality laws that blocked aid to allies.
</P>
<P>
   As he had expected, when the United States did go to war, Gorin,
along with the vast majority of the former Veterans of Future Wars,
went with it, serving as an artillery captain in Italy, France and
Germany and later writing and publishing ``The Cannon's Mouth,'' a
history of field artillery in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he accepted an offer from a childhood friend,
Billy Reynolds, to join the family's aluminum company, Reynolds
Metals, and became an executive with its international subsidiary,
first in Louisville, where he made an abortive run for Congress in
the 1950s, later in Bermuda and ultimately in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement in 1981, he returned to Louisville,
operated a farm in southern Kentucky and continued to amuse his
friends with his geniality and once-renowned wit.
</P>
<P>
   Gorin is survived by his wife, Eleanor; a daughter, Eleanor
Leuenberger of Schlossrued, Switzerland; a son, Jeff of Tempe,
Ariz., a brother, Standiford of McMinnville, Tenn., and five
grandchildren.

 &HT;    The Super cities: Atlanta and Denver
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Picture, if you will, a large metropolitan area that
consistently blows past its regional rivals in economic expansion,
population increases and every other kind of growth.
</P>
<P>
   An expanding, mega-hub airport and relatively low-cost suburbs
beckon to still more refugees from older cities and declining rural
areas, and yet the region is struggling with maddening congestion
and air-quality problems. Because the area is widely seen as the
economic engine for the entire state, the new governor is fixated
on addressing threats to the capital city's quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the suburban traffic has made in-town areas popular
again, and downtown is suddenly showing signs of new vitality.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an Atlantan, you might think you're looking in the
mirror. But you're actually glaring into the eyes of Atlanta's
Super Bowl rival, Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first moved here, what struck me was the similar size
and age,'' said Steve Turner, a native of Atlanta who now works as
an urban designer in the planning department of Denver's
consolidated city-county government. ``The neighborhooods close to
the core were built around the same time. I live in Congress Park.
Whenever people visit me from Atlanta they say, `Wow, this looks a
lot like Virginia-Highland.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are some obvious differences, of course. Metro Atlanta has
about a million more residents. Atlanta is a mecca for
African-Americans, while Denver's nearby Rocky Mountains call out
to die-hard skiiers.
</P>
<P>
   But the two have plenty in common: superior climate, a young,
high-wage population and lots of jobs, to name a few. And in both
cases, phenomenal economic success has both cities wondering how to
cope with the people, cars and environmental damage that have come
with it.
</P>
<P>
   City rankings of all sorts regularly have Denver and Atlanta
nudging each other in their top 10 lists. In ranking
``wealth-creating'' cities, Fortune recently put Atlanta eighth and
Denver ninth. Money Magazine's ``Best Places to Live 1998'' had
Denver second and Atlanta sixth.
</P>
<P>
   On the flipside, the Sierra Club's list of ``most
sprawl-threatened'' places (aside from Los Angeles) put Atlanta on
top and Denver five slots below. Indeed, ``sprawl'' was the first
word that came to the minds of some outside observers asked to
compare the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   James Howard Kunstler, who wrote ``The Geography of Nowhere''
and travels the country speaking on urban issues, criticized both
cities for their ``automobile slums.'' ``Each (football) team
represents a regional capital of suburban hyper-growth, both of
which are rapidly becoming places not worth living in,'' Kunstler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hanson, a Denver resident who has spent time in both
cities, made similar observations as he sat in the Wynkoop brewpub
in Lower Downtown sipping an ESB (for Extra Special Broncos, what
else?).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very similar in that you have an interesting core city
and a lot of sprawl that's not interesting around it,'' said
Hanson, 40. An architect and stay-at-home dad, Hanson lives in a
100-year-old home in Capitol Hill, which is roughly analagous to
Grant Park. He noted that both cities began life as rail hubs. ``We
wouldn't be here if it weren't for the railroad _ same as
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences? ``There are no mosquitoes here. We weren't burned
by Sherman.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, though, the fact that Atlanta was torched by
Union Gen. William T. Sherman during the Civil War puts the two
cities on roughly the same development timeline. Incorporated in
1861, Denver was just four years old when Atlanta began rebuilding
after the war ended in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason many neighborhoods in Denver instantly call to
mind parts of Atlanta, Turner noted.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has its own Buckhead in the Cherry Creek Mall area,
minutes from downtown. Like Buckhead, it is the central city's cash
cow, supplying about a quarter of the sales-tax dependent budget.
And as in Buckhead, the boom began around a revamped older mall
surrounded by single-family homes; it is now a shopping haven with
high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   But Cherry Creek is a pedestrian's paradise in comparison to
Buckhead, complete with a recreational trail along the namesake
creek that bustles with elderly walkers, young skaters and joggers.
To picture the district's main drag, Colorado Boulevard, think
Peachtree in Buckhead, only wider.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, the Denver Technology Center along Interstate 25
south of downtown, which now has nearly as many jobs as the central
business district, can be likened to Perimeter Center. Just south
of there, northern Douglas County was the fastest-growing county in
the nation for much of the 1990s (think Gwinnett County in the
1980s).
</P>
<P>
   Residential and office development there spins out from Park
Meadows mall. (The malls even have oxymoronic names in common. Is
Perimeter Center at the perimeter or in the center? And where are
the park and meadows at Park Meadows?)
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, that area was just fields,'' said Larry
Mugler, who analyzes development for the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (the acronym for which is pronounced ``Dr. Cog'').
</P>
<P>
   Today, Park Meadows seduces customers with opera Muzak, parquet
floors and marble-accented restrooms. Shopper Barbara Meehan, who
lives just outside Denver, has visited Atlanta and sees it as less
a metropolis than a hick-opolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of Atlanta as alligators and snakes and that sort of
stuff,'' Meehan said. ``Atlanta is a strictly Southern town. They
have trees and we have mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are clear regional differences. For both
Atlanta and Denver, ``frequent flyer'' ranks in the top five
``lifestyle interests,'' according to demographic research firm
Polk Intelligence. But when Denverites are skiing, Atlantans are
playing tennis. While their Western counterparts are camping and
hiking, the Southerners are reading the Bible or other religious
texts. Almost 30 percent of Denver residents say they are regular
bicyclists, twice the percentage in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   New governors in both states came to office promising to address
the quality-of-life issues associated with congestion and sprawl.
But while Democrat Roy Barnes is emphasizing mass transit in a
region that has poured billions into asphalt, Bill Owens _
Colorado's first Republican governor in 24 years _ is pushing
highway projects he says have lagged the area's growth.

   While Denver is a bit behind Atlanta in its physical sprawl, it
appears ahead in downtown redevelopment. The city and
quasi-governmental development agencies have offered aggressive
incentives to spur housing developments downtown. Streets are
bustling even after business hours, especially along the 16th
Street mall, where a free shuttle bus carries visitors along the
restaurant-shopping corridor, and in Lower Downtown, better known
as LoDo.
</P>
<P>
   A once-seedy warehouse and old-time office district, LoDo is
what downtown Atlanta's Fairlie-Poplar district wishes to be.
Already inching its way back with artists' lofts, a brew pub and
eateries several years ago, the district took off after the city
opened Coors Field there for the new Rockies baseball team. Another
anchor is Denver's Union Station, which, unlike Atlanta's Union
Station, was left standing. Today, LoDo is the focus of the
region's nightlife, luring locals and tourists alike, even in the
baseball off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has room to add thousands more residents close-in, thanks
to the closure of two close-in airfields _ Lowry Air Force Base and
Stapleton Airport. Redevelopment has already begun at Lowry, where
the tightly clustered rooftops of a new neotraditional village have
sprouted in the shadow of enormous military aircraft hangars. Real
estate signs foretell a new business park nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But even filling in the airfields won't accommodate the 1
million additional residents expected by 2020, regional planners
said. Further sprawl is almost inevitable, Mugler noted, but local
governments want to limit it. To articulate what they don't want
for Denver, the planners recently compiled figures comparing the
region with Atlanta: While 82 percent of Denver's population lives
within 17 miles of downtown, 45 percent of Atlanta's population
lives farther out than that.
</P>
<P>
   But when they forecast job growth, they look to Atlanta as an
inspiration, Mugler added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is in some ways a cautionary tale for us,'' he said.
``But as an economic success it's something to aspire to.

MARGARET WENTWORTH OWINGS, WHO FOUGHT FOR ANIMALS, WAS 85
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: California)   (dal) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California artist and
conservationist who fought for the survival of sea otters, sea
lions, mountain lions and other wild creatures, died on Jan. 21 at
Wild Bird, her clifftop home above the Pacific in Big Sur, Calif.
She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, reported the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
which recently published her paean to Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Owings, a former member of the California Parks Commission,
led campaigns to protect the world's forests and oceans. The
National Audubon Society honored her with a medal in 1983 and last
year listed her among 100 individuals who had done the most to
shape the environmental movement, along with Barry Commoner,
Jacques-Yves Cousteau, William O. Douglas, Lady Bird Johnson,
Stewart Udall and Morris K. Udall.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Berkeley, Calif., she graduated from Mills College
in 1934 and completed graduate studies in art the next year at the
Fogg Museum at Harvard University. She had one-woman exhibitions of
her stitchery at galleries and folk-art museums but largely set
aside her art to work for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   She and her second husband, Nathaniel Alexander Owings, a
founding partner of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill, fought to keep the developers away from the wild beauty of
Big Sur.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal residents of Santa Fe, N.M., they also assembled a
significant collection of the art and Pueblo culture of the
Southwest, now part of the permanent collection of the California
Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Owings was the founder and first president of Friends of
the Sea Otter and won a battle to end the bounty-hunting of
mountain lions in her state. As a member of the Point Lobos League
she was instrumental in saving the beaches between the Carmel River
and Point Lobos State Preserve, near Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   She sat on the council of the Save-the-Redwoods League and the
Big Sur Land Trust. She was a past trustee of Defenders of
Wildlife, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation and the
Environmental Defense Fund, and a founder of the Rachel Carson
Council against poisons in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote about her experiences and spent the last months of her
life compiling her writings and artwork. The resulting book,
``Voice From the Sea: Reflections on Wildlife and Wilderness,''
published by Monterey Bay Aquarium weeks before her death, sums up
five decades of her writings and renders in verse and prose the
passions underlying a lifetime commitment to the preservation of
the gifts of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Owings, who designed their home, Wild Bird, died in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Owings is survived by a daughter, Wendy M. Benjamin, of
Durango, Colo., from her previous marriage to Malcolm Millard, a
resident of Carmel, Calif.; three stepdaughters, Natalie O. Prael
and Jennifer O. Dewey, both of Santa Fe., and Emily O. Kapozi, of
Novato, Calif.; a brother, William Wentworth, of Walnut Creek,
Calif.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

   CHINA-ONECHILD _ BEIJING _ There are hundreds of thousands of
``missing girls,'' in China every year. The result of abortion,
infanticide or abandonment, all happening at incredible rates
because Chinese parents can have only one or two kids. And they
still want sons, not daughters, so they dispose of the females.
This is reflected in China's increasingly skewed sex ratio, most
recently documented at a record 120 boys to every 100 girls.
(Natural rate is 105/100.) The more efficient Chinese birth control
cadres become at limiting births, the more girls go missing. And
the more difficult life will be for Chinese young men as they come
of age, lacking girls to marry. One woman related that many women
in their village respond to the government limitation on babies by
getting ultrasound examinations and then having abortions if they
discover the fetus is female. ``I know many people who do this,''
she said. ``Medically, it's very safe now.'' The American angle on
this is that thousands of abandoned baby girls have become
available for foreign adoption. More than 4,000 American families
took home Chinese girls last year. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox News

   w/CHINA-SCANNERS _ WASHINGTON _ An American company that helped
launch medical ultrasound machines in China two decades ago says it
cannot control now whether Chinese doctors use them for
sex-selection abortions. Hedberg said the ultrasound systems her
company sells in China are used for treating heart, vascular and
skeletal problems as well as fetal monitoring. ATL Ultrasound is
one of at least three American medical equipment companies whose
ultrasound technology is now in widespread use at Chinese hospitals
and clinics. Others include General Electric and Hewlett-Packard.

Honduras is now $3.4 billion poorer. Thousands of homes, farms and
cattle were swept away by the mudslides and floods spawned by
Hurricane Mitch last fall. Hundreds of roads, bridges, water and
phone lines have been obliterated. More than 5,600 lives were lost.

   CUBA-HEALTH _ HAVANA, Cuba _ Cuba's socialist system has failed
in many respects. Store shelves are often empty. Houses are
dilapidated and scarce. But Cuban scientists have developed an
array of new vaccines and drugs that are at the leading edge of
biotech research around the world. Cuba's state-run biotechology
industry has always been much admired for the advances it's made.
But now health officials in Cuba say a new AIDS vaccine will be
ready for use within two to five years. Preliminary testing of the
new formula is scheduled to begin in early 1999. We take a look at
the biotech industry and its goals in coming years. (Emling,

   ISRAEL-ELECTIONS _ JERUSALEM _ If you believe that elections
tell you a lot more about a country than about the candidates,
Israel's May 17 prime ministerial showdown fits the theory. What we
have seen so far is a field with at least five prominent opponents
representing small factions and realigning the country's political
map. There has been little talk about issues, but already, Israel
has seen major players change parties, Watergate-styled break-ins
at campaign headquarters and accusations that slogans are being
used to incite violence. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) MOVED FRIDAY

   w/ISRAEL-GENERALS _ JERUSALEM _ If you want to be Israeli prime

candidate, former General Ehud Barak, did. In the 1980s, he dressed
like a woman, sneaked into a downtown Beirut apartment and shot
three PLO fighters. Also on the operation, but headed to a
different apartment block, was one of Barak's opponents, recently
retired Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who won Israel's highest medal
for bravery on the mission. Former Gen. Moshe Arens is also running
with his own party and others are being courted to join the parties
in their campaigns. Current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu never
got above captain (though he was in Barak's unit), but it does not
change the fact that a country on constant guard against security
threats has frequently turns to its military leaders for the top
political post. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) MOVED FRIDAY

   RUSSIA-SECEDE _ IVANGOROD, Russia The grass wasn't always
greener on the other side of the border. But now it is, and the
residents of this depressed Russian border town want to secede and
become part of the neighboring country of Estonia. In Soviet times,
there was little difference between Ivangorod and the Estonian town
of Narva across the border. Now, Estonia's economy is booming while
Russia is in the grips of yet another economic crisis. Novogorod
has petitioned both Russia and Estonia to shift the border, but
neither government is much interested. Estonia is seeking NATO and
European Union membership; adding a border dispute would only
complicate issues with Russia. (Holmes, Cox News Service) MOVED

many military bases; weapons or airplanes such as the

   RUDOLPH _ It will be a year Jan. 30 since Eric Robert Rudolph
rented Kull the Conqueror from a video store and bought a few
groceries in Murphy, N.C., then disappeared as police descended on
his trailer, where the lights were still on. In Murphy and nearby
Andrews, Rudolph remains a topic of conversation _hero to some,
satan to others, a marvel to most. How, for instance, has he
survived two killer winters in the outdoors? Or is he outdoors? Or
in one of the old mines where he used to play? Or in somebody's
vacation cabin? Or in Missouri, or Colorado, or hanging with
neo-Nazis in Belgium or Germany? Or is he even still alive? We talk
to townsfolk, including the trekkers and trappers and hunters who

   RUDOLPH-VIET _ It has now been a year since Atlanta and
Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph slipped into the
heavily wooded mountains around Andrews, N.C., with federal law
enforcement agents only a few hours behind him. Despite the
closeness of the pursuit of Rudolph and fresh leads last year at
this time, the anti-government recluse and former airborne soldier
has managed to elude one of the most intensive and concentrated
manhunts in recent law enforcement history over the last 12 months.
Rudolph is threatening to become as enigmatic and as elusive a
target as fabled hijacker D.B. Cooper, who disappeared into the
Pacific Northwest on Thanksgiving Eve 1971 with $200,000 in
Northwest Airlines' money after parachuting from one of their
Mexico-bound jets. Rudolph's hunters appear no closer now to
tightening the noose on their quarry than they were when they first
showed up in Andrews. If anything, the feds have gotten bogged down
in a mission that has developed eerie similarities to the U.S.
military involvement in Vietnam. There may never be a satisfactory
conclusion to the Rudolph hunt, just as Vietnam ended without any
real resolution of the problem. (Martz, Atlanta

II. Now we're getting an exclusive look at how that 21 percent
failure rate breaks out at each of the 15 public and 19 private
colleges with education programs. The results at historically black
colleges, we hear, are so bad that the agency that administers the
test, the Professional Standards Commission, has agreed with their
demands that scores be broken down by race at all 34 schools _ to
show, for example, that blacks at UGA and GSU did almost as bad as
students at Paine College or Fort Valley State. This tests
subject-matter knowledge, the area that needs strengthening but is
not something colleges of education have traditionally been
accountable for. Denying certificates to, say, 50 or 60 percent of
the graduates of a historically black college is a controversial
move _ threatening the college's very existence in the case of
Paine College in Augusta, and further depressing an already scarce
supply of minority teachers. PSC is giving us exclusive on stats

   DELPHI _ The unions that represent GM's Dayton-area workers have
agreed to promote the Delphi Automotive Systems spinoff to
potential investors in a stunning turnaround for GM-Union
relations. Nick Nichols, chief GM negotiator for the IUE, delivered
a speech late last year to about 600 GM executives and received a
standing ovation. Nichols' theme was that GM and its workers must
be partners in this spinoff if it's to succeed. In exchange for the
IUE's support, GM has agreed to extend the retirement benefits
cut-off date for IUE members until Oct. 1. IUE will also be
eligible for significant discounts on trucks and cars through 2000.
This contrasts to the heated battles that have characterized GM's
relations with the UAW, it's largest union. But there is some
evidence, at least here in the Miami Valley, that the frostiness
between GM and the local UAW membership is thawing. (Wagner, Dayton

   NEW YORK _ Dr. Richard Harold Freyberg, a leading rheumatologist
who helped organize the Arthritis Foundation and build it into
today's 700,000-member organization with a professional staff of
750, died Jan. 23 at his retirement home in Venice, Fla. He was 94
and formerly lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Freyberg came to New York in 1944 as director of the newly
established Division of Rheumatic Diseases at the Hospital for
Special Surgery in Manhattan, a post he filled for nearly three
decades. Concurrently, he served as chief of the arthritis clinic
at New York Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He left for Palm Desert, Calif., in 1974 to help establish the
Arthritis and Rheumatism Wing of Eisenhower Medical Center there.
After retiring to Florida, he remained active in his field as a
lecturer and writer. Dr. Freyberg was co-author of ``The History of
Rheumatology,'' published in 1985 by the Arthritis Foundation.

<P>
   A native of Goshen, Ind., he attended the University of Michigan

asked to set up the Rackham Arthritis Research Unit at Michigan. He
directed its research projects until his move to New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Dr. Freyberg and a few colleagues met in a New York
hotel room with Floyd B. Odlum, an industrialist afflicted with
rheumatoid arthritis. That meeting led eventually to the founding
of the Arthritis Foundation with an initial fund-raiser led by Bob
Hope that netted about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation moved to Atlanta in 1977 and now operates with an
annual budget of $110 million to support research, cures and
prevention and to improve the lot of those affected. Dr. Freyberg
was a director for 22 years and more recently remained an honorary
trustee.
</P>
<P>
   He also became active in the American Rheumatism Association and
was president in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Freyberg's wife, Helen Beckman Freyberg, died in 1985 after
50 years of marriage. He is survived by a daughter, Joanne Moss of
Birmingham, Mich.; a son, Thomas, of Palos Verdes, Calif.; five
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANS A `BLOT' ON INDIA, PREMIER TELLS NATION
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In a somber address to the nation, Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Saturday made his strongest
condemnation yet of the recent attacks on Christian places of
worship in India and the murders of an Australian missionary and
his two young sons as ``a blot on our collective consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such violence violates our tradition and culture of
tolerance,'' he said on the 51st anniversary of the assassination
of India's pacifist leader, Mohandas K. Gandhi. ``It goes against
everything that Gandhiji and our savants have taught us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister's remarks, broadcast on the state-run
television station, did nothing to quiet the opposition Congress
Party and some of his own allies who say the government has moved
too slowly to stop the sectarian violence and acted too quickly to
exculpate Hindu militants who belong to groups associated with the
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party that Vajpayee heads.
</P>
<P>
   The party came in for heavy flak Saturday even from one of its
longtime leaders, Madan Lal Khurana, the Tourism and Parliamentary
Affairs Minister, who resigned in part over the violence against
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Khurana said he had been silenced when he
tried to speak out within the party against Hindu militants who
have been making irresponsible, anti-Christian statements. These
individuals, who are part of organizations that are in the same
family of Hindu nationalist groups as the party, are damaging the
image of the party and India, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khurana said he had been personally shaken after the missionary,
Graham Staines, and his sons, 10 and 6, had been burned alive in
their van in the eastern state of Orissa as a mob chanting Hindu
slogans circled them. He had written a letter to the party, leaked
to newspapers, asking for permission to ``atone'' for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Khurana's resignation complicated Vajpayee's efforts Saturday to
reclaim the secular high ground. The prime minister fasted for
religious harmony and vowed to see that all those who had committed
sectarian crimes would be punished. He noted that suspects had been
arrested in the Gujarat attacks and that no efforts were being
spared in searching for the Staines' killers.
</P>
<P>
   Also fasting Saturday was Home Minister L.K. Advani, who _ long
before any investigation of the missionary's killing was near
completion _ said that a youth group that is part of the same Hindu
nationalist family of organizations as the Bharatiya Janata Party
had not been involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party president, Sonia Gandhi, speaking Saturday at
an observance of the anniversary of Gandhi's death, accused the
government of weakness and hesitance in enforcing the law to
protect minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Places of worship have been torched, innocent people bullied,
threatened, beaten, injured and even killed,'' she said. ``Instead
of moving swiftly and decisively to end the violence and apprehend
the perpetrators, homilies are given about national debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, an Italian-born Catholic and the inheritor of the
Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, was referring to remarks Vajpayee made
earlier this month when he visited the district in the western
state of Gujarat where more than two dozen attacks on Christians
and their institutions have been reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister condemned the attacks, but he also called for
a national debate on religious conversions. Hindu militants have
been accusing Christian missionaries of converting Hindus through
bribes and intimidation and maintain that all conversions should be
outlawed. Leaders of the groups said that Vajpayee's call for a
debate on the issue had vindicated their position.

WILLIAM E. HUNT, 77; NEUROSURGEON DEVELOPED ANEURYSM CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William E. Hunt, a retired neurosurgeon at Ohio State
University who devised a widely used system for the clinical
evaluation of brain aneurysms, died on Tuesday at his home in
Columbus. He was 77 and also had a home in Gouldsboro Point, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a recurrent rupture of his thoracic aorta, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt served for 37 years on the faculty of the Ohio State
College of Medicine, retiring as a professor emeritus of surgery in
1991. He was the chairman of its division of neurological surgery
from 1964 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt was best known for the Hunt-Hess classification for
weakened blood vessels in the brain, called intracranial aneurysms.
Named also after a resident who worked with him, Dr. Robert Hess,
it is the most widely used classification of aneurysms.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a Spanish pathologist, Dr. Eduardo Tolosa, Hunt
defined the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome of ophthalmoplegia, a painful
paralysis of the eye muscles. From 1973 to 1988 he was the
principal investigator and director of the national Spinal Cord
Injury Research Center based at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the American Board of Neurological Surgery, which
oversees graduate medical education in that specialty, and wrote a
textbook about the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, as well as articles for
professional journals.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt received the first Lifetime Achievement Award of the
Neurological Society of America and its Gold Medal, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   William Edward Hunt was born in Columbus, the fifth physician in
four generations of his family. In 1943 he was a Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Ohio State, where he was a fencing and saber champion.
He received his medical degree with honors from Ohio State in 1945.
After two years in the Army as a general surgeon, he trained in
neurology and neurophysiology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Hunt returned to Ohio State. He took charge of the
medical school's division of neurologic surgery in 1963 and was
appointed a full professor the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt is survived by his wife, Dr. Carole Ann Miller, a retired
professor of neurosurgery; two sons, William W. 2nd, of Austin,
Texas, and Dr. David D., of Hoboken, N.J.; his daughter, Virginia
R. Hunt-DaCosta of Bainbridge, Ohio; a sister, Marian H. Lyle of
East Windsor, N.J., and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Virginia Reimold Hunt, ended in divorce.
His second wife, Charlotte Curtis, died in 1987.

IN ELECTION, WILL ZEDILLO HAVE FINGER IN THE PIE? 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President Ernesto Zedillo earned international
applause last year when he said he would be the first Mexican
president in modern times to refuse to handpick his successor. But
how his party intends to nominate its candidate for the July 2000
presidential balloting remains one of Mexico's intriguing
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   For months, party leaders loyal to Zedillo have been
contradicting themselves, leading to suspicions that the president
and his circle hope to shoehorn a favorite candidate into the
presidency through a nominating procedure only moderately more
democratic than Mexico's traditional presidential anointment
ceremony, known as the dedazo, or big finger.
</P>
<P>
   Last June Zedillo told a New York audience that he favored an
American-style primary to select the candidate from the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which has
controlled the presidency for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mariano Palacios, the PRI's party president, said a
national convention would set formal nominating rules last
September. But that date came and went, and the convention has been
tentatively scheduled and subsequently postponed several times
since. The nominating rules have yet to be written.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter party infighting led to the assassination of the PRI's
candidate in 1994, and the party remains divided. As a result,
early elbowing among several rivals for the PRI candidacy has
prompted warnings that the party could split unless a consensus
candidate is nominated through a democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the risk of a split if any group of PRI-istas believes
the process is being manipulated,'' said Oscar Gonzalez Rodriguez,
a PRI congressman who helped found one of several factions pressing
for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Likely candidates already have emerged in Mexico's two
opposition parties, both of which have announced formal nominating
conventions for the fall. Vicente Fox Quezada, the governor of
Guanajuato state, has no apparent challengers for the nomination of
the pro-business National Action Party. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
Solorzano, the mayor of Mexico City, appears equally probable as
the nominee from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are expected to be the most competitive in Mexican
history, but polls suggest that the PRI can retain the presidency _
unless the party splinters. What is likely to be a bruising
nominating battle is already under way.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, the interior minister, has emerged as the
favorite of Zedillo's governing circle, several independent
analysts said. Roberto Madrazo, the governor of Tabasco, has begun
a television campaign with the financial backing of the PRI's
traditionalist faction, known as the dinosaurs. But only Manuel
Bartlett Diaz, a former interior minister who is governor of
Puebla, has said publicly that he is seeking the PRI nomination. In
an interview, he criticized the PRI leadership for leaving the
nomination process murky.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the confusion is creating concern and doubts,'' Bartlett
said. ``We need clear nominating rules that are fair for all
potential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Arturo Venegas, a PRI spokesman, said Zedillo had urged
party leaders to organize Mexico's most democratic nominating
process. But since the rules have not been written, it remains
unclear whether the candidate will be selected in a primary
election, in a national assembly with democratically elected
delegates, or in an old-style convention packed with presidential
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, several PRI lawmakers met with Palacios to urge him
to convene a party convention immediately so that the rank and file
could help write the bylaws that will govern the nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the party leaders write the rules in private and then just
try to persuade the rest of us to accept them, I'm suspicious that
they'll script them to benefit their own favorite candidate,'' said
Jose Luis Soberanes, a PRI senator who attended the meeting. He
said Palacios declined to set a date for a convention. Venegas, the
PRI spokesman, confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be scheduling party assemblies on the whim of a few
dissidents,'' Venegas said. Only a handful of party members are
concerned about the nominating process, he said. Luis Rubio, a
Mexico City political scientist, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A humongous number of party members are demanding democratic
procedures,'' he said. ``The PRI leaders keep postponing the
assembly because they want to force Bartlett and other dissident
candidates to close ranks behind Labastida, who's emerged as the
official candidate. They don't have the political monopoly they
once had, but they still want to control the process.''

WARY U.S. BROODS ON A PEACE EFFORT MINUS KING HUSSEIN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With King Hussein of Jordan lying gravely ill from
cancer in a hospital in Minnesota, senior Clinton administration
officials say they are alarmed at the prospect of pursuing a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East without the Arab leader
widely seen as most committed to the goal.
</P>
<P>
   American officials had hoped that the king's decision to return
home this month after six months of cancer treatment at the Mayo
Clinic in Minnesota was a sign that his health had improved, and
that he might remain on the throne for at least a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   But those hopes were dashed this week when the king's doctors
announced that his lymphatic cancer had returned.
</P>
<P>
   The frail, painfully gaunt 63-year-old monarch returned
immediately to the United States, but not before dismissing his
brother as heir and naming instead his 36-year-old eldest son. The
palace intrigue shocked Jordanians and many foreign leaders, who
had come to take the country's political stability for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of King Hussein to Jordan and to the region can
hardly be overstated,'' Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, said in an interview. ``This is someone of enormous
integrity and courage who believes deeply in broadening the peace
process, and who has been prepared to take risks for that _
political and personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official said: ``King Hussein has
led his country for almost half a century, most of that time as a
good friend of the United States and a vital proponent of Middle
East peace. And it's strange and frightening to think of the peace
process without him.''
</P>
<P>
   The king's illness has complicated the peace effort by
unsettling Israel's political and military leaders as their
negotiations with the Palestinians are gridlocked and as Israel
prepares for national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jordan's humiliating defeat in the 1967 war, when the
Israelis captured eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, the king has
been that rare thing for Israel in recent years: a reliable friend
in the Arab world. Since offending Arab neighbors by signing a
peace agreement with Israel in 1994, he has done more than any
other Arab leader to shift it from pariah status.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was desperate last October to avoid breakdown
of a summit meeting in Maryland between Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. So
he asked Hussein to leave his sickbed in Minnesota and join in the
negotiations. In announcing an interim peace agreement three days
later, Clinton said the king was ``at the heart of this success.''
</P>
<P>
   The king, who came to power in 1952, when he was only 16, has
brought Jordan prominence all out of proportion to its size and
economic and military might. With a population of 4 million people,
Jordan is an impoverished, landlocked, resource-poor nation
surrounded by oil-rich neighbors _ some threatening, notably Iraq
to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and scholars who have studied
Jordan say they are convinced that Crown Prince Abdullah is
committed to the policies of his father, especially Hussein's
devotion to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdullah and the other children have been raised by a father
who has for his entire life been committed to peace,'' said Judith
Kipper, a Middle East specialist at the Council on Foreign
Relations who knows the king and his family well. ``I don't think
Abdullah wanted power. I don't think he really expected it. But he
is absolutely prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger shared Ms. Kipper's appraisal of Abdullah, who was
educated in part at Georgetown University in Washington. ``We've
had a lot of contact with the crown prince over the years,'' Berger
said, ``and he is a very bright man, highly respected in the
Jordanian military. I think that the crown prince is deeply
committed to the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is undeniable that Abdullah, who has spent his career in
the military, has little background in politics or economics, and
that Jordan's neighbors may quickly try to exploit his
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine that Assad and Saddam won't see him as a
child,'' said a senior aministration official, referring to
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq, who have both een in power for nearly three decades.``That
does carry great danger, especially if Iraq tries to make
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is thought to be a particular threat, given Saddam's call
this month for the overthrow of neighboring Arab governments that
have supported economic sanctions against Iraq. An estimated
300,000 Iraqis live in Jordan, and many are loyal to the Iraqi
leader.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they made a quick decision last week to
offer as much public support as possible to Abdullah to bolster his
standing at home and in the region.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hastily
rearranged a Middle East tour to include a visit to Amman, the
Jordanian capital, to meet the prince and express confidence in the
stability of a key American ally. ``I wanted to stop here to make
very clear that the U.S. stands with Jordan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats who have served in Jordan say the king's
decision last week to overturn decades-old succession plans and
name Abdullah as heir was not so surprising, especially if his
death is near.
</P>
<P>
   While the king's brother and longtime heir apparent, Prince
Hassan, is widely respected for his intelligence and commitment to
the Middle East peace effort, he is also considered aloof. He has
inspired little affection among the people and the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Abdullah does have the tie with the military, which is
the bedrock of stability in Jordan,'' said Roscoe Suddarth, the
American ambassador to Jordan from 1987 to 1990. ``I think all of
his instincts will be very much to follow in his father's
footsteps. On balance, I'd say that he's a good choice.''

JURY DELIBERATIONS AHEAD IN GUNMAKERS' LIABILITY SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he left his home in Japan for a business trip to
California in 1994, Koichi Sunada could not have imagined the
sudden decision he would face in America: whether to authorize
doctors to remove his 22-year-old son from life-support machines.
The young man, who had been living in New York after immigrating to
the United States, was shot by a robber while Sunada was in
California, and was left brain dead in a Queens hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying recently in Federal District Court in Brooklyn,
Sunada recounted the nightmarish days after his grief-stricken
wife, at home in Japan, called him in California with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Kei was shot,''' Sunada said. ``If you live in
Japan, the words `to be shot' are words one never hears.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunada told of rushing to New York and seeing his son _ a
physical fitness and karate enthusiast who had dreamed of becoming
an auto-racing driver _ tied to machines that were sustaining a
futile heartbeat, a hole visible in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Sunada, a 53-year-old urban planner, was not testifying at the
trial of his son's killer. That took place three years ago; the
gunman was convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
Rather, he was testifying at the trial of others he also considers
responsible _ more than 25 American gun manufacturers, including
the giants of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sunada and relatives of five other people killed with illegally
obtained handguns, as well as a teen-ager severely wounded with
such a gun, are the plaintiffs in a potentially precedent-setting
civil suit being closely watched across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that the manufacturers are collectively liable
for the shootings in the case _ even if it cannot be proved which
company's gun was used in a given shooting _ because their
marketing and distribution of handguns has been so negligent that
they have fostered the illegal firearms traffic that put the
weapons into the hands of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it is the first time such an argument has gone
to trial _ the jury could begin deliberating on it this week _ and
that the outcome could set a precedent for similar suits that
various cities have more recently filed, or are planning to file,
against gun makers, much as states have sued the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the far-flung implications and legal abstractions.
Sunada's testimony dealt with the agonizing personal circumstances
that helped give birth to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that since my son was brain dead, I should remove
the life-support systems,'' he testified, as he relived that day at
the hospital four and a half years ago. ``I was in shock. The
inside of my mind was in confusion,'' he said, his Japanese
rendered into English for the rapt jurors by an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   But after taking a night to think it over, he said, ``I agreed
to the removal of life support, and he died.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun makers deny the plaintiffs' central contention _ that
the companies oversupply states with weak gun-control laws and that
many of the excess guns end up in the hands of illegal traffickers
who resell them to criminals and youths in states with strong gun
laws, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say that the oversupply argument is based on
flawed data, that they cooperate with law enforcement, and that to
hold them liable would be to shift the blame to them from the
criminals who used the guns.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who have followed the case have seen it in terms of
David and Goliath _ a small group of people who have suffered the
consequences of the illegal trafficking, and four lawyers with
limited resources, versus major gun makers like Smith &AMP; Wesson
Corp. and Colt's Manufacturing Co. and their team of a dozen
well-financed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four lawyers for the plaintiffs _ Denise Dunleavy,
Michael S. Feldberg and Marc E. Elovitz _ say they entered the case
only in the last two months, as the trial neared. For virtually all
of the time since the suit was filed in 1995, they said, the lawyer
who brought it, Elisa Barnes, had carried it forward as a solo
practitioner in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies' lawyers, James P. Dorr, suggested,
however, that the David and Goliath perception was somewhat
exaggerated. He said other lawyers had helped Ms. Barnes behind the
scenes on pretrial matters like depositions. Ms. Barnes said that
other lawyers had volunteered to do two depositions for her, but
that she had done more than 30 others.
</P>
<P>
   But when David and Goliath were mentioned, she laughed at the
comparison. To become a figure of Biblical dimensions, she said,
``I'm going to have to go to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun companies' lawyers have expressed unhappiness that the
judge, Jack B. Weinstein, allowed the suit to go to trial,
maintaining that it had so little merit that he should have
dismissed it long ago. Instead, he ruled in 1996 that it was
possible the plaintiffs could convince a jury of their theory of
industrywide ``negligent distribution'' of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge has made clear that whatever cause lies behind the
litigation, he will not allow any crusading oratory. When Ms.
Barnes said to the jurors, ``We're going to ask you to turn off the
spigot'' that allows illegal guns to come into New York State, the
judge immediately stopped her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you won't be asked to do that,'' he declared, adding that
the jurors would be asked to determine only whether the defendants
were liable.

REAL ESTATE: HUD RESHAPES BOSTON PROJECTS AS MODELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For almost three years Rosa M. Cabrera has been living
in a temporary rental apartment, planning for the day she can move
into a new apartment at a South End complex going up on the site of
her former home.
</P>
<P>
   The new development, called Camfield Estates. is being built at
a cost of $17.6 million by the Federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development. It will provide 102 town houses, replacing 136
leaky, pest-ridden apartments in low-rise precast-concrete
buildings, which were demolished. Initial occupancy is scheduled
for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cabrera and other former tenants who were relocated before
the buildings were demolished intend to return _ and as the owners
of the development. They formed a residents association in 1992 to
influence the development process, and since then they have
undergone hours of training, financed by HUD, in real estate
development and management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't mind the time, as long as when we move back,
we don't have the same problems as before and these apartments are
there for other generations,'' said Ms. Cabrera, who is a
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Camfield Estates is replacing a development called Camfield
Gardens, one of 11 privately built but federally insured
developments that HUD repossessed in the South End, Dorchester and
Roxbury districts of Boston. With a total of 2,200 apartments,
these 11 developments form one of the nation's largest housing
revitalization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Demonstration Disposition, the program was intended
to serve as the model for the recycling of about 7,600 apartments
that HUD repossessed under its multifamily insurance programs
across the country. It is questionable, however, whether Congress
will appropriate enough low-income housing subsidies to make this
approach possible on so broad a scale.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston pilot program, HUD is investing $320 million for
new construction and renovation of 1,850 apartments in all 11
developments. Of that total 1,453 apartments will be in renovated
properties and the rest, 397, will be in new projects. Camfield
Estates is the first of the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   To make the apartments affordable, HUD is planning to deliver
them debt-free so that rents will not have to cover any mortgage
payments. In addition, the agency will supply housing subsidies to
the projects over 15 years under the Section 8 low-income housing
program, in effect a rent supplement making it possible to hold
tenants' rents even below the buildings' requirements for
operations and reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Project-based Section 8 subsidies for new construction have been
a rarity in recent years. Their effect will be to make it possible
to rent 87 percent of the new apartments to households earning 50
percent or less than the median income in the area. The the median
income in Boston is $44,000, so most tenants will be earning under
$22,000. They will pay 30 percent of their income as rent.
</P>
<P>
   Though financed by the Federal government, construction has been
managed by a state agency, the Massachusetts Housing Finance
Agency. So far, about 450 households have been relocated during
construction and about 200 apartments have been renovated and
reoccupied in various projects. First occupancy at Camfield Estates
starts in the summer, but completion of all 80 buildings is not
expected until 2002. The development cost per apartment is likely
to average $120,000, said Robert L. Pyne, development director of
the state housing agency.
</P>
<P>
   A central element of the program has been to involve tenants in
the redevelopment process. During the planning stages, the tenant
association at each complex received about $95,000 to hire a team
of professional advisers _ a lawyer, architect and development
consultant; a liaison with the construction company and a community
development corporation experienced in management.
</P>
<P>
   Once construction is completed, the tenant organization at each
complex will decide whether it wants to own the property alone or
in partnership with a private real estate company, or whether it
will forgo ownership entirely. In that case, HUD officials say that
they will sell the complex to a private company for $1 if it agrees
that for at least 30 years it will maintain the development for
low-income occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Camfield Estates is on 3.5 acres off Tremont Street in the
city's much sought after South End neighborhood, which in recent
years has become a popular residential location. The development it
replaces was built in 1971. Blaming poor design, construction and
management, HUD was obliged to foreclose in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the tenants' association won a $93,000 planning grant
from HUD It hired a development consultant and decided it wanted to
assume ownership and renovate the project, hoping for a HUD grant
to pay for it. A year later the Massachusetts agency became the
program administrator for HUD and found that demolition and new
construction was the way to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The new complex is designed as town houses around an oval
garden, with Domenech Hicks &AMP; Krockmalnick and Hezekiah Pratt &AMP;
Associates as the architects. There will be parking for about 80
cars, a community building with offices and a computer learning
center, ample landscaping and a large community garden. The total
development cost is estimated at about $167,000 per apartment.
Construction began last March.
</P>
<P>
   According to Paulette Ford, president of the Camfield Tenants
Association, the tenants are eager to move into brand new
apartments, but have been disappointed with some aspects of the
construction. They wanted an all red-brick facade to blend with the
neighborhood's Victorian architecture. Less costly gray vinyl
siding was chosen instead. They also feel that there should have
been more larger apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is will the buildings be sold to the
residents and kept affordable,'' Ms. Ford said. In the '60s more
than 2,000 housing units in nearby Roxbury were razed and tenants
were relocated with the promise that they could return to new
housing. But fewer than half the units were ever built and
apartments that did come back on market were too small or costly
for many of the displaced families to occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is how long the process of vacating,
demolishing and completing construction will take. At Camfield
Estates it has already run on for six years, twice as long as
anticipated. Many families who were relocated have scattered and
will not return despite their original intention to do so. Camfield
had 126 households in 1993. Now 78 say they will return, according
to Ms. Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, housing advocates see much to admire in the
program. ``This program is revitalizing what was a seriously
distressed inner-city neighborhood and delivering high quality
housing with more tenant involvement than usual,'' said Aaron
Gornstein, director of Citizens' Housing and Planning Agency, a
national affordable housing advocacy group based in Boston. ``But
as in many complicated large-scale development projects, there have
been glitches along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he questioned the adequacy and timeliness of the
tenants' training and the length of the development process. And he
noted that in the long term there is uncertainty about the
availability of adequate subsidies to maintain affordability.
</P>
<P>
   For some relocated tenants affordability is already a concern.
Ms. Cabrera's income is too high to make her eligible for a rent
subsidy, and she expects a new rent of about $1,000 a month, phased
in over a few years, compared with the $476 a month she had been
paying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard,'' she said. ``But we'll have brand-new
apartments, I can return to be with my neighbors, near my job and
we'll help set an example for the other developments in the area.''

 &HT;    Rubin warns of trade crisis
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ The United States cannot run huge trade
deficits with its major trading partners indefinitely, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned an international conference
of political and business leaders here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international system cannot sustain indefinitely the large
imbalances created by the disparities in growth and openness
between the U.S. and its major industrial trading partners,'' Rubin
declared at the weeklong World Economic Forum being held at an
Alpine ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin promised not to use the dollar ``as an instrument of
trade policy'' he conceded at a press conference following his
speech that financial markets might act in coming months to drive
down the value of the dollar, as measured against the euro and
other major trading currencies. The possible drop in the dollar,
which would reflect the huge U.S. trade huge deficit, would make
foreign goods more expensive in the United States while American
products would be cheaper overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Savings rates in the United States are far too low, Rubin noted,
striking a familiar theme in the four years he has served in the
Treasury post. But in response to a reporter's question, Rubin said
``he could not presume to advise Americans not to invest in
securities,'' a form of consumption that does not alleviate the
impact of the trade outflows.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also seemed reject any major restructuring of the
International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions
that have been widely criticized since the Asian financial crisis
first erupted in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Widely discussed reforms that sound attractive on their
surface, on full examination often raise serious questions to which
there are currently no good answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also ruled out the creation of a so-called ``early warning
system'' that would alert governments and private investors to
impending trouble in capital markets or third-world economies.
</P>
<P>
   Neither his 26 years' experience as a Wall Street trader nor his
service in several roles in the Clinton administration, Rubin said,
had assured him that such a predictive system would work. What is
more, he said, ``the early warning system itself could create
precisely the instability and even panic that such a system is
designed to prevent.''

THE NAZI GOLD DISPUTE WITH SWISS BANKS IS DECLARED ENDED
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Vice President Al Gore and the new
president of the Swiss Federation, Ruth Dreifuss, declared Saturday
that the dispute over the disposition of Nazi gold and the
treatment of Holocaust survivors by Swiss banks was over.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came even as the United States opened
discussions with Germany over compensating hundreds of thousands of
elderly Europeans who worked as slave laborers or forced laborers
for German companies in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's joint announcement, made during an economic forum
that has drawn Gore and a third of the Clinton administration's
Cabinet to this Swiss ski resort, culminated an effort to repair
what Ms. Dreifuss said had been a ``brutal'' two-year breach in
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the two major Swiss commercial banks, Credit Suisse
and Union Bank of Switzerland, formally signed a deal negotiated
last summer that calls for $1.2 billion in payments to resolve all
outstanding claims against Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Those include the dispute over what Switzerland did with gold
seized by the Nazis from Holocaust victims and deposited in Swiss
banks and over the way Swiss banks dealt with accounts opened in
the 1930s by European Jews who then perished during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those accounts disappeared, or were drained, in the
years following the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to understand the special quality of
courage that the Swiss people have shown in confronting the past,''
Gore said Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were clearly pleased at the symbolism of
making the announcement alongside Ms. Dreifuss, who on Jan. 1
became the first woman and the first Jew ever to hold the
presidency of the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
   What was not mentioned during Gore's carefully scripted public
exchanges with Ms. Dreifuss Saturday morning was the apparent
failure of one of the Clinton administration's key diplomatic
efforts with the Swiss: to get the Swiss National Bank, the
country's central bank, to become part of the final settlement of
the Nazi gold issues.
</P>
<P>
   Historical studies published by the Clinton administration, and
confirmed by outside historians, concluded that more than 80
percent of the looted gold that the Nazis deposited here was put in
the Swiss National Bank. But only the country's two big commercial
banks _ which have extensive business dealings in the United States
and around the world and feared the controversy was doing them
enormous harm _ joined in the $1.2 billion settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The government refused to take part, and Ms. Dreifuss has not
dissented from that position.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Business
Affairs, who has led the diplomatic negotiations, noted Saturday
that the Swiss National Bank had made a $75 million contribution to
a charitable fund for Holocaust survivors more than a year ago.
``The bank has said it may consider a further contribution'' after
a historical commission created by the Swiss government issues its
final report, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting last week with Germany's new Chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, Eizenstat opened discussions over the creation by
Germany of a large, privately financed fund to compensate those who
worked as slave laborers or forced laborers for German companies.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the class-action suits in the United States
against the Swiss banks has given rise to similar suits against
German companies, including Siemens and Volkswagen, and a suit
against Ford Motor Co. for the actions of its German subsidiary in
the years before American involvement in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and General Motors have both said that their companies in
Germany were essentially nationalized and that they had little
control over the use of slave labor, but the class-action suit
against Ford contends that the company's American managers were
aware of the use of unpaid, ill-fed and maltreated workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this is an historic effort by Chancellor
Schroeder and the government to close a difficult part of the
past,'' Eizenstat said in an interview Saturday. ``This will have
to be done in a way that takes into account the pending class
actions and that provides closure for the German companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's problem is much like the one that faced the Swiss
banks: it is seeking a ``global settlement'' that will terminate
all future claims. Like the Swiss banks, the German companies have
little interest in going to trial defending the actions of
long-dead managers, or sullying their carefully constructed images
as global concerns with the ugly realities of half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several German companies have hired consultants and lawyers who
worked with the Swiss in an effort to avoid several of the blunders
that led to an outcry in the United States and elsewhere about
their handling of the Holocaust victims. But in private, several
European executives attending the World Economic Forum here have
expressed concern that World War II-era suits are turning into what
one executive called ``a legalized form of blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations that led up to Saturday's joint
announcement by Gore and Ms. Dreifuss, American officials sought
assurances from Switzerland that it had not given up on trying to
create a $4.7 billion humanitarian fund, financed by selling some
of the country's gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the fund, which would most likely require a
national referendum, set off intense opposition from Swiss who
believed their country was being unfairly singled out, and
pressured by the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ Shackled in handcuffs, Grigory Pasko was
rushed past the small knot of fellow reporters who gathered outside
the military courtroom, hoping to observe his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight!'' he shouted out defiantly, as two policemen
hauled him away.
</P>
<P>
   Then the courtroom doors slammed shut. The news media were
shooed away. In a scene reminiscent of trials of dissidents in the
old Soviet Union, one of the new Russia's most notorious treason
trials was under way.
</P>
<P>
   After reporting about the dumping of military waste at sea, the
37-year-old captain has been charged with disclosing some of the
state's most sensitive secrets. Denied bail, he already has spent
14 months in a tuberculosis-infested prison. If convicted, he could
stay in jail for another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Russia is a raucous democracy. Politics is a
verbal slugfest. The constitution guarantees free expression. News
media are a cacophony of clashing opinions and vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still limits on free speech, especially where the
military is concerned. Pasko has emerged as the vivid test of
Russia's still unfinished struggle to overcome the dark legacy of
official secrecy, late-night searches and whimsical persecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Pasko's trial follows the arrest in St. Petersburg of Aleksandr
Nikitin, a retired Navy officer who researched radioactive
contamination caused by Russia's northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   But this drama in Vladivostok is being played out more than
5,000 miles from the media glare of Moscow, and features
unrepentant former KGB officials and the raw politics of Russia's
Far East. A closed city in Soviet times, off limits to foreigners
or Soviets without special permission, Vladivostok is now an open
port, a neighbor to China, Japan and the two Koreas and rife with
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test of whether there is really freedom of speech in
Russia,'' said Aleksandr Tkachenko, head of the Russian PEN Center,
which lobbies for free expression in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A career Navy officer with the outward dash of a matinee star,
Pasko was working as a reporter for Boyevaya Vakhta (Battle Watch),
the newspaper of Russia's Pacific Fleet, when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian leaders
trumpeted the need for a no-holds-barred look at the nation's past.
The Russian Navy was dumping weapons and nuclear waste at sea, and
Pasko set out to expose it.
</P>
<P>
   He filmed the environmental abuse and documented it in his
newspaper. Like many cash-strapped Russian journalists, he also
freelanced, providing video tapes and other material about
environmental abuse to Nippon Hoso Kyokai, or NHK, Japan's largest
television network. In the months before his arrest, aptain Pasko
was receiving about $300 a month from the Japanese news media, his
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   After NHK broadcast a report on the dumping of military waste,
Russian authorities began to take a closer look at Pasko.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he began to deal with the problem of radioactive waste,
he constantly felt the FSB was stepping on his heels,'' Pasko's
wife, Galina Morozova, recalled in an interview, referring to the
internal security police, one of the heirs to the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   When Pasko left for a business trip to Japan in November 1997,
customs officials seized some of his documents. When he returned,
he was arrested at Vladivostok airport and charged with selling
secret information.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the FSB raided his modest apartment, confiscating
his computer, fax machine and even his family's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``When glasnost began, there was a brief period when it seemed
there could be complete freedom of speech,'' Ms. Morozova said,
referring to the greater openness allowed in Russia in the early
1990's. ``But the security organizations did not disappear and
gradually the screws began to tighten again. Grigory did not notice
that moment when the policy began to shift in the opposite
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Satskov, a senior FSB official for the Pacific Fleet,
told a Vladivostok newspaper that the basic strategy was to try
Pasko as an officer who gave secrets, not as a journalist who
uncovered a environmental scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Pasko's lawyers say the arrest may have little to do with
reports on the Navy's waste dumping. Rather, they speculate, it may
be an attempt to stifle the reporter after he began to inquire into
the alleged theft by local officials of Japanese aid for processing
radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   The specific charges in the 10-point indictment against Pasko
are classified. His guilt or innocence will be decided following
the closed trial by the judge of the military court and two
officers in the border guards who serve as lay judges. The degree
of foreign interest, however, may influence whether Pasko can win
release on bail or prevail in legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In the similar case of Nikitin, Bellona, the Norwegian
environment organization Nikitin had supplied with information,
lobbied hard on his behalf. Although he has yet to be formally
acquitted, he was released on bail after ten months.
</P>
<P>
   Pasko's Japanese contacts, in contrast, have kept their
distance.
</P>
<P>
   NHK, which has a bureau in Vladivostok, did not report on the
opening of his trial, said Fumina Koike, a NHK spokeswoman in
Tokyo. Nor has the television network appealed for Pasko's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain Pasko has never worked exclusively for NHK,'' the
network said in a statement. ``If Captain Pasko needs our
assistance for his defense in the trial, we are willing to consider
and respond frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest newspapers, also has yet
to report on the trial, its spokesmen said. The newspaper says it
interviewed Pasko to learn about the Russian Navy and environmental
issues but says it never paid him.
</P>
<P>
   Pasko recently received a boost when Amnesty International
designated him a ``prisoner of conscience,'' and press-freedom
organizations have come to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which did take note of the Nikitin
case, has shown relatively little interest in Pasko in distant
Vladivostok, his lawyers said. ``We are monitoring the case, but we
don't normally get involved in cases when they are before the
court,'' said an official at the American Embassy in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his wife, Pasko did publish a letter in a local
tabloid, decrying his arrest as a clumsy effort to stifle his
reporting. She said the more ``serious'' newspapers in Vladivostok
were afraid to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Pasko's visits with his wife were temporarily
suspended, and he was transferred to an overcrowded cell with 30
hardened convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulties are also apparent in court. One of Pasko's lawyers
was expelled from the courtroom after he asked a witness whether he
was working with the security services.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her kitchen, Ms. Morozova cast a glance at a photo of
their honeymoon in Egypt, just six months before Pasko's arrest.
Since then, she has only been able to see her husband six times.

COMMENTARY: BETTY CURRIE'S P.C. PASS
</HEADLINE>
 
(REPEATING from Friday, Jan. 29, to sub 7th graf to insert
`niggardly') (bl) 
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Bill Clinton, aspiring to be
President Pothole, gives a focus-group-driven laundry list of a
State of the Union speech that stops just short of promising every
citizen a health-club membership _ and what do Republicans do to
counter it? Both of the members of Congress giving the GOP
televised response advertise that they've had Clintonesque marital
fissures in their own families, and one of the pair, Jennifer Dunn,
goes on and on about how ``sound,'' ``strong'' and ``prosperous''
the country is on Clinton's watch.
</P>
<P>
   As if this weren't enough, Pat Robertson pronounces the
president's speech a ``home run'' _ and, in another
Alice-in-Wonderland reversal, Rush Limbaugh soon decides to join
Larry Flynt's crusade by inexplicably Flynting a conservative GOP
senator by name on his radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes still more proof that Bill Clinton has frightened his
opponents into switching teams: This was the week that the 13 House
managers decided to become, of all things, touchy-feely P.C.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation could first be sighted last weekend when the
managers, some of them in jus'-folks sweaters suggestive of
Clinton's golf-course wardrobe, reported on their first official
tryst with Monica Lewinsky, speaking empathetically about how
``personable and impressive'' she was. Henry Hyde went so far as to
say that the point of the meeting was ``to get a sense of how she
(Ms. Lewinsky) feels.''
</P>
<P>
   But the final proof came 48 hours later when the guys produced
their long-awaited witness list, and it did not include Betty
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   The president's secretary up until that moment had been
considered nearly as certain a witness as Ms. Lewinsky. Her
presence had frequently been cited by the House managers as
crucial; anti-Clinton pundits had piled on with plausible
explanations of why she was, as they put it, ``the one essential
witness.'' If you believe that the obstruction of justice count is
the more solid of the two impeachment articles, they argued, no one
is better placed at the Clinton-Lewinsky-Vernon Jordan nexus than
Mrs. Currie to get at the gift-hiding, job-searching and
testimony-coaching at the core of Clinton's possible
witness-tampering in a federal case.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Currie failed to make the witness list, there was
bafflement from Republicans like Susan Collins as well as Democrats
like Charles Schumer _ not to mention much of the press _ and no
credible on-the-record explanation for this omission from the
prosecutors. But the niggardly, not-for-attribution mutterings were
clear enough: The 13 white men cowered at the prospect of throwing
hardball questions at an African-American woman who might break
into tears.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think it might be a little late for such heightened
sensitivities. Given that the House managers include one member
who's spoken before a racist group and others who have fueled the
attack on quotas, affirmative action and Anita Hill, why run away
at this make-or-break juncture from as valuable a witness as Mrs.
Currie? Such is the ever-increasing power of Bill Clinton to set
the agenda for even his fiercest adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The president who promised a cabinet that looked like America
had, in typically shameless fashion, done the same with his defense
team: one disabled lawyer, one black woman lawyer, one white woman
lawyer, one Brooks Brothers lawyer and, to wrap it all up, one Good
Ole Boy. The 13 managers clearly, if belatedly, took this
stage-managed diversity to heart. Given the choice between calling
a black woman who might actually help their case and summoning
Sidney Blumenthal, an unshakable Clinton partisan who is more
peripheral to it, they blinked. The politics of P.C. trumped the
legal imperatives and inviolate principles that supposedly governed
their prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's main virtue as a witness is that his public persona
is so annoying _ he's the recurrent hangnail of the Clinton
scandals _ that he could arouse national sympathy for Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But the managers didn't consider the prospect that in the world
of P.C. they've now entered, even the choice of Blumenthal could
backfire. All he has to do to become a martyr is convince America
that he has been targeted by the Clinton-bashing Rev. Jerry
Falwell, who, just days before the release of the witness list,
proclaimed that the Antichrist is alive, ``male and Jewish.''

EXPERTS SEEKING CAUSE OF ILLNESS AT BRONX SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Environmental testing continued Saturday at a Bronx
school that was evacuated twice last week after students and
teachers became ill there.
</P>
<P>
   A number of students who had been on the second floor at
Intermediate School 135, at 2441 Wallace Ave. in Bronxdale, began
to suffer from severe nausea, headaches or chest pains on Thursday
and again on Friday. Several were taken to hospitals for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are checking the water in the school's drinking
fountains, as well as its furnace and indoor air quality. Because
some people reported the odor of rotten eggs, which is often
related to sulfur dioxide, the officials also planned to check the
oil in the school's heating system for that chemical during tests
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While the cause of the illnesses at I.S. 135 has not been
pinpointed, school officials said they had made progress in the
investigation of a separate spate of illnesses at another Bronx
school.
</P>
<P>
   Chiara Coletti, director of communications for the Board of
Education, said that noxious gases coming from the Bathgate
Industrial Park were responsible for the nausea and dizziness that
overcame teachers and students at Public School 4 in the Bathgate
section of the Bronx last Monday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   City and state environmental agencies will attempt this week to
pinpoint where in the industrial park the gases are originating,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Students at a third Bronx school, Public School 19, also were
sickened last week, by what was described as an alcohol-like smell.
Ms. Coletti said officials are looking at the possibility that
alcohol or some other substance may have spilled in the nurse's
office and its odor spread through the ventilation system.

PAUL METCALF, WHO WROTE EXPERIMENTAL TALES, DIES AT 81
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Maine, S.C., Va., Mo., R.I.)  (dw) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Metcalf, who made his mark as an experimental writer of
prose, poetry and plays, died on Jan. 21 near Pittsfield, Mass. He
was 81 and lived in Chester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Nancy, said Metcalf had a heart attack after buying
apples at a farmers market not far from Arrowhead, the Berkshire
home of Herman Melville, his great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a medieval chronicler with the eye of a poet and the
heart of a taleteller, he fits together radiant fragments into a
wholly new kind of construct,'' the author Guy Davenport once wrote
of Metcalf. His more than 20 books were often collages of
first-person historical narratives, science writing, newspaper
clips and his own words, woven together in a single fabric. ``It
was like a symphony, with sources like old diaries and botanical
descriptions as the different instruments,'' said his daughter
Adrienne.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the words had a cumulative effect. In his 1976 book
``Apalache,'' an epic about the settlement of the New World, he
mixed native and settler chronicles with his own musings: ``The
fragrance drifts seaward/we smelled the land a hundred leagues, and
farther  &UR; when they burned the cedars &LR; /before we come in sight of it
thirty leagues, we smell a sweet savour/we had now fair sunshine
weather, and so pleasant a sweet as did much refresh us, and there
came a smell off the shore like the smell of a garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf came from a distinguished New England family. His mother
was Eleanor Thomas Metcalf, a granddaughter of Herman Melville and
his literary executor. His father, Henry Knight Metcalf, who worked
for an insurance company, was a descendant of Roger Williams, the
founder of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf was born in East Milton, Mass., and was educated at
private schools. He attended Harvard but disliked it and left after
only three months. In 1942 he married Nancy Harman Blackford of
Charleston, S.C., and during the next 20 years the couple spent
long periods in the South. In addition to his wife, he is survived
by a brother, David, of Topsham, Me.; two daughters, Anne
Westmoreland of Schuyler, Va., and Adrienne, of Becket, Mass., and
two granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his life, Metcalf thought little about his famous
ancestor and his writings. His first book, ``Will West,'' published
in 1956, was a short novel about murder with a Cherokee as the
protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 60s Metcalf returned to the Berkshires, and in
his 1965 book, ``Genoa,'' acknowledged the relationship to
Melville. ``Genoa'' was one of his best-known works, a blend of
references to Melville, other sources and his own language.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, a man called Michael Mills muses about his own
history, and his brother, Carl, who is a monster: ``Herman would
harangue his wife and two daughters (this was after the sons were
gone) on matters that had no interest for them, and they would roll
their eyes, and sigh, and wait, or there would be outbursts of
temper, sarcasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf told his hometown newspaper, The Berkshire Eagle, that
the book ``was a way of getting the Melville monkey off my back.''
</P>
<P>
   William H. Gass, reviewing ``Genoa'' in The New York Times, said
that the book ``invites us to pass our minds down a new but ancient
track, to become, ourselves, both fact and fiction, and to discover
something true about the geography of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf was a tall man with a powerful physical presence. In
recent years, with his hair nearly shoulder length and his pipe in
his mouth, he was a colorful figure. His home in Becket became a
center for artists and writers in the area. As a writer he remained
a cult figure, although in 1987 he was honored by the American
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Beginning in 1996, the
Coffee House Press of Minneapolis published a three-volume edition
of his collected works.
</P>
<P>
   He also supported efforts to increase the collection of
Melville's papers at Arrowhead and at the Berkshire Athenaeum in
Pittsfield. In 1921, the manuscript of Melville's novel ``Billy
Budd'' was discovered in a tin box in his family's home.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, as Metcalf was moving out of his Becket
house, he found two more boxes of family papers and memorabilia
that he had long forgotten. He donated the papers to the Melville
Room of the Berkshire Athenaeum.

 &HT;    Delphi `set free' by GM to become publicly traded company
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner and Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp. on Friday will nudge its
huge auto parts division out of the corporate nest in a move that
will forever alter Dayton's identity as a GM town.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest automaker will offer up to 18 percent of
Delphi Automotive Systems in an initial public offering of stock on
the New York Stock Exchange. The IPO is scheduled to take place
Friday, a spokeswoman for the exchange told the Dayton Daily News.
GM plans to distribute the remaining stock in Delphi, the world's
largest maker of auto parts, to GM shareholders later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The spin-off, which has been two years in the making, will
immediately make Delphi one of America's largest independent
companies. It also will remove 15,000 of GM's 20,000 Miami Valley
workers from the automaker's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi's pending independence has brought both anxiety and hope
for workers whose future largely depends on whether the new company
sinks or swims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that it will work, but I guess it's wait and
see,'' said Ahmad Abdul-Majid, a worker at the Delphi brake plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad deal for people that's been working for GM all
these years,'' said Harley Turner, another brake plant worker. All
the GM job security and benefits and even the GM purchases of
Delphi products will be up in the air, he said. ``It's going to be
tough _ that's what everybody is worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a Wall Street tradition, Delphi leaders are
expected to celebrate the offering when Delphi Chairman and Chief
Executive J.T. Battenberg III rings the bell to open trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. Delphi officials believe the stock,
trading under the symbol DPH, will open at about $16 a share,
according to GM filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., has 204,000 employees in
169 manufacturing plants, 40 joint ventures and 27 technical
centers spread throughout 36 countries. Outside the state of
Michigan, no metropolitan area has more Delphi workers than Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's legacy as a GM town will linger, but as an independent
company, Delphi will easily eclipse the automaker as an economic
power in the Miami Valley. Only Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
with 20,700 employees, will have a larger local work force.
</P>
<P>
   Once the spin-off is complete, the Moraine Truck Assembly plant
will be the only GM factory in the area. A new diesel engine plant
in Moraine, expected to open in 2000, is expected to be a joint
venture between GM and Isuzu Motors Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, GM has served as a source of security and
prosperity for Delphi workers, but they may emerge from the
spin-off with a brighter future, one automotive industry authority
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delphi is being set free and I think you're going to see the
company absolutely blossom in this role. I think it's a positive
deal for all those involved, shareholders, employees and
(Dayton),'' said David Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation.
``(But) it's a tough world and Delphi will have to be tough and
smart to stand out against the competitors out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the spin-off, Delphi's primary goal remains
increasing its non-GM business internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 35 percent of Delphi's business comes from
sources other than GM's North American operations. That's up from
17 percent in 1992, but Delphi officials want at least 50 percent
of their business to come outside GM by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delphi has proven its ability to compete,'' said John F.
``Jack'' Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, in a letter
to shareholders. ``But the fact is, for competitive reasons, many
manufacturers simply refuse to buy components from Delphi as long
as it's part of General Motors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cole also warns that Delphi can no longer expect a free ride
from GM when bidding as an automotive supplier. After the spin-off,
GM will buy parts from any supplier it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to work like crazy to keep GM's
business,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi and GM executives spent most of last week on their IPO
road show trying to convince potential investors nationwide that
their company will be profitable and stormy labor relations with
its blue-collar work force have calmed. Falling prices for its auto
parts and high labor costs are the main challenges facing Delphi
executives as they tout the new stock.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi's board also cut bonuses for the company's top executives
following weak 1998 financial results. Excluding several charges
and the impact of labor strikes, Delphi's net income was $889
million last year, down 36 percent from $1.38 billion in 1997,
according to SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   Battenberg, for example, had his bonus cut 56 percent to
$450,000 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even if investors embrace Delphi stock, local labor experts say
nothing is guaranteed for Dayton and other communities that depend
on the massive company for jobs and income.
</P>
<P>
   `` My crystal ball says there will be fewer (plants and jobs in
Dayton 10 years from now),'' said Steve Dandaneau, a sociology
professor at the University of Dayton. ``Common sense says there
will be fewer. Older plants and equipment will be retired ... I
wouldn't be surprised if there were 50 percent fewer workers in 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which posted $28.5 billion in sales for 1998, has
seven divisions that make brakes, shocks, struts, air conditioners,
compressors, steering systems, air bags, and many other automotive
parts. These components are then integrated into systems that are
often tailored to fit specific vehicle models for about 30
automakers worldwide. Some of those companies include Chrysler,
Ford, Honda, Harley-Davidson, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mercedes Benz,
Mitsubishi, Suzuki and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   The company now supplies parts to every major automaker in
Europe and provides cockpit modules to Fiat, Volkswagen AG and
Daimler-Benz AG.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi's roots trace back to GM's beginnings in the United
States. GM founder Billy Durant bought AC Spark Plug in 1909. Four
years later, Durant acquired Dayton Engineering Laboratories
(Delco). Soon, he acquired companies owned by Dayton inventor
Charles Kettering, father of the self-starter.
</P>
<P>
   Delco is Delphi's main ancestor in Dayton. Delco products, Delco
Moraine and the Inland division employed thousands of local workers
for decades before they were consolidated in the late 1980s. The
three divisions were part of GM's massive Automotive Components
Group, which eventually was named Delphi in 1995.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Issa Alison-Konteh sat at an
intersection in this capital, an unsteady stool beneath him, the
gutted Piccadilly chicken grill behind him, a crumbled house beside
him and two burned-out buildings before him.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings were set aflame last February, when
Nigerian-led peacekeeping troops swarmed into Freetown and restored
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah to power. He had been ousted a year
earlier by rebels who contend that they are battling a rich clique
that they say runs what the United Nations ranks as the world's
poorest nation.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a so far vain but extremely brutal campaign to recapture
the city, the rebels returned and destroyed the house and
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians do their own, the rebels do their own, and
you're caught in the middle,'' said Alison-Konteh, 39.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of civil war between the rebels and a
government that says the guerrillas are merely out for their own
gain, Sierra Leone lies in ruins, a country only in name. More than
440,000 of its people _ about 10 percent of the population _ have
fled to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Government authority has dissolved. The main national defense
force is the Kamajors, a ragtag militia of men and boys who often
wear mirrors on their chests in the belief this will ward off
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the government's only significant support has come
from a West African peacekeeping force headed by soldiers from
sub-Saharan Africa's most populous country, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But that support seems about to evaporate, leaving Sierra
Leone's capital under attack and its northern and eastern regions
in the sway of rebels who, according to the government, foreign
diplomats and locals, terrorize residents by hacking off hands and
feet of captives to show what vengeance they can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big mess,'' said a Western diplomat in the region. ``It
is not a mess that will be easy to clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this change lie in Nigeria. The former dictator
there, Gen. Sani Abacha, found it useful to draw attention away
from his record of abuse at home by promoting democracy abroad _
which in Sierra Leone meant heading up the peacekeeping force known
as Ecomog and restoring Kabbah to power in 1998 (the grateful
Kabbah promptly renamed one of Freetown's main arteries Sani Abacha
Street).
</P>
<P>
   But Abacha died in June, and his successor, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, has promised to restore civilian rule in Nigeria and said
he hopes to withdraw all its troops from Sierra Leone by May. In
addition, the price of oil, Nigeria's chief source of wealth, is
plummeting, slicing at the money needed to help keep Sierra Leone
together.
</P>
<P>
   As for Washington, it gave Ecomog $3.9 million in 1998 for
peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. This year, as part of the United
States' shrinking total peacekeeping budget in Africa, only $1.3 is
budgeted. No reliable figures exist about the costs incurred by
Nigeria, though some diplomats have suggested that they might reach
as high as $1 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Nigerians are in Freetown, a city of ruins that
belies the optimism of its name, given when it was settled two
centuries ago by freed slaves from Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
   The first university in sub-Saharan Africa was founded here. But
now there is only death, despair and devastation. Nigerian forces
shell the hilly outskirts of eastern Freetown, where the rebels
have fled for now, retreating from their latest offensive, launched
Jan. 6, to retake this skeleton of a city.
</P>
<P>
   The latest assault on Freetown followed three months during
which the rebels killed and maimed villagers in eastern and
northern Sierra Leone. The rebels' actions seemed to be a reaction
in part to the public execution in Freetown of 24 soldiers involved
in the 1997 coup against Kabbah and, more important, the death
sentence handed out last October to their leader, Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who is appealing the death sentence and is believed to
be in jail somewhere in Sierra Leone, founded the Revolutionary
United Front in 1991, saying he was disgusted with the
mismanagement and corruption of successive civilian governments.
</P>
<P>
   A cashiered army corporal, Sankoh directed his guerrillas from
the bush. He has been seen in the outside world only a few times
and is said to inspire religious devotion among his followers, an
unknown number of whom are now fighting on his behalf and demanding
his release.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sankoh signed a peace agreement with Kabbah, who had
been chosen president in what were considered fair elections. The
elections followed five years of rule by the military, whose young
officers enriched themselves in the country's diamond mines _
tapped since by the government and the rebels to finance their war
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1996 accord quickly unraveled. The military staged a
coup in 1997 and invited the rebels to join them in Freetown in a
partnership that lasted until February 1998 when the Nigerians
helped restore Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels now trying to topple the president are made up of
Sankoh's group and former members of the military. No one knows
exactly how many they are; nor is there a precise number for the
Ecomog forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's group, consisting of men and boys from rural areas,
says it represents disaffected Sierra Leonans against a powerful,
small elite in Freetown who exploit and monopolize the country's
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have vast mineral resources and yet we are the poorest
country on the face of the planet,'' said Martin Coker, the special
assistant to Sam Bockarie, the rebels' battlefield commander.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in the bush on his satellite phone, Coker said: ``Our
people are deprived of basic human rights to health, education, and
a better standard of living. It is a noble cause that we have
embarked on.''
</P>
<P>
   Coker, who said he lived illegally in the United States for a
decade and worked as carpenter in Washington until 1996, denied
charges by ordinary Sierra Leonans, the government, foreign
diplomats and international humanitarian groups that members of his
organization had committed atrocities. He blamed instead the
militia fighting for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Septimus Kaikai, the president's spokesman, rejected the rebels'
criticisms. ``There are no issues for these people,'' he said.
``They do not have a political agenda. They do not have a religious
agenda. There's no social agenda. What they're simply doing is
simply personal; it's personal aggrandizement, selfishness on their
part, just to amass wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   The government _ along with the United States, Britain and
Nigeria _ has accused Liberia of helping the rebels in Sierra Leone
with arms and men. Sankoh is a longtime ally of Liberia's
president, Charles Taylor, who was once a guerrilla leader himself
waging an extremely vicious seven-year civil war that ended in a
stalemate and in his eventual election as president.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has denied his government's involvement in Sierra Leone,
although he has said that Liberian individuals are fighting in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the Liberian war _ reflected later in wars in
countries like Zaire, now Congo, Rwanda, the Congo Republic and
Sierra Leone _ included the widespread use of child soldiers and
the notion that unarmed citizens are fair targets.
</P>
<P>
   But the influence of Liberia's war may have been greatest on
Sierra Leone: in addition to close ties between Sankoh and Taylor,
soldiers, rebels and mercenaries from both countries are believed
to have fought in each other's wars, easily crossing the porous
border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   When Sierra Leone's rebels briefly held power, they proved
extremely unpopular among residents of Freetown, many of whom lined
the streets this month to cheer Nigerian soldiers. After the deaths
and mutilation of thousands in the capital during the latest
offensive, any reconciliation with the rebels is hard to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's main sports stadium, where thousands of refugees
and hungry gathered, there was no talk of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to be flushed out of the country,'' said Abdul
Margai, 28, whose house had been set afire by rebels. ``Just kill
them. We don't want to see them again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kill them,'' echoed Emmanuel Dijohn, 25.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, men, women and children walked in file, staring
straight ahead, carrying on their heads bags of rice, branches and
other tools to start over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello! How are you? Welcome!'' a woman cried to a reporter
drawn to a small fire burning in the ruins of her house.
</P>
<P>
   A group of boys had burned down the front of her house, leaving
only a back portion, which Fatimata Koroma was now cleaning. Mrs.
Koroma, 40, said she had fled the fire by jumping over a backyard
fence at least 2 feet above her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a woman like me jumping this fence and then jumping
another fence higher than this one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fearful,'' she said. ``I would prefer to die than see
such things again.'' Then she returned to cleaning the remains of
her house.

IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL THE QUEST FOR WITNESSES A MATTER OF PRECEDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI AND KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., knows that President
Clinton is almost certain to be acquitted on the articles of
impeachment, because the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority
necessary for a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Smith knows, too, that the three witnesses about to be deposed
for Clinton's trial have been questioned time and again, and may
have little if anything new or revelatory to say.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as he gets closer to the moment when he will have to
cast a vote that will likely be remembered better than any other in
his political career, he finds himself craving an extra ounce of
confidence, a few more grams of assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like a greater sense of certitude than I have now,''
he said in an interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he could comfortably vote guilty
or not guilty on the articles of impeachment without an iota of
additional information.
</P>
<P>
   But no impeachment trial in the Senate, Gramm said, had ever
proceeded to a verdict without at least some word from witnesses, a
step that he said was proper and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is not an outcome, it's a process,'' he said in an
interview late Thursday. ``There's almost too much focus on the
horse race aspect of this _ who's winning, who's losing _ rather
than the system. We're setting a precedent that's going to be
important 50 years from now and 100 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment trial of President Clinton poised to round
a pivotal corner and turn toward fresh testimony from three
witnesses beginning Monday, the Republican senators who steered it
in that direction said they were not blind to the public distaste
for the proceedings or oblivious to the predictability of the
verdict at the end.
</P>
<P>
   They were not on a political suicide mission, they said, or a
crusade to humiliate the president at any cost, as many Democrats
have asserted. The Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats, and
it would take 67 votes to convict Clinton and remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In extensive interviews with a dozen Republican senators over
the last three days, they said they were trying to satisfy a
variety of needs and concerns that were more important than any
rapidly reached terminus.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them said they were interested in resolving lingering
questions about the evidence. Others said they were interested in
safeguarding Constitutional procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Several said they simply wanted to be as thorough and
responsible as possible, an effort that they said a few witnesses
and a few more days could only assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you say there aren't two-thirds, for each of us
who have to cast those votes on the articles, it makes a difference
in how we explain those votes,'' said Sen. Olympia J. Snowe of
Maine, a moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe added that when future generations ``look back on the
record, they want to see how we arrived at this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said that he shared that
concern and that he and many other Republican senators had not
firmly made up their minds about their votes on the two articles of
impeachment. The first article charges Clinton with perjury, the
second with obstruction of justice for trying to conceal his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make the right decision,'' Santorum said. ``That's
important for me. I want to make a decision based on the oath for
impartial justice. If I don't get all the information, then I'm not
doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that for some senators, the vote to take videotaped
depositions from Ms. Lewinsky and presidential confidantes Vernon
E. Jordan Jr. and Sidney Blumenthal, was less an expression of any
confusion about the voluminous record of the case than an act of
accommodation for the House trial managers who had pressed for
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, several senators said that the depositions were by
no means a prelude to the appearance of witnesses on the Senate
floor. Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said he would vote against
such a scenario ``unless there was something explosive, like
dynamite'' in the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a number of people on my side of the aisle who
would vote no,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Most of the senators interviewed would not signal how they
intended to vote; they said that would be inappropriate, given that
they are acting in part as jurors who have taken oaths of
impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, most of the senators also declined to
discuss in detail what testimony from the three witnesses they were
most interested in hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was one of the exceptions. While he said he was leaning
toward voting for conviction on obstruction of justice, he said he
was tilting toward acquittal on perjury. He added that many
Republican colleagues were similarly inclined, and that Clinton
might win acquittal on perjury by a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd bet at least a third of my colleagues see it as I do,''
Smith said, explaining that he felt that Clinton's denials of a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were artful enough to ``stay
on the legal side of perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas agreed that there were many
Republicans who would vote to acquit Clinton on perjury, although
he would not say where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them feel it's encompassed in the obstruction of
justice,'' said Hutchinson, whose brother, Asa, is one of the House
trial managers. ``Some of them feel that perjury would not rise to
an impeachable offense, but obstruction of justice does.''
</P>
<P>
   Those senators willing to discuss the upcoming depositions in
detail said there were several key areas of interest. One was the
precise course of events on the day when Ms. Lewinsky returned
several gifts, which the president had given her, to Betty Currie,
Clinton's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   House trial managers have contended that the purpose of a 3:32
p.m. phone call which Mrs. Currie placed to Ms. Lewinsky on Dec.
28, 1997, was to arrange the retrieval of the gifts, and that the
advance call somehow showed that Mrs. Currie was doing the
president's bidding. But Ms. Lewinsky has testified several times
that she gave the gifts to Mrs. Currie around 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that whole area needs clarification,'' Hutchinson
said, adding that further questioning of Ms. Lewinsky might
accomplish that. ``It's something I need.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said he was particularly
interested in assessing Ms. Lewinsky's and Jordan's voices and
demeanors when they respond to inevitable questions about their
previous testimony that Jordan's efforts to find her a job were not
down payments on her silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so flatly unbelievable,'' Grassley said. ``It makes you
wonder how a lowly intern can get the attention of the president of
the United States, a $12 million-a-year lawyer like Vernon Jordan
and John Podesta, the president's chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said, in reference to Jordan, ``I'd like to know how many
other interns in the White House he went to these lengths to get
jobs for. It's just _ it really smells, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said he hoped to see Blumenthal asked anew about the
president's initial assertion to him early last year that Ms.
Lewinsky was a mendacious stalker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what he knows now,'' Grassley said, ``what's his
reflection of what the president told him? Was the president
obstructing justice by coaching him? He's either got to say what he
thinks, or take the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gramm said that there was always the possibility to gain
more insight into the case than the thousands of pages of records
had provided.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he said: ``Anybody who says they've sat down and
read those six volumes is not telling the truth. I don't believe
it.'' He said he had read only ``bits and pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said he had learned ``a tremendous amount'' in the
trial so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn every day,'' Gramm said. ``Every time this ground is
plowed, you get a better understanding of the facts. I'm sure I'll
learn something in the last sentence that's spoken. Will it change
my mind? Maybe, maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, most senators, including Gramm, said these fine
points were not the primary reason for the depositions scheduled
for Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consideration, they said, was history. To proceed
to this next chapter of the trial was to stay true to the past, set
a good example for the future and craft an insurance policy against
any assertions down the line that Clinton's transgressions were
swept aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing what the Constitution requires, handling this
case the way every other impeachment has been handled,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that Republicans were taking the long view. ``If we
shortchange this too much,'' he said, ``we will create a grassy
knoll for conspiracy theorists for the next century.''

SAILOR OVERCOMES CALAMITY IN SOLO RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isabelle Autissier is as amazed as anyone at the success she has
resurrected from failure in sailing alone around the world.
</P>
<P>
   A string of mishaps at sea in December in the 27,000-mile Around
Alone race set calamity in motion aboard her yacht, PRB. The
sailboat's canted keel went haywire, the satellite antenna fell
overboard, and the boat's mainsail track jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Helpless in storms, and slow on a good day, the 60-foot sailboat
limped to Tasmania for repairs like a hot-air balloon with a slow
leak. For Autissier, hopes of winning the eight-month ocean race
all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now _ the race restart from
Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb. 6. The 41-year-old Autissier will
not only be among the dozen solo sailors expected to set out on Leg
3, but she is also in the lead by six hours on elapsed time. Her
position is a puzzle unless you know her drive, tenacity and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had all those problems, all I could think about was to
get to safety,'' Autissier said last week in a telephone interview
from Auckland. ``We have an expression in France that says it is
`to save the furniture.' I was sure I would lose three or four
days. I had been leading, and suddenly, I felt I was out of the
race. I thought, `What have I done to the ocean?'''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Autissier fixed her boat and set out again, she was
about 500 miles behind the leader, Giovanni Soldini of Italy. But
her boat hitched a fast ride on a sizable cold front with 40-knot
winds. ``Suddenly, I did it,'' she said. ``I had good luck. I was
able to be very quick, and I caught up.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stage of the Around Alone race is apt to bring other
tales of turmoil at sea. But Autissier's travails through three
previous round-the-world races and this competition, have always
tested her shrewdness in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Where she is headed now _ the 5,960 miles across the Pacific
Ocean to South America, around Cape Horn and north to Uruguay _ are
often kinder to her. ``In the Pacific Ocean, the low fronts are
slower, and more predictable, so you have time to do something,''
she said. ``The Pacific Ocean is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other sailors do not share that optimism, however. With
Cape Horn reaching down into the Pacific like a mad troll, the leg
can be treacherous. In previous round-the-world races, two solo
sailors, Harry Mitchell of England, and Gerry Roufs of Canada,
disappeared in those waters without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Mouligne, a Frenchman who lives in Newport, R.I.,
will sail at that low latitude known as the Screaming Fifties for
the first time. As the leader in Class II, for boats up to 50 feet,
Mouligne is anticipating the journey with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leg 2 was easy _ cold and windy but not dangerous for me,''
Mouligne said from Auckland. ``But I dread Leg 3 as it could prove
to be a lot more difficult. So far I have done well, and I am
better prepared than ever before. But that is only part of the
equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a fast and well-outfitted boat, as Mouligne has in his
50-foot Cray Valley, makes the trip fairly palatable. But others
are not so fortunate. Fedor Konioukhov, the Russian sailor who has
trailed other competitors in Class I by as much as 4,000 miles,
might have to face that span of open ocean truly alone.
</P>
<P>
   Konioukhov was due to arrive in Auckland this weekend, but on
Friday he inexplicably began sailing away from that port. Race
officials did not expect him to arrive in time to make the race
deadline, which would result in his disqualification from the
competition. Konioukhov's participation was already in jeopardy for
failing to honor a waypoint on the route from Cape Town to
Auckland. More importantly, questions have been raised about his
boat's failure to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-foot yacht, Modern University for the Humanities, is
relatively old and weather-worn compared to others in the fleet. If
Konioukhov encounters trouble on the way to Cape Horn, other
sailors might not be able to rescue him. Autissier said it is in
Konioukhov's best interest to retire from the race in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has trouble, of course, we would go to find him,''
Autissier said. ``But he is very slow, and it is very dangerous for
him. It might be that nobody is close enough to help him.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slow-moving low pressure will crawl toward the central
Mississippi Valley on Sunday, causing an area of rain to expand
across the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys. Damp winds from the
east and southeast will stiffen during the day as the pressure
difference increases between the low and a strengthening high over
New England. A few thundershowers will be imbedded in the rain
area, but cool air near the ground will limit the threat of severe
storms. Meanwhile, patchy freezing drizzle will occur over parts of
the central Missouri Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty onshore winds will draw Atlantic moisture into the
southern Appalachians. Intermittent rain will develop from northern
Florida across Georgia and the western Carolinas. The precipitation
will begin as freezing rain and sleet in some of the higher
elevations. Farther south, partly sunny and warm conditions will
cover central and southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Cold and dry weather will prevail in most areas from the
northern Great Lakes to New England. Chilly winds from the
northeast will produce patchy clouds and flurries near the New
England coast. Otherwise, sunshine will be plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will persist in the Northwest as strong winds
from the Pacific promote periods of coastal rain and mountain snow.
Locally heavy snow will plague the Cascades and northern
Bitterroots later Sunday and Sunday night as a jet stream
disturbance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will be dry and mild although some high clouds
will dim the sun over parts of New Mexico and the Rio Grande
Valley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Ocean Snow
</P>
<P>
   Snow and high pressure systems seldom go hand in hand. But, on
Thursday and Friday, an expanding area of high pressure in Quebec
was the catalyst for as much as nine inches of snow near the
Massachusetts coast. The clockwise circulation of air around the
high generated strong, cold winds from the northeast along the New
England coast. As the chilly winds passed across the milder ocean
water they garnered moisture that was deposited as snow after
reaching land. This is the same mechanism that sometimes leads to
heavy snowfalls for regions downwind of the Great Lakes. &QL;

Wellington-based Rosenberg, a one-time professional dancer and now
a popular children's entertainer on the South Florida circuit _ her
stage name is ``Miss Maggi'' _ has been recruited to be the
rehearsal coordinator for the massive production. (It turns out
she's an old friend of one of the producers.) It's her job to coach
all the different performers and then bring them together on the
final day. Right now, she's still auditioning dancers. On Jan. 23,
she'll do her first major run-through, with up to 600 members of
the cast. On Jan. 30, she'll do a dress rehearsal with everybody.
And on Jan. 31 . . . it's showtime. (Passy, Palm Beach Post). 40.

PATAKI FACES BALANCING ACT ON SUPERFUND
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's Superfund program, which has been
responsible for cleaning up more than 300 hazardous-waste sites
across the state, is running out of money, putting Gov. George
Pataki in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, is caught between environmentalists who
want him to refinance and even strengthen the program, and his
powerful corporate allies who want him to relax the stiff penalties
and cleanup rules that it imposes on businesses and the owners of
polluted property.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is considered a defining one for Pataki. In his first
four years as governor, his actions preserved hundreds of the
state's most cherished rivers, lakes, streams and forests _ firmly
establishing him in the public mind as an environmentalist, a
central part of his political appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also been pilloried in some environmental circles,
accused of neglecting the contentious issue of corporate pollution
while he pursues a Republican agenda of easing regulations to make
New York friendlier to business.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pataki's efforts to protect open spaces have enabled him
to walk a political tightrope, as a Republican environmentalist who
has avoided any major fights with his allies in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides reject the idea that he is pursuing conflicting
goals. But many experts say that the Superfund issue may force him
to choose a side. ``This is one of the most critical environmental
issues he will have to face as governor,'' said Larry Shapiro, an
environmental lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research
Group. ``It will be one of the most prominent tests of his
administration's commitment to protecting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The state program, formally known as the Inactive Hazardous
Waste Disposal Site Program, was created to clean up toxic dumps
and spills not covered by the federal Superfund program. Since the
New York program was created in 1982, it has spent more than $1
billion. The last major infusion of cash it received was in 1986,
when voters approved a $1.2 billion bond act to refinance it, but
all that money is now either spent or spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the state's program has cleaned up more than 300 waste
sites, from landfills to abandoned dry cleaning plants and gasoline
stations, and it is still cleaning 511 others. But it lacks the
money to finish all of those or to clean up about 300 other
properties identified by state officials as posing a ``significant
threat to public health.''
</P>
<P>
   After avoiding the issue for years, Pataki and his aides have
said he intends to address the matter this year with a package of
proposals aimed at overhauling the program. But he has said almost
nothing about how he intends to renew the program, apart from
saying that he would add several hundred polluted sites not
currently on the list. His relative silence has left many questions
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The questions include: Should the program be paid for by
taxpayers or by the industries that use and produce toxic
materials? Do contaminated sites need to be thoroughly cleaned even
when they will be put to industrial use? And should the current
owner of a property be liable for a cleanup even though the
previous owners were responsible for the contamination?
</P>
<P>
   For the governor, the most critical question is how to refinance
the program, which some environmentalists estimate will cost $2.5
billion over nine years. Some environmentalists contend that the
state should continue funding a major portion of the program by
assessing fees and taxes on the industries that produce,
manufacture or use hazardous waste materials. But business leaders
have refused to accept that option, unless environmentalists agree
to make changes to the program that would be more favorable to
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to commit significant new money to the program
until program reforms are made that make more sense,'' said Kenneth
J. Pokalsky, the director of environmental programs for the
Business Council of New York State, a statewide chamber of
commerce. ``There are things that are wrong with the program as it
now stands.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has not said how he intends to respond. But an advisory
group he appointed to propose a refinancing plan is seriously
considering relaxing some of the program's rules, according to a
preliminary report it has circulated among its members. The Pataki
administration would not comment on the committee's work other than
to say that the group had reached no final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration disputes the notion that the Superfund
program is testing the governor's commitment to the environment,
saying that his record on pollution is as strong as it is in
preserving open space. ``There are those who like to build the
Republican stereotype of `good on land and bad on other
environmental issues,''' said Gary Scheffer, a spokesman for the
State Department of Environmental Conservation. ``But it doesn't
fit this governor, and that frustrates them.''
</P>
<P>
   One major change that corporate leaders are pushing for is in
the area of so-called cleanup liability. The current program holds
not only the major polluter of a site responsible for its cleanup
but also a long list of others _ from banks that foreclosed on
contaminated property to subsequent owners.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders say that the main polluters alone should be
held responsible. They contend that the current liability
provisions in the Superfund program are needlessly punitive and
have led to litigation that has delayed cleanup projects.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists contend that industry has overstated the
degree to which minor polluters are targets of Superfund programs.
They say that most of the protracted legal fights over cleanups
were started by major polluters who are dragging subsequent owners
of a contaminated property and other innocent parties into court to
share the cost of the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Another question being debated is the practicality of holding
property owners to stringent cleanup standards in all cases.
Business leaders want to allow owners to consider the realistic
health risks and the proposed uses of contaminated sites when
cleaning them up. For example, pollutants would not have to be
entirely removed from a contaminated property if, say, an
automobile repair shop was to operate there.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders contend that while no level of exposure to
hazardous materials is desirable, such risks should be put into
perspective, given the huge expense of cleaning a site to
preindustrial conditions. Otherwise, they say, many contaminated
properties will be left undeveloped and ultimately benefit no one.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and others argue that that approach is
dangerous because no one can say for sure how a property will be
used in future years as it changes ownership. They also contend
that failure to eliminate pollutants entirely poses a risk to
natural resources like groundwater and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that that approach doesn't work is because today's
corner gas station is tomorrow's condo,'' said Judith Enck, an
environmental analyst with the New York Public Interest Group. ``I
think this is just an attempt to get the cheapest cleanup costs
possible for polluters.''

MOURNERS KNEW MAN THROUGH HIS DOG
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was, as Beth Pacheco put it, ``just a wonderful,
warm story in a cold city.''
</P>
<P>
   With background barking as a kind of memorial music, more than
40 people, accompanied by about 30 dogs, bowed their heads in
prayer Saturday morning to honor a man they hardly knew.
</P>
<P>
   They did not know his religion.
</P>
<P>
   They did not know what caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   Most did not even know his last name.
</P>
<P>
   But they knew his dog, Hamlet. And so they gathered in Cadman
Plaza Park in Brooklyn Heights _ lawyers and bookkeepers and
doormen, shepherds and Dobermans and mutts _ to remember John
Tanski, a man who lived alone and died alone and is still alone,
his body unclaimed in the local morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``John died a lonely New York death, with no one to claim his
remains,'' said Jennifer Bausch, 29, a lawyer who organized the
makeshift service, brought the bagels and dog biscuits, and offered
a brief eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know John Tanski well,'' Ms. Bausch said. ``The only
thing I knew real well about John was that he loved Hamlet. That
was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet, a 4-year-old shepherd mix whose black and brown coat is
highlighted with white fur, pouted a bit at the service, then
busied himself with a box of ``People Crackers'' from the doggie
snack bar. Neighbors said Tanski was 42 and lived off disability
payments after suffering a head injury years ago in a motorcycle
accident. They said he had rescued Hamlet as a puppy from a
homeless man who had abused him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that ever happened to John was Hamlet,'' Ms.
Bausch said. ``The best thing that ever happened to Hamlet was
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bausch, with her huge gray bouvier des Flandres, Godiva, and
the other mourners knew Tanski and Hamlet by sight, from passing
one another in the park each day as they scooped their poop. He
would talk baby talk to the puppies as Hamlet flirted with their
parents, whose owners were part of the community of dog people in
anonymous New York who connect only through their pets.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m., they would see Susanne Fordham, 47, and her hulking
90-pound red Doberman, Aranda. Afternoons, they would bump into
Mary Lee Graffeo, an actress, with Natick, half chocolate Labrador
and half Doberman. At night, they would meet Chris Hanscom-Bolton,
31, and Molly and Noodle, his poodles.
</P>
<P>
   Known to them as Hamlet's John, Tanski talked little of his
life, and rarely mentioned what must have been his many problems.
It was all about the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet used to steal Aranda's toys,'' Ms. Fordham said. ``So I
always brought two. John used to bring it back later in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a routine,'' she added. ``When Hamlet wasn't there, I
noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogs and their owners began to worry when Tanski and Hamlet
disappeared from the park. It was Ms. Bausch, who knew where he
lived and went to check on him, who found him in his apartment at
the St. George Hotel two weeks ago. Neighbors said the Medical
Examiner's office told them he had been dead for four days. Hamlet
was hungry, but he had not soiled the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial service Saturday, publicized by word of mouth
and through a dozen simple fliers hung on trees and in pet stores,
there were dogs in sweaters and dogs in harnesses, sleek spotted
dogs and fluffy white ones, puppies and old-timers, dogs rubbing
noses and growling suspiciously, scampering about and sitting at
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I know them all so well, but they're always
here,'' Ms. Graffeo said to explain why she _ why they all _ had
gathered on this chilly morning. ``People who put a lot of care
into their dogs find a way to care about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pacheco, a retired college professor, does not have a dog,
but she saw Tanski and Hamlet on her frequent walks in the park, so
she attended anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sharon Blackburn of Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims in
Brooklyn Heights read from the Bible. Ms. Bausch quoted from her
own book, ``Dogs Never Lie About Love,'' sharing a passage in which
Napoleon came upon a dead enemy at the end of the Italian campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lay there deserted by all except his dog,'' Ms. Bausch
read. Napoleon, she said, was stirred to tears ``by the grief of
one dog.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending a week at the pound, Hamlet is now in a ``foster
home,'' and the Brooklyn Heights Dog Association is trying to find
him a permanent place in Brooklyn Heights, where he knows the
sights and smells. They are also searching for a final resting
place for Tanski, who they said was estranged from his family in
New Jersey. Only a relative can authorize cremation, so they are
collecting donations for burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurt me all day, knowing he died alone,'' said Jim
Murray, 40, his two dogs, Ata, a mutt, and Henry, a border collie,
wandering around his ankles. ``I just hope, God forbid, when I go
at 100, people have this for me.''

NATO PREPARED TO AUTHORIZE STRIKES AGAINST SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also KOSOVO-ULTIMATUM, KOSOVO-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO allies worked into the night Saturday
on a plan to authorize military action against Serbia at any time
if it does not agree to start talks next weekend in France with the
ethnic Albanian leaders of Kosovo about autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance ambassadors in Brussels prepared to give authority to
NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, after he consults with
allied capitals, to order airstrikes against military targets in
Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia unless President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia agrees to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   They met after Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain presented
an international ultimatum to Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leaders
in the region. Milosevic, who annulled autonomy for Kosovo 10 years
ago, made no direct response Saturday, Cook reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meetings were scheduled throughout the weekend on
plans for possible airstrikes against Serbia if Milosevic resists
the negotiations. Also being discussed was how to send in American
ground troops should President Clinton decide they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's top national security advisers have reached
a consensus to recommend sending American ground troops should the
two warring parties agree to a cease-fire, administration and
congressional officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement released Saturday, David Leavy, a White House
spokesman, said ``the president has made no decision'' on whether
to send American troops should an international peacekeeping force
enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Six nations _ the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany
and Russia _demanded an end to all violence in a meeting of the
so-called contact group on the Balkans that had been scheduled in
London on Friday in the expectation that NATO would issue an
activation order Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Allies did not want to take sides with the
Kosovo Liberation Army, in effect becoming its air force against
Serbia in the rebels' struggle for independence, a goal none of the
contact group countries supports. Ethnic Ablanians make up 90
percent of Kosovo's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making clear that the actions of the Kosovans in the
negotiations and on the ground will have a bearing on the decision
of the secretary-general to order strikes,'' a senior NATO diplomat
said. Further possible military measures to exert pressure on the
rebels, like a NATO naval blockade of major Albanian ports, are
still under study, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under what amounts to an international ultimatum, both sides
have seven days from Feb. 6, extendable by a week or less, to reach
agreement on autonomy along lines worked out over the last few
months by an American mediator for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, the
ambassador to Macedonia. The negotiations would be held in
Rambouillet, a rural 18th-century chateau 32 miles southwest of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians do negotiate a settlement,
officials said, the alliance would draw up plans for a
30,000-member NATO peacekeeping force that could stay in Kosovo for
years while a peace conference works out more permanent
arrangements.

<P>
   Clinton administration officials are considering plans to
contribute 2,000 to 5,000 troops to the peacekeeping force, and
leaders of France and Britain said last week that both their
countries would provide soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said no decision had yet been made on withdrawing
1,020 international observers from the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe who are now monitoring the situation in
Kosovo. A French-commanded NATO extraction force of 2,000 European
soldiers is based in Macedonia.

<P>
   Albanian loyalties have been divided between the Kosovo
Liberation Army, armed through Albania by a financial support
network in Europe and the United States, and moderates led by
Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian nationalists view Kosovo, where the Serbs suffered a
historic defeat against the Turks in 1389, as holy ground.
Milosevic used the 600th anniversary of the battle to mobilize
support for the nationalist cause a decade ago, telling a million
Serbs at the site that they would never again be victimized.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO decision would reactivate plans for both immediate,
limited warning strikes and a wider ``phased air campaign'' that
could hit Serb air defense sites and other military targets not
only in Kosovo but also elsewhere in Serbia. Hundreds of planes,
mainly American, and dozens of ships are poised for operations that
could start from bases in Italy and the Adriatic within days.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme allied commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, had authority to begin the bombing in October if Milosevic
refused to withdraw heavily armed police and army units that were
attacking Albanian villages as well as Kosovo Liberation Army
units, and to begin negotiations with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the threat, Milosevic promised to comply, and Clark's
activation orders were suspended. But according to Western
officials, Milosevic did not do what he promised.
</P>
<P>
   After a Serbian attack that killed 45 Albanian civilians in the
village of Racak this month, the United States began mobilizing
international support for stronger action to stop the violence.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright lobbied allied foreign
ministers and went to Moscow to persuade Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov to support a call by the contact group for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright refused to say she would go to the contact group
meeting until she was assured that NATO allies, including France,
would vote to authorize military action.
</P>
<P>
   American negotiators accepted a decision by the Allies Saturday
to leave the primary responsibility for ordering military action
this time in the hands of Solana, a civilian, rather than Clark's.
NATO officials said Solana would consult with allied capitals
before going ahead, but that he would not have to seek a new
alliance decision to order Clark to launch the planes and cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The plans would also allow Solana to order bombing if there was
another major atrocity against civilians, though the threat of
imminent NATO action did not prevent a Serbian police raid on
Friday in which 24 ethnic Albanians were killed in the village of
Rugovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Solana could also give the order if Milosevic
refused to make good on the earlier promises to reduce police and
military forces in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to show our determination to both
parties,'' a French official said. ``The Albanians see time working
in their favor, and the eventual emergence of a greater Albania,
but that is not what the international community wants. We want
substantial autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia for a determined
period of, say, three years, which will allow time to reach a
permanent settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, some Western officials hope, Milosevic could be history
and more moderate Serb leaders might agree to let Kosovo go.
</P>
<P>
   But the other side of the coin is that if the two parties do
agree to come to Rambouillet, American and European peacekeepers
could be stuck in Kosovo for years, as they have been in nearby
Bosnia since the end of 1995.

MEDIATE IS READY TO END A LONG DROUGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ When you have not won a golf tournament in
six years, it is natural to have doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Mediate's last victory on the PGA Tour came in 1993. But
Mediate, who started Saturday as the leader of the Phoenix Open,
insisted he was not looking for a place to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I can win again; I just don't know when,'' said
Mediate, who started Saturday's third round at six-under-par 136
for the tournament, two strokes ahead of Tiger Woods. ``It's been
six years, but a lot of those years, I was hurt and didn't play
much. I just want to play well this weekend, be there on Sunday,
and maybe have a chance to birdie the last hole and win. If I get
in that position, I won't be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Mediate has overcome adversity to return as a factor on
tour. In 1994, he sustained a ruptured disk that required back
surgery and threatened his career. It was a turning point for
Mediate, but he accepted the challenge. Once overweight, he has
lost more than 60 pounds during the last five years, and he now
looks slender at 6 feet 1 inch and 190 pounds. Mediate maintains a
rigorous workout regimen, aimed at preventing back problems. And
while the change in his body forced Mediate to make changes in his
swing, he feels more comfortable than he has in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked a lot in the off season, and I worked on the right
things,'' Mediate said. ``I want to be ready when I come out here.
I feel like it's my job, and I should be ready, or I shouldn't come
out. I'm stronger and hit the ball farther than I've ever hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 36, Mediate feels as if he has some good years
left on tour. But he admits the depth of talent is much greater
than it was when he joined the tour in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players out here today are so good,'' said Mediate, who
has two career tour victories, the 1991 Doral-Ryder Open and the
1993 Kmart Greater Greensboro Open. ``To win, everything has to go
your way, unless you're like David Duval, and kick everybody's tail
by nine strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done anything like that before, but a lot of these
guys have that kind of talent. Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson _ you
can go on and on. Guys come out here ready to win right away.''
</P>
<P>
   But through two rounds at the TPC of Scottsdale, Mediate's
experience and patience had paid off. Historically, the Phoenix
Open has been a birdie-fest, like it was two years ago when Steve
Jones won the tournament at 26 under par. But this year, the rough
has been grown higher, some of the fairways have been narrowed and
some of the tee boxes have been moved back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's playing a lot more difficult,'' Woods said. ``You have to
be careful. The greens are more firm than they were in '97, when I
played here last. And the pins seem to be more tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate agreed, but he was enjoying the challenge. ``It's kind
of U.S. Open-like,'' he said. ``The fairways are wider, but the
rough is tough, and the greens are firm. The course is very
difficult, and it's not going to get any easier. I don't know if
the course is going to let us shoot low scores, but I like it that
way. I think I'll handle it fine. I'm not much for 25 or 30 under
par. I have never shot that low, so I don't expect to.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-round play was suspended on Friday due to darkness, so
Mediate was not certain who his playing partner would be Saturday.
But there was a good chance that Mediate would be paired with
Woods, whose gallery was certain to be boisterous, especially at
the Phoenix Open, known for raucous crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Tiger doesn't bother me at all,'' said Mediate.
``He's a lot of fun to play with. We've had a good time the few
times we played. You can't let other people dictate what you're
doing, or you're going to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be out there with him. I want to feel that. It's
been a long time. Before I got hurt, I was there a lot, in
contention. I didn't win a lot, but I was there a lot. I love that.
I want to be in there and feel nervous, see how I handle it.
Hopefully, I can handle it and survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two rounds, Mediate was right where he wanted to be. And
he hoped that he was two rounds from victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my second tournament of the year, and I didn't know if I
was ready,'' said Mediate. ``I guess I am.''

EDITORIAL: OPEN DOORS IN THE SENATE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 31:
</P>
<P>
   With the final debates and deliberations in President Clinton's
impeachment trial not far off, the television news broadcaster CNN
has rendered an important service by reminding the Senate of its
constitutional duty to conduct the critical remaining portions of
the trial in public.
</P>
<P>
   To date, most of the debate about whether impeachment
proceedings should be open or closed has centered largely on
traditional Senate practices, with too little attention paid to the
constitutional and public-interest arguments raised by Senators Tom
Harkin and Paul Wellstone.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief-like document distributed to all 100 members of the
Senate on Friday, CNN makes a powerful case that when the Senate
confronts the solemn issue of whether to depose a duly elected
President, the First Amendment requires openness.
</P>
<P>
   The application to the Senate _ prepared for CNN by Floyd
Abrams, a lawyer who has also worked for The New York Times on
First Amendment cases _ does not challenge the Senate's power under
Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution to exercise control over
how impeachment trials are conducted. Nor does it dispute that
impeachment debates and deliberations have historically been
conducted in secret.
</P>
<P>
   But it notes that American government and society have changed
since the Senate held closed hearings in the trial of President
Andrew Johnson. Those changes include what Abrams terms the
``architecture'' of free-speech law. Through dozens of rulings over
the past several decades, the Supreme Court has recognized that the
First Amendment extends beyond barring suppression of speech by
individuals or assaults on a free press, to prohibiting government
from arbitrarily preventing citizens from obtaining critical
information about the functioning of their government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer range of proceedings endorsed as open by the Supreme
Court,'' the brief states, ``suggests the importance under the
First Amendment of public observation of the act of doing
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   That is so, even where the proceeding in question had a history
of being closed.
</P>
<P>
   The oath taken by the senators at the start of the trial imparts
a duty to abide by not just the impeachment clause, but the
Constitution as a whole. So far, in all the debates about whether
various proceedings should be open or closed, scant attention has
been paid to First Amendment considerations, which weigh heavily
against closed-door impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   At this important juncture in the trial, the question can no
longer be ignored. This application is a timely and valuable way of
reminding the Senate that any business as important as deciding the
fate of a Presidency must be conducted in full public view.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 31:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Republican leaders are devising plans to
shore up the Social Security system. But neither the president nor
his opponents are saying much about how to rescue Medicare, the
entitlement program that is in deeper fiscal peril and poses even
more unappealing political choices.
</P>
<P>
   Under current trends, Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund,
which pays hospital bills for the elderly and is supported mostly
by payroll taxes, will be depleted by 2012. Clinton's plan to use
roughly $650 billion of the projected $4.4 trillion federal surplus
over the next 15 years to support Medicare may stave off insolvency
for a few more years, but it will not solve the long-term problem
of immense new costs when baby boomers begin needing Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare has
been thrashing out a plan to strengthen Medicare. The 17-member
group is supposed to produce final recommendations by March 1 with
the support of at least 11 members. But the ideological split is
hardening between Republicans who want to cut Medicare costs by
having private health plans compete for Medicare contracts and
Democrats who want to guarantee benefits and expand Medicare
coverage to include prescription drugs. Controlling costs and
improving benefits are not easily reconcilable goals, yet both
sides, when pressed, admit that both reforms are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, chairman of the commission, recently issued a
draft plan that would dismantle traditional Medicare, which
reimburses doctors and hospitals according to a government payment
scale for every service that they perform. Instead, elderly
individuals would be offered a fixed sum to spend as they choose
among private and government-run plans. A federal board would
negotiate with private plans on premiums and benefit packages. The
plan would require some contribution from the elderly, just as they
pay some Medicare premiums now, with higher contributions required
for costlier plans.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to have private plans control costs, but many health
experts say this transformation would produce only modest savings.
Eventually, more money would have to be found to pay for the
existing level of benefits or cuts would have to be made by
limiting eligibility or reducing coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's plan, which has come under criticism from other health
experts in the Senate such as Jay Rockefeller and Edward Kennedy,
is a starting point for discussion. But it is vague on crucial
details. For example, it does not say how far the government should
go in dictating benefits. Setting a strictly defined benefits
package might squelch the flexibility and innovation that private
plans need to control costs while delivering good care. But not
doing so might subject some beneficiaries to inadequate plans that
are cleverly marketed. The Breaux plan does not address drug
coverage. It would reduce overall costs by gradually increasing the
eligibility age for Medicare and charging higher premiums for those
with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are nervous that radical restructuring might produce a
system that is more chaotic and less protective of the poor. The
Medicare system already allows the elderly to opt into private
health maintenance organizations, and about six million
beneficiaries have done so because those plans offer drug coverage
and lower deductibles. But relying on the market means accepting a
lot of flux. Last year, several private managed care plans abruptly
decided to pull out of Medicare because the premiums were not
covering their costs. That left 400,000 beneficiaries scrambling to
find new doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's plan does not adequately address such difficulties or
the problem of private plans using strategies to enroll only
healthy people, leaving the sickest to pay more in a vestigial
government-run program. It is thus unacceptable in its present
form. Still, some shift away from traditional Medicare is
inevitable as the health care system moves ever more deeply into
managed care.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With foreign powers competing for influence
in the soon-to-be-rich lands surrounding the Caspian Sea,
Azerbaijan, potentially the richest of them, has made a startling
offer. It wants the United States to open a military base there.
</P>
<P>
   The offer could give the United States its first permanent
military presence on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Even
if the base does not materialize, the offer suggests that
Azerbaijan, where American oil companies have invested billions of
dollars, is eager for a military partnership with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to giving the United States greater influence in
the Caspian region, any such partnership might draw the United
States into alliances with undemocratic governments.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan's autocratic president, Heydar Aliyev, returned home
Saturday after 13 days in a Turkish military hospital, where he was
being treated for what was described as acute bronchitis. In his
absence, his chief foreign affairs adviser, Vafa Guluzade, has
given interviews asserting that Azerbaijan wants a military
protector.
</P>
<P>
   Guluzade said he was prompted by evidence that Russia is sending
advanced weapons to Armenia, Azerbaijan's neighbor and enemy.
According to Western intelligence agencies, the shipments include
MiG-29 fighter jets as well as the S-300 radar and anti-aircraft
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Azerbaijan is under a big threat from Russia,'' Guluzade said
in an interview. ``They are waiting to use the Armenians to strike
against us. I think Turkish and American military bases would be
welcomed here. I'm not saying they will be here in 20 minutes, but
they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials have not received a formal request for the
opening of a base in Azerbaijan; it may come when Aliyev visits
Washington later this year. Their initial response might be
described as intrigued but cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real American base in Azerbaijan is impractical, especially
since there's no direct threat to American interests there or any
active enemy to defend against,'' said one military planner. ``If
they were to request military assistance or military advisers, that
would be a different thing. There would even be the possibility of
taking over an old Soviet base and using it as a joint American and
Azerbaijani facility. If anything is going to be done out there,
that would probably be the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be a formula similar to that for basing U.S. troops
in Turkey. The largest contingent of American soldiers in the
region is at Incirlik in southern Turkey, but their base is
officially Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the elegant solution to use in Azerbaijan,''
said a Middle Eastern diplomat. ``But however you clothe it, the
Russians certainly wouldn't be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia considers the Caucasus region, all of which was part of
the Soviet Union, as its sphere of influence. It has troops in both
Armenia and Georgia and resents Azerbaijan's unwillingness to
accept them. Russian leaders are also seeking to persuade
Azerbaijan to export the bulk of its oil through a pipeline across
Russian territory, rather than choosing a route across Turkey that
is favored by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan
have become bitter enemies. Russia and Armenia supported a
successful uprising by ethnic Armenians in the Azerbaijani enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990s, and the enclave is still
controlled by ethnic Armenians. No real progress has been made on
settling the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the surprise offer from Azerbaijan, some experts on
Caspian politics had expressed unease at the close ties that are
emerging between Washington and Caspian governments, most of which
have been widely criticized for their corruption and lack of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building up proto-revolutionary situations in this part
of the world,'' the American scholar Martha Brill Olcott warned at
a congressional hearing last year. ``What we are doing is
pussyfooting with a bunch of very corrupt leaders because we don't
want to risk them getting angry at us.''

REAL ESTATE: CO-OPS AND LIABILITY FOR HARASSMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many business owners are aware of the legal and
financial perils of sexual harassment in the workplace and have
taken steps to help prevent it. But co-op and condominium
associations, lawyers say, have generally failed to guard against
the possibility of such claims, despite the fact that some
buildings have many employees.
</P>
<P>
   Two 1998 U.S. Supreme Court decisions, however, along with a
recent New York state Supreme Court ruling on discrimination in
hiring, now make ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination _
and failing to deal with it properly when it occurs _ a risky
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most buildings are unaware of the increased
potential for claims of discrimination and harassment being filed
against them,'' said Richard Siegler, a Manhattan co-op lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler said that one reason sexual harassment in the workplace
has not been a matter of concern for co-ops and condominiums is
because the male-dominated building service workforce makes it less
likely for the most common form of sexual harassment _ male
supervisor and female subordinate _ to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, however, a state Supreme Court Justice in
Manhattan began to chip away at the male domination of the building
service workforce by refusing to dismiss a discrimination complaint
brought by an African-American woman who had been denied a job as a
door person at 13 buildings. The ultimate outcome of the case has
not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Siegler said, the U.S. Supreme Court broadened the
federal sexual harassment laws to include so-called same-sex
harassment. In the case of Oncale vs. Sundowner Offshore Services,
he said, the court found that ``pervasive unwelcome conduct of a
sexual nature'' could constitute sexual harassment even though the
victim and the harassers were all males.
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of Burlington Industries Inc. vs. Ellerth,
Siegler said, the Supreme Court ruled that if a victim of sexual
harassment suffered a ``tangible job detriment'' _ such as being
denied a promotion or a raise _ then the company itself would be
held ``strictly liable'' for the harassment, even if it did not
have knowledge that the offensive behavior was occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that even buildings that have all male employees
can end up defendants in sexual harassment lawsuits,'' Siegler
said. ``And they can be held liable even if there was no knowledge
the harassment was taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Salvatore, a Manhattan labor and employment lawyer, said
that ``the only issue is how big a check you have to write _ and
it's not unusual to find six-figure verdicts in these kinds of
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore added, however, that the court did provide employers
with a defense against strict liability for claims of sexual
harassment. He said that if an employee has suffered no tangible
job detriment, and if the employer has a policy against harassment
and a procedure for dealing with harassment complaints, then the
company would have an ``affirmative defense'' to liability if the
employee did not report the harassment and take advantage of the
complaint procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that employers who are doing the right thing to
prevent and address sexual harassment claims have a defense against
liability,'' Salvatore said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, those employers who do not establish
policies and procedures for dealing with sexual harassment leave
themselves wide open to liability.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Salvatore said, employers _ including co-ops and
condominiums _ can conceivably be held liable for the improper
actions of individuals who are not even direct employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be harassment of a building employee by a vendor, by a
subcontractor, or even by a delivery man who makes regular
deliveries,'' he said. It is even conceivable, he said, that
harassment of a building employee by a shareholder _ who is an
owner of the company _ could constitute actionable sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harassment in the workplace is a minefield for the unwary,''
Salvatore said.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, should co-op and condominium boards do to avoid the
mines? ``The most important thing to do is to take a proactive
approach to discourage harassment and discrimination,'' said Nancy
Smith, a Montclair, N.J., lawyer who specializes in sexual
harassment law. ``And the best way to discourage discrimination and
harassment is through training.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said that all employers should consider hiring
consultants who specialize in training employees to think
differently about sexual, racial and religious discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's important for big companies to train their employees,
it's even more important for co-ops and condominiums to do the
same,'' she said, comparing training to an ``insurance policy''
against harassment lawsuits. ``When big companies lose lawsuits
they have deep pockets to dig into. But when a co-op or condominium
gets hit with a six-figure judgment, it's like the money is coming
from your own family.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegler said that his law firm has been recommending that client
buildings with more than 15 employees adopt a comprehensive policy
against all forms of harassment and discrimination and a procedure
for dealing with complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, he said, should explain that harassment is not
limited to matters of a sexual nature but can include racial,
ethnic or religious slurs or jokes, and even teasing about a
disability. Harassment occurs, he said, when submission to such
conduct is made a term or condition of employment, or rejection of
such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions
affecting an employee, or when the conduct unreasonably interferes
with an individual's performance or creates an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Siegler said, a complaint procedure should be
established so as to encourage employees experiencing harassment or
discrimination both to advise the offender to cease the behavior
and to notify a supervisor if it does not stop. The policy should
also require the supervisor to report the allegation to the
president of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Siegler said, the policy should require that all
complaints be promptly and thoroughly investigated and that
disciplinary action be taken if warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Taranto, president of Taranto &AMP; Associates, a Manhattan
management company, said that her company has gone one step further
to protect itself and its clients against claims of harassment and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling everybody to take out discrimination insurance,''
Ms. Taranto said, explaining that her company recently purchased $1
million in such coverage from Chubb Insurance for an additional
premium of about $5,000 a year. ``It's worth it. Discrimination and
harassment suits are becoming rampant. Everybody seems to have
something to sue about.''

&HT;        SANTORUM SAYS WITNESSES NEEDED IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 29, -- Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Rick
Santorum said witness testimony in President Clinton's impeachment
trial was crucial to helping him make up his mind about the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need that information,'' Santorum said. ``I want to have as
complete a record as possible. We have an obligation to bring this
case to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum's reaction came after a tumultuous week in the Senate
that ended with the preparation of subpoenas for Monica Lewinsky,
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, and the president's friend
Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected a motion to close debate and vote on the
verdict. It approved a Republican-backed plan providing a rough
outline for what could be the last two weeks of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the three witnesses to give depositions.
Then, they could give live or videotaped testimony in front of the
Senate, if approved by a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he thought if the trial had ended without
witnesses, the House impeachment managers would not have had a fair
chance to present their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important the Senate have a trial,'' Santorum
said. ``We need to follow our constitutional mandate to vote on the
articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter would not comment on the trial, but in the past said he
wanted a full trial with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he thought it would have been premature to dismiss
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Though calling witnesses will prolong the trial, Santorum and
Specter have said they will still manage to focus on other issues
including reforming Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Specter has said that the Senate's schedule isn't
full in January and February. He said work hasn't stopped on other
topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security issue is the number one domestic issue
which has to be resolved,'' Specter said. ``We've been working on
it simultaneously while the impeachment proceedings have been going
on.''

A ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE DUDLEY IS READY TO ROLL FOR KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chris Dudley clamped the rebound between his hands,
and using his elbows like a machete, cleared the space around him
Friday night. Along the way, he caught the Nets' Keith Van Horn
right in the goatee.
</P>
<P>
   As Van Horn checked his jaw alignment, you wondered if the
spirit of Charles Oakley had moved Dudley to display that kind of
rebounding form and technique in the Knicks' exhibition loss in New
Jersey. But this is Dudley. Always has been.
</P>
<P>
   In his 11 years in the NBA, he has defied his genteel Yale
pedigree _ one that includes his grandfather Guilford Dudley, the
former ambassador to Denmark _ by bashing and thrashing with
blue-collar appeal in the paint. While Oakley has been banished to
Toronto, Dudley survives him as the Knicks' intimidator.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be as feared as Oakley, but Dudley presents a prickly
thicket of sharp elbows around the basket. Van Horn knows that now
as the caretaker of a fat lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that little Charles wasn't old enough to see
that one,'' said Dudley, who was called for a flagrant foul on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   Little Charles is 3{ months old, and the firstborn of Dudley and
his wife, who is also named Chris. Little Charles is the reason
Dudley rolled out of bed at 3 a.m. to help with the feedings during
the lockout. He is also the reason Dudley started his rigid
workouts just three hours later every morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get up at 6 a.m. anyway,'' Dudley said. So he forced
himself out of the house in San Diego and went through extensive
flexibility exercises, hit the weight room, worked on his game and
ran with a former Marine.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a very fit 34-year-old who arrived at training
camp in excellent shape after signing a four-year, $28 million deal
to be Patrick Ewing's support system. Dudley was pressed into a
29-minute performance on Friday when Ewing left with a mildly
sprained right knee during the second quarter. It's unclear how
long Ewing will be out, but whatever practice or playing time he
misses will be absorbed by Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dudley spent part of the off season tinkering with an
offensive game that has never wowed anyone, he reverted to what he
does best Friday night and ended the final exhibition tuneup with
13 rebounds and 4 points (1 of 6 from the field, 2 of 8 from the
free-throw line).
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to work on their weaknesses in the off
season,'' said Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who watched Dudley take an
uncharacteristic 5 shots and grab just 2 rebounds in 17 minutes
during the Knicks' first exhibition game on Wednesday. ``He's tried
to keep developing his offensive game. But sometimes you forget who
you are. He had more shots than rebounds in the last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the team played well with Dudley on the floor. Before
back trouble put him on the injured list in February, his role as a
defender allowed Allan Houston and Larry Johnson to blossom. In
that way, Dudley is a nice fit for the new, more diverse Knicks.
But when Ewing is healthy and conditioned, there is no match for
the impact he can make offensively. Until Ewing's injury heals and
his form returns, Dudley has shown he can be an effective
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays very hard,'' Van Gundy said. ``You know what you're
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have paid handsomely to get it. Dudley's lucrative
deal was the payoff for the risk he took last year. Passing up a
three-year, $18 million offer from Detroit, Dudley dived through a
loophole in the former collective bargaining agreement by
re-signing with Portland for just over $1 million to facilitate a
sign-and-trade deal with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   After a touch-and-go negotiating process before training camp
two weeks ago, the Knicks came up with a contract to make up for
his sacrifice. Dudley had offers from other teams, Buck Williams
was about to retire, and the Knicks had just sent Terry Cummings to
Golden State in the Latrell Sprewell deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little apprehensive when it looked like things might
not work out here,'' Dudley said. ``But on the other hand, I don't
know, I was kind of at peace with it. I had some money because I'd
been in the league for a while, and I wasn't worried. I know it's a
saying that you put it in God's hands, but that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley just wants to perform. And do it in a way that will
conjure Oakley's image from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's added pressure, but I do want to step in
and help out in Oakley's loss,'' Dudley said. ``I don't know if I
have to do more. I think I've always been an aggressive player. I'm
not trying to change my game.''

GEORGE L. MOSSE, AUTHORITY ON NAZI GERMANY, DIES AT 80  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Israel, Germany, Wisconsin, Great Britain, Cal., Pa.
Mass.)  By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George L. Mosse, a retired University of Wisconsin historian who
was an authority on European fascism and Hitler's Germany, died on
Jan. 22 in his home in Madison, Wis. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Mosse was selected to be the first scholar-in-residence at the
Holocaust Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He was praised in 1970 by Gordon Craig, a professor at Stanford
University and then the dean of American historians of Germany, for
his book ``Germans and Jews: The Right, the Left, and the Search
for a `Third Force' in Pre-Nazi Germany'' (Fertig, 1970).
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times Book Review, Ms. Craig said Mosse had cast
``much light on the characteristic attitudes of rightist
intellectuals'' and showed how it was possible for some of them
``to shut their eyes to Hitler's brutalities.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Mosse also had revealed ``the desperate nature of
the search'' by Jews in Germany in the three decades before Hitler
came to power in 1933 ``for a means of integration with a society
that rejected them, desperate because in some cases it led to their
adoption of the ideology and elitism of their most virulent
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosse, who pronounced his name MOSS-ee, served as both the John
C. Bascom Professor of European History and the Weinstein-Bascom
Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin, whose
faculty he joined in 1955. He was also the Koebner Professor of
History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He retired from all
three posts in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier book that Mosse edited and for which he wrote an
introduction, ``Nazi Culture: Intellectual, Cultural and Social
Life in the Third Reich'' (1966, he described what happened to
cultural life in Germany after Hitler became dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The impact varied, with some areas hardly touched. But some
academic fields were eliminated or died off, because most people
working in those areas had to flee Germany.
</P>
<P>
   That work was praised by Walter Laqueur, then director of the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Contemporary History (The Wiener
Library) in London, as ``a very illuminating new source book.''
</P>
<P>
   A significant essay by Mosse, ``Toward a General Theory of
Fascism,'' was also first published in 1966. It appealed for more
comparative studies of fascism and for more far-reaching research
on the subject. That call, as Frederick Ludwig Carsten, a historian
of Central Europe, observed in 1981, was heeded by younger
political scientists and historians.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980's Mosse wrote about the broader impact on cultural
life in Europe of World War I, the Holocaust and other cataclysms.
A Princeton historian of modern Europe, Anson Rabinbach, said that
Mosse's book ``Nationalism and Sexuality'' (Fertig, 1985) ``is a
path-breaking study of how stereotypes like `healthy' and
`degenerate' and `normal and abnormal' underlay what became the
persecution of Europe's Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies and the
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosse wrote more than two dozen books, and his other writings
included reviews in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   The many honors he received included the American Historical
Association's award for scholarly distinction and the Leo Baeck
Medal.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Berlin and was a grandson of Rudolf Mosse, the
publisher of the liberal Berlin newspaper The Berliner Tageblatt.
The Nazis denounced the Mosse family, shut the newspaper and forced
the family, which was Jewish, to flee Germany in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   After some years in Britain, George Mosse came to the United
States and earned a bachelor's degree in 1941 from Haverford
College and a doctorate in 1946 from Harvard. During his academic
career he also taught at the University of Iowa, Cornell, Cambridge
University and Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his partner, John Tortorice, of Madison, and
by a niece, Joy Mosse of Beverly Hills, Calif.

BANKING ON SUPER BOWL T HELP FEED THE HUNGRY

   COLUMBA, S.C. _ Children do not go to bed hungry in the fine
homes of suburban Spring Valley's cul-de-sac neighborhoods. But
hunger is on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday they will show it.
</P>
<P>
   At dozens of churches in Spring Valley and Columbia, and
thousands more around the United States, teen-agers will stand at
the exits, soup pots in hand, collecting money for people who have
far less than they. They call it the Souper Bowl, playing off one
of America's most conspicuous days of consumption, Super Bowl
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 10th year, the Souper Bowl has raised more than $4.4
million for the poor and the hungry. Last year, 8,577 churches took
part in 50 states, raising $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Souper Bowl started at the Spring Valley Presbyterian Church
when a young intern, Brad Smith, prayed on Super Bowl Sunday for
parishioners to remember ``those without even a bowl of soup to
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, after Smith earned a divinity degree and
returned as the 900-member church's youth pastor, the empty soup
bowl image came back to him. He discussed it with members of the
church's youth group, and they came up with the idea of asking each
person in church on Super Bowl Sunday for $1 and a can of food.
Church members told their friends, who told their pastors, leading
22 churches in the area to take part that first year. They raised
$5,700.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the young people created fliers publicizing the
Souper Bowl. They added 124 more churches around the state and
collected five times the amount. In three years the Souper Bowl had
spread to churches beyond South Carolina, largely by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The money and food go to food banks, soup kitchens, homeless
shelters and local branches of Habitat for Humanity in thousands of
communities throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In New York last year, 375 churches took part, raising $76,853.
In New Jersey, 186 churches raised $43,366 and in Connecticut, 58
churches raised $11,765.
</P>
<P>
   Each church's youth group decides where to donate the money
collected. Advance sign-up is not required. Church leaders can _
and have _ decided to take part on Souper Bowl morning, by
gathering soup pots and announcing the collection at the worship
service. All Smith asks is that someone from each church call his
toll-free number that afternoon to report how much was collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contemporary church can throw its hands up, fight it or
pretend it's not there,'' Smith said recently of the materialistic
trappings of football's biggest game. ``Or we can acknowledge that
football transcends many things in our society, and we can use that
for good.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL itself has jumped on the Souper Bowl bandwagon. Several
teams, among them the Denver Broncos, the Super Bowl champions who
will defend their title on Sunday, have made public service
announcements for the Souper Bowl. Campbell's Soup has promoted the
event in its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the number of churches participating grew by 60
percent, while the cash collected increased by 54 percent. Smith
believes the program's growth and its attractiveness to young
people lies with the fact that it is simple and it has integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Smith said his pride in today's young people had
swelled. Despite all the tales of troubled children, what Smith
says he sees in his own church and what he gleans in telephone
calls from around the nation is that young people are committed to
improving their world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our young people are bombarded with messages of hopelessness
and despair and yet every one of them is created in the image of
God and can make a difference,'' he said. ``They give, they care
for others, they are good stewards.''

SUNY AND REGENTS FIELD FLOOD OF CALLS ABOUT CHARTERS FOR SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The phone calls are already coming in, 50 or 60 a
week, to the State University of New York and the state Department
of Education, asking what it takes to start a charter school.
</P>
<P>
   A state law, passed last month, authorizes the university and
the Board of Regents to grant 50 charters each for new schools. In
addition, the Regents can approve an unlimited number of
conversions of existing public schools. The charter schools will be
publicly financed but will be run by teachers, parents and
community groups, independent of their local districts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the university nor the Regents are prepared to take
applications yet, but they are working together to develop
application forms, to set policy and to formulate a joint grant
request to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to have a draft of an application form in February,
for discussion. In the meantime, they suggest that potential
applicants look at application forms from Florida, New Jersey and
Massachusetts, to get an idea of what they might require.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY and the state both say that, in talking to officials in
other states, they have learned that it does not pay to rush.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, for example, issued five charters in three months, said
Scott W. Steffey, a SUNY vice chancellor who is heading the
university's new Charter Schools Institute, and officials in
Florida said that if they could do it again, they would not do it
so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they would have taken a year to 18 months,'' Steffey
said. ``We have the benefit of learning from their mistakes, and
will not move so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Kadamus, a deputy commissioner at the state Department
of Education, said it was possible that a few charter schools would
open as soon as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who are very far along, and have filled
out other application forms and have found financial backing,'' he
said. ``It is conceivable we could have people ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadamus and his department will brief the Regents on charter
school progress at their meeting this week. Steffey reported on his
progress at SUNY's board meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   Steffey said he thought the typical approval process might take
six to nine months and include three phases: a written application
and interview; a contracting stage in which the university would
scrutinize the contracts a school intended to sign with teachers,
transportation companies, food vendors, testing companies and
others; and a preopening phase for ironing out final details, like
a certificate of occupancy for the space the school will use.
</P>
<P>
   But Steffey also suggested that potential applicants might seek
advice from groups that have been created around the country to
help develop charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the university and the Board of Regents have many
decisions yet to make, some policies have been established by the
new state law:
</P>
<P>
   Charters will be granted for five years but can be revoked for
cause, either by the university or by the Regents.
</P>
<P>
   A charter school cannot base admission on intellectual ability
or achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Schools intended for disadvantaged students are to get
preference.
</P>
<P>
   A school must have at least 50 students to qualify for a
charter. If it has fewer than 250 students, it will not be bound by
union agreements. But the university is allowed to grant 10
exemptions, so up to 10 schools can exceed 250 students and still
not be bound by union rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Board of Trustees is responsible for approving and
monitoring university charter schools and will probably set up an
oversight committee, the university's Charter Schools Institute
will handle most of the work. The institute is also intended to
conduct research on charter schools and other education issues, and
to serve as a national clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Aceto, president of SUNY's Faculty Senate, recently
expressed his dismay over Steffey's appointment as head of the
institute, saying that his career had been in marketing, not
education, and that he had no experience working in primary or
secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to newspapers, Aceto added that the Steffey
appointment was not a result of a national search, but of a
decision to select ``someone with no qualifications who is one of
their `own.''' Steffey declined to respond to such criticism, other
than to note his experience as an executive at Nynex.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of SUNY's academic affairs committee earlier in
mid-January, the chairwoman, Candace de Russy, asked Steffey how
the university would define and insure quality in charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   He said that those were among the questions the institute had
yet to answer. ``The whole question of how to make them accountable
but leave them free from reregulation is an extraordinarily
significant issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Badillo, vice chairman of the City University of New
York, who was a guest at the recent SUNY committee meeting, asked
whether City University could start a charter school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just submit an application,'' Steffey responded.

REAL ESTATE: HOW TO BUILD IN NEW YORK WITH A FIRM FOUNDATION
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a child William Bellafatto played with toy trucks.
Now he is 31 and running a 175,000-pound hydraulic excavator that
is gouging the earth for a project ponderously named the Flushing
Bay Combined Sewer Overflow Retention Facility. Every time he
drives the machine's claw into the ground, the bucket pulls up 7
tons of soil. Trucks haul it away.
</P>
<P>
   This repetitive routine off College Point Boulevard in Flushing
started in October and will continue until March. It is preparing
the site for an underground tank that can hold 28.4 million gallons
of overflow from the city's combined storm and sanitary disposal
system if heavy rain makes it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Bellafatto is operating his rig in a hole that is 7 acres large
and 20 feet deep, heading to a depth of 35 feet over most of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty easy work,'' he said. ``On other jobs you've got
to dig and shore, dig and shore, dig and shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Other jobs are not so simple, and there are a lot of them at
present. In Manhattan, to dig and shore is the rule rather than the
exception. There are holes in Manhattan of all diameters and
depths, reflecting the varying sizes of sites, the scale of new
buildings and the changing level of rock that must be reached to
provide secure footings.
</P>
<P>
   There is more foundation work going on, in fact, than at any
time since the middle '80s, the contractors say, and more
construction work in general. Raymond G. McGuire, general counsel
of the Contractors Association of Greater New York, said that his
members were in construction on 150 residential or commercial
buildings in the five boroughs, and that 85 more would start within
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more work than they've had since 1988,'' he said. The
council represents major high-rise construction companies,
responsible for building 75 percent of new high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Estate Board of New York reported that permits for new
privately owned residential units in Manhattan increased last year
for the fourth year in a row, surpassing 9,000 units for the first
time since 1989. The figure is well below the 25,335 new privately
built units of 1985, however.
</P>
<P>
   The level of activity has put construction workers much in
demand. In excavation work, experienced heavy-equipment operators,
with overtime, are able to earn $80,000 to $100,000 a year. ``But
in the '70s, guys were making about $15,000 a year,'' Bellafatto
said.
</P>
<P>
   The dig in Flushing may be straightforward, but those in
Manhattan are not. They are complicated by the fact that new
structures are often replacing old buildings, which may have
replaced still older buildings. Neighboring buildings, as well as
ongoing underground activities like train service, must be
protected and sustained while a new foundation is built.
</P>
<P>
   It is in Manhattan, also, that variable rock conditions create
the most unusual variations in excavation and foundation work from
site to site. Reaching the bedrock that can carry the heavy load of
skyscrapers may require deep drilling or pile-driving. The bracing
of side structures, to prevent collapse, becomes a high art. The
protection of underground systems _ the subways, the utility lines
_ is an overriding concern.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago 50 cars were crushed in a cave-in of the
walls of an underground parking garage at the Seward Park co-op at
Clinton and Grand Street. No one was hurt. The cause of the
collapse has not been determined by the Department of Buildings. It
will take several months to complete the investigation, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction managers, engineers and consultants who work on
building foundations say that each job is different, with its own
set of challenges. Everything depends on what lies beneath the
surface, which is usually known, up to a point, before the digging
starts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest current challenges faces E.E. Cruz &AMP; Co.
Inc., the Holmdel, N.J., contractor that is building the tunnel
portion of the light rail system that will connect John F. Kennedy
International Airport with the subway and rail station in Jamaica,
Queens. It is expected to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rail line will run above ground, over the median
strip of the Van Wyck Expressway. But it will also run through an
$80-million mile-long tunnel, currently being built by the ``cut
and cover'' method under two taxiways, two highway bridges and
three on-off ramps of the expressway.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors are excavating as deep as 44 feet, through a
water table that in some places is only 5 feet below the surface.
Seventy-five workers on a two-shift schedule are laboring in a cut
that is 100 feet wide, 1,000 feet long and 25 feet deep. Three huge
excavating machines and half a dozen smaller track excavators work
in the hole, supported by a complement of bulldozers and dump
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   All this has to be done, said Joseph F. Malandro, a divisional
vice president of E.E. Cruz, without disturbing airport operations
or disrupting the gas, electrical or communications systems that
lie underground. ``It's difficult,'' Malandro said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The work has given a Boston subcontractor, Trevi-Icos Inc., a
chance to show its stuff in New York. Boston has had an upsurge in
public construction on and near its waterfront, and Trevi-Icos has
grown adept at installing a watertight ``grout blanket,'' a
cement-like seal in the shape of a deep U, 80 feet wide at the
bottom. It keeps the dug-out space dry while workers build the
tunnel, a section at a time. The blanket is sunk to depths ranging
from 50 to 90 feet. A pump at the bottom pumps out water during the
descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sinking a highball glass in a lake,'' Malandro said.
The water is pumped into a storm sewer and winds up in Jamaica Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At the Flushing site, conditions are quite different. Excavation
goes on over a wide area, with various soil constituents _ sand,
clay, peat and fill _ layered within.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remove the material in layers,'' said Charles J.
Montalbano, the project manager for E.E. Cruz, whose joint-venture
partners in the job are NAB Construction of College Point, Queens,
and Frontier-Kemper Constructors, of Evansville, Ind. The sides of
the site are braced with 425 concrete caissons sunk as much as 100
feet into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no more dramatic illustration of the variation in
ground conditions in Manhattan and the contrast in foundation
structures they call for is to be found than at York Avenue between
71st and 72nd Streets. There Urban Foundation/Engineering, of East
Elmhurst, Queens, had the job of installing supports for a
six-story addition over Sotheby's headquarters, which is in a
former garage building.
</P>
<P>
   Underground rock on the York Avenue side of the property starts
at a depth of only 5 feet, providing a fine footing for the
existing building. But the rock drops almost vertically on the east
side of the property. Over two months, Urban Foundation drilled as
deep as 30 feet from the building's loading platform on 71st Street
to reach bedrock. The drills created a hole in the soil and the
rock below for the concrete caissons that support the added weight
of the structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like adding legs under a table,'' said Bernard F.
Langan, president of Langan Engineering and Environmental Services,
of Elmwood Park, N.J., which acted as the geotechnical consultant
on the project.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the legs are created by hammering piles of timber,
concrete or steel into place rather than by drilling holes for
caissons. Pile driving is noisy and generates much vibration, which
can disturb abutting buildings or underground activity. ``But it's
cheaper, and if you're far enough away from existing buildings,
it's feasible,'' said Andrew J. Cianci, vice president of Langan
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   To determine ground conditions before excavation, Langan uses a
drill with a bit 2 inches in diameter, made of industrial-grade
diamond. The barrel of the drill draws out rock in cylindrical
pieces about 5 feet long, or sometimes less. ``The bigger the piece
the better the quality of the rock,'' said Langan. The rock that
can hold Midtown skyscrapers is hard, intact micaschist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Times Square area, Urban Foundation is the subcontractor
for the excavation currently under way for the 3 Times Square
project, on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd streets. Tishman
Real Estate and Construction, in partnership with Rudin Management,
is building the 32-story office tower as the North American
headquarters of Reuters, the British information services company.
A hole 32 feet deep on a site of 32,000 square feet is being dug
through the old foundations of demolished buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rock is good,'' said Melvin Febish, chairman of Urban
Foundation. ``The old basements were 10 feet down and we're going
down another 20 feet for the new basement level.'' The rock
underneath is capable of carrying a load of 40 tons per square
foot. With that bearing capacity, no piles or caissons are
required.
</P>
<P>
   Three busy streets, a subway underneath and two historic
buildings surround the site. Contractors say they are replacing
``poor'' rock with ``good'' rock _ that is, concrete in place of
weathered schist _ under the foundations of the abutting buildings
to prevent them from settling during and after the excavation
process.
</P>
<P>
   At sites that are nearer the rivers in Manhattan, caissons or
piles are usually required. And on many narrow and deep sites, the
bracing system to protect neighboring properties and streets during
construction is intricate.
</P>
<P>
   At Third Avenue and 65th Street, HRH Construction Corp. is
building a 34-story 94-unit condominium for the Related Cos. on
property once occupied by the Sign of the Dove restaurant. It is a
narrow hole, only 120 feet wide along the avenue and 84 feet long
on 65th Street, with older buildings abutting the site on the
western and northern sides.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concrete footings, the building will rest on a huge
concrete slab, called a mat, that is 4 feet thick, said Anthony
Rafaniello Jr., the project superintendent for HRH Construction.
The mat rests on rock 40 feet below street level. The depth of the
dig will provide two subcellars, one of them to be used for
parking.
</P>
<P>
   Every 9 feet on their descent to that level the foundation
subcontractor, LaQuila Construction of Brooklyn, sinks angled steel
rods into the foundation of abutting buildings to brace them
against collapse. The rods ring the hole and will stay in place
when the new foundation walls go up.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On West End Avenue between 64th and 65th streets, Tishman Speyer
Properties is excavating for the foundation of an apartment house
that will have two towers 33 stories tall above a 12-story base,
and 507 apartments plus retail space. It is to go on the market
next spring for occupancy starting in late spring.
</P>
<P>
   It is a large site _ 28,000 square feet _ with a hole already
dug to its 26-foot depth across the entire plot. A portion of a
former New York Times printing plant occupied the land until its
demolition in the 1970s. ``Our foundation will be slightly
shallower than the foundation of the Times building,'' said Allen
Dzbanek, senior director of Tishman Speyer, ``but we're able to
make use of the sub-sub cellar depth for parking.'' There will be
three levels of parking for 225 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor will punch holes through the slab at the base of
the old Times building to create footings for the new building on
the rock below. Though slabs and columns of the old building were
demolished and removed, parts of the old walls will be re-used;
they must be pinned to rock until the new superstructure goes in.
The pinning is done with steel bars 35 feet long and an inch and
three eighths in diameter, drilled through the old walls and into
rock every 20 feet from the footing to the first-floor level of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The excavation and foundation contractor is Civetta Cousins, a
Bronx-based company. Just this month Civetta Cousins began
excavating on the north side of 52nd Street east of Fifth Avenue
for the new Austrian Cultural Institute, which Barney Skanska
Construction Co., as construction manager, is building for the
Austrian government. It will be a 22-story building with 28,000
gross square feet of space, replacing a five-story building that
the institute formerly occupied. Raimund Abraham of Manhattan is
the architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough, tight job,'' said Nick Roselli, general
supervisor of Civetta Cousins. ``We've got to go down 30 feet on a
site only 25 feet wide.'' The bottom 10 feet is rock, the base of
the new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In Battery Park City, which was built over fill, piles are
driven about 100 feet to reach bedrock to support the foundation.
There are thousands of old timber piers lying at all angles in that
fill, contractors say, and there is a high possibility of smacking
into them when the piles are driven. ``Old maps are invaluable in
finding them before you dig,'' said Cianci. When the old timbers
are found, the piles are designed to try to avoid them, or if need
be, drill through them.
</P>
<P>
   An 18th-century map had forewarned builders of the presence of a
cemetery for Colonial-era blacks under ground at Broadway between
Duane and Reade Streets where the federal government was building
an office building in 1991. The skeletal remains of 427 bodies were
dug out by trowel at a depth of 20 feet. They will be re-interred
at a memorial site on Duane Street after bio-anthropological
studies at Howard University are completed, the General Services
Administration said. The project is expected to be completed in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   But maps do not tell all. No maps warned the Icos Corp. of
Engelwood, N.J., that it would come upon four cannon from British
vessels of the 1680s and 1730s when it was digging near the East
River for the Financial Square office building that Howard Ronson,
a British developer, was building at Old Slip in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were found on the fifth day of excavation and they were
drawn up slowly in steel caskets,'' said George J. Tamaro, the
senior partner in Mueser Rutledge, the Manhattan engineering firm
that was the foundation consultant on the project. The cannons
eventually came into the possession of the South Street Seaport
Museum, which has in its collection over 2 million items that have
been recovered in lower Manhattan excavations, said Peter Neill,
president of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Mueser Rutledge has been advising builders about foundation
construction since 1910. On the wall in its offices at 708 Third
Ave. are geological maps dating from 1865 and 1898 that illustrate
the soil composition in Manhattan from its northern tip to its
southern toe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major changes in foundation construction since 1996,
said Tamaro, has been brought about by the need to comply with New
York City's new seismic-code requirements. The code will mainly
change foundation specifications in areas lacking hard rock close
to the surface _ in most of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island, and
certain areas of Manhattan and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Already affected are new emergency medical services facilities
that are being developed by the city, engineers say. These are
light one-story buildings in which ambulances and other medical
vehicles are garaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some locations they will have to be built on piles rather
than shallow footings to meet the code's requirements,'' said
Cianci of Langan Engineering. The cost of foundation work, which
would have been about $200,000 for a building of 7,000 square feet
in the past, will about double, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If that means more work, Bill Greer won't be disappointed. He is
the 56-year-old head of the operating engineers crew from Local 14
at the Flushing excavation, a man who has run cranes, backhoes,
pile drivers and more for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's a big boon for us, all this work,'' he said.
``It's really great.''

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IS WARMING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., N.J., Ariz.)  (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The campaigning for president never really ends
in New Hampshire, home of the United States' first primary for the
better part of half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, who
finished third in the Republican contest in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of a few hours, not a few years, he was back, at
least in spirit. Bumper stickers in plaid (his campaign color
scheme) began appearing the morning after the primary, each
brightly emblazoned with ``2000!''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Alexander himself reappeared, working _ and
networking _ to get the Republican nominee, Bob Dole, elected. Then
just a few weeks after the fall election, he began returning on his
own, once again trudging about in search of votes and campaign
money, his eye now locked on February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has since become such a dogged fixture in New
Hampshire coffee shops, Rotarian meetings, high school civics
classes and such that the political quip of the moment is that he
should be paying New Hampshire taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same could be said of Steve Forbes, the publisher, who
finished fourth in the 1996 Republican primary. He, too, was back
on the trail in a matter of months and has since created something
of a permanent political presence in the Granite State, matching
Alexander almost visit for visit and, like Alexander, running some
of the earliest ads ever seen anywhere in primary campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But the days when Alexander and Forbes can claim New Hampshire
as their own little political playground are about to end. With the
2000 primary now little more than a year off, the rest of the
presidential wannabes, who for the most part have made only
scattered forays to New Hampshire and even fewer forays to other
states, are beginning to gear up for concentrated campaigning here.
</P>
<P>
   All the talk that they might bypass the New Hampshire primary or
the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses seems so far to be nothing
more than just talk. Oh, March 7 still looms as the most important
day of the season, with primaries in close to a dozen states,
including delegate-rich California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But no presidential hopeful has yet been so bold as to say that
New Hampshire and Iowa can now be ignored, that the early bounce
they have given winners no longer counts for much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other states keep rushing forward to be among the first to
hold their primaries, but candidates still look upon us as the
first of the first,'' said New Hampshire's chief election official,
Secretary of State William Gardner. ``Delaware is trying to steal
some of our thunder by scheduling their primary within four days of
ours instead of the usual week. But otherwise we haven't seen any
real signs that 2000 will be any different than other years for us,
and if we do we'll fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was, then, that on Monday, Bill Bradley, the former New
Jersey senator and onetime New York Knicks star, arrived here for
his first real campaign outing of the year, trailed by a crush of
political reporters and live-at-6 TV teams, many from out of state.
More than anything that Bradley, a Democrat, said or did, that
clamoring gaggle of scribes and anchor people served notice that
Election 2000 was genuinely under way.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Vice President Al Gore will be in the state, not his
first trip but his first in this new phase of Election 2000 and one
meant to shore up his considerable lead in the polls, given the
Bradley challenge.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, three potential candidates are visiting
in the next two weeks: Alexander in still another foray, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona in his first visit in months and Elizabeth Dole
in her first trip here since resigning as president of the American
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain and a number of others, Dole, whose husband is Bob
Dole, is ``exploring'' whether to run at this point, but in the
parlance of presidential politics that essentially is a euphemism
for a test run or a marketing trial.
</P>
<P>
   So how is the field faring thus far?
</P>
<P>
   The latest New Hampshire polls, which should carry a ``Use At
Your Own Risk'' label this early on, have Gore comfortably ahead on
the Democratic side, with only Bradley daring to challenge to date.
On the Republican side Mrs. Dole and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
appear evenly matched, with the rest of the field trailing badly,
including the earliest starters, Alexander and Forbes, as well as
former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Democratic Party officials, Gore is exceptionally
well positioned in New Hampshire, not just because he is so well
financed but because over the years the Clinton administration has
worked the state with great care.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, faces the daunting task of starting
from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Republican presidential aspirants in New Hampshire,
announced or otherwise, Alexander probably has the most extensive
political operation at this point, followed by Forbes. Both also
are well financed, especially Forbes because of his great personal
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   But party officials say that Mrs. Dole, Bush and Quayle are in
telephone contact with supporters across the state and that either
could be up and running with a strong organization in short order,
mainly because each has visited the state many times in earlier
campaigns, Quayle as the No. 2 on the Republican ticket, Mrs. Dole
to campaign for her husband, and Bush to campaign for his father,
the former president. The party officials also foresee no money
problems in the state for any of the three.
</P>
<P>
   For the other announced and unannounced Republican aspirants,
among them McCain, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, Gary Bauer of the
Family Research Council and Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire,
money and a strong campaign organization may be harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   But none are being counted out, given the quirky nature of the
state's politics: Many primaries over the years have turned on an
obscure issue or event that suddenly burst on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance that Smith could become a ``favorite son,'' thereby
scaring off the other candidates?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not likely,'' says Stephen Duprey, the state Republican
chairman. ``The field is too strong for that, especially if Dole
and Bush jump in. In fact, I think the best bet at this point is
that we could have a field of at least eight candidates, one of the
largest ever. And if we do, we're going to have a real cat fight,
one that could have a surprise ending because the vote could be so
terrifically fragmented.''

UTAH POLITICIANS SAY THEY ASKED ABOUT BID `IMPROPRIETIES'
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In the late summer or early fall of 1997, more
than a year before the Olympic bribery allegations emerged that
have since shaken this state to its core, two of Utah's senior
state politicians invited the president of the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee, G. Frank Joklik, to a get-acquainted meeting at the
state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians were concerned. They had heard reports _ rumors,
really, they said _ about what the then-speaker of the House of
Representatives, Melvin R. Miller, termed ``improprieties,'' in
Salt Lake's conduct during the competition for the 2002 Winter
Games, which Salt Lake had captured in 1995. So they said they
asked Joklik, who had recently replaced Thomas K. Welch as
president of the Organizing Committee, what he could tell them
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated that that happened when Mr. Welch was in charge,
and had nothing to do with him and was out of his purview,'' Miller
said. And that was pretty much the end of the conversation, Miller
recalled. Since he and the Senate president, Lane Veattie, had only
hearsay and rumors of what had gone on, they had no way to follow
up on their questions. ``You obviously had no basis on which you
could challenge Mr. Joklik's position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting has become even more loaded with meaning _ at least
in retrospect _ in light of the budget documents that have emerged
about how the Salt Lake Bid Committee had incorporated, as early as
1991, a specific program that included financial assistance to
people who could influence the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games.
The question of knowledge within the committee _ who knew and
understood what the programs included _ has become a central issue
as state, federal and independent investigations into the scandal
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik's attorney, Mark H. Tuohey, said Joklik had not
investigated the concerns raised by the Miller and Veattie because
their concerns were simply too vague. He also said that some rumors
had been floating around at the time about possible use of
prostitutes for International Olympic Committee members, but he
said those rumors had been found to be groundless, and that Joklik
thought that's what the officials were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't, `Look, Frank, we've got problems with this and this
and this,' because he would have looked into that,'' Tuohey said.
``It just wasn't any more specific than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But politicians, business people and residents here say that
that obscure meeting in the office of the Senate president also
illuminates some other unavoidable truths in Salt Lake during and
after the city's race for the Olympic rings: There were rumors,
speculation, hearsay and gossip about the Bid Committee's doings
and the IOC members who were seen being whisked about town. And in
every case those reports ran hard up against a Bid Committee that
had become almost fortress-like in its power and its secrecy and,
many people say, its arrogance as an entity that did not like to be
questioned or challenged. Many residents swept up themselves in the
euphoria over the Olympics, also didn't want to believe what they
had heard and so didn't push.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were reluctant to turn over these rocks,'' said B. Gale
Dick, a retired professor of physics at the University of Utah who
has been a critic and watchdog of the Olympic effort on
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the Salt Lake City council, Deeda Seed, said she
heard about possible tuition payments to IOC family members as
early as 1996, but could not prove anything. She became the City
Council's liaison to the committee last year, but in meetings she
attended, the board never even recognized her to ask a question.
Ms. Seed acknowledged that her position as a potential
whistle-blower was probably hampered by the fact that she had been
critical of the Committee on other issues, and had probably been
stereotyped as a someone looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem was I didn't have confirmation _ it was my word
against theirs,'' she said. But the program of direct payments,
including tuition and living expenses, and even American Express
bills of the children of International Olympic Committee members,
was well underway. Documents including itemized and numbered checks
paid to IOC members' children for college tuition, furniture, rent
and other items, were included in the Bid Committee materials that
have been shown to The New York Times by a person involved in the
bid process concerned that a fuller version of the story be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   The documents specifically show that the programs begun in 1991,
especially the scholarship program, were there and documented
within the Committee's budget documents. Regular checks paid to the
son of the IOC member from Mali for his tuition, room and board at
Howard University, were there along side direct checks paid to the
IOC member from the Republic of Congo, Jean-Claude Ganga. Ganga,
along with five other IOC members, was recommended for expulsion
last week by an IOC report, but he has denied any wrongdoing and
has said he will not resign.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who are or were close to the Olympic campaign now
say that the closed and sometimes high-handed nature of the Bid
Committee had become a symptom of its problems long before the
allegations of vote buying emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, for the example, the City Council from Park City,
a nearby mountain resort town where about 40 percent of the Olympic
events are scheduled to take place, journeyed down to Salt Lake to
lodge a formal protest that the planning was being done without
them, from within the committee's offices. The specific complaint
was the committee budget that had just been finished, without any
consultations, Park City officials complained, from the city that
is almost the Olympic's co-host.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't include us, or any of the venue cities,'' said
Myles Rademan, the public affairs spokesman for Park City. ``They
did it themselves, told us they would consult, but never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Rademan said he told the board members that Park City residents
deserved to know more of what was going on, and to feel that they
had representation. ``We can't run our city the way you run the
Olympics,'' Rademan said he told the board. ``We have a hard time
explaining to our people who you do business with when it's not
open.''

<P>
   Close your eyes, and it feels like Russia all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, the largest economy in its part of the world, seems to
be steering rudderless from crisis to crisis. Its president,
serving his second term, is seeing his international reputation as
a reformer erode. Capital is fleeing and state governments are
defying the central authority by refusing to pay their bills.
Facing fiscal crisis, the government's only solution seems to be to
push interest rates to ridiculously high levels.
</P>
<P>
   So it was in Russia last summer, as that country lurched toward
default. In retrospect, the sign that things were out of control
came when the government was unable to borrow rubles, at least not
without paying stratospheric interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same thing is happening in Brazil, whose national
government last week tried to issue about $420 million worth of
bonds denominated in reals, the local currency, but linked to the
dollar to protect investors. The bonds did not sell, because
bidders were demanding interest rates of up to 35 percent _ about
the market rate that Brazil's own central bank had established in
its desperate effort to support the real.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil finds itself in a classic Catch-22. If it pays such huge
interest rates for very long, the government will go broke or end
up with a worthless currency as the printing presses run overtime.
On the other hand, to get the money it needs without turning on the
printing presses, it must pay such rates.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been widespread speculation that Brazil will
default _ or, to put it in the more restrained terms used in polite
financial circles, restructure its debt. People don't believe
Brazil will honor its promises, so they will not lend money to it.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a couple of years ago that Brazil seemed to be a
beacon of economic success. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had
halted runaway inflation through the introduction of the real, with
a policy of gradual controlled depreciation against the dollar.
Capital was flowing in from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   But the seeds of disaster were hidden in that apparent success.
The president put off many badly needed reforms. Brazil's public
sector is bloated, with too many well-paid employees doing too
little, while there remains great poverty in some areas. The
government's debt grew and the real became overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Then the world changed. Foreign investors, burned in Asia and
Russia, began to flee. Efforts to get Brazil's fiscal house in
order _ efforts that would have been hailed a year earlier _ seemed
to be too little too late and met political resistance.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Brazil _ its coffers filled by what was supposed to be
a reassuring bailout by the International Monetary Fund _ tried to
brazen it out without devaluing the real. When that failed, it
tried a little devaluation, then a bigger one. It said it would let
markets fix the value of the currency, but then intervened. It
pushed interest rates to the sky and then balked at paying such
rates. The real is down 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government and IMF now face the difficult task of trying to
figure out what to do next. There are no guarantees that even
serious fiscal reform will bring investors back.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear what has not worked. High interest rates are
like some drugs: In moderate doses, they can cure, but huge doses
kill. The country must get rates down. If that leads to a further
fall in the real, so be it. That will hurt those who rely on
imported goods. But it will also make Brazil's exports more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   It might be that the real, which now appears undervalued, would
not fall very far, or at least not for very long. Capital is
fleeing because investors fear the government will default. But
many Brazilian stocks have held their international value, as some
investors bet those companies will prosper when things calm down.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Russia, the Brazilian banking system is reasonably
strong. Unlike in Asia, most corporations are not burdened by
foreign currency debt they will be unable to pay after devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   International aid will be needed, both to offset the damage to
the poorest Brazilians and to help some companies that will be in
deep trouble as a result of the local recession and the currency
devaluation. The priority now should be to keep the money available
for those needs _ not for propping up the currency.

END OF DEBATE: HALL OF FAME VOTERS REWARD TAYLOR'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The former Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, considered
by many to be one of the greatest players of all time, was voted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday in his first year of
eligibility, despite the objections of some voters who felt his
history of drug abuse should have kept him out.
</P>
<P>
   Inducted with Taylor were two former Los Angeles Rams _ Eric
Dickerson, a powerful runner who holds the single-season rushing
record of 2,105 yards, and the offensive lineman Tom Mack, who
never missed a game in his 13-year career _ as well as Cleveland
tight end Ozzie Newsome, whose 47 touchdowns are the best at his
position, and the Buffalo offensive lineman Billy Shaw, a dominant
run blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Two finalists, wide receiver Lynn Swann and defensive lineman
Howie Long, were not voted in.
</P>
<P>
   But the nominee who drew by far the most attention in this
year's class was Taylor, the Giants' No. 1 draft pick out of North
Carolina in 1981. Some voters felt it would send a negative message
if Taylor, who has been arrested three times since his retirement
and recently spent time in a drug rehabilitation clinic, was voted
in. It did not help Taylor when, in a conference call with the news
media last week, he appeared to some voters as arrogant and
unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Taylor's remarkable accomplishments on the
field, as well as public pleas from the Giants owner Wellington
Mara, NFL Commissioner Paul Taglibaue and several football writers,
proved to be the determining factors. Taylor needed 29 of 36 votes;
the final tally was not released, but it was believed that there
were at least five members who voted against him.
</P>
<P>
   The voting committee was made up of news media representatives
from all 30 NFL cities, plus five at-large members and the
president of the Pro Football Writers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, in their private meeting to determine the entrants,
the committee will introduce a nominee and spend from six to eight
minutes discussing him. When Taylor's name was introduced Saturday,
several voters said, the committee argued for some 35 minutes, and
then had to move on to other candidates because the discussion
involving Taylor became too contentious.
</P>
<P>
   While the other entrants gave speeches and answered questions
after their names were announced, Taylor did neither, instead
releasing a statement through the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by being elected to the Pro Football Hall of
Fame,'' Taylor said. ``As I have said, I feel like it is the
ultimate reward for playing the game that I love so much and gave
so much. I appreciate the debate and the consideration that was
given my nomination. Ultimately, this honor has to do with how I
played the game. Obviously the majority of the committee felt the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't always come across, but I do appreciate the
well-wishes and concerns of my family, my friends and my former
teammates. It means a great deal to me. It truly does.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor added: ``I want to thank my coaches, especially Bill
Parcells, my teammates, and the Giants' ownership, especially Mr.
Mara. I would not be receiving this honor if it weren't for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor dominated football for most of his career, which lasted
from 1981 to 1993. He went to 10 Pro Bowls, was a three-time
defensive player of the year and was named the league's most
valuable player in 1986. He had 132.5 career sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many think Taylor is one of the top five players in history.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the few who changed the way a position was played.
Using a combination of power, speed and ferociousness, Taylor
terrorized offensive lines. Coach Joe Gibbs of the Washington
Redskins used an ``H-back'' player _ a hybrid of a tight end and an
offensive linemen _ almost specifically to counter Taylor, because
linemen were too slow to block him.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson recalled facing Taylor during his rookie season in
1983. Dickerson said that on one play in that game, the Rams'
coaching staff instructed him not only to block Taylor, but also to
hit him low and cut him down. ``I really didn't want to do that,
but I did,'' Dickerson said. ``When he got up, he looked at me and
said, `Don't you ever cut me again.' I said, `OK'''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor's destruction of offenses on the field was matched by
his self-destructive nature off it. He tested positive for cocaine
use in 1988 and was suspended for four games.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents that put his the Hall of Fame nod in jeopardy came
once his playing days ended. Taylor was most recently arrested last
Oct. 19 for purchasing $50 worth of crack cocaine from an
undercover police officer in a St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., hotel
room. There were 15 crack pipes in the room, the police said.
Taylor claimed he was set up.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Florida arrest, Taylor entered a drug
rehabilitation clinic in New Jersey, with Mara paying about $7,000
for the visit. Taylor said Saturday that he is in an outpatient
rehabilitation program but would not give details.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Taylor thanked Giant fans, who have seemed to
strongly support Taylor despite his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Giants' organization retired my jersey,'' he said,
``I said this then and I'll say it now: There has always been and
will be a Lawrence Taylor, but without the fans, there would have
never been an L.T.''

 &HT;    Shanahan's strategy hits mismatches, weak spots
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When you look into the beady yet steely eyes of a coach
whose team openly refers to him as The Mastermind, you know that
Mike Shanahan is obsessed by this Super Bowl and motivated by the
presence of Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can dodge questions about (Reeves) all he wants, but we
know there is something special about this game for Mike,'' tight
end Shannon Sharpe said. ``Everyone always says that the game will
be decided on the playing field, and maybe that's true. But I know
this much about this game: For the Falcons to win, they're going to
have to beat Mike, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory today will put Shanahan two-up over Reeves in Super
Bowl rings as a head coach. Denver veterans acknowledged privately
over the past week that Shanahan's renewed acrimony with the man
who gave him his first job in the NFL spawned unparalleled
attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reeves, Shanahan is a control freak. His staff offers
little to his offensive plans. But unlike Reeves, whose offensive
bible remains the Tom Landry playbook he inherited more than three
decades ago, Shanahan changes week by week. With assistant head
coach Alex Gibbs, he sets out every game to identify the key
weaknesses in an opponent's defense and then pound away at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think back to last year's Super Bowl and all the yards we got
running left against the Packers,'' guard Mark Schlereth said.
``The thing with Mike is, he'll probe for a while to find your soft
spot. Once he's located it, look out. The same thing happened in
the Miami playoff game this year. We found a weakness and exploited
the heck out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against a defense far better than advertised, the Broncos might
not enjoy many physical advantages, so Shanahan will attempt to
create mismatches. He believes in substitutions, formations and
movement, and they will be apparent early tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of the Denver attack is tailback Terrell Davis, the
former University of Georgia player who rushed for 2,008 yards this
season, but he also will act as a decoy.
</P>
<P>
   The other key for the Broncos will be Sharpe, a difficult
matchup for any defense. The nine-year veteran compensates for the
fact the Denver passing game lacks a viable No. 3 wide receiver to
team with starters Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the Denver script calls for Sharpe to be
used in five different sets on the first seven plays alone. The
Broncos coaches think the Falcons might be counting too much on
their linebackers to help cover Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Broncos get Sharpe involved early, it will open the
run lanes for Davis, who rushed for 366 yards and three touchdowns
in the team's first two postseason victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is like a puppeteer with the offense,'' tackle Harry
Swayne said. ``And he's looking forward to pulling the strings in
this game.''

 &HT;    After the fun, under the gun
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Just because the Atlanta Falcons are playing in the
Super Bowl today for the first time in their 33 years doesn't mean
their game plan is new.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves' preachings are the same as they have been in
each of his 18 years as a head coach in the NFL: Run the ball well,
don't let the other team run the ball well, and don't make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger issue going into today's game as roughly a seven-point
underdog against the Broncos, however, is focus, or perhaps a lack
of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable, although not guaranteed, that it could be a
big factor in preventing the Falcons from becoming the first
first-time Super Bowl participant to upset a defending champion in
the big game.
</P>
<P>
   This team, remarkable in its ability to shut out distractions,
won a franchise-record 11 games in a row. Not even Reeves'
quadruple heart-bypass surgery on Dec. 14 was enough to throw the
train off the tracks. But with players babbling and cavorting this
week, perhaps the breaking point has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' center Robbie Tobeck said. ``As soon
as Morten (Andersen) made that field goal, I was running around the
field, all crazy. Going through all the hard times, the coaching
changes, the losing, the fans really down on you _ it's great to
see the city of Atlanta on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Distractions or not, it all goes back to the plan. Reeves'
formula for success is common in the NFL. But the Falcons have been
uncommonly good in following the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson was the league's No. 2 rusher with
1,846 yards, breaking the century mark 12 times in the final 14
regular-season games. Anderson will have to be more decisive today,
though, than in the NFC Championship Game when he had 67 yards on
23 carries against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Atlanta was No. 2 in the NFL against the run
this year. Today, the Falcons face the running back who was No. 1
in rushing. Denver's Terrell Davis proved he can do many things
while rushing for 2,008 yards and 21 touchdowns, but his ability to
cut back and change direction is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to stop him would be almost impossible,'' middle
linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``What we want to do ... is contain
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons led the NFL with a plus-14 turnover ratio for many
reasons _ indefatigable spirit was chief among them.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest play probably was when defensive end Chuck Smith
forced a critical fumble by quarterback Randall Cunningham in the
NFC title game. It set up a touchdown pass that triggered a
comeback from a 20-7 deficit. Some say the Falcons have nothing to
lose: The Broncos are favored; Atlanta is the dream team that
exceeded all expectations. Forget that. It took 33 years to get
here. It's time to make it count.
</P>
<P>
   ``As great as you felt seeing that field goal go through against
Minnesota, I told our football team to remember the feeling,''
Reeves said, ``because it ... is going to be the worst feeling you
ever had in your life when you end up on the short end of the stick
in the Super Bowl.''

o'clock, a sub-zero wind chill deep-freezes the Michigan landscape.
Inside the Pontiac Silverdome, 81,270 fans are warm and toasty and
in full-throated roar. Down on the artificial turf stands Anthony
Munoz. The memory of the moment prompts a one-word remembrance:
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaaahhhh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you're aware of the millions and millions of people
watching,'' recalled Munoz, then a young offensive tackle for the
Cincinnati Bengals, now a sportscaster and a member of the Pro
Football Hall of Fame. ``This is the ultimate. You grew up watching
the Chiefs and Vikings, and Cowboys and Dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   And now millions and millions of people are watching the Bengals
and 49ers in Super Bowl XVI. Watching you. ``All of a sudden,
you're standing under the goalpost, waiting to be introduced,''
Munoz said. ``And you say, 'Knees, just don't buckle.' It's
unbelievable. You've arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Atlanta Falcons, that moment, that ``Aaaahhhh,'' finally
arrives tonight. After a week in the South Florida sun, a week of
Super Bowl babble and hype from Media Day to Elway to Ray's dog
collar to Shannon's Sharpe-tongued, nonstop blather, Super Bowl
XXXIII has arrived at last. Time to buckle your chin strap, but not
your knees.
</P>
<P>
   As Buffalo's Thurman Thomas quickly discovered in Super Bowl
XXVI, the weight of the moment _ and, in Thomas' case, the wait of
the moment _ can cause a man to lose his headgear. His head, too.
The pressure can be enormous when Super Sunday finally dawns, along
with the realization of just where you are and just what's at
stake. The jitter bug can infect anyone, but first-time Super Bowl
participants are especially at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting phenomena will be (that) the Broncos have been
through it all before, and Atlanta hasn't,'' said Dick Anderson,
the strong safety for Miami's three consecutive Super Bowl teams in
the early '70s. ``Will all the hoopla and press all week make
Atlanta less focused?''
</P>
<P>
   Denver has been there five times before, including last year's
31-24 upset of Green Bay in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's first Super Bowl, Dallas dominated the Dolphins 24-3
in Super Bowl VI in New Orleans. ``The thing that amazed you the
most was the hoopla that went on in the hotel all week,'' Anderson
said. ``The next year, all we were focused on was Washington.''
Those Dolphins beat the Redskins 14-7 to finish 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   Staying focused
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely impossible to prepare for,'' Randy Cross said.
``That first time you walk out on that field is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross played in three Super Bowls for San Francisco in the 1980s
and now lives in Atlanta. His Super Bowl baptism was in XVI against
Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting to that point, though, can be daunting enough. Ron
Jaworski had trouble sleeping all week before Super Bowl XV. By
Sunday, he was nervous and sleep-deprived and threw three
interceptions in Philadelphia's 27-10 loss to the Raiders.
Jaworski, with Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, later advised
Phil Simms before Super Bowl XXI of the distractions and the need
for heightened concentration. Simms focused intently each day.
That, and coach Bill Parcells uncharacteristically scripting the
first five plays, helped Simms complete a record 22 of 25 passes
for 268 yards and three touchdowns in New York's 39-20 victory
against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weirdest thing is when you walk out on the field a couple
of hours before the game,'' Cross said. ``That stadium is usually
empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on Super Sunday. Instead, the stadium is at least
half-filled long before kickoff and later is jammed to capacity.
And not with the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just fans dressed in the teams' colors,'' Cross said.
``It's filled with Roman royalty. Everybody's dressed up, like a
nonfootball crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a high-priced Super Bowl crowd. Corporate America come to
watch the gladiators. ``You're almost waiting for them to give
thumbs up or thumbs down,'' Cross said. ``That's when you realize
it's not just another football game. You've been told all week that
it is. It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it'd be another ball game,'' said Terry Hoage, the
ex-Georgia All-American safety who played for six teams in a
13-year NFL career and was a nickel back and special-teamer for
Washington in Super Bowl XXVI against Buffalo. ``But when I walked
out on the field before the Super Bowl, it was unbelievable. A
really big deal. The fanfare, the whole nine yards. Everybody's
into it. As a player, I looked up into the stands, and they're all
into the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoage's Super Bowl experience came in the frosty climes of
Minneapolis. ``It absolutely (stunk) as a player,'' he said. ``All
you could do was sit in your room all week and think about the ball
game or go ice fishing,'' he said. Indeed, some of the Redskins did
just that. ``Some of the outdoor guys _ Russ Grimm, Donnie Warren _
went ice fishing,'' Hoage said. ``They went snowmobiling to their
ice-fishing houses. I really couldn't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the traffic
</P>
<P>
   Game-day transportation can be nettlesome, too. Before Super
Bowl XI, Raiders coach John Madden changed the travel itinerary to
have the team buses leave early for the Rose Bowl. ``Take off!''
Madden ordered after boarding a bus. At the stadium, only Madden
realized why six players _ including 6-foot-8, 310-pound John
Matuszak _ were missing. He kept quiet. ``As a head coach, you
can't go around and say, 'Hey, I lost six players!'. . . . Here I
am playing hide-and-go-seek before the damn Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later in Tampa, three Raiders _ Howie Long, Lyle
Alzado and Bill Pickel _ took a taxi to the game and got stuck in
traffic. Alzado, riding shotgun, was livid, screaming. The players
finally got out of the cab, walked a half-mile to the stadium and
helped stun the defending champion Redskins 38-9.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, walking wasn't an option for Cross' teammates.
In Pontiac, the 49ers were advised not to take taxis to the remote
Silverdome, for fear of traffic jams. ``Thank goodness we ignored
that,'' said Cross, one of 12 or 14 Niners who cabbed it to the
dome. Two hours before kickoff, already dressed in the locker room,
he said, ``We're sitting there drawing straws: Who's gonna play
quarterback? Who's gonna play running back?''
</P>
<P>
   The team buses were stuck in traffic. The rest of the 49ers did
not arrive until 90 minutes before kickoff. And in what state? ``On
edge,'' Cross said, laughing. ``It's kind of a bad thing to be late
for a Super Bowl and your wedding. Those are two things you don't
want to be late for.'' The 49ers won 26-21.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing the clock
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Slater was in his fourth season with the Rams when they
played Pittsburgh in Super Bowl XIV in Pasadena, Calif. ``I had a
tendency to get uptight,'' Slater said. ``But the guys we had _
(Jack) Youngblood, Hacksaw (Reynolds) _ did a good job of keeping
everybody loose.'' Including Slater. At least until the pre-game
introductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember coming out in the stadium and watching 103,000
people come to their feet when the Steelers were introduced,''
Slater said. ``And many of them were Rams fans. Then we were
introduced. For a few minutes there, I was a fan, as far as the
whole aura of the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a spectacle, one whose enormousness is heightened by the
early-evening start and the seemingly interminable delay before the
kickoff. ``There's all this extra time from the time you leave the
field to the time you have to play football,'' said Cross. ``You
have to be on the field at 6 but the game doesn't start until 6:18.
You come out, then get introduced. They'll shoot off fireworks,
have Stealth bombers overhead. (Tonight) you've got Cher singing
the national anthem. God knows how that'll work out.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, you just want to hit somebody, just want to
play football. ``Everything's just so big because of the (pre-game)
program and the hype,'' Munoz said. ``It's almost like, 'Man, knock
me out and wake me up when they're ready to play football.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time you (play in a Super Bowl), it's hard not to
hyperventilate,'' Cross said. ``Football players are really on
edge. But it's not just the players; it's everybody. The coaches
are uptight. The guys who pour the Gatorade are strung out.''
</P>
<P>
   The hysteria, and the extra delay on the sidelines between
introductions and kickoff, conspired against the Bills' Thomas in
Super Bowl XXVI. ``That's the sort of weird thing that can happen
in this game,'' Cross said. The AFC's leading rusher that season,
Thomas missed Buffalo's first two plays of the game because he
misplaced his helmet. Both were running plays. ``I was very
upset,'' said Thomas, who finished with just 13 yards on 10 carries
in a 37-24 loss and with an everlasting Super Bowl stigma.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only Bill who succumbed to nerves that night. On
the opening kickoff, Buffalo's Scott Norwood kicked it prematurely
and had to kick-start the game again. After the first kick, Hoage
asked the referee, ``What do you think the odds are in Vegas they
they'd have two (opening) kickoffs in this game?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoage said, ``I don't think he thought that was too funny.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing comical about a slow start in the Super Bowl,
though. Forget Thomas. Ask the Redskins, who watched the Raiders
recover a blocked punt for a touchdown in the first quarter of
Super Bowl XVIII, then saw Jack Squirek return an interception off
Theismann 5yards for a touchdown seven seconds before halftime for
a 21-3 lead. Ask the Chargers, who gave up a 44-yard scoring pass
to Jerry Rice just 1:24 into Super Bowl XXIX, then a 51-yarder to
Ricky Watters on San Francisco's next possession in the 49ers'
49-26 rout.
</P>
<P>
   All of that ensued after Cross, who was doing color commentary
for British TV for the game, had warned, ``The Chargers have got to
survive the first 10 minutes of this game.'' The first 10 minutes
on the game clock? ``No, the first 10 minutes, period. A 7-,
10-point lead in a Super Bowl is a pretty big lead,'' Cross says
now, ``only because it causes people to press.''
</P>
<P>
   How might the Falcons react tonight if they fall behind early in
their first Super Bowl? Who knows? But know this: When asked if the
Falcons might be traumatized or shaken this week by the Super Bowl
XXXIII atmosphere, defensive end Chuck Smith said, ``I'm glad to go
through the emotional trauma. Great. Give me all the emotional
trauma that you can. Give it to me every year.''

 &HT;    Both sides see splendor in grass
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Atlanta Falcons' path to the Super Bowl was paved
with fuzzy concrete. And are they ever glad to get off it.
</P>
<P>
   While Denver has been insistent all week that the natural
playing surface at Pro Player Stadium offers an advantage to no
one, the Falcons can't wait to roll around on real grass for a
change. If that seems odd for a team that just went 12-1 on
artificial surfaces this season, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to playing on grass. It's the best surface
to play games on,'' Falcons running back Jamal Anderson said. ``We
practice on grass all the time, and it's a lot better on the body.
When you fall on it or carry the ball 25 or 30 times, you kind of
look forward to falling on grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I'm a little bit more confident in my footing on
grass. I'll try some different cuts on grass. When we're not on
grass, I may be a little more hesitant to make a sharp cut, because
I don't want my body going one way and my leg going another way.
When we're on grass, I can let it all hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have no idea what he's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys have played in the NFL a long time and have
played on different types of surfaces,'' Denver safety Tyrone
Braxton said. ``It's a break for us, but it's not going to be a
great advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The field is all new grass and opulent, sodded just last month
by golfer Greg Norman's Turf Farm in Avon Park in central Florida.
Norman dropped by the stadium Tuesday to inspect the surface, which
appeared thicker than even at the height of the baseball season.
The strain of grass was developed for Norman at Penn State and was
named for him: GN-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt sweet to me,'' said Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith,
who walked on the surface at Tuesday's media day. ``I had on tennis
shoes but, I mean, it's the same for both sides. Like our field in
Denver is as hard as a rock. The grass is dead. But hey, if they
want us to line up in the parking lot, it's like, let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Dan Reeves signed on as coach, his team has played 27
games on artificial turf, including the last nine in a row, and
just seven on real grass. But Atlanta's 20-7 record on the
artificial surfaces suggests more than it should. Anderson is
hardly a speed back, and the receiver corps does not feature a true
breakaway threat.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Falcons have gone 3-4 on natural grass
under Reeves. Half of those losses came in San Francisco. The
record should also reflect that Atlanta's most impressive victory
of the season was a 41-10 rout of the Patriots on the grass field
at Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more excited than they are to play on grass,'' Falcons
wide receiver Terance Mathis said. ``We practice on grass all week,
and then we have to play on turf. We know what the turf does to our
bodies. Usually, it takes until Thursday to get over it for us
older guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might lose a half-step on grass but you're going to be
more daring. You're going to go crazy out there. You're going to
turn the corner a little harder. You're going to make a sharper
cut. You're going to take a chance of trying to make somebody miss.
You're going to dive after those balls knowing that grass is going
to give a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is inconclusive whether teams that play on turf at home
are at a disadvantage on grass-field Super Bowls. Turf teams Dallas
and Pittsburgh won six of their nine titles on grass fields, but
turf team Buffalo went 0-2 in its Super Bowls on grass. Among the
Bills, Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals, six of the past 10 teams to
lose in the Super Bowl had artificial surfaces back home. But
eventually, such analysis becomes meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Denver wide receiver Willie Green said, ``the
weather is more of a factor than the turf.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one, not even Greg Norman, can do anything about the
weather.

 &HT;    Only one detail left to cap off the week
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The grandest week in Falcons existence is one final
detail from completion. The world had so long gone out of its way
to avoid this franchise. Then, suddenly, in one mad dash, it rushed
to catch up on 33 years of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Buchanan dressed for the occasion, coming to the blow-out
media day wearing a dog collar. And thus did a Falcons cornerback
establish a fashion trend for future players looking to make a
spectacle of themselves. Next will come the whips and handcuffs.
It's going to start looking like a Bourbon Street novelty store.
</P>
<P>
   How many times in the past six days have I been asked by a
fellow sportswriter to relay old tales of Falcons woe? Ten? Twenty?
I should have prepared a lengthy memo before ever getting into
town, titled ``The Everlasting Shame of the California Championship
Trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a week of reassurance. Cher promised to wear
nontransparent clothing to her performance of the pre-game national
anthem. She must have gotten some bad information that good taste
and restraint were parts of the Super Bowl code.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week of reaching for obscure clues to today's outcome.
I once tried to get a prediction from a pig for one long-ago Super
Bowl. This time, others went to a New York color-psychology firm
for the inside skinny. ``While the black (jerseys) may make (the
Falcons) appear more formidable, rough and tough, it'll also make
them top heavy,'' said Samuelle Easton, the firm's president.
``They won't be able to overcome it.'' She claims to have nailed
the past two Super Bowls, which makes her record far superior to
the pig's.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week of strange concerns and confessions. First Falcons
receiver Terance Mathis complained about the decision to allow Pro
Bowl players and 10-year veterans to lead the Falcons off the
airplane in Miami. That was tantamount to a newlywed griping about
his wife rushing first into the honeymoon suite.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mathis came forward with details of a drinking problem. A
pure shock, this stand-up, community-oriented guy weaving down that
particular path. We'll see if a catharsis is good preparation for
the big game.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week of taking sides and picking at old scabs. There
never was any question with whom Atlanta would side in the
Reeves-Shanahan-Elway triangle. Did you know that when Dan Reeves
went in for his mid-December bypass operation, surgeons had a
terrible time getting him set right on the table? Seems he was
reflexively flipping over onto the wrong side. From his Denver
experience, he just assumed that all sharp objects went into his
back. (Just another Super Bowl exaggeration).
</P>
<P>
   It was a week of the ridiculous. Shannon Sharpe woofed like no
one has before. Chris Chandler was being ranked ahead of Hall of
Fame shoo-in John Elway. Reeves became unhinged when it became
public he was working 292-pound rookie Bob Hallen at fullback. If
that prevents him from handing Hallen the ball on fourth-and-1 of a
tie game, then the breach will have been a valuable service to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   As Super Bowl weeks go, the Falcons had themselves a fine one.
With their first visit, they pretty much got the full treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping they have a little something left for one final
detail.

 &HT;    One of football's most vocal traditions
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It's two days before the Falcons and Broncos tee the
ball up for Super Bowl XXXIII, and Pat Summerall is relaxing
comfortably in the spacious Maddencruiser without his friend and
partner John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been together so long as a team, it seems odd to
see one of them at a football stadium without seeing the other. But
Madden is inside Pro Player Stadium for a taping session, and
Summerall isn't scheduled to begin his rehearsals on introducing
Cher singing the national anthem and the starting lineups for the
Falcons and Broncos for at least another hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ideal time for reflecting on a team that has been to
football announcing what Lewis and Clark were to trailblazing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if people care a lot who televises the Super
Bowl,'' said Fox game producer Bob Stenner. ''But I know when they
see Pat and John, that's a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Summerall's first game with Madden in Tampa has
been told time and time again. He saw this former Oakland Raiders
coach sweating profusely in the booth before the game even started
and thought it was nervousness about being on television. Only to
learn later Madden had a phobic fear of heights.
</P>
<P>
   But the roots of this team, which has set a record for longevity
in network announcing that may never be broken, began much sooner
than 1980. Only the old-timers remember Summerall spent the first
14 years of his television career in the analyst role that has made
Madden a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The change to play-by-play was swift and unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was with CBS and working with Jack Buck as the No. 1 team
when (then CBS Sports chief) Bob Wussler called me at home,''
Summerall said. ''He wanted to see me, and when we talked, he said
he was going to move me with somebody else. Bob said he couldn't
tell who was talking, Jack and I sounded too much a like. So he
said he was making a change, and he'd like me to do play-by-play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said OK. But I thought he was talking about taping some
games that season and maybe starting the following year. But he
said, 'Let's go this week. Who do you want to work with?' So just
like that, I started doing play-by-play in 1974 with Tom Brookshier
as my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerall's first meeting with Madden didn't come with that
fateful game at Tampa in 1980. They had met on occasions when
Madden coached the Raiders, but it was only through the persistence
of CBS and the advice of a friend that pushed Madden into
television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to do TV. I didn't like the things TV guys
did,'' said Madden, who was now sitting at a table in the
Maddencruiser and getting miked for an interview with a local Miami
station. ''The TV guys didn't know football. They were saying and
doing football things that were simply not true.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept saying no to CBS until someone said, `Why not give it a
try. If you don't like it, you can just walk away from it. But if
you say no now, maybe three or four years from now you might wonder
what would have happened, except by then, maybe they won't want you
no more.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Madden gave it a try, and CBS did not shoot him to the top of
the depth chart. Madden worked those regional games that go to 5 or
6 percent of the country. And he didn't mind doing them because it
kept him close to the game he loved. He is certain if it wasn't for
television, he would have returned to coaching.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other analyst, Madden is responsible for the
degree of preparation network announcers now put into the game. He
pioneered arriving two or three days before the game and talking to
the players and coaches. But the evolution had nothing to do with a
conscious attempt at innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stopped flying on any planes, so the way I had to get to
places was on trains. So I'd leave early and would get to the city
about Thursday,'' Madden said. ''By getting there early and being a
former coach, I started calling coaches who were friends and I'd go
by and talk to them because the rest of the crew wouldn't get in
until Saturday before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we'd talk and watch films. The second year, I was working
with Gary Bender, and he said he'd like to do that, too. So he
started coming in early. It wasn't anything official. But (then CBS
executive producer) Terry O'Neil came in the next year and put that
in as policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the force of Madden's personality triggered a rise in
celebrity that transcended sports announcing like none before him,
with the possible exceptions of the late Howard Cosell and Don
Meredith, Summerall discovered his own presence did not go
unnoticed when he entered the Betty Ford clinic a couple of years
ago for alcohol treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He was overwhelmed by the response of people nationwide offering
support and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tell me I got more mail than anybody ever has, including
Elizabeth Taylor,'' Summerall said. ''I was amazed. I'll tell you a
funny story. When you're at the Ford Center, you're not supposed to
talk with anyone on the outside or get calls for three weeks. But
not long after I entered, a guy said I had a phone call. I didn't
know what to think. I was afraid maybe someone had died. I kept
thinking who could it be. So I got the phone, and it was Mike
Ditka. Nobody was supposed to get through, but Ditka got through.''
</P>
<P>
   If the team of Madden and Summerall could survive a round with
alcoholism, it was a pretty good bet that CBS losing the NFL to
Fox, and last year's rumors that Madden might jump to ABC and
''Monday Night Football,'' wasn't going to break them up.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, they talked about it but never made any kind of
pact that they'd be a package deal.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even network executives are bright enough to know not
to break up a good thing.

   ''Pat is a man of few words. John is a man of a lot of words,''
Stenner said. ''John can go off on a tangent, knowing Pat can
safely land the ship. You never know how it's going to turn out
when two people are put together, but Pat and John are one of those
examples of what happens when it's a perfect fit.''

 &HT;    Taylor earned a nomination, but does he truly deserve it?
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Electing new members to the Pro Football Hall of Fame is
not like picking the next pope. It is not heavy duty. There are 14
candidates of recent vintage, and one chosen by a veterans
committee, in this case, Billy Shaw, who vaulted from Georgia Tech
into a career as an all-time American Football League guard at
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding on Billy Shaw was no problem. His credentials and
life's record are without blemish. The problem is with a new
candidate named Lawrence Taylor, who was a linebacker for the New
York Giants for 13 seasons. Never in my 18 years on the committee
has such a firestorm broken out over a player up for consideration.
Usually, these meetings of the 30 or so delegates are rather civil,
good-natured and without cussing and fussing. This one was loaded
before any of us ever left our front doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has a record off the field to clog a court docket. Drug
abuse, family abuse, deadbeat father, more than just drug abuse,
drug busts. Twice recently.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, he has a record beyond challenge. Some with or
without license call him the ``greatest defensive player in
football history.'' There is no such thing as a ``greatest''
player. There have been great ones, but as a defensive player,
better than Dick Butkus? Ray Nitschke? Joe Greene? Name your own.
</P>
<P>
   That's moot. We get around now to life beyond the field. Should
that be factored into the career of these great athletes? Should
they be held to a higher standard than the rest of us? The Pro
Football Hall of Fame draws the line at the white lines; anything
off the field doesn't count. This is so published in the Hall of
Fame bylaws:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only criteria for election to the Pro Football Hall of
Fame is a nominee's achievements and contributions as a player,
coach or contributor in professional football.''
</P>
<P>
   To get in the Baseball Hall of Fame, players' character and life
off the field come into consideration. It's in the rules. That's
what keeps Pete Rose out, Shoeless Joe Jackson, too. Should the
same kind of standards not apply to the hall at Canton? Shouldn't
the National Football League have as much pride in keeping its hall
clear of character rubbish? Should I not be allowed, as a committee
member, to set some standards that I feel belong?
</P>
<P>
   As an alumnus of North Carolina, I take no pride at all in
Taylor's record. He has a life record that is shameful and reflects
on his university. Should I consider that? I do, and I did.
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates rarely speak out for themselves. Taylor has been
mouthing support for himself that should be embarrassing. On a
conference call this week, he said he had no intention of making an
apology to anybody just to get into the Hall of Fame. Fine, that's
his standard. I have mine. The Pro Football Hall of Fame needs one.
If Jim Brown and O.J. Simpson came up as candidates today, could
you vote for them? Think it over.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned, Lawrence Taylor went in, breezing. It was a
sprited debate with the pros making the cons feel like small
change. The atmosphere was intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   A motion was made to add to the by-laws for eligibility, one
similar to the standards of the Baseball Hall of Fame, that
character, contributions to society and conduct off the field
should be considered. Sad to report, the NFL has shown considerable
lack of interest in the character of its athletes, as evidenced by
the commisioner himself Paul Tagliabue who Friday recommended that
Taylor be inducted. Shame on him.

 &HT;    Consistency counts
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Falcons beat Minnesota in the Metrodome. After that,
nothing should seem daunting. The Broncos are the reigning Super
Bowl champs, but this game is on a neutral field. And the commodity
that so imperiled the Falcons in Minneapolis _ speed at every
position _ isn't a Denver hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of John Elway notwithstanding, Denver is a grinding
sort of offense. It pounds with Terrell Davis and its smallish but
fierce offensive line. It moves the sticks with percentage passes
to Ed McCaffrey and Shannon Sharpe. In sum, the Broncos are like
the Falcons, with one exception: Denver doesn't have Tony Martin to
run through a secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have the better defense, and it has been tested in a
way Denver's hasn't. San Francisco brought Steve Young and Jerry
Rice and J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens to the Georgia Dome and
managed 18 points. On its last 10 possessions in the NFC
Championship Game, the highest-scoring offense in league history
could score only once. It has become fashionable to call the
Falcons' linemen and linebackers the best front seven in football,
but the secondary is substandard no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Buchanan has talked the big talk, guaranteeing a victory and
likening Sharpe to the equine Mr. Ed. But Buchanan has the capacity
to heap pressure on himself and then play surpassing football. His
interception against San Francisco on Nov. 15 was the Falcons' play
of the year, and his work against the outrageous Randy Moss _ who
proclaimed during the game, ``That Ray Buchanan can't cover me!'' _
was nigh heroic.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos aren't going to bomb the Falcons into submission.
They're no longer that kind of team. Elway hasn't passed for 200
yards in four of his past five playoff games. He hasn't had to. The
Broncos belong to Davis. Denver relies on him more than the Falcons
do on Jamal Anderson, which is saying something.
</P>
<P>
   And what is the one thing the Falcons do best? Stop the run.
Only one opposing back has gained 100 yards in the Falcons' past 26
games, and that one _ the Jets' Curtis Martin _ had 101. Limit
Terrell Davis to 101 yards and the Broncos must rely on Elway to
win the game, and he's no longer the daring young man of 1986. The
one time Davis was blunted this season _ 29 yards against Miami on
Dec. 21 _ the Broncos were helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, the NFC Championship didn't follow the script.
Anderson gained only 67 yards. Minnesota had the ball longer. But
Chris Chandler kept the Falcons moving, fashioning a line for the
ages _ 27 of 43 for 350 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions.
Chandler has been the best quarterback in football when it mattered
most this season, better than Young, Randall Cunningham and Elway.
This Super Bowl is a fitting stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons don't have to do anything they haven't already done.
The beauty of their season has been its week-to-week consistency,
even as the stakes mounted exponentially. ``It's like someone
dangled a diamond in front of us,'' said Bob Christian, the injured
fullback. ``As we went along, we realized, 'Hey, we can do this
thing.' ``
</P>
<P>
   They can and will. Falcons 23-20.

   Then he'll cheer a team _ and a quarterback _ that have ignited
the fan and the Falcon in him this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a swagger to 'em,'' Bartkowski says, approvingly,
of these Falcons. ``They're like a hired gun coming into town to
knock off the sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for the quarterback: ``Chris Chandler is spectacular. He
throws the ball great, has great touch; he just needed the
responsibility of being `the Guy.' I like to see a guy who has
knocked around a while, who didn't get a lot of credit while
playing on some bad teams, in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartkowski, 46, calls the 33-year-old Chandler ``a great kid''
as well as ``a very good friend.'' They played golf together during
the open week before the NFC title game. Bartkowski's oldest son is
now 17, born one year after the Falcons' closest previous brush
with the Super Bowl _ the favored 1980 team's long-lamented,
come-from-ahead playoff loss to Dallas at Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have the best team in the NFL that year, not a doubt in
my mind,'' Bartkowski says. ``If we had gotten past Dallas, we
would have beaten Philadelphia (in the NFC title game) and probably
the Raiders (in the Super Bowl). I probably thought, like most
around me at the time, that there'd be multiple opportunities,
going forward, to reach the Super Bowl. And there might have been,
if Leeman (Bennett, the coach) had been able to stick around. Dan
(Reeves) reminds me so much of Leeman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the many dreary years between the Bennett era and the Reeves
era, ``it was extremely sad, a little bit embarrassing,''
Bartkowski says. ``You almost had to apologize for where you
played. ... (But) my contention is that Atlanta has always been a
football town. It became a baseball town by default. Now these guys
have seized the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeman Bennett, Falcons coach 1977-'82, also has a role today:
hosting a pregame radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost totally lost interest (in recent years),'' he admits.
``I would go to a (Falcons) game, watch three or four plays, then
someone would start talking to me. I didn't watch the games like I
enjoy watching games _ (that is,) as a coach watches games. I got
interested again (this season).''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was because his new radio show _ it aired after
Falcons broadcasts throughout the season but will air before the
game today _ gave him reason to pay close attention.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was because of how closely these Falcons match his
Falcons philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``As coach, I always felt like the team that had the best
running game and stopped the run would win,'' Bennett says.
``People thought that was awfully conservative back then. But it's
true.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that two teams adept at both running the ball and
stopping the run meet in the Super Bowl, what gives? ``It could
come down to whether Chris Chandler beats John Elway,'' Bennett
says, ``like he beat Randall Cunningham (in the NFC title game).''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kenn, a fixture at offensive tackle for the Falcons for 17
years, regrets only that he couldn't have played another four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite the dichotomy of feelings,'' he says, describing
his reaction to the NFC title game. ``One minute, I was ecstatic to
the point of tears because the Falcons were going to the Super
Bowl, and the next minute, I was saddened to the point of tears,
almost, because I had missed the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired after the '94 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it'd probably happen in my lifetime,'' he says about
the Falcons in the Super Bowl. He laughs. ``But I thought I'd live
a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   R.C. Thielemann, unlike Bartkowski and Kenn and most former
Falcons, played in a Super Bowl. The offensive guard got there with
the Washington Redskins after spending eight seasons, 1977-'84,
with Atlanta. He heard the news of the Falcons' win over Minnesota
while visiting a volcano during a vacation in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started jumping around, and no one knew what I was doing,''
Thielemann says. Two weeks later, he says, ``I'm still shocked.''
And he figures the current Falcons are experiencing some culture
shock of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really cared about the Falcons for many years,''
Thielemann says. ``No free drinks. No free food. Now, instant
celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewey McClain and Dave Scott are as relieved as they are happy.
</P>
<P>
   McClain, a Falcons linebacker 1976-'80, says, ``We've always
felt that we let the city down in 1980. There has been a monkey on
our backs ever since. Now that monkey is off our backs. Until this
season, we were the best Falcons team ever. Now we're the
second-best.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a Falcons tackle 1976-'82, says, ``For me, this Super
Bowl brings closure to the late '70s and early '80s. It brings
closure to a time period when we could have, should have, gone all
the way and didn't. Well, now we've done it. Their success is our
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott _ like Bartkowski, Bennett, Kenn, Thielemann, McClain and
countless other Falcons past _ continues to live in metro Atlanta.
And on this Super Sunday, he speaks for most in the city: ``I've
enjoyed football more this season than any other time in my life.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO allies removed the last restraints
Saturday on military action against Serbia if it does not agree to
start talks next weekend in France with the ethnic Albanian leaders
in Kosovo about autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance ambassadors in Brussels gave authority to NATO's
secretary-general, Javier Solana, after he consults with allied
capitals, to order airstrikes against military targets in Kosovo
and elsewhere in Serbia unless President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia agrees to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   They acted after Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain
presented an international ultimatum to Milosevic and Kosovo
Albanian leaders in the region. Milosevic, who annulled autonomy
for Kosovo 10 years ago, made no direct response Saturday, Cook
reported.
</P>
<P>
   But in a warning to the ethnic Albanian leaders fighting for
independence for the province, NATO officials said strikes would
not go ahead if the Albanians refused to negotiate or stop
attacking the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meetings were scheduled throughout the weekend on
plans for possible airstrikes against Serbia if Milosevic resists
the negotiations. Also being discussed was how to send in American
ground troops should President Clinton decide they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's top national security advisers have reached
a consensus to recommend sending American ground troops should the
two warring parties agree to a cease-fire, administration and
congressional officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement released Saturday, David Leavy, a White House
spokesman, said ``the president has made no decision'' on whether
to send American troops should an international peacekeeping force
enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Six nations _ the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany
and Russia _demanded an end to all violence in a meeting of the
so-called contact group on the Balkans that had been scheduled in
London on Friday in the expectation that NATO would issue an
activation order Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Allies did not want to take sides with the
Kosovo Liberation Army, in effect becoming its air force against
Serbia in the rebels' struggle for independence, a goal none of the
contact group countries supports. Ethnic Ablanians make up 90
percent of Kosovo's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making clear that the actions of the Kosovans in the
negotiations and on the ground will have a bearing on the decision
of the secretary-general to order strikes,'' a senior NATO diplomat
said. Further possible military measures to exert pressure on the
rebels, like a NATO naval blockade of major Albanian ports, are
still under study, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under what amounts to an international ultimatum, both sides
have seven days from Feb. 6, extendable by a week or less, to reach
agreement on autonomy along lines worked out over the last few
months by an American mediator for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, the
ambassador to Macedonia. The negotiations would be held in
Rambouillet, a rural 18th-century chateau 32 miles southwest of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians do negotiate a settlement,
officials said, the alliance would draw up plans for a
30,000-member NATO peacekeeping force that could stay in Kosovo for
years while a peace conference works out more permanent
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are considering plans to
contribute 2,000 to 5,000 troops to the peacekeeping force, and
leaders of France and Britain said last week that both their
countries would provide soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said no decision had yet been made on withdrawing
1,020 international observers from the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe who are now monitoring the situation in
Kosovo. A French-commanded NATO extraction force of 2,000 European
soldiers is based in Macedonia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albanian loyalties have been divided between the Kosovo
Liberation Army, armed through Albania by a financial support
network in Europe and the United States, and moderates led by
Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian nationalists view Kosovo, where the Serbs suffered a
historic defeat against the Turks in 1389, as holy ground.
Milosevic used the 600th anniversary of the battle to mobilize
support for the nationalist cause a decade ago, telling a million
Serbs at the site that they would never again be victimized.
</P>
<P>
   Today's NATO decision reactivates plans for both immediate,
limited warning strikes and a wider ``phased air campaign'' that
could hit Serb air defense sites and other military targets not
only in Kosovo but also elsewhere in Serbia. Hundreds of planes,
mainly American, and dozens of ships are poised for operations that
could start from bases in Italy and the Adriatic within days.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme allied commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, had authority to begin the bombing in October if Milosevic
refused to withdraw heavily armed police and army units that were
attacking Albanian villages as well as Kosovo Liberation Army
units, and to begin negotiations with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the threat, Milosevic promised to comply, and Clark's
activation orders were suspended. But according to Western
officials, Milosevic did not do what he promised.
</P>
<P>
   After a Serbian attack that killed 45 Albanian civilians in the
village of Racak this month, the United States began mobilizing
international support for stronger action to stop the violence.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright lobbied allied foreign
ministers and went to Moscow to persuade Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov to support a call by the contact group for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright refused to say she would go to the contact group
meeting until she was assured that NATO allies, including France,
would vote to authorize military action.
</P>
<P>
   American negotiators accepted a decision by the Allies Saturday
to leave the primary responsibility for ordering military action
this time in the hands of Solana, a civilian, rather than Clark's.
NATO officials said Solana would consult with allied capitals
before going ahead, but that he would not have to seek a new
alliance decision to order Clark to launch the planes and cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The plans would also allow Solana to order bombing if there was
another major atrocity against civilians, though the threat of
imminent NATO action did not prevent a Serbian police raid on
Friday in which 24 ethnic Albanians were killed in the village of
Rugovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Solana could also give the order if Milosevic
refused to make good on the earlier promises to reduce police and
military forces in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to show our determination to both
parties,'' a French official said. ``The Albanians see time working
in their favor, and the eventual emergence of a greater Albania,
but that is not what the international community wants. We want
substantial autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia for a determined
period of, say, three years, which will allow time to reach a
permanent settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, some Western officials hope, Milosevic could be history
and more moderate Serb leaders might agree to let Kosovo go.
</P>
<P>
   But the other side of the coin is that if the two parties do
agree to come to Rambouillet, American and European peacekeepers
could be stuck in Kosovo for years, as they have been in nearby
Bosnia since the end of 1995.

ST. JOHN'S EMOTIONS OVERCOME AT END BY UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the old St. John's chant of ``Let's go, Redmen''
competing with the roar from thousands of boisterous Connecticut
fans in a sold-out Madison Square Garden Saturday afternoon, No. 9
St. John's and No. 1 Connecticut staged a highly charged battle for
Big East supremacy that seemed more like a neighborhood brawl. In
the end, St. John's bubble, blown big by a magical week of
basketball, was deflated in the closing minutes as Connecticut
prevailed with the final swing in emotion to win, 78-74, and remain
undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's has played an extraordinary week of games, and there
was no emotional or physical letdown Saturday. After taking No. 2
Duke in an overtime loss in a classic game last Sunday and then
coming back from a 15-point deficit to beat Syracuse on Wednesday,
St. John's led the undefeated Huskies until 4 minutes 57 seconds
were left in this game. Then Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin
stripped Reggie Jessie and fed Kevin Freeman for a layup that gave
the Huskies the lead at 69-67. They would not trail again.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton's 3-pointer opened the lead to 72-65 with 3:08
left, but St. John's would pull back to just 2 down when the
reserve Lavor Postell hit a 3-pointer with 34.9 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut made a succession of free throws to insure the
victory, and as the seconds wound down, it was Freeman and Hamilton
who bowed in celebration to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is 19-0 over all and 11-0 in the Big East. St.
John's is 17-5 and 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had 22 points, Freeman 16 and El-Amin 15 and 6 assists.
Postell had 23 points and 11 rebounds; Jessie 17 had points and
Artest 14.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's opened the second half with a magnificent burst, a
10-3 run, that opened the lead to 12 points with 17:09 to play.
</P>
<P>
   With a 46-41 lead, Jessie hit a layup and then, on the next
Connecticut possession, Ron Artest intercepted a pass meant for
El-Amin at halfcourt. The ball made its way to Bootsy Thornton, who
hit what is for him now a routine 3-pointer. The run ended when
Jessie stripped Freeman of the ball as he went to the basket, and
threw an outlet pass to Erick Barkley, who missed. But Jessie
grabbed the offensive rebound and went back up for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of play, already fast, then became frantic, a
development that Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun had said before the
game would not be good for his team. But St. John's, with Barkley
temporarily out of the game after getting poked in the eye, could
not convert on any of the run-and-gun possessions and the Huskies
closed their deficit to 53-49.
</P>
<P>
   After St. John's took a timeout, Barkley was back, but he threw
a bad pass that was picked off by Rashamel Jones. Jones went to the
basket and Connecticut was down by only 53-51 with 12:38 to play.
St. John's would open the lead by to 7 points, but Hamilton hit a
3-pointer to tie it again at 61-61, and St. John's lost the lead in
the second half for the first time with 6:49 left.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's seems to have developed an affinity for giving its
fans a scare before getting fully involved in a game. The Red Storm
may have thought its game plan against Syracuse earlier in the week
worked pretty well: fall behind badly early and then use the team's
grittiness to make it a game.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's was down by 13 points after just four minutes, a
result of a torrent of scoring created by Connecticut's pressure
defense and fast-break offense. Hamilton, Connecticut's of the year
candidate scored 10 of the Huskies' first 16 points (Freeman had
the others), as St. John's, for the first time since its
lackadaisical loss at Miami, looked slow.
</P>
<P>
   But against Syracuse, when it trailed by 15 points midway
through the first half, St. John's proved no deficit was large
enough to intimidate the Red Storm. Against the Orangemen, the
players were convinced that Syracuse could not continue its torrid
shooting from the perimeter. Against Connecticut, St. John's did
not wait for the Huskies' offensive machine to go off the rails.
The Red Storm exploded instead, stepping up its offensive
rebounding, using its own pressure defense to create turnovers and
running off the next 9 points, 6 by Thornton, who had 12 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the smaller St. John's lineup _ which, after
pulling Albert Richardson three minutes into the game, had nobody
on the floor anywhere close to the size of Connecticut's
6-foot-11-inch Jake Voskuhl _ grabbed 13 offensive rebounds and
scored 14 second chance points. The Red Storm caused nine
Connecticut turnovers and had five steals.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's tied the score at 26-26 with 8:20 left in the first
half after Postell grabbed a steal and fed Barkley, who ran the
fast break up the floor, only to pass the ball behind his back to
Postell for the layup, the end of a 23-10 St. John's run.
</P>
<P>
   After the game was tied again at 35-35 with 3:52 left in the
half, St. John's held Connecticut to just one score _ El-Amin's
3-pointer with 1:40 left _ and led at halftime, 43-38. &QL;

AFTER 10 SEASONS, VETERAN CYCLIST HOPES TO LEAVE HIS NAME IN
HISTORY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Italy, France, Spain, England, Calif.)  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Max Sciandri was still shaken an hour after he had been
introduced as the senior member of La Francaise des Jeux bicycle
team at a recent press conference here. ``It's my 11th year in the
sport and suddenly I'm presented as the oldest rider of the team,''
he said. ``The 10 years have gone by really quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to be one of the youngest riders on my teams,''
he continued in a tone of wonder, ``and now I'm the oldest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sciandri, who will be 32 on Feb. 15, was the first of 22
Francaise des Jeux riders introduced at a hotel in Paris a couple
of weeks ago. Across Europe, professional bicycle teams have been
staging their annual presentations, a chance for a little publicity
and a buffet lunch to thank their many suppliers before the
European season begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As officials admitted, La Francaise des Jeux slumped last year,
its second in the sport. In 1997, it won the team competition in
the World Cup series of classics and one of its riders, Frederic
Guesdon, won the esteemed Paris-Roubaix race, just as the French
team's directeur sportif, Marc Madiot, did in 1985 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   There were no comparable successes last year, and then the team
became marginally involved in the doping scandal that washed over
the Tour de France when three of its riders and its director were
questioned by the police.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Sciandri (pronounced SHAN-dree) seemed to speak for
the team when he said, ``I need a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his teammates, he has a high place to come back
to. He has won daily stages in all three big Tours, in France,
Italy and Spain, and finished in the top five in many one-day
classics, while winning one of them, the Leeds Classic in 1995. In
1993, he finished third in the World Cup standings and in 1996
third again in the road race at the Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Sciandri has ridden in three countries for six
teams, a high number but fitting for somebody as international as
he is. He was born in Derby, England, to Italian parents who had a
restaurant there and now have two in Los Angeles. Sciandri holds
dual nationality; in Italy, where he lives with his wife and two
children outside Florence, and in England, which he represents in
the Olympics and the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to finally win a classic, a big classic, to be on the
books,'' Sciandri said in an interview after the team presentation.
``I've been close for 10 years,'' a reference to third- and
fourth-place finishes in Milan-San Remo, a third-place finish in
the Grand Prix of Zurich, fifth- and 11th-place finishes in the
Tour of Flanders and a fifth-place finish in both the Amstel Gold
Race and Liege-Bastogne Liege _ all World Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being so close so many times,'' he said, ``this makes you be
more hungry. I want to be finally on the books _ these famous books
_ so one day when I look back, at least I left a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Sciandri might have left a few signs already if not for injuries
and bad luck. More than once, especially when he rode for the
American-based Motorola team in 1992, 1993 and 1996, he appeared to
be well set up for a victory that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to have had bad luck in my career,'' he said. ``A lot
of times. But I still carry on, doing my job, training in the right
way, doing all the right things. So, sooner or later, at least a
bit of luck has to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two years Sciandri has been dogged by injuries. He hurt
his back in a crash in November 1997 and was slow to return to form
last season, winning only two stages in the Dauphine Libere in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I was riding really well and it was getting close to the
world championships and I fell and broke my right arm during the
Zurich race in August. So I had to stay away from my bike for a
month and a half. Now I'm back on the bike, I've got 6,000 or 7,000
kilometers of training and I'm getting ready for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years I'm going to start from one again. You have to
have motivation, you have to believe in something. When you're
training, you see some races in your head. I already have Milan-San
Remo in my mind. That race will be held March 20. I know I don't
have so many years left, so I'm going to have to go really hard
right from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sciandri said he felt comfortable with his role as the senior
rider for a team that had no designated leader. ``I feel a bit more
responsible, especially because this team counts a lot on younger
riders,'' he said. ``That's something I like.'' The average age on
La Francaise des Jeux is 25.
</P>
<P>
   At that age, Sciandri won a stage in the Giro d'Italia, finished
second in Paris-Camembert and sixth in the Classica San Sebastian,
a World Cup race. ``Time's gone by quickly,'' he concluded. ``It's
been great, a really good time of my life these 10 years.
</P>
<P>

RUNNER-UP'S REVELATION TESTS THE TENNIS WATERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: France, Switzerland)   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ After her first Grand Slam final had
ended in a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Martina Hingis, Amelie Mauresmo sat at
a table outside the players' lounge Saturday and talked calmly and
confidently about her decision to make her homosexuality public
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Even before arriving at the Australian Open, the 19-year-old
Mauresmo said she had decided to talk about the topic, not because
she wanted to become a symbol or the focus of attention, but
because she did not want to dance around the subject throughout her
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the media asks me what's going on in my life, I'm obliged
to talk about this because it's part of my life,'' she said. ``And
here it is. It's clear that I'm not going to get unanimous support
for this. Not everybody is going to be behind my back saying,
`Super.' But no matter what I do, there will always be people
against me. With that in mind, I decided to make my sexuality
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be people who I hope will respect me for doing it
because it was my decision, and because there are many other
players who are the same way as I am and say nothing and act as if
nothing is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo, who is from Bornel, France, was asked if her decision
might serve as an example to those players. ``Perhaps,'' she said.
``I hope so for them, because right now they are the ones who are
having a hard time dealing with their situation. I feel sorry for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo's resolve to talk about her sexuality will be tested
most obviously by the corporate world. The last high-profile tennis
player to acknowledge her homosexuality, Martina Navratilova, never
received sponsorship and endorsement contracts commensurate with
her achievements before retiring in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a good test,'' said Pam Shriver, a former
president of the Women's Tennis Association and Navratilova's
former doubles partner. ``If the commercial world embraces her,
then it's a different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Shriver added: ``I think that as long as Amelie has done the
evaluation of coming out and knows what she's in for, that's fine.
But I hope she didn't go in blindly and think there weren't going
to be possible repercussions commercially, because there could
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo, who has a clothing contract, said: ``I think things
have evolved and, in my opinion, if they want to set me aside,
there will be dozens more who will take me. It's clear. And if they
let me go for that, they are jerks anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Shriver expressed her belief that ``there certainly won't be any
repercussions long term with the players in the locker room or the
way Amelie is treated at tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, there were repercussions in Melbourne.
Mauresmo came here with her new coach, Christophe Fournerie, and
her French girlfriend, Sylvie Bourdon. On Thursday, after her
semifinal victory, Hingis was asked about Mauresmo at a news
conference, which was broadcast around the tennis center, with
Swiss journalists who reported that she answered in a joking tone
in German: ``She's here with her girlfriend. She's half a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis later denied making the comment and explained that she
had said only that Mauresmo played like a man, but neither
Fournerie nor Mauresmo was convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to the press conference, and she really said that
`she was half a man because she was with a woman,''' said
Fournerie, who did not explain where he had listened to Hingis.
``She would do better to think before speaking. Despite her young
age, she has got responsibilities in light of her ranking. She
needs to understand certain things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo said Hingis' comment ``was a very bad joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw another interview after the doubles where she said, `I
didn't want to say it that way,''' Mauresmo said. ``But for me, it
was stupid on her part, really stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' news conference with the Swiss came on the same day that
a remarkably poised Mauresmo upset top-seeded Lindsay Davenport in
three sets. When Davenport met with reporters, she said, ``A couple
of times, I thought I was playing a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   She also made references to Mauresmo's broad shoulders and
power. Unlike Hingis in her purported comment, Davenport made no
reference to Mauresmo's sexuality, and she later made it clear that
she had been talking only about Mauresmo's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But the remarks from the world's two top-ranked players made the
front pages of several Australian newspapers on Friday. When
Mauresmo picked up the papers that morning to revel in her upset,
Bourdon said, she was quite disappointed. ``She was so happy when
she saw herself on the front pages, and then we saw that what was
below the pictures had nothing to do with tennis, and she was
clearly affected by this,'' Bourdon said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, before she left Melbourne, Davenport sent a
note of apology to Mauresmo, saying she was sorry that her comments
had contributed to the commotion. ``Her message was very important
for me, because I was very disappointed by what happened,''
Mauresmo said. ``It was good, and I appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9-inch Mauresmo expressed surprise that the 6-2
Davenport would be in awe of her power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay hits the ball harder than me; she is more powerful
than me, and she's six inches taller than me, so that really
shocked me,'' said Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her frustration with her opponents' comments and the
news media's treatment of them, Mauresmo said the unpleasantness
had not spoiled her first Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that when I walked on court, I wasn't thinking
about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who began the match with four Grand Slam singles titles
already to her credit, would prove the better and more consistent
player on Center Court. Mauresmo was nervous from the start, and
though she improved her performance in the second set and saved six
match points in the final game, Hingis' victory would take little
more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   After it ended and before they climbed the steps into the
president's box to accept their trophies and give their speeches,
the two European teen-agers exchanged a few words. According to
Mauresmo, Hingis apologized for what had happened. But Hingis said
after the match that she had told Mauresmo something she wished to
keep private but that ``there's nothing to apologize for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis added, ``I think we will talk a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   The last unseeded woman to reach a Grand Slam singles final was
Venus Williams, at the 1997 United States Open. Within a year,
Williams was in the top five. Mauresmo will be ranked at least 18th
as she heads off for vacation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She certainly did not expect to reach the final in Melbourne,
but after doing so, she attributed her success to being ``good and
happy'' in her private life and hiring Fournerie in December. She
also said that being open about her sexuality had made her feel
free on and off the court, but Mauresmo made it clear that she had
no intention of becoming a spokeswoman for others like herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to say it once and for all,'' she said, ``and now I
want us to talk about tennis.'

BRONX MAN IS ARRESTED IN A SERIES OF RAPES OF MASSEUSES 
 (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx man was arrested and was facing charges of
rape and robbery Saturday in a series of attacks on masseuses in
Manhattan, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified as Darryl Bolden, 35, was picked up after
phone records revealed that he had made phone calls to the victims,
said a police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Bolden, who is 6 feet 10 inches tall and
weighs about 340 pounds, matched the description given by the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   He was last arrested for two assaults in the early 1980s, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The police began looking for a serial rapist after Jan. 15, when
a 50-year-old masseuse living on West 69th Street reported that a
man who came in for an appointment had raped her and stolen $100.
</P>
<P>
   A 33-year-old masseuse in the same building then told the police
that she had been robbed of $400 on Dec. 13 by a client who fit the
same description. A few days later, a 46-year-old woman reported
that she had been raped and robbed by a man who fit the same
description in her home near West 75th Street on Sept. 24. Another
woman reported a similar attack on Jan. 21 near East 60th Street.

OUTDOORS: ELK MAY SOON ROAM CATSKILL RANGE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Mont., Pa., Wyo.)  (bl) 
By NICHOLAS KARAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wapiti, alias elk, may again roam the Catskill Mountains of New
York. This range of the Appalachian Mountains in southeastern New
York just west of the Hudson River was once the home of waapiti, as
the Shawnee called the elk and as the first colonists misnamed this
second-largest member of the deer family.
</P>
<P>
   The last New York elk was shot on the Raquette River, in the
Adirondacks, in 1847. Elk lasted longer in more southerly and
westerly areas of the state. The last trace of elk in New York
disappeared about 1870. About the same time, they also disappeared
on the west side of the Delaware River, on the Pocono Plateau in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the flood of resort-bound travelers to the Catskills
and Adirondacks that caused their demise, but rather subsistence
efforts of earlier settlers. Elk were sought as food and clothing
by America's frontier people, and as the population expanded
agriculture westward, the elk disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous Eastern elk are extinct, and so are six other
subspecies that once thrived in the United States and
central-western Canada. The Eastern elk (Cervus canadensis
canadensis erxleben) was somewhat smaller than the Western animals,
darker in color and crowned with lesser antlers.
</P>
<P>
   The only species that survived is the Yellowstone elk (Cervus
canadensis nelson bailey). It found sanctuary in this nation's
first federal park, Yellowstone National Park, established in 1872
by President Ulysses S. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has its way, elk will
return to the Catskills, where outdoor activities already include
fly-fishing for trout from spring to fall, rafting and canoeing in
the summer, and deer hunting in the late fall. Elk have been
successfully reintroduced recently in Pennsylvania, and New York
may be next.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle in the re-establishment of an elk herd in New
York is to locate suitable habitat. To find it, the foundation
endowed a two-year study, a joint venture by researchers at Cornell
University and SUNY's College of Environmental Science and
Forestry. The Catskills came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biologically, a few areas in the state, including portions of
the Catskills, have a relatively large amount of habitat that can
meet the needs of elk,'' William Porter of SUNY said.
</P>
<P>
   Deer hunters need not fear that the larger elk, 700 to 800
pounds, would drive out deer, Porter said. ``Elk probably will not
compete with white-tailed deer because the two species prefer
different foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Habitat, however, is not the big problem if elk are to be
successfully reintroduced. They must also find social acceptance
and approval among the human residents of areas where introduction
is proposed. This includes parts of Greene, Sullivan and Ulster
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eastern Catskill region has higher social feasibility than
other areas we examined,'' said Jody Enck of Cornell's human
dimensions research unit, ``because social and economic
characteristics of towns and villages here make them the most
likely to be able to benefit if elk restoration occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the area to handle tourist interests, a social
criterion, was a factor Enck used in his evaluation of various
regions. This area has a well-developed tourist-based economy and
the idea has already found support from outfitters, retailers and
motel/hotel interests.
</P>
<P>
   Approval for the introduction of elk to the area will come from
public debate, and sampling by the state's Department of
Environmental Conservation. The Rocky Mountain foundation and the
state department have been quick to point out that restoration of a
once-native species requires a public scoping process and
completion of a state environmental quality review process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the DEC would consider a proposal for the restoration
of elk,'' said Gary Parson, the department's wildlife bureau chief,
``we'd want to be sure that it was both biologically feasible and
that the local people are in favor of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The RMEF,'' according to its field director David Ragantesi,
who leads 2,000 members and 10 volunteer chapters in New York,
``has fulfilled its role by funding the study. Now we hope to
encourage public discussions about elk restoration in this area to
determine if local and regional support exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RMEF will be glad to assist these discussions by providing
information on positive and negative impacts of an elk
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1984, the elk foundation has more than 110,000
members nationwide who helped generate nearly $70 million to
conserve and enhance 2.3 million acres of wildlife habitat. The
RMEF is headquartered in Missoula, Mont. &QL;

COMMENTARY: WOODSTOCK HELPS MOTHER OUT OF CRISIS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IVER PETERSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. _ For people who feel trapped by city life, who
daydream about living without woes among the dharma spirit shops
and tie-dyed jogging tights of a rural arts colony like this one,
the reality is that even here, weird and sad things happen. It's
just that Woodstockers seem to be pretty good at coming to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a Woodstock moment last summer when the organizers of
a benefit for the local youth center, not wanting to take $12,000
in receipts home, stashed the proceeds in a clothes dryer for
overnight safekeeping. When half of the money _ but only half _ was
missing the next day, residents passed the hat and replaced the
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, residents have raised $20,000 to plug the gaps
in the medical insurance of a carpenter, Jonathan Kellogg, who has
leukemia. Roxy Dawn, a longtime resident, turned a solitary
Christmas 10 years ago into an annual Christmas party attended by
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   But however distressing the theft of donated money may be,
however dispiriting a solitary Christmas or frightening the onset
of a dread disease, few, if any, people in Woodstock have been
tested by the kinds of horrors that Sharon Wilber has faced.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock may have its quirks _ keeping sidewalks clear of ice
does not seem to be of much interest here _ but when trouble struck
Ms. Wilber, the town, led by an oil-burner repairman named
Christopher Neal, responded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilber was always the family rebel, she told her friends. At
38, she was the mother of eight children from two failed marriages
and other relationships, and she lived with her six youngest
children in a tiny, decrepit cabin owned by her mother, Edith
Murray, in the Bearsville Flats west of town.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Ms. Wilber's precarious life as a janitor and
community volunteer fell apart when her son Devin, 7, pushed his
bike out onto Route 212 without seeing a car that was bearing down
on him. He had been on his way to his grandmother's house. He died
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Neal, 49, born and raised in the Bronx, came up here 20 years
ago for the music and ``the scene.'' He has known Ms. Wilber almost
that long, so of course he attended Devin's wake. ``I said,
`Sharon, if there's anything I can do, you let me know,''' he
recalled. ``I mean, what could I do for her? But you always say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilber didn't ask for anything, but she had a piece of
offhand, awful news. ``She said, `Oh, by the way, my mother's
having the cabin bulldozed down. The boys are out there seeing what
they can get out,''' Neal recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It was true: In whatever spasm of grief or anger that held her,
Ms. Murray had chosen that moment to have the cabin that Ms. Wilber
and her children lived in knocked down. Ms. Murray said it was
unfit for habitation, The Woodstock Times reported. She had wanted
her daughter out for years, she told others. Ms. Murray and Ms.
Wilber later refused to speak of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Neal refused to speculate on Ms. Murray's motives. ``I don't
want to go there,'' he said. ``I don't think we can ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Neal chose to act. He knew that Steve Dallow, a
dentist and a volunteer fireman, had a three-bedroom house in the
Bearsville Flats for sale for $59,000. ``I said I'd come over and
write out a $1,000 check for a binder on the house,'' Neal said.
``Steve said, `Never mind the binder, just put the money in your
fund.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the next month and a half, while Ms. Wilber and her children
camped at the homes of friends, Neal wrote fund-raising letters,
knocked on doors and stood on the green with his dogs and a sign:
``Help Sharon Wilber.'' He got a lot of spare change, many small
checks and a few big ones. The summer people chipped in, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't give anybody any peace,'' said Gale Brownlee, who
watched Neal through the window of her Century 21 real estate
office on Main Street. ``He went door to door; he stood out there
and sold raffle tickets. He didn't let people forget for a minute
that there was a family in need.''
</P>
<P>
   By September, nearly $70,000 had been raised. It paid for a new
roof on the house, a full tank of oil and the title, free and
clear, in Ms. Wilber's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, those kids needed a home,' Neal said. ``The town came
through.''

COUNCIL NEGOTIATES WITH MAYOR OVER HOMELESS CENTER  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With four community agencies in Brooklyn facing
eviction as early as Monday, the New York City Council is in
last-minute negotiations with the Giuliani administration to avert
that showdown and to resolve broader policy disputes over the
city's homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the chances of a settlement, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said at a news conference Sunday that ``there are many ways to do
that.'' But he cautioned, ``We may be able to work it out; we may
not be able to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had said that the four groups would be removed from a
city-owned building to make room for a new homeless shelter, whose
creation he said was necessitated by a new law limiting the size of
shelters. The council, which passed the law over the mayor's veto,
has denied that the measure forces the creation of new shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said he chose the site, in the Cobble Hill
neighborhood, because it is in the district of Stephen DiBrienza,
the chairman of the council's General Welfare Committee and the
sponsor of the law on homeless shelters. The mayor has said that
DiBrienza wants more shelters, so one should be in his district.
But DiBrienza has said no new shelters are needed and has accused
the mayor of petty retaliation over other issues in the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan provoked a backlash, especially because it
would have forced out the 25-year-old South Beach mental health
program, which provides classes, counseling and other services for
about 500 outpatients. So he agreed to let that agency remain,
occupying three floors of the four-story building. But he said the
other groups would have to leave to make way for a small shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had warned that they would evict those
groups on Friday, the last business day of the current lease. But
because of the renewed negotiations, the officials relented.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's chief attorney, Corporation Counsel Michael
D. Hess, notified a lawyer for one group that ``the city will take
no action to terminate or disrupt your client, Families First,
Inc., at 250 Baltic St., prior to Monday, Feb. 1.'' That group
sponsors counseling, training and social activities for families.
</P>
<P>
   The other groups facing eviction are the Cobble Hill Civic
Association, Community Board No. 6 and a program for the elderly
run by the Heights and Hill Community Council.
</P>
<P>
   DiBrienza, the council's lead negotiator, said the last-minute
reprieve was a hopeful sign, but he expressed frustration that five
days of talks had not yet produced an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One major sticking point is the issue of providing temporary
accommodations for homeless families who sometimes must sleep
overnight in chairs or on the floor of the city's application
center, called the emergency assistance unit, in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inhumane conditions like people sleeping on floors is what we
want to stop,'' said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for the council
speaker, Peter Vallone. ``If there is other language for meeting
that goal, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBrienza agreed, saying, ``The real stumbling block is children
on the floor. They simply have to take them out and let them sleep
somewhere in the system'' of shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor contends that the key problem is a 200-bed limit on
the size of shelters that he says was imposed by the new law. He
says the law would force the city to build new shelters for 18,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   But the council says the limit applied to new shelters and
exempted existing ones, and it passed an amendment to reaffirm the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Now, DiBrienza said, the administration is concerned that the
200-bed limit would apply to the replacements for any of the
existing shelters, an issue raised by plans to redevelop the
Bellevue shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to come up with a formula for flexibility,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, it would be unfair to use the four
community groups as pawns in the dispute.

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Scattered showers did nothing to dampen the
enthusiasm of the Tennesseee faithful Saturday afternoon as more
40,000 turned out at Neyland Stadium for the official celebration
of Volunteers' 1998 football national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration of Tennessee's first national title since 1951
came almost a month after the Volunteers beat Florida State 23-16
in the Fiesta Bowl to wrap up a 13-0 season. Didn't matter. The
fans put on their Orange parkas and arrived in a mood to party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a lot of places in the country where you'd get
this many people to come out on a day like today,'' said Tennessee
coach Phillip Fulmer. ``But it doesn't surprise me. These people
are why this season was so special.''
</P>
<P>
   The event, originally scheduled for Jan. 16, already had been
postponed once due to a conflict with the inauguration of Gov. Don
Sundquist. Saturday's event was going to take place rain or shine
for many reasons, not the least of which was the presence of four
recruits on this, the last weekend before national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   Neyland Stadium, the nation's second-largest on-campus football
facility, was decked out for the occasion. A JumboTron television
screen was brought in and two hours before the ceremonies fans were
treated to a complete replay of the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Painted orange and white logos on the field proclaimed Tennessee
to be the ``1998 National Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans coming to and from the event scrambled to buy hats, shirts,
posters, and anything they could get their hands on that declared
the Vols to be No. 1 for the first time in 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   A number of dignitaries spoke, including Knoxville Mayor Victor
Ashe and university President Joe Johnson. Sundquist was a no-show
due to illness.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cheers of the day, however, were reserved for
Fulmer, linebacker and captain Al Wilson, and long-time radio voice
John Ward, who retired at the end of the season after 31 years at
the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just an incredible day,'' said Wilson. ``But you knew
after the kind of season we had, the people were going to turn out
no matter what. This place is really something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee team received four different national championship
trophies during the ceremonies: Associated Press (media poll);
Sears (coaches poll); McArthur Bowl (College Football Hall of
Fame); and Grantland Rice (Football Writers Association of
America).
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer, now 67-11 in seven seasons at Tennessee, received two
national coach of the year awards: one from the American Football
Coaches Association and the other from the FWAA.
</P>
<P>
   The team also received the official SEC championship trophy from
Commissioner Roy Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl sent a contingent to present the game's
championship trophy. Fiesta Bowl trophies also went wide receiver
Peerless Price, the offensive MVP, and to Dwayne Goodrich, the
defensive MVP.
</P>
<P>
   The day concluded with closing remarks from Fulmer who reminded
the crowd that when he took over as coach in 1992, he promised to
take the program to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're there,'' said Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Fulmer ended his celebration of the championship.
There was work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, signing day is Wednesday. The Orange White
spring game is April 24 and the Vols' 1999 opener is on Sept. 4
with Wyoming.

NETS APPLYING THE PRESSURE TO IMPROVE DEFENSIVE SCHEME
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not quite the Chicago Bulls, the Miami Heat or the old
Bad Boys from the Detroit Pistons, but the New Jersey Nets are
showing improvement defensively. In their 92-90 exhibition victory
over the New York Knicks on Friday night, they proved that coach
John Calipari's increased emphasis on defense is bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal from Wednesday night's loss at Madison Square
Garden, when Latrell Sprewell hit wide-open jump shots and split
their defense for uncontested finger rolls, the Nets provided
adequate resistance in their final preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   With their rugged defender Jayson Williams playing only
sparingly, the Nets held the Knicks to 39 percent shooting from the
field, made 12 steals and pressured the Knicks into 24 turnovers.
Two nights earlier, the Knicks had blitzed their defense by making
49 percent of their shots.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Patrick Ewing played only eight minutes Friday because
of a mild knee sprain, but Sprewell, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson
and the rest of the Knicks' top players spent significant time
trying to break down the Nets' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a ways away,'' Calipari said. ``But I think our
players have a better idea of what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Gill was among the most impressive defenders, especially
in the final minutes. With 5 minutes 58 seconds left and the score
tied, Calipari walked down his bench, looked at Gill and said, ``Go
get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari was referring to Sprewell, who had erupted for 11
third-quarter points and had just blown by Sherell Ford to draw a
foul. But with Gill covering him like a muscle shirt, Sprewell did
not score again, had one shot blocked and missed a potential
game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I relish those moments,'' said Gill, who scored 14 points. ``I
love making the big play, whether it be defensive or offensive. Cal
always puts me in that situation, and he's counting on me to come
up with a big play or something.''
</P>
<P>
   While Calipari's focus on improving the Nets players' perimeter
footwork _ with the aim to stop opponents from driving past them _
has helped, the greatest factor in the Nets' improvement has been
the addition of Jim McIlvaine.
</P>
<P>
   In both games, the 7-foot-1-inch center has been as good as
advertised, blocking five shots in 44 minutes. After finishing 26th
in the league in blocks last year with an average of 3.8 a game,
the Nets swatted 12 shots in the games with the Knicks. In one
first-half sequence on Friday, McIlvaine blocked Houston's layup
after Houston had gone by Gill and then rejected Kurt Thomas'
putback attempt.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine's presence allows the Nets to keep gambling on the
perimeter without always paying the price when their aggressiveness
gives opponents a path to the basket. ``I don't have to worry about
whether my man is driving on me when he's in there,'' Gill said.
``When Houston got past me, McIlvaine smacked it right out of
there. It was a pleasant surprise to have him back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as critical to the Nets' turnaround has been their
defensive rebounding. As strong as Williams is on the glass, the
Nets were a terrible defensive rebounding team last season.
Opponents scored many second- and third-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Williams playing a total of only 42 minutes in
both games, the Nets kept the Knicks from dominating the offensive
boards. The Knicks had seven offensive rebounds on Wednesday and
nine on Friday. The Nets, who outrebounded the Knicks in both
games, had a total of 37 offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be a better defensive rebounding team and I think
we're starting to do it and starting to concentrate,'' Calipari
said. ``But we still have a ways to go in a lot of areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' most glaring defensive deficiency on Friday was on
transition. In the first quarter alone, the Knicks scored 11 points
by beating the Nets up the floor. While the Knicks are not the
plodders they used to be, that still is unacceptable. ``If the
Knicks can make that a strength in a game with us, we're in deep
trouble,'' Calipari said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Nets are better defensively, but still not good
enough.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have offered Scott Burrell a one-year deal with
$537,500. Burrell, who can get the same amount in Houston, Miami or
Milwaukee, wants to play for the Nets but wants to be signed for
the $1 million exception. The Nets do not appear willing to give
Burrell more money and are expecting him to make a decision Sunday
or Monday. The free agent small forward visited Miami on Saturday.
The Nets also are interested in reacquiring Jim Jackson, the
seventh-year free agent guard who averaged 16.5 points, 5.8
rebounds and 5 assists with them in 33 games during the 1996-97
season.  &QL;

   &UR; THE SENSE OF REALITY: STUDIES IN IDEAS AND THEIR HISTORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Isaiah Berlin. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In nine essays, the eminent philosopher argues that the search
for a utopian society is the pursuit of a fantasy and that ideas
have consequences, but rarely those that are expected. ``For anyone
wanting to understand the twists and turns of the history of ideas,
this book will be indispensable,'' John Gray wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLOUDSPLITTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Russell Banks. Harper Perennial, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling novel about the abolitionist John Brown, selected
by the editors of The New York Times Book Review as one of the best
books of 1998, is narrated by his third son, Owen, and is less a
historical epic about slavery than a domestic drama about the
challenge of living with a fanatic. The story tracks Owen's growth
from introverted son to struggling disciple to firebrand officer in
the bloody holy war of his father, whose failed raid on Harpers
Ferry in 1859 was one of the fuses that touched off the Civil War.
Last year in these pages, Walter Kirn praised the book's ``rich and
soulful'' language.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PILLAR OF FIRE: AMERICA IN THE KING YEARS, 1963-1965 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Taylor Branch. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17.
</P>
<P>
   This middle volume of a planned trilogy on the life and times of
Martin Luther King Jr. covers such fateful events as the
assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Malcolm X and the signing of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ``By giving King such epic treatment,
Branch implies that he was an epic hero,'' Alan Wolfe wrote here in
1998. ``The great merit of Branch's stunning accomplishment is to
prove definitively that he was.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEARING THE CROSS: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., AND THE SOUTHERN
CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David J. Garrow. Quill/Morrow, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This book maintains that while the victories of the civil rights
movement were not King's alone, his leadership was indispensable.
In 1986 the reviewer Howell Raines, said ``Garrow has provided the
fundament of fact on which future King biographies must rest.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VISITORS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anita Brookner. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This intensely introspective novel focuses on an emotionally
remote 70-year-old widow struggling to maintain her dignity in a
world without happy endings. ```Visitors' may be the book Brookner
has spent her life aiming toward,'' Jacqueline Carey wrote last
year. ``Nothing distracts us from the lesson that even failure can
entail an incredible triumph of will.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Geraldine Brooks. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after reaching out to pen pals in the Middle East,
Europe and America to escape her isolated childhood in 1960s
Australia, a journalist travels abroad to seek them out. In 1998
the reviewer Valerie Sayers, called this a ``charming and sharply
intelligent'' memoir ``full of a generous interest in the life
beyond the self.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DESTINY OF FIRE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Zo Oldenbourg. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 13th-century France, this novel chronicles the suffering
of a noble family that was part of a pacifist sect deemed heretical
by the Roman Catholic Church, and whose members were persecuted
during the ensuing Albigensian Crusade. ``Oldenbourg brings back to
us the cruelty and terror of one of the unhappiest episodes in the
long story of man's inhumanity to man,'' Thomas Caldecot Chubb
wrote in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNICORN'S BLOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Finney. Picador USA, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale of intrigue at Queen Elizabeth I's court
involving the pursuit of a stolen diary said to contain secrets
that could threaten the queen's reign. ``Finney's intricate novel''
is ``swiftly moving and deftly woven,'' Julie Gray wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TSAR: THE LOST WORLD OF NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Kurth. Photographs by Peter Christopher. Back
Bay/Little, Brown, $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   This account of the last reigning Romanovs acknowledges their
political blunders and moral failings while emphasizing their
benevolent acts and abiding love for each other. In 1995, Francine
du Plessix Gray called the narrative ``amply documented and
compellingly written'' and the color photographs of Romanov sites
``as beautiful as any pictures I've seen of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOSCOW: GOVERNING THE SOCIALIST METROPOLIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy J. Colton. Belknap/Harvard University, $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   This book traces the history of the Russian capital and the
politics that shaped it. In 1996 our reviewer, Stephen Kotkin, said
the author succeeds in ``superbly demonstrating the depth of the
Soviet-era contribution to the ancient city's outer face and inner
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HORACE AFOOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Frederick Reuss. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this novel is a monkish middle-aged oddball, living
in a small town, who succumbs to the tug of intimacy when he
befriends a dying librarian and a self-destructive woman. The
result is ``a sly satire of Midwestern life and a restrained
account of how a closed heart comes to be unlocked,'' David Sacks
wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUMMER OF BETRAYAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Hong Ying. Translated by Martha Avery. Grove, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A young poet's life unravels after she gets swept up in the 1989
Tiananmen Square protests and later finds her lover in bed with
another woman. ``Hong Ying's prose ... is both sensuous and
lapidary, eloquently expressing the novel's wide emotional and
intellectual range,'' Philip Gambone wrote in 1997.

 &HT;    Managers fighting to keep trial alive
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Illinois Republican Rep. Henry Hyde once compared
prosecuting the impeachment trial of President Clinton to walking
into the ``jaws of political death.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde and his prosecutors seem to be snatching life from
those jaws. Every time the first impeachment trial in 131 years
seems to be on the verge of dying, the House Republican prosecutors
find a way to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was less than two months ago that Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said he had ``no plans'' for a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   When the House voted Dec. 19 to impeach the president, forcing
the Senate's hand to conduct a trial, Lott said the trial would be
quick, over in as little as five days.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the standoff with Hyde and his fellow prosecutors
over calling witnesses to bolster their case that the president
lied under oath and obstructed justice to conceal his affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors let Lott know there would be no case unless they
present a full case with opening arguments, witnesses and closing
arguments. The Senate balked, but it did give the House managers a
piece of what they wanted: a full three days of opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Then the prosecutors applied pressure for witnesses. And much to
the chagrin of Senate Democrats, and even some Republicans, they
got another inch.
</P>
<P>
   They won the right to question three key witnesses under oath
and videotape sessions for possible use on the Senate floor. In the
end the witnesses may not be live, but they are allowed to be
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans call it sheer persistence. Democrats say it is more
like a relentless obsession by ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts are these: The House prosecutors have won
incremental victories from the Senate. And none is as important as
the right to question Lewinsky once more under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Lewinsky has been heard only on audiotapes from
conversations she had with her former friend Linda Tripp. Her
depositions for independent counsel Kenneth Starr were recorded on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky will be questioned by Rep. Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.) on
Monday. Presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal then will be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will be queried by Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) about how
he helped Lewinsky with a job search in New York City and whether
that job search was to buy her silence about her affair with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal will answer questions from Rep. James Rogan
(R-Calif.) about what the president told him about his affair with
Lewinsky and whether Clinton lied about Lewinsky with the idea that
Blumenthal would pass along the false information to others.
</P>
<P>
   And while the House prosecutors say they have been told by the
Senate leadership that they will not be allowed to call the three
witnesses to testify in person, the procedure approved by the
Senate on Thursday does not preclude that from happening, and it
even allows for the possibility of a vote on additional witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the House prosecutors were able to put a foot in the
door to keep it open. Political scientists say it is rare for the
House to have extracted so much from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House managers have carefully and gingerly gotten much of
what they want by understanding they can't push too far,'' said
William Connelly, professor of politics at Washington &AMP; Lee
University. ``They understood you have to settle for less than the
whole loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the House prosecutors say they are ``deeply unsatisfied''
with accepting less than a full loaf. They say the Senate has let
down the country by not hearing the story about the president's
conduct from witnesses. Witnesses, they say, will tell what
documents and videotapes can not.
</P>
<P>
   Several prosecutors, including Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia and
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are so frustrated by the process
that they would now like to see the independent counsel statute
overhauled if not removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten a quarter of the loaf,'' Barr said about the
impeachment trial to date. ``The Senate has forced us to
dramatically and unfairly cut back the number of witnesses we
requested. They have apparently decided we will have no opportunity
to have live witnesses and they apparently will give the White
House time for witnesses, so there again, they get the last word.''
</P>
<P>
   The country has been ``shortchanged'' in Barr's view because
they have heard a story about partisan warfare, instead of a story
about how the president violated the rule of law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr is not alone in openly expressing his frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this process has resulted in an outcome that won't
be legitimized by our public institutions and the people of
America,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon (R-Utah).
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, the chance that the House prosecutors will win
a single Democrat in the vote to oust the president is very slim.
But that does not stop the House from pushing on, refusing to give
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers have succeeded in keeping it (the trial) alive,
but it is on life support and the patient chart is on the steady
downhill slide,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of politics at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said he was surprised that the Senate leadership has put
so much on the line in accommodating the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised that the 55 Republican senators are seemingly
more concerned about the health of House Republicans than they are
about Senate Republicans,'' Sabato said. ``They don't want to pull
the rug out from the House but in the process they may be
endangering the GOP majority in 2000 in the Senate.

   OLY-CONFLICT-OFINTEREST _ Alex Gilady is a part-time executive
for NBC. He also is an IOC member who works on the committee's
radio/TV commission. He was a middleman in the negotiations between
the two entities for the TV contract _ and made money from both
sides. He is an example of people who work both sides of the fence
behind the Olympic scenes and raises conflict-of-interest
questions. This system apparently will continue even while the IOC
cleans up its act on awarding bid cities. (Fish, Atlanta

   GLF-DUVAL _ David Duval is in one of the hottest ``zones'' in
golf history, a stretch that continued last Sunday with a
record-setting 59 at the Bob Hope. His golf game is so solid, so
terrifying for competitors, that they all wish he'd pack it up and
go home. ``We're playing for second,'' is the common refrain. For
years, critics snickered that Duval didn't have what it takes to
win. Now, after winning the first two tournaments of 1999 and more
than an $1 million in January, they think he may never lose.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

 &HT;    Shaw overcomes odds to be honored in Hall of Fame
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Two players whose brilliant careers have at times been
overshadowed by their off-field indiscretions withstood some of the
most intense scrutiny ever imposed by a board of 36 selectors here
Saturday to gain induction into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But while linebacker Lawrence Taylor and tailback Eric Dickerson
will garner most of the headlines for the five-man Class of '99,
the honoree who might have overcome the longest odds was Billy
Shaw. A former Georgia Tech linebacker who went on to star at
offensive guard for the Buffalo Bills (1961-69), Shaw became the
first player ever to spend his entire career in the old AFL to gain
admission to the pro football shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Also selected for induction Aug. 7 in Canton, Ohio, were
offensive guard Tom Mack and tight end Ozzie Newsome.
</P>
<P>
   ''During this week, I've had some time to reflect on the years
of the AFL and all of the ridicule we put up with for being the
so-called `new guys' and the perseverence we had to have,'' Shaw
said Saturday afternoon from his home in Toccoa. ''A lot of great
players had to perform in obscurity until the league finally got
accepted. It's a humbling thing to represent those players, to
carry their banner into the Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was the nominee of the Hall of Fame's seniors committee,
which nominates one candidate a year.
</P>
<P>
   He was a two-platoon performer at Tech for coach Bobby Dodd, but
his physique and quickness made him a natural at guard. He played
in eight AFL all-star games, and was named to pro football's
all-decade team for the '60s. He was a captain on the Bills' two
AFL championship squads but retired before the league began playing
a merged schedule with the NFL in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were two outstanding offensive linemen in the (AFL), Ron
Mix and Billy Shaw,'' said Sports Illustrated football writer Paul
Zimmerman, who extensively covered the league. ``(Shaw) was a
better player even than Gene Upshaw.'' Bills owner Ralph Wilson
noted that Shaw was ''a great team leader who had a heart of
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw awaited word on the Hall of Fame voting Saturday morning
with wife Patsy, and several of the couple's close friends. Shaw,
who earned the nickname ''Steady Eddie'' during his playing career,
conceded that the last few days were nervous ones for him. Shaw
knew, he said, that deliberations on the Hall voting began at 7:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''By about 10:30 or so,'' he said, ''I thought my heart was
going to stop I was so nervous. When the phone rang with the news .
. . that was quite a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting session took nearly four hours, believed to be the
longest discussion ever on the 15 candidates, and the debate on
Taylor took 34 minutes alone. Selectors described the presentation
of Taylor as even but intense. Although he redefined linebacker
play and rates inarguably as one of the greatest defenders in NFL
history, Taylor came under fire because of his well-documented drug
problems. Taylor currently is in a treatment program for cocaine
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate must receive 80 percent of the votes for induction
and it is believed that the decision on Taylor was a close one.
Several New York-area newspapers conducted polls of the selectors
last week and most confirmed there were at least seven voters
opposed to Taylor's induction.
</P>
<P>
   In a statment released through the New York Giants organization,
Taylor said: ''I feel like it is the ultimate reward for playing
the game that I've loved so much and gave so much to. I appreciate
the debate and the consideration that was given my nomination.
Utlimately, this honor has to do with how I played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, who still holds the single-season rushing record with
2,105 yards in 1984, is the third-leading rusher in league history.
Mack played 13 seasons for the Rams and played in 11 Pro Bowl
games. Newsome tops all NFL tight ends in receptins with 662.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson played one month of the '93 season with the Atlanta
Falcons but his name does not appear in the media guide. He was the
only one of the five honorees to be here for the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never made it to the Super Bowl, so this is my Super Bowl,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   CLASS OF 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the likely candidates for the Hall of Fame next
year:
</P>
<P>
   _ QB Joe Montana: Four Super Bowl titles make him a lock-in his
first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   _ S Ronnie Lott: A big hitter with range, finished brilliant
career with 63 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   _ QB Phil Simms: Didn't make it to finals this year, but support
for him will pick up.
</P>
<P>
   _ DE Howie Long: Played all four positions along defensive front
played them all well.
</P>
<P>
   _ Owner Dan Rooney: Steelers boss played key role in
establishing labor peace in NFL.
</P>
<P>
   CLASS OF 1999 PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME BIOS
</P>
<P>
   ERIC DICKERSON, Running Back
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Rams (1983-87), Indianapolis Colts
</P>
<P>
   (1987-91), L.A. Raiders (1992),
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (1993)
</P>
<P>
   _ Ran for a record 2,105 yards with the Rams in 1984. He stands
third on the career rushing list with 13,259 yards, having rushed
for more than 1,000 yards seven times. Was the No. 1 pick by the
Rams and second player overall by the Rams in 1983. Named NFL
Player of the Year in 1984 and the NFL Offensive Player of the Year
</P>
<P>
   in 1986. Gained a playoff record 248 yards rushing in 1985

blockbuster trade that involved the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   TOM MACK, Guard
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Rams (1966-78)
</P>
<P>
   _ Although he never made it to a Super Bowl, Mack was a frequent
postseason player. He was selected to play in Pro Bowls 11 times in
13 years. One reason was his durability; he never missed a game
because of injury. The No. 1 pick by the Rams in 1966 played in 184
straight games.
</P>
<P>
   OZZIE NEWSOME, Tight end
</P>

Named to pro football's All-Decade Team of the 1960's and All-Time
AFL Team. The captain for eight seasons, played on the Bills'

 &HT;    Reeves can take big leap toward Hall with Falcons win
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The events of Saturday did not bode well for the
eventual candidacy of Dan Reeves to the Hall of Fame, and the
Atlanta Falcons coach may need an upset victory in Super Bowl
XXXIII today to merit consideration for the pro football shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the '98 finalists rejected by Hall of Fame selectors on
Saturday were coaches Marv Levy and George Allen. Both men had
sparkling resumes but the one element that factored into the
voting, acknowledged several of the 36 selectors, was that neither
of them ever won a Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, of course, lost four Super Bowl games with the Buffalo
Bills. Despite a career winning percentage of .681, Allen was a
loser in his lone Super Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a four-time Super Bowl loser with the Minnesota
Vikings, selectors inducted coach Bud Grant in 1994. But it took
several years for Grant to finally crack the Hall, and sentiment
Saturday seemed to indicate that any coach elected in the future
may need at least one Super Bowl triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is 0-3 in Super Bowl games, all during his tenure with
the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, Dan has to keep Atlanta on top to have a real shot,''
said longtime Buffalo News columnist Larry Felser, one of the Hall
of Fame selectors. ''The fact he has taken two different franchises
to Super Bowls gets him some attention but it probably doesn't get
him into (the Hall of Fame). Now if he takes a team like Atlanta,
which has had a miserable history, and wins the thing, that could
do it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no players, coaches or administrators with anything
more than flimsy ties to the Falcons in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta coach Norm Van Brocklin (1968-1974) was inducted
in 1971 for his contributions on the field, not the sideline. Wide
receiver Tommy McDonald, who went into the Hall last summer, spent
the 1968 season with the Falcons, but it came in the twilight of a
career most associated with the Philadelphia Eagles. Running back
Eric Dickerson, one of five men inducted Saturday, spent the first
month of the '93 season with the Falcons. While a Falcons helmet
appeared on the Dickerson press release that was distributed here
Saturday, the team doesn't even list him in its media guide as ever
having played for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 seasons, Reeves is seventh among winningest coaches
with 172 victories. Five of the six men ahead of him _ Don Shula,
George Halas, Reeves' mentor Tom Landry, Curly Lambeau and Chuck
Noll _ already are in the Hall of Fame but all of them have
championships on their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The only one of the six not enshrined at Canton is Chuck Knox,
and he rung up 193 wins in 22 years. Like Reeves, however, Knox
never won a Super Bowl and selectors seem unmoved by the fact he
resurrected three franchises. Knox has yet to be a finalist, and a
survey of selectors here last week indicated waning support for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think (Reeves) is a viable candidate unless he wins
the big game,'' said selector Jerry Magee of the San Diego
Union-Tribune. ''His career is reminiscent of Don Coryell's
coaching tenure. Great regular-season record but no trophies.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight men who coached teams since the 1970 merger are in the
Hall of Fame and they have an aggregate 17 Super Bowl victories.
All but Grant have at least one Super Bowl win and, of that group,
all but Weeb Ewbank of the New York Jets are multiple winners.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' winning percentage of .580 is superior to that of Ewbank
(.507) and Noll (.572). But it is far below those of Hall of Fame
coaches Vince Lombardi (.740), Joe Gibbs (.683), Shula (.665), Bill
Walsh (.617), Grant (.607) and Landry (.601).
</P>
<P>
   A victory today, though, would go a long way toward closing the
gap and there is some dissenting opinion among selectors that
Reeves' current record is good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been three places now and won, and that deserves
consideration,'' said Boston Globe columnist and Hall of Fame
selector Will McDonough. ''I don't think he has to win a Super Bowl
for us to think seriously about him.''

   CHINA-ONECHILD _ BEIJING _ There are hundreds of thousands of
``missing girls,'' in China every year. The result of abortion,
infanticide or abandonment, all happening at incredible rates
because Chinese parents can have only one or two kids. And they
still want sons, not daughters, so they dispose of the females.
This is reflected in China's increasingly skewed sex ratio, most
recently documented at a record 120 boys to every 100 girls.
(Natural rate is 105/100.) The more efficient Chinese birth control
cadres become at limiting births, the more girls go missing. And
the more difficult life will be for Chinese young men as they come
of age, lacking girls to marry. One woman related that many women
in their village respond to the government limitation on babies by
getting ultrasound examinations and then having abortions if they
discover the fetus is female. ``I know many people who do this,''
she said. ``Medically, it's very safe now.'' The American angle on
this is that thousands of abandoned baby girls have become
available for foreign adoption. More than 4,000 American families
took home Chinese girls last year. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox News

skeletal problems as well as fetal monitoring. ATL Ultrasound is
one of at least three American medical equipment companies whose
ultrasound technology is now in widespread use at Chinese hospitals
and clinics. Others include General Electric and Hewlett-Packard.

cattle were swept away by the mudslides and floods spawned by
Hurricane Mitch last fall. Hundreds of roads, bridges, water and

industry has always been much admired for the advances it's made.

Israel's May 17 prime ministerial showdown fits the theory. What we

representing small factions and realigning the country's political
map. There has been little talk about issues, but already, Israel
has seen major players change parties, Watergate-styled break-ins

   w/ISRAEL-GENERALS _ JERUSALEM _ If you want to be Israeli prime
minister, it helps if you're an army general. Its even better if
you personally snuffed out a couple terrorists. The Labor Party
candidate, former General Ehud Barak, did. In the 1980s, he dressed
like a woman, sneaked into a downtown Beirut apartment and shot
three PLO fighters. Also on the operation, but headed to a
different apartment block, was one of Barak's opponents, recently
retired Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who won Israel's highest medal
for bravery on the mission. Former Gen. Moshe Arens is also running
with his own party and others are being courted to join the parties
in their campaigns. Current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu never
got above captain (though he was in Barak's unit), but it does not
change the fact that a country on constant guard against security
threats has frequently turns to its military leaders for the top
political post. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) MOVED FRIDAY

   RUSSIA-SECEDE _ IVANGOROD, Russia The grass wasn't always
greener on the other side of the border. But now it is, and the
residents of this depressed Russian border town want to secede and
become part of the neighboring country of Estonia. In Soviet times,
there was little difference between Ivangorod and the Estonian town
of Narva across the border. Now, Estonia's economy is booming while
Russia is in the grips of yet another economic crisis. Novogorod
has petitioned both Russia and Estonia to shift the border, but
neither government is much interested. Estonia is seeking NATO and
European Union membership; adding a border dispute would only
complicate issues with Russia. (Holmes, Cox News Service) MOVED

rented Kull the Conqueror from a video store and bought a few
groceries in Murphy, N.C., then disappeared as police descended on
his trailer, where the lights were still on. In Murphy and nearby
Andrews, Rudolph remains a topic of conversation _hero to some,

survived two killer winters in the outdoors? Or is he outdoors? Or
in one of the old mines where he used to play? Or in somebody's

   RUDOLPH-VIET _ It has now been a year since Atlanta and
Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph slipped into the
heavily wooded mountains around Andrews, N.C., with federal law
enforcement agents only a few hours behind him. Despite the
closeness of the pursuit of Rudolph and fresh leads last year at
this time, the anti-government recluse and former airborne soldier
has managed to elude one of the most intensive and concentrated
manhunts in recent law enforcement history over the last 12 months.
Rudolph is threatening to become as enigmatic and as elusive a
target as fabled hijacker D.B. Cooper, who disappeared into the
Pacific Northwest on Thanksgiving Eve 1971 with $200,000 in
Northwest Airlines' money after parachuting from one of their
Mexico-bound jets. Rudolph's hunters appear no closer now to
tightening the noose on their quarry than they were when they first
showed up in Andrews. If anything, the feds have gotten bogged down
in a mission that has developed eerie similarities to the U.S.
military involvement in Vietnam. There may never be a satisfactory
conclusion to the Rudolph hunt, just as Vietnam ended without any

failure rate breaks out at each of the 15 public and 19 private
colleges with education programs. The results at historically black
colleges, we hear, are so bad that the agency that administers the
test, the Professional Standards Commission, has agreed with their
demands that scores be broken down by race at all 34 schools _ to
show, for example, that blacks at UGA and GSU did almost as bad as
students at Paine College or Fort Valley State. This tests
subject-matter knowledge, the area that needs strengthening but is
not something colleges of education have traditionally been
accountable for. Denying certificates to, say, 50 or 60 percent of
the graduates of a historically black college is a controversial
move _ threatening the college's very existence in the case of
Paine College in Augusta, and further depressing an already scarce
supply of minority teachers. PSC is giving us exclusive on stats

   DELPHI _ The unions that represent GM's Dayton-area workers have
agreed to promote the Delphi Automotive Systems spinoff to
potential investors in a stunning turnaround for GM-Union
relations. Nick Nichols, chief GM negotiator for the IUE, delivered
a speech late last year to about 600 GM executives and received a
standing ovation. Nichols' theme was that GM and its workers must
be partners in this spinoff if it's to succeed. In exchange for the
IUE's support, GM has agreed to extend the retirement benefits
cut-off date for IUE members until Oct. 1. IUE will also be
eligible for significant discounts on trucks and cars through 2000.
This contrasts to the heated battles that have characterized GM's
relations with the UAW, it's largest union. But there is some
evidence, at least here in the Miami Valley, that the frostiness
between GM and the local UAW membership is thawing. (Wagner, Dayton

STRONG REACTION TO GOVERNOR'S DECISION TO SPARE LIFE OF KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL AND KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Death penalty opponents were gleeful Friday over
Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's decision to spare the life of a
condemned killer after Pope John Paul II made a personal plea for
the man's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous act of mercy, something you don't see from
politicians nowadays,'' said the Rev. Larry Rice of St. Louis. ``He
didn't wait until the last minute; he didn't cut corners. He's to
be commended.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice and others said they hoped Carnahan's action _ combined
with the pope's two-day visit and his pointed call for the
abolition of the death penalty _ would invigorate their movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's political opponents criticized his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he changed Darrell Mease's death sentence to life
without parole out of respect for the pope and the pope's direct
request for mercy that came after a prayer service Wednesday in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Mease, 52, was convicted of the ambush slayings of his former
drug partner, the man's wife and their paraplegic grandson in
southwest Missouri in 1988. He was scheduled to be executed on Feb.
10.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, director of the New Life Evangelist Center, said he plans
to start a petition drive to abolish capital punishment. He said he
hopes to gather enough signatures to put the issue on the November
2000 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that public sentiment has
traditionally favored the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Early reaction to Carnahan's decision indicates that still may
be true. The governor's office received about 200 calls Friday,
many of them critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten more that I would characterize as supportive of
the death penalty than those who are against it,'' said Chris
Sifford, Carnahan's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Republicans said the decision could be an issue in next
year's Senate race between Democrat Carnahan and Republican U.S.
Sen. John Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Duwe, spokesman for the state GOP, said Mease ``was the
poster boy for the death penalty in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't execute Darrell Mease, who can we execute?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leader Delbert Scott's office received several
e-mails and telephone calls critical of Carnahan's decision, said
Scott Swain, Scott's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting some phone calls and they are not happy,''
Swain said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sifford said the governor's office was not surprised by the
reaction. He said Joe Bednar, Carnahan's legal counsel, planned to
contact the son of the couple killed by Mease to explain why the
governor spared the life of the man who killed his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Sifford said the governor's office was unsuccessful in reaching
the victims' family on Thursday and planned to apologize for the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less critical of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hill, executive director of the Missouri Baptist Convention,
said Baptists would have a wide range of views on the issue, but he
did not object to Carnahan's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal basis, I feel comfortable with the governor
responding to a plea for mercy,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mike Schilling, a Springfield Democrat who has
introduced a bill to end the death penalty, said
government-sanctioned killing perpetuates a cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continual churning of a vengeful attitude throughout
society,'' Schilling said. ``People are horrified by a really
gruesome murder and what's the first thing they ask? `Are you going
to seek the death penalty?' Politicians have demagogued this issue
so they look tough on crime. But it is vulgarizing our culture.''

DISCOUNT DENVER IF THE MOON IS BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: This is the time of year when all the weird and
off-beat auguries start telling us whether it's going to be a good
year or bad year for stock players.
</P>
<P>
   The January Barometer, for instance, on Friday forecast an up
market for 1999. The barometer's custodian, Stock Trader's Almanac
publisher Yale Hirsch, says it has only registered three
significant bad calls since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   If the Standard &AMP; Poor's composite index ends January with a
gain, according to the barometer, things look rosy for the market.
Since the S&AMP;P 500 ended the trading month well on the plus side,
this is an encouraging sign. While the barometer gave significantly
false signals in 1966, 1968 and 1982, Hirsch says, it has never
been wrong in the years when a new Congress convened.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's the Super Bowl Predictor, with which
nearly everyone in the stock market seems familiar. The other day a
colleague looked at the Denver-Atlanta match-up and said, ``Well,
it doesn't matter who wins this year, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl Predictor, in case you haven't heard, is based on
the big game's history since 1967. When a National Conference team
wins, the market as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
usually up. It's also bullish when an American Conference team wins
if it was an NFL member before the NFL merged with the American
Football League. Conversely, when an American Conference team wins,
the average usually declines.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl Predictor has a success rate of nearly 90
percent, but Denver's participation throws an anomalous wrinkle
into this year's game, which prompted the colleague's observation.
Even though American Conference champ Denver won last year, the
stock market still had a spectacular year. Moreover, Denver was
involved two of the other three times the Super Bowl Predictor was
wrong. Even though NFL teams beat the Broncos in 1978 and 1990, the
Dow Jones lost ground both years.
</P>
<P>
   So, based on Denver's history, the team's penchant for throwing
the Super Bowl Predictor out of kilter makes it a highly
questionable indicator this year regardless of who wins.
</P>
<P>
   If these prognosticatory staples are too old hat, here's a new
toy to play with. It isn't geared to predicting the market's
full-year performance, but it sure is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the ``Blue Moon Theory,'' and credit Market Logic with
the research into this weird bit of market lore. A ``blue moon,''
incidentally, is the second full moon to happen during a single
month. Although they usually occur only once every 2 years or so,
1999 will have two such occurrences. The first will be Sunday
night, and the second will be Wednesday, March 31.
</P>
<P>
   What Market Logic has discovered is that the S&AMP;P 500 has
better-than-average performances before and after blue moons.
Measurements since 1950 show the median change the days before a
blue moon was plus 0.30 percent and the average change was only
slightly less. The days after a blue moon, the median gain was 0.21
percent and the average gain more than double that. The daily
average over nearly 50 years has been only 0.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you can strike it rich with this bit of esoterica seems
doubtful, but isn't it fun to know?

STARR WEIGHS WHETHER TO INDICT SITTING PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Rewrites graf that begins ``These discussions'' and two grafs
that begin ``Last summer.'')  (lb) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has
concluded that he has the constitutional authority to seek a grand
jury indictment of President Clinton before he leaves the White
House in January 2001, several associates of Starr said last week.
</P>
<P>
   While the president's legal team has fought in the Senate
chamber for the president's political survival, Starr and his
prosecutors have actively considered whether to ask a grand jury
here to indict Clinton before his term expires, said Starr's
associates, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But these associates emphasized that Starr had not decided
whether, or when, to ask the federal grand jury here to charge
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice related to the
Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is persuaded by precedent and logic that a sitting
president can be indicted,'' said one associate who speaks
frequently with Starr. ``But he has given no hint about whether he
would do it, either now or sometime down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking such striking action, Starr would be guided by a
number of outside factors, including the impact that a grand jury
indictment of the president would have on the nation and the
government, said the associates and other friends with whom Starr
has discussed the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The associates say that Starr agrees with the conclusion of his
office's two constitutional-law scholars, who say that the
Constitution and legal precedent provide a prosecutor with the
authority to seek the indictment, trial and conviction of a sitting
president.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars concluded that the 1997 Supreme Court decision
allowing the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit to proceed while
the president was still in office greatly increased the chances
that an indictment of Clinton would survive a constitutional
challenge by the president's lawyers, the associates said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most constitutional scholars think that a sitting
president can be indicted, the majority of those who have written
or spoken on the subject believe that a trial would have to wait
until the president left office.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in Starr's office have been poring over the record of
the debates within the office of Leon Jaworski, the Watergate
special prosecutor, over whether to indict President Richard Nixon,
both before and after his resignation, the associates said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Starr's lawyers scoured autobiographies, including
Jaworski's, and obtained copies of prosecution memorandums in the
National Archives written by the Watergate prosecutors, the
associates said.
</P>
<P>
   These discussions in Starr's office occur at a highly sensitive
time. Several Senate votes on procedural issues last week made it
all but certain that there was not the two-thirds majority, 67
votes, required to convict Clinton on the two articles of
impeachment and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his prosecutors have had no communications with the
House managers or the White House about the possibility of
including the president's future criminal jeopardy in negotiations
over a censure of the president, the associates said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr, declined to discuss
the matter. ``We will not discuss the plans of this office or the
plans of the grand jury in any way, shape or form,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Lawyers Cite Possible Indictment
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, the president's lawyers argued in the
Senate trial that they were deeply concerned that the Office of
Independent Counsel would seek the indictment of Clinton after his
term expired on Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, one of the president's personal lawyers, has
demanded that House managers provide access to about 55,000 pages
of unreleased documents compiled by Starr that they said Clinton
would need to defend himself against a criminal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also threatened to seek testimony from witnesses in the
Senate trial to explore what he says was improper collusion between
Mrs. Jones' lawyers and Starr's prosecutors in late 1997. Bakaly
denied that there was collusion between his office and Mrs. Jones'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's associates said that the independent counsel had several
options in the coming weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that he could choose not to seek an indictment of
Clinton, they said. Or he could decide to seek the indictment after
Clinton's term expires.
</P>
<P>
   Another option that has been discussed is seeking an indictment
sometime in the coming months but asking a judge to keep it under
seal, meaning that it would remain a secret for some time. If Starr
chose to postpone a trial of the president until after he left
office, a sealed indictment would keep the charges secret and spare
the president the indignity of trying to lead the country while
under the cloud of a public indictment.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth option would be to indict Clinton while he is in
office, but ask the court to postpone a trial until after he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's associates said that neither the outcome of the Senate
trial nor the public's wishes expressed in opinion polls would
affect his decision. ``Prosecutors do not take polls to decide what
to do,'' another associate of Starr said. ``Ken has proven he is
immune to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   According to those polls, most Americans view Starr as an
overzealous prosecutor who has pursued Clinton, both in criminal
court and in September's 445-page impeachment referral.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing Prosecutions of Others in Case
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Starr and his prosecutors subpoenaed Clinton to
appear before the grand jury, but then agreed to withdraw the
subpoena after the president decided to voluntarily testify, which
he did from the White House on Aug. 17. On Sept. 9, Starr sent his
445-page referral, which was full of sexual detail, to the House.
And on Nov. 19, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee
as an ``aggressive advocate'' for impeachment, in the words of his
ethics adviser, Samuel Dash, who resigned in protest over the tenor
of Starr's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky case, Starr
has filed multiple criminal cases against Webster Hubbell and Susan
McDougal, two associates of the Clintons who say they are being
singled out unfairly because they will not provide damaging
evidence to Starr's continuing Whitewater inquiry. Starr's office
has defended the propriety of the prosecutions against both Hubbell
and Ms. McDougal, who face trials later this year.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Starr indicted Julie Hiatt Steele, a Virginia
woman who cast doubt on statements by Kathleen Willey that Clinton
had made an unwelcome sexual pass at Ms. Willey inside the White
House in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In Alexandria, Va., Ms. Steele was charged with three counts of
obstruction of justice and one count of witness tampering. Her
lawyer called the charges ``a glaring example of Starr's gross
abuse of his prosecutorial power.'' Starr's office has defended the
Steele indictment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Starr Keeps Quiet About His Intentions
</P>
<P>
   Starr has not said publicly what he will do in his still-active
criminal inquiry into the president. During his testimony before
the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 19, Starr was asked whether
the president, after he left office, was subject to criminal
prosecution for offenses that he might have committed while in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he thought that the framers of the Constitution ``did
intend for there to be separate proceedings'' in the criminal
courts and the Congress. He also indicated that the question of an
indictment would be assessed ``after this body has done its duty
and reached its judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we ever seek an indictment,'' Starr said, ``we engage
not only _ and I would hope any prosecutor's office would do that _
in a very careful assessment of the facts, the elements of the
offense and the like. We go through each of the elements. We look
at the witnesses and the documentary evidence and the like, and
then we have to satisfy, following Justice Department standards: Is
it more likely than not that a fair-minded jury would convict based
on these facts, beyond a reasonable doubt?''
</P>
<P>
   At a November breakfast meeting with reporters, Bakaly, the
independent counsel's spokesman, said that Starr had not ruled out
the option of seeking an indictment of Clinton after his term
ended, but he quickly added: ``I don't want to send any signals
here. There's no statute of limitations problem. We have developed
a criminal case.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the independent counsel's office, there is a group of
prosecutors who believe that not long after the Senate trial
concludes, Starr should ask the grand jury of 23 men and women
hearing the case against Clinton to indict him on charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice, the associates said. The group
wants to charge Clinton with lying under oath in his Jones
deposition in January 1998 and in his grand jury testimony in
August, the associates added.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year statute of limitations for a perjury charge would
not expire until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury's 18-month term expires in March, but one
associate said that Starr could ask the presiding judge for a
six-month extension. If Starr chooses to seek an indictment of
Clinton after September, however, he would need to impanel a new
grand jury and either hear from witnesses all over again, or have
the testimony read to the jury, the associates said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Consultants Look at Constitutionality
</P>
<P>
   Since early last year, the constitutional question has been
exhaustively researched by two constitutional-law experts who are
paid consultants to Starr: Ronald Rotunda of the University of
Illinois Law School and William Kelley of the University of Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rotunda and Kelley have concluded that the 1997 Supreme
Court decision in the Paula Jones case suggests that the
Constitution does not prohibit a prosecutor from seeking an
indictment, trial and conviction of a sitting president, the
associates said.
</P>
<P>
   With unanimity, the Supreme Court ruled that neither the
Constitution nor public policy justified allowing the president to
delay the pretrial proceedings and the Jones trial itself until
after Clinton had left office.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial published by The Legal Times in July 1997,
Rotunda said the court's reasoning in Clinton vs. Jones suggested
``that the Constitution provides no bar to the indictment, trial
and conviction of a sitting president for a federal crime, although
the trial court might not be able to impose a sentence until the
president's service of office is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   In his court papers filed in the 1974 Watergate tapes case,
United States vs. Nixon, Nixon argued that a president could not be
criminally prosecuted. ``If the president were indictable while in
office,'' he said, ``any prosecutor and grand jury would have
within their powers the ability to cripple an entire branch of the
national government.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Jaworski was advised by lawyers in his office that
they had concluded that Nixon could be indicted for his Watergate
crimes while still in office. But Jaworski rejected that advice,
believing that an indictment of Nixon would most likely fail to
withstand a constitutional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Robert Bork, the solicitor general at the time, filed a
brief arguing that the Constitution barred any criminal indictment
of a sitting president. He concluded then, and still believes, that
the impeachment process is the only remedy for criminal acts by a
president. Bork feared that the indictment of the president would
lead to ``the paralysis of a branch of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ruth Jr., another Watergate deputy special prosecutor,
said in an interview last week that he thought there was nothing in
the Constitution that prevented the indictment of a sitting
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my own view at the time, which I expressed to Leon, was
that the indictment of a president is such a momentous event that
the impeachment process should go first,'' said Ruth, who is now
retired and living in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In their discussions, the lawyers in Starr's office have cited
the arguments made in the Watergate era during their deliberations
about whether to proceed with such drastic action, associates of
Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor have cited a view held by some prosecutors in
Jaworski's office that ``a failure to indict the incumbent
president, in the face of evidence of his criminal activity, would
seriously impair the integrity of the criminal process,'' an
associate of Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument in favor is that ``prosecutors should pay no
heed to considerations of national interest,'' an associate of
Starr said. As one prosecutor in Jaworski's office said in 1974:
``We have a duty to act without regard for external factors. It is
not for us to weigh the political effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But in raising questions about such action, several of Starr's
prosecutors have also said that the Nixon-era prosecutors
considered both the risk that the Supreme Court ultimately would
strike down an indictment and the impact on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Several times since the Senate trial began on Jan. 6, Kendall,
the president's lawyer, has argued that the proper forum to try
Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice is a
criminal courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those comments are seen by some in the office as an
invitation,'' one associate of Starr said.

NATO AUTHORIZES ATTACK IF SERBS SHUN TALKS

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO allies removed the last restraints
Saturday on military action against Serbia if it does not agree by
Feb. 6 to start talks next weekend in France with the ethnic
Albanian leaders in Kosovo about autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance ambassadors in Brussels gave Secretary-General Javier
Solana authority, after consultation with allied capitals, to order
air strikes against military targets in Kosovo and elsewhere in
Serbia unless President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia agrees to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   They accelerated planning for a possible emergency extraction of
the 1,020 international civilian observers now in Kosovo for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in case the
Serbian authorities menace them because of the bombing threat.
Officials said it could take up to 10,000 NATO troops to take the
observers to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has also begun planning for a possible peacekeeping
force of 30,000 to 40,000 troops to monitor any agreement the
parties reach in eventual negotiations, officials said. The United
States is considering contributing 2,000 to 5,000 peacekeepers and
Britain and France have said they would provide soldiers for a
force to carry out an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The allies acted after the British foreign secretary, Robin
Cook, presented an international ultimatum to Milosevic and the
Kosovo Albanian authorities. Milosevic, who annulled autonomy for
Kosovo 10 years ago, made no direct response Saturday, Cook
reported.
</P>
<P>
   But in a warning to the ethnic Albanian leaders fighting for
independence for the province, NATO officials said strikes would
not go ahead if the Albanians refused to negotiate or stop
attacking the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO secretary-general will take full account of the
position and actions of the Kosovar leadership and all Kosovar
armed elements in and around Kosovo in reaching his decision on
military action,'' the allies agreed, referring to the rebel
forces. ``NATO will take all appropriate measures in case of a
failure by the Kosovar Albanian side to comply with the demands of
the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meetings were scheduled throughout the weekend on
plans for possible air strikes against Serbia if Milosevic resists
the negotiations. Officials also were discussing how to send in
American ground troops should President Clinton decide they are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's top national security advisers have reached
a consensus to recommend sending American ground troops if the two
warring parties agree to a cease-fire, administration and
congressional officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement Saturday, David Leavy, a White House
spokesman, said ``the president has made no decision'' whether to
send American troops should an international peacekeeping force
enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting of the so-called contact group on the Balkans that
was scheduled in London on Friday in the expectation that NATO
would authorize air strikes Saturday, six nations _ the United
States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Russia _ demanded an
end to all violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that though the earliest probable date for action
was a week away, Solana had full authority to order air strikes
before then if there was another large-scale massacre of Albanian
civilians by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the allies did not want to take sides with the
Kosovo Liberation Army, in effect becoming its air force against
Serbia in the rebels' struggle for independence, a goal none of the
contact group nations support. Kosovo is 90 percent populated by
ethnic Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making clear that the actions of the Kosovars in the
negotiations and on the ground will have a bearing on the decision
of the secretary-general to order strikes,'' a senior NATO diplomat
said. Further possible military measures to exert pressure on the
rebels, like a NATO naval blockade of major Albanian ports, were
still under study, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under what amounts to an international ultimatum, both sides
have seven days from Feb. 6, extendable by a week or less, to reach
agreement on autonomy along lines worked out over the last few
months by an American mediator for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, the
ambassador to Macedonia. The negotiations would be held at a rural
18th-century chateau in Rambouillet, 32 miles southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians do negotiate a settlement,
officials said the alliance would draw up plans for a 30,000-member
NATO force that could stay in Kosovo for years while a peace
conference works out permanent arrangements.

</P>
<P>
   Albanian loyalties have been divided between the Kosovo
Liberation Army, armed through Albania by a financial support
network in Europe and the United States, and moderates led by
Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's NATO decision reactivates plans for both immediate,
limited warning strikes and a wider ``phased air campaign'' that
could hit Serbian air defense sites and other military targets not
only in Kosovo but also elsewhere in Serbia. Hundreds of planes,
mainly American ones, and dozens of ships are poised for operations
that could start from bases in Italy and the Adriatic within days.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, had authority to begin the bombing last October if
Milosevic refused to withdraw heavily armed police and army units
that were attacking Albanian villages as well as rebel units, and
refused to begin negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the threat, Milosevic promised to comply and Clark's
activation orders were suspended. But according to Western
officials, Milosevic did not do what he promised.
</P>
<P>
   After a Serbian attack that killed 45 Albanian civilians in the
village of Racak this month, the United States began mobilizing
international support for stronger action to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   American negotiators accepted a decision by the allies Saturday
to leave the primary responsibility for ordering military action
this time in the hands of Solana, a civilian, rather than in
Clark's.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Solana would consult with allied capitals
and take account of the views of the contact group before ordering
any strikes. But they said that he would not have to seek a new
alliance decision to order Clark to launch the planes and cruise
missiles that would carry out attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take my decision in the light of both parties'
compliance with international commitments and requirements,''
Solana said, ``including in particular assessment by the contact
group of the response to its demands, to avert a humanitarian
catastrophe, by compelling compliance with the demands of the
international community and the achievement of a political
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of imminent NATO action did not prevent a Serbian
police raid in which 24 ethnic Albanians were killed in the village
of Rugovo on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The allies also said Solana could also give the order if
Milosevic refused to make good on the earlier promises to reduce
police and military forces in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance said it was ``studying how to support measures to
curb arms smuggling into Kosovo,'' actions aimed primarily against
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to show our determination to both
parties,'' a French official said. ``The Albanians see time working
in their favor, and the eventual emergence of a greater Albania,
but that is not what the international community wants. We want
substantial autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia for a determined
period of, say, three years, which will allow time to reach a
permanent settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, some Western officials hope, Milosevic could be history
and more moderate Serb leaders might agree to let Kosovo go.
</P>
<P>
   But the other side of the coin is that if the two parties do
agree to go to Rambouillet, American and European peacekeepers
could be stuck in Kosovo for years, as they have been in nearby
Bosnia since the end of 1995.

MYSTERY OF STRAY TIGER LEADS OFFICIALS TO A PRESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey wildlife agents continued Saturday to count tigers on
a private refuge in Ocean County, trying to confirm suspicions that
a 431-pound Bengal tiger shot to death as it wandered loose last
Wednesday had escaped from the compound. But there were no signs
that the mystery was nearing solution.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson Township neighbors worried and wondered about the
world-class concentration of tigers in their midst, investigators
for the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife again scouted
craggy lairs and other hiding places in the dense winter woods of
the 12-acre reserve called Tigers Only Preservation, trying to
account for about 20 of the big cats.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor William Allmann of Jackson Township said the investigators
were probably on the right track. ``All indications are that the
tiger came from this property,'' he said, noting that Six Flags
Great Adventure Safari Park nearby had accounted for its nine
tigers. ``The only other possibility is that someone could have
dropped it off, but that's very far-fetched.''
</P>
<P>
   But the owner of Tigers Only, Joan Byron-Marasek, insisted
through a lawyer, Valter Must, that the wayward tiger had not come
from her property, that a 20-foot perimeter fence was intact, and
that the episode _ and the curiosity and suspicions it has aroused
_ had turned her quiet, private life upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is beleaguered,'' Must said. ``She's a very private
person. It's been a circus out here, with law-enforcement and
animal-rights people, the press and people sneaking into the woods
to take her picture. She wants to accommodate the public's need to
feel safe, but she hopes this incident doesn't destroy what she has
worked for her entire life. She finds this whole thing very
intrusive and embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama began last Wednesday after residents on two nearby
roads spotted a tiger on the loose, triggering a seven-hour search.
Efforts to tranquilize and trap the animal failed _ the darts
missed _ and the police, fearing that someone might be hurt, shot
and killed the tiger in a driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, which left some residents terrified and many
astonished to learn that dozens of tigers were harbored in the
area, prompted an extensive search for the tiger's owner. Samples
of the tiger's fur, and soil and other material from its paws, were
taken for analysis, which could take several days. An autopsy
revealed nothing in the tiger's stomach that might provide a clue.
</P>
<P>
   After the elimination of Six Flags, suspicion fell quickly on
Tigers Only. Exercising a search warrant on Friday, state wildlife
investigators went to the compound to take a census and examine
Mrs. Byron-Marasek's records, including her exotic-animal licenses
for a reserve she has owned for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But at the gate the investigators were confronted by 17 large,
dangerous-looking dogs, all of which, Allmann said, had no township
licenses. The mayor said Mrs. Byron-Marasek tried to round up and
pen the dogs, but was so long doing so that the investigators
decided to enter the property using cagelike movable steel tunnels
obtained from Six Flags Great Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Huljack, deputy chief of the wildlife division's
enforcement bureau, said the investigators tallied 17 tigers, but
were not satisfied that their count was complete. Mrs.
Byron-Marasek's state exotic-animal licensing paperwork suggested
that the reserve was home to 23 tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Byron-Marasek was quoted by officials as saying that none
of her tigers was missing, that several had died, while others _
ferocious but shy _ were just hiding from the unaccustomed hubbub
of cars coming and going, of helicopters chattering overhead and
strangers moving about their normally serene woods.
</P>
<P>
   While the search warrant expired on Friday, Mrs. Byron-Marasek
gave wildlife investigators permission Saturday to continue their
effort, Allmann said. He said that Mrs. Byron-Marasek was
cooperating and that reports to the contrary were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said he had strengthened police patrols around
the compound, in part because of residents' fears, which were
heightened by a report of a breach in a perimeter fence. Officials
confirmed that part of an outer fence was down, but said that a
20-foot inner fence was still intact.
</P>
<P>
   And so the mystery _ and the fears _ remained.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This makes me very nervous, especially with the number of
tigers she has,'' Diane Dememmo, 31, a mother of two children, said
Saturday as she eyed the compound warily from her parked car.
``It's happened once. We don't want it to happen again. As a
mother, I'd like to see the preserve closed down, or at least more
security.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Gunther, a mother of six who has lived in the area for
21 years, said she was not worried. ``There's never been a
problem,'' she said. ``I didn't even know the preserve was there.
She has a responsibility to maintain proper fencing, but I think
having the preserve in the community is a wonderful thing.''

 &HT;    12 Super minutes
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PLAM BEACH, Fla. _ In a few short hours, this high-school
gridiron on the western edge of Miami will be transformed into a
field of dreams. But first, Maggi Rosenberg has to contend with a
fate worse than thunderclouds.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   No one had bothered to tell Rosenberg, rehearsal coordinator for
Super Bowl XXXIII's halftime show, that the field, otherwise home
to Dade Christian School's football team, was due for a scheduled
soaking. So when she arrives on the morning of the show's first
full-scale rehearsal _ with more than 1,000 performers, crew
members and production staff _ she discovers all her markings have
been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, we had a beautifully painted field,'' Rosenberg
sighs. ``Today, we have a beautifully watered field.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the business of show business when you're dealing with
the world's most-watched spectacle, seen by a live audience of
75,000 and worldwide television audience of close to a billion.
It's true there's a football game being played today at Pro Player
Stadium, but don't tell that to the people involved in the Super
Bowl halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   People like the 500-plus cheerleaders who have come to perform
from high schools throughout Martin, Palm Beach, Broward and
Miami-Dade counties. People like the entertainment executives from
New York's Radio City Music Hall, who are producing the whole
shebang.
</P>
<P>
   And people like Maggi Rosenberg _ Wellington resident,
well-known local children's entertainer (her stage name is ``Miss
Maggi'') and now one of the pivotal players in this 12-minute
production.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. All this for 12 minutes, give or take a few
seconds of banner-waving. Wouldn't it just be easier to let a band
march?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for the SUPER BOWL!'' replies Rosenberg, who came to the
job because of her work on a San Francisco 49ers halftime show a
few years ago promoting children's literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Super Bowl halftime shows stretches all the way
to 1967, the event's first year. Back then, a marching band did
suffice as entertainment. Make that two marching bands _ from the
University of Arizona and University of Michigan _ who amused the
crowd at Los Angeles Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the show grew to slightly larger
proportions. Broadway veteran Carol Channing sang ``Hello, Dolly!''
from a giant float hoisted on to the field. The youth group Up With
People performed a couple of times. Disney produced a
silver-anniversary salute to the game, featuring New Kids on the
Block.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a little competition _ namely when the upstart Fox
network decided to air its hit comedy series, ``In Living Color,''
during halftime in 1992 _ for the NFL to get wise to the show's
real potential. The next year, working with Radio City Productions,
the league staged a blockbuster event featuring Michael Jackson,
who seemingly popped out of a giant video screen as part of his
dramatic entrance. The crowd went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really took the show away from the traditional pom-pom
girls to a much more theatrically produced show,'' says Radio City
Vice President Michael Fiur, who has been in charge of six halftime
specials, including this year's.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ``the biggest challenge is how to top yourself,''
Fiur adds. In 1996, the show in Phoenix featured pop diva Diana
Ross departing by helicopter, a move that required the approval of
the Federal Aviation Administration. Last year's bash in San Diego
was billed as ``A Tribute to Motown's 40th Anniversary,'' starring
Boyz II Men, Queen Latifah, Smokey Robinson and Martha Reeves, who
sang her classic hit, ``Heat Wave,'' to the accompaniment of balls
of flame.
</P>
<P>
   As for this year's production, estimated to cost $2.5 million?
Organizers are careful not to reveal any of the special effects _
they wouldn't want to spoil the surprise _ but this much is clear:
The show is a little soul, a little swing and a lot of salsa. The
Miami Sound Machine herself, Gloria Estefan, is the headliner,
Stevie Wonder is her special guest and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy fill
out the bill to tie in with the current swing revival.
</P>
<P>
   But the stars, if anything, take a back seat to the volunteer
cast of hundreds. To see them rehearse at Dade Christian School _
after Rosenberg got the painting crew to come back, of course _ is
to witness a sight even an operatic great like Richard Wagner (or a
circus showman like P.T. Barnum) couldn't have envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers are waving flashlights to the bluesy beat of a Wonder
song. Teams of older swing dancers are pretending they're at the
world's biggest sock hop. Guys on stilts are actually attempting
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   And all this is happening _ more or less _ at the same time,
thanks to a dozen or so production assistants scurrying across the
field and a petite woman _ staging director Judy Chabola _ barking
orders into a microphone as she stands on a platform high above the
action. A typical command to the color-coded groups of performers
might go something like this: ``Blue people with the spinners, can
you please go back?'' or ``Yellows, go get ready for the jump
ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, you're looking at a kaleidoscope whose edges
become more distinct as the rehearsal process continues,'' says the
show's creative director, Jeffrey Ernstoff, who jokes that his
biggest challenge is finding a role for his 86-year-old mother, a
Boca Raton resident. ``The trick is to combine the traditional
elements of pageantry with a hip twist.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trick that necessitates a year of planning. This year's
halftime show got its start as soon as the clock ran out on last
year's Super Bowl. The process typically begins with picking the
right artists _ Estefan was a natural choice for Miami _ and then
selecting the music. After a score is created, a team of
choreographers gives the show its visual shape.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work isn't done in a studio. Instead, it's laid out
on grids and charts _ like the battle plan for the invasion of a
small country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is war,'' says head choreographer Doug Jack, who like
most of his halftime colleagues stages stadium events throughout
the world. ``We've done shows in Singapore where we actually used
the military as our base of command.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 12 minutes seen around the world are just one part of the
equation, however. Equally important is the plan for bringing out
the 20-piece, 10-ton portable stage where the headliners perform.
While the average stadium rock show takes a day to assemble, the
NFL allots the halftime stage crew, featuring more than 150
volunteers, less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we can't dent a blade of grass in the process,'' says
Fiur, the executive producer. The secret? ``We use pneumatic
airplane tires,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the television aspect. The halftime show is really
two shows: one for the stadium audience, the other for home
viewers. The former can't see Estefan's expression as she sings,
but the latter can't feel the sonic boom of the fireworks (yes,
there will be plenty bursting in air).
</P>
<P>
   ``For the stadium audience ... you want to fill as much of the
field as possible. On television, that spectacle doesn't always
translate,'' says Paul Miller, the director for Fox, now the
broadcast network. ``My main focus is on the stars who are
performing.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as set-up goes, the halftime TV crew gets about as
much time as the halftime stage crew, sometimes literally shoving
the network sports producers out of their spots. ``It's the
greatest get-out-of-the-way moment in show business,'' says
creative director Ernstoff.
</P>
<P>
   What's Rosenberg's role in this army of entertainers and
executives? She's a kind of behind-the-scenes drill sergeant,
responsible for everything from picking practice locations to
ordering the gallons of Gatorade the cast will consume to making
sure paramedics are on hand. (A bungee jumper was killed during a
rehearsal for the 1997 halftime show.)
</P>
<P>
   And during today's big game, it will be Rosenberg's job to
gather the 1,200 cast and crew members at an off-site location,
shuttle them on 30 buses to the stadium and get them back just
after halftime. And, oh yeah, feed them. What do you serve 1,200
people on their night of fame? Rosenberg has a two-word reply:
``Box lunches.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering, Rosenberg doesn't get to see the game.
Neither do most of the cast and crew, which makes it particularly
hard to recruit college athletes for some of the grunt work. But no
one else seems to care. At the show's makeshift headquarters in
suburban Miami, a bulletin board announces the details of each
rehearsal. It's only in tiny handwriting at the bottom that you'll
find the names of the teams, Denver vs. Atlanta, along with the
current odds.
</P>
<P>
   At least they're finally aware who's playing. ``I didn't even
know who was in the playoffs,'' Rosenberg says.

ANDERSON SHOWS NO EVIDENCE OF NERVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Nothing bothered Jamal Anderson this past week, and if
that's still the case Sunday, nothing may bother the Atlanta
Falcons, either.
</P>
<P>
   For Anderson, the crush of Super Bowl week was merely the
extension of a life spent in the midst of celebrity. Media hordes
were nothing new to the 26-year-old running back. Questioners
coming from all angles were old hat, something he'd seen handled
with aplomb for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   For a kid who grew up thinking of Sugar Ray Leonard as his
uncle, Muhammad Ali as his father's friend, Mike Tyson as his big
brother, and Donna Summer as his dance instructor, a few thousand
notebooks and cameras were no problem, because he long ago learned
that's what it's all about at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The way he sees it, the way he's always seen it, is that this is
how it's supposed to be. At least if you want to achieve athletic
success it is, because if you do, celebrity follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being at Eric Dickerson's house when I was like
10,'' Anderson recalled. ``I saw all these trophies and I was like,
`Oh, my God, he's the best ever.' That influence was invaluable.
Being around all those guys is where I learned about being
competitive. All they talked about was being the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was intensely competitive and he's recognized as one of
the top bodyguards in his business. He worked hard to be the best
in the business. All of us grew up with that attitude: `Why be
average?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 25 years, James Anderson has made a living guarding
celebrities such as Ali, Michael Jackson, and Richard Pryor. His
son saw people like Summer at family barbecues and Pryor on the
living-room couch. He saw Leonard at press conferences and Ali
stopping traffic.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew up, they would take him aside, explain to him what
press conferences and interviews and fans were all about, and as he
listened, Jamal Anderson also grew. He grew into a 234-pound
battering ram of a back who this season finished second only to
Denver's Terrell Davis in rushing yards with 1,846, the ninth-best
total in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons he learned as a kid surrounded by celebrity came
into play all week, a week that has overwhelmed many a young NFL
star ill-prepared for the endless questioning that goes along with
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, we have a natural tendency that when we see people on
television, we put them on another level,'' Anderson said. ``For
some reason, people think they're not human. Not only are they
celebrities, they're held to a higher standard because they're on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's unfortunate because everybody's human.
Everybody errs. Everybody makes mistakes. We're all the same. We're
all going to eventually bleed, be afflicted with different diseases
or problems, die.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up and ask for an autograph and I say, `My name on
a paper is no more valuable than your name on a paper.' If it
really means something to them, so be it, but we need to understand
that we're all the same people regardless of what we do. I'm no
more important than the guy who builds a car or the person who
keeps his kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of who was around our house, we treated everybody
the same way. Believe me, Sugar Ray Leonard didn't get any more
special treatment than our neighbor who came over for a barbecue.
We threw them on the couch together. Ray didn't eat before anybody
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate enough to oftentimes be standing right next to
Muhammad or Sugar Ray in situations like this when I was young. I
would be thinking, `This is unbelievable,' watching how they
handled these situations. They looked forward to it. That's what
they were all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying the load
</P>
<P>
   Now it's what Anderson is about as he awaits his arrival on the
biggest stage in professional football. When he gets there, he will
bring a powerful body, strong legs, and an ability to absorb and
deliver punishment that allowed him to carry the ball a record 410
times this season.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson speaks of those carries, there is not a hint of
complaint, not a mention of being worn down by the kind of workload
normally reserved for the Budweiser Clydesdales. There is only a
sense that this is his game and he will play it out in the hopes
that it will transform him into the kind of athlete who needs
someone like his father around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't something I thought about a lot until it got to
about 370,'' Anderson said. ``Then I was like, `Wow.' Just to think
about the fact that nobody's carried that many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting pounded every year since I was 7, so I'm
used to it. I had 410 carries but I don't feel it. I don't want to
say it was easy. I don't really want to do it again, but I don't
feel like it was that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (coach) Dan (Reeves) thinks I feel good, he'll give it to
me as many times as it goes in the flow of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If things are flowing well for the Falcons, that is a lot of
times, because Atlanta is 20-2 when Anderson carries 20 or more
times, including 15-0 this season. Knowing that, the Broncos expect
to see a good deal of Atlanta's celebrity-in-waiting Sunday. More,
they expect, than they'd like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presents two or three huge problems,'' said Denver safety
Tyrone Braxton. ``First of all he's fast, so he can outrun you.
Second of all, he's quick so he can outmaneuver you. And three, he
has power. He can run over you. If any back has that, he's a great
back. The guy is a great back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Earl Campbell. He's short, he's strong, he's
thick, and he's quick. He's a very difficult force to be reckoned
with.''
</P>
<P>
   That's only when he's on the field, however. Anyplace else,
Jamal Anderson is his father's son and his celebrity client's
protege. He is a glib kid with a ready smile and an answer for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal has been around a lot of greatness and I think it's
taught him humility,'' his father said several weeks ago while
working for Tyson in Las Vegas. ``If you see him bragging, he's
joking, having fun with the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got that from Ali and Ray. It helps him relax. He doesn't
want you uptight when you're talking to him. Jamal's effervescence
comes from his mother. He's always been one of our shiest children
but he grew into being outgoing. He's learning to be comfortable
with his own success now. Since the Falcons began having success,
he's become a more gregarious person.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming control
</P>
<P>
   It would have been difficult to imagine a more engaging athlete
to deal with during a week as tedious as this past one, but Sunday
no one expects to see that side of Anderson until his work is done
_ except for perhaps those moments when he dances the Dirty Bird,
the steps he uses to celebrate his touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson danced that dance 16 times this season and if he can do
it a couple more times Sunday, he will surely have the underdog
Falcons in position to unseat the defending Super Bowl champions
because it would likely mean Atlanta was running with authority and
running down the clock.
</P>
<P>
   That control of the game has been a big part of the Falcons'
success, and there is only one way to achieve it: Anderson must run
over people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not careful, if you don't have two guys there to
wrap him up and do a great job tackling him, he'll run over two
guys,'' said Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski. ``He'll run over
three guys. In film the last two weeks I've seen some amazing
things done by this man.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a ball-control team, and they're the best in the
league as far as that goes, so we have to stop him. But he can do
it all. He's a combination of Terrell Davis, who can make you miss,
and the power of Jerome Bettis. He's got the speed of some of the
best backs in the league. He's got the full package.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they've got a great system for him. They like to hold onto
the ball, and he seems like the key to the whole thing. If he gets
out on us, they'll give themselves a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If the former seventh-round draft choice from Utah gets out on
the Broncos, he'll also give himself a chance to become what he's
long dreamed of since he was a boy learning not to look wide-eyed
at guys named Ali and Leonard. He'll give himself a chance to shine
in front of the world, a chance to have his own time in the
celebrity's sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do picture yourself in those situations,'' Anderson
conceded. ``You picture yourself growing up to be Muhammad Ali. You
just try to imagine what it's like to be them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I enjoy the situation we're in right now. Playing in the
Super Bowl is great. There are no bad days for Jamal Anderson. This
is the greatest athletic stage there is and I'm happy to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself in a situation once where I was either unwanted
or overlooked (coming out of Utah), so this is the reward for all
late-round picks. When you start like that, you have to fight and
claw your way to where we are now. This is something I've worked
for my whole life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I thought coming out of the draft that I had more
ability than to have been picked in the seventh round, but for one
reason or another I was picked No. 201. That's a constant
motivator. People don't think players like myself or Terrell Davis
(a sixth-round pick in 1995) should be achieving these things.
That's always prominent in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at the Falcons the same way. We weren't supposed
to be here. That's why I believe we're going to do some things that
will impress a lot of people. We feel good about where we are as a
team. We're looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jamal Anderson's approach to life and celebrity, what else
could it be?

SPORTS COLUMN: CALHOUN FUMES, AND THE HUSKIES RESPOND 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis' team more than weathered the game-opening tornado,
but even with a 12-point lead three minutes into the second half,
he understood the forecast remained cloudy with a 90 percent chance
of a heavy Connecticut run. Beyond the youthful tendencies of his
own players in games against higher-ranked teams, he knew Jim
Calhoun wasn't going to just go away without a burst of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with Jarvis, the bearded egghead in control of the
understated blend of urban talent that is St. John's, Connecticut's
top-ranked Huskies feed off the uncensored emotion of their kinetic
coach. So here they were Saturday, in sold-out Madison Square
Garden, suddenly down a dirty dozen, with Calhoun predictably
spinning like a twister in a corn field.
</P>
<P>
   His junior center, Jake Voskuhl, had earned his scorn and a seat
on the bench with an inbounds pass that turned into a Bootsy
Thornton 3-pointer. Calhoun yanked Albert Mouring off the bench by
his shirt _ the classic move of the Knight _ after his senior
guard, Ricky Moore, made another distasteful pass. Only Voskuhl,
appreciating the company in his moments of misery, stood up to
greet Moore, which motivated Calhoun to scream at him some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy thing, when someone's yelling at you like
that,'' Voskuhl said after UConn had ridden Calhoun's rage to a
78-74 victory. ``But you also know that he isn't really mad at you.
He's mad at the team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that when Calhoun began to thunder, it had been a
team effort, both ways, which accounted for the 53-41 St. John's
lead. The stark reality Calhoun faced, from the point when his team
led by 16-3 after starting with a five-minute bolt of lightning,
was that the Red Storm had come back to dominate UConn as if the
Huskies had stepped up from the Patriot League. St. John's, in the
person of Lavor Postell, was killing UConn on the offensive boards.
Their two New York City recruits on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway
to eventual draft lottery status, Ron Artest and Erick Barkley, had
settled in and were going about the day as if beating No. 1 was
simply what they had been brought to St. John's to do.
</P>
<P>
   Artest and Barkley were signed not by Jarvis, but Fran
Fraschilla, the human jumping bean whose two-year run ended with an
unceremonious and unexplained dismissal last spring. Though these
aren't his players _ to speak in the vernacular of the market _
Jarvis has managed in a short amount of time to mold them in his
more subdued manner. St. John's, when on its game, plays less like
a storm, more like the Red Calm. The chest-bumping, face-contorting
show ended with the careers of Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton.
Wasted motion and emotion, like Fraschilla, were out. Execution and
efficiency were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just really kicked our butts,'' Calhoun said, explaining
how he got to a time out, 17 minutes 9 seconds remaining, the
Garden rocking for a college game as it hasn't since, well, last
week against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the stoppage, Calhoun said almost nothing, which is
difficult for a man who talks as if he's getting paid by the word.
``Think what you're doing,'' he said, finally, raising the
likelihood of UConn's first defeat, the loss of its top ranking
and, worse, the loss of unchallenged supremacy in its own league.
He fumed for the remainder of the long television time out, waiting
for his players to inhale his wrath. Richard Hamilton soon spoke
up. Then Khalid El-Amin. Then the Huskies charged out with a
renewed passion, with a 10-0 run, with the apparent resolve of the
more experienced team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all stems from Coach Calhoun; we feed off him,'' said
Voskuhl, who wound up scoring two significant baskets as the
Huskies made their final, frantic, up-tempo push, rallying from a
4-point deficit with an 11-0 run and a lead of 72-65.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found an old friend, and that is our defense,'' Calhoun
said, launching into one of his high-speed monologues. Jarvis, in
contrast, later sat with his hands clasped, placidly explaining how
St. John's had failed to execute in the closing minutes, as it had
in other close calls in the Garden against Stanford, Purdue and
Duke. ``We're just not there yet,'' he said. ``We've been in a
position to beat every one of them. It's about being the last team
to make the last run.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Jarvis sat four of his sad-eyed players, including
Artest, who had tried to take control of the game against the
defense of Kevin Freeman, but couldn't, and Barkley, whose judgment
with the ball was uncharacteristically freshman-like as the game
slipped away. His forced jumper, with St. John's down by 4 inside
of 25 seconds, was the Storm's last chance, and it came in a crowd
and with Artest calling for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In one more unwitting testimonial to Calhoun's motivational
skills, Voshkul got the rebound, forcing St. John's to foul.
Artest, never shy about upbraiding a teammate in the heat of a
game, complained to Barkley, who told him, in no uncertain terms,
to mind his own business.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis' cool, calming effect was obviously, painfully, all
gone. The sun was down, the day was lost. St. John's, in the end
playing Jim Calhoun's game, was sucked into the teeth of an
emotional storm. &QL;

UNLIKE BOSTON, HOUSTON HAS ACT TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Bob McNair spent an interesting few days with Bob Kraft
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is the owner who couldn't find a home for his football
team in his hometown. McNair is the owner of a home for a football
team in his hometown who can't find a team to occupy it. Only in as
dysfunctional a place as the National Football League under Paul
Tagliabue could such a situation exist.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday and Thursday, McNair tried to convince Kraft and
the rest of the league's Finance Committee that Houston, the
nation's fourth-largest city, deserves the NFL's 32d franchise, an
expansion team likely to be awarded at the owners' meetings in
March.
</P>
<P>
   All McNair had to offer is deep pockets to pay the league's
exorbitant franchise fee, no rivals in his town trying to fight him
over ownership, and a voter-approved, signed, sealed, and delivered
$310 million stadium plan that guarantees the NFL the world's first
retractable-roofed, natural grass, 69,250-seat football facility
ready for occupancy in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While Kraft couldn't squeeze Massachusetts Speaker of the House
Tom Finneran for more than $57 million to build some off-ramps in
Foxborough, prompting Kraft to move the Patriots to Hartford,
McNair cobbled together a constituency that included Harris County
politicians, the Houston Sports Authority, the Metropolitan Transit
Authority, the Houston Livestock Show &AMP; Rodeo Association, the
mayor, the city council, and the city's voters; and he got them all
to agree to provide 74 percent of the financing ($230 million) for
the stadium that will adjoin the Astrodome and turn the entire area
into the world's largest trade-show facility.
</P>
<P>
   While McNair was working on his plan to return an NFL team to a
city the league abandoned in 1994, Kraft couldn't find two nickels
to rub together to keep his team in Massachusetts _ a team that was
in the Super Bowl just three years ago. Not surprisingly, Bob
McNair finds this surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some interesting conversations because of what he's
gone through,'' McNair said Thursday. ``He's had some awful
problems up there that I sure can't understand. But we've been
fortunate to have a united front in Houston. He asked me about how
I managed to accomplish that, because it's clear to everyone that
you need to develop public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Oilers left, it was a wakeup call for Houston. Most
people just thought these were only threats. They thought the team
would never leave. After that happened, the environment was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense when Bud (Adams) owned the Oilers that we
didn't need to do anything to help them with a stadium. Now the
attitude is very different. Houston is my hometown, and I'm a
homer. I pull for anything that's Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen in Baltimore and St. Louis how the people started to
develop an inferiority complex about their city when they lost
their franchises. It happened in Houston. We have a vibrant economy
and a great city, but I'd travel around the world on business and
people would ask me, `What's wrong with Houston? Why'd you lose
your football team?' I got tired of having to defend Houston
instead of promoting it, so I got involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with what he has put togther, McNair is not a lock to
win league approval for a franchise. Also in the running are two
groups from Los Angeles, although neither has solid stadium
financing, voter approval, or the political landscape to get a
stadium built.
</P>
<P>
   One group, which has only about $20 million in government
backing, hopes to put a team back into a refurbished LA Coliseum
that would cost nearly $342 million. The other, led by former
Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz, is pushing for a $350 million
stadium in Carson, Calif., but has about as much governmental
support as Kraft had in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the NFL and many owners continue to privately favor
Los Angeles, whispering that they do not want an entire generation
in the second-largest market in the country to go without the NFL.
That might sound logical to a league that has no team in LA or
Houston but approved franchises in Nashville, Jacksonville, and
Charlotte, but it makes little sense when the nation's
fourth-largest city appears eager and organized to embrace the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is the 11th-largest TV market in the country; LA is
second. Yet in 1994, the last year both cities had NFL teams,
Houston ranked ninth in NFL TV ratings, LA 15th.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, a year after the Oilers left for Tennessee, Houston's
NFL television ratings were still higher than 25 percent of the
cities with teams; and last year, its Super Bowl viewership was
higher than any city without an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting is that two NFL franchises, the Rams and the
Raiders, left Southern California because of lack of fan support,
while McNair argues that the Oilers left because of a lack of
stadium support. He seems to have numbers to back that up. In the
five years before their moves, Houston averaged 55,436 fans per
game in the outdated Astrodome, the Raiders were drawing an average
of 53,318 to the Coliseum, and the Rams were down to an average of
48,572 in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league knows they need to be in Houston and in Los
Angeles,'' McNair said. ``What they're in a quandary about is how
to do it. If the 32d franchise goes to Houston, will that close out
Los Angeles? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five or six teams that could move there without
paying the huge franchise fee for an expansion team, and that would
allow them more money to go toward solving the stadium problem out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, they have two groups vying for an expansion team
in Los Angeles and neither has enough public support. Is that a
reflection of the true level of support for bringing NFL football
to LA or is it a measure of their passion for football? I don't
know, but what's obvious to me is that we have the best plan, the
financing, and the public support. If Houston is awarded the next
franchise, we're ready to start building the stadium. The NFL knows
that's not the case in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   As one NFL owner put it last week, ``How we've run things lately
wouldn't be a case model for long-term planning, would it? I don't
think they'll be studying the franchise moves we've made at the
Harvard Business School.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL ends up with a franchise in troubled Los Angeles
while shutting out Houston and Bob McNair, it will be more evidence
that Paul Tagliabue knows how to make money but has no idea how to
run a football league.
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the cap
</P>
<P>
   NFL Players Association executive director Gene Upshaw said last
week the salary cap for 1999-2000 will increase about $5 million,
to $57.5 million per team . . . McNair once explored buying the
Miami Dolphins when Joe Robbie was looking to sell and has long
been involved in horse racing. His best horse was Touch Gold, who
won the Belmont a few years back . . . New Cleveland Browns coach
Chris Palmer, who has been going over the list of available
veterans in the upcoming draft, says he has found few people who
can help and a lot who are overpriced. There are also more than a
few players on the list who have already decided to retire. Green
Bay, for example, has Reggie White and Robert Brooks on its list.
White has already announced his retirement, and word is Brooks's
bad back may force him to give up the game . . . If you're still
wondering what happened with Dave McGinnis and the Chicago Bears'
head coaching job, here's the story of how it blew up in his face
from someone on the inside of the dealings. After interviewing with
Bears owner Michael McCaskey, McGinnis was told there would be
another meeting the following day. Driving out to the Bears complex
in Lake Forest, Ill., the next morning, McGinnis heard a radio
report that said he had been hired and a press conference would be
held that afternoon. That was news to him since he had not yet even
brought his agent into the negotiations. Enraged, he went to Bears
front office man Mark Hatley with heated words. He came out
insulted by an offer for a four-year deal worth $750,000, $800,000,
$850,000, and $900,000, plus $200,000 for a television show (the
going TV rate is $1 million a season, even for head coaches with no
experience). Worse, only the first two years were guaranteed, with
a buyout option for the team after that. McGinnis stormed out and
the deal collapsed. A day later, Dick Jauron was named the Bears
coach . . . If the Patriots intend to get into the free agency
sweepstakes for either 49er wide receivers Terrell Owens and J.J.
Stokes or Arizona's Rob Moore, they will be fighting more than the
likelihood that Owens and Moore could end up being named transition
or franchise players next month. Division rival Miami also is
interested. Coach Jimmy Johnson badly wants another target for Dan
Marino and fears Yatil Green may not be the deep threat he hoped
for after back-to-back season-ending knee injuries . . . The
Raiders have just over a week to decide whether to pay quarterback
Jeff George a $5 million bonus to buy back three more years on a
contract George was able to void at the end of this season, his
second in Oakland. Word out of Oakland is that owner Al Davis is
not convinced George is the man to build his team around, but head
coach Jon Gruden is pushing Davis to write the check . . . Unhappy
Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson has told his agent to ask
Minnesota to trade him because he does not want to back up Randall
Cunningham again next season. Minnesota is unlikely to comply with
that request, just as Buffalo has no intention of trading Rob
Johnson, regardless of whether he beats out Doug Flutie next
summer, because of the salary-cap hit . . . When the free agency
period begins in two weeks, Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin will be
looking to get into the market for top defensive players such as
Chiefs cornerback Dale Carter, Packers tackle Santana Dotson, and a
familiar face, Lions linebacker Stephen Boyd, whom Coughlin coached
at Boston College. . . . Apparently there are two sides to a
bizarre story out of New York last week. Dolphins linebacker Zach
Thomas claimed he was mugged near the Port Authority bus terminal
at 3:30 a.m. and had his wallet stolen. But a Port Authority
spokesman claims two of its police officers found Thomas
intoxicated and unable to remember whether he was assaulted, fell,
or was in a fight. Stay tuned . . . This was a week of revelations
and soul-searching at the Super Bowl. One day Cornelius Bennett is
talking about becoming a born-again Christian not long after he was
charged with sexual misconduct, then Atlanta receiver Terence
Mathis told a packed room of reporters how he almost ruined his
life with alcohol. Denver offensive line coach Alex Gibbs, who will
never be accused of being a touchy-feely kind of guy, then claimed
he nearly quit the team because he became depressed after learning
that All-Pro tackle Gary Zimmerman was retiring last spring. ``I
was so depressed that I didn't want to go to camp,'' said Gibbs.

FALCONS ON SOLID GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Eventually, somebody is going to run the football in
Sunday's 33d Super Bowl. Whoever does is going to win. Don't bet
against the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons had not upset the Vikings two weeks ago to win
the NFC Championship, Minnesota would be favored to beat the
defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos. Of that you can be
sure.
</P>
<P>
   So why shouldn't the team that beat the team that would have
been favored to beat the defending champions beat the defending
champions?
</P>
<P>
   The gambling constituency has made the Broncos a 7 1/2-point
favorite, but it is difficult to fathom why. Certainly Denver has
the game's leading running back in Terrell Davis and an offensive
line in front of him that is as nimble and adept at holding without
being penalized as any in the league. Together they have created
one of the more powerful forces in the football universe _ a
crushing running game that took Davis to 2,008 yards this season
and his team back to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Davis is faced with a defense that was the
second-stingiest in the NFL against the run, a quick and agile
group that likes to penetrate into the backfield and hold its
ground, cutting off the cutback lanes runners like Davis search
for, and rallying to the ball with alarming swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have allowed only one runner to gain 100 yards since
they embarked on what is now a 22-4 streak, and that was on a day
when defensive tackle Travis Hall was out of the lineup and three
other starters left with injuries during the game.
</P>
<P>
   In their only shot at Davis, they limited him to 79 yards last
year in a one-touchdown loss, so they have no reason to look upon
controlling him in this game as an Olympian task. Even if they do
it, of course, the Falcons still have to cope with Shannon Sharpe,
Rod Smith, Ed McCaffrey, and future Hall of Fame quarterback John
Elway, but the fact is putting the ball in Elway's hands these days
is the best way to beat the Broncos because at 38 he is not the
force he once was.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if the game comes down to quarterbacks, Atlanta has the
superior one in Chris Chandler, although who knows if he will come
through in the biggest game of his life?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the key for each team will be containing the other's
running game, because that is what both have used to get this far.
Atlanta has the edge there, it would seem. Denver is strong on
defense, but the Falcons allowed just 75 yards rushing per game
this season, while controlling the clock better than any team in
football with a battering ram of a back named Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings were the highest-scoring team in NFL history this
season but they scored only 7 points in the final 2 1/2 quarters
against the Falcons because Anderson ran just enough to allow
Atlanta to control the clock. Then the Falcons were able to beat
Minnesota's secondary with their own set of explosive wide
receivers, Tony Martin and Terance Mathis. Those two allowed the
Falcons to quietly lead the NFL in yards per pass attempt, and they
were the second-most productive set of receivers in the game,
trailing only Minnesota's Randy Moss and Cris Carter in yardage
while finishing fourth as a duo in touchdown catches.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's strong point these days is running, not passing, and
Atlanta's strong point is stopping the run while pounding the ball
itself. Thus the critical stats may be these: The Broncos are 33-4
when Davis rushes for 100 yards or more, 6-0 in playoff games. The
Falcons are 20-2 when Anderson rushes 20 times or more, including
15-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Good as Davis is, and he's the best in the league, it's easier
to rush 20 times than it is to rush for 100 yards, so the edge,
slight though it may be, would seem to be with the Falcons' defense
not the Broncos' offense.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons can contain Davis and prevent him from making the
sharp cutbacks into an open defensive backfield, Atlanta can win as
long as Anderson is free to slam away enough to keep the clock _
and his offense _ moving.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is a back who wears defenses down, pounding, pounding,
pounding with his 234 pounds until they begin to lose their
resolve. The proof is that in first halves this season, he has
rushed for 713 yards and an average of 3.75 yards a carry, but in
second halves he has 1,133 yards, averaging 5.15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   So expect a game of clock management in which the Falcons will
try to control the ball for long stretches (which they did better
than any other team, averaging more than 33 minutes of offense a
game) and keep Davis on the sideline, where he can do no damage.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say Elway isn't capable of winning a game for the
Broncos, but the fact is in this game the Falcons have the better
quarterback and at least as good a defense, so the difference will
be which running game comes through.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if it's the one that belongs to Atlanta's
Dirty Birds.

CONTROVERSIAL TAYLOR REACHES HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With voters staying within the rules, Lawrence Taylor
rolled into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first try
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the controversial linebacker of the New York Giants,
created the most interest ever in a Hall of Fame vote when his
off-field life brought into question his fitness to be enshrined in
Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was one of five new members elected Saturday. He was
joined by Eric Dickerson, one of the greatest running backs of all
time; tight end Ozzie Newsome of the Cleveland Browns, now general
manager of the Baltimore Ravens; senior candidate Billy Shaw of the
Buffalo Bills, who played most of his career in the old American
Football League; and Tom Mack, an 11-time Pro Bowl guard for the
Los Angeles Rams who made it in his final year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Taylor became too much of the story; his brushes
with the law, which include two arrests on drug charges, led to a
debate about whether he should be inducted. The controversy
detracted from the other four players, who all had distinguished
careers.
</P>
<P>
   In statement handed to media, Taylor said he was ``humbled'' by
his election.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, who played with four teams but mostly the Rams and
Colts, called this the biggest thrill of his life. ``I never made
it to the Super Bowl, so this is my Super Bowl,'' said the man who
holds the single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards, set in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Players must be named on 80 percent of ballots cast to be
elected. With all 36 voters present, 29 were needed. There was no
announcement on the final tally.
</P>
<P>
   Boston native Howie Long made an impressive showing on his first
chance, finishing in the top seven. He and wide receiver Lynn Swann
of the Pittsburgh Steelers came up just short in the voting.
</P>

LOCAL EVENT FEELS LIKE THE BIG TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
   The feeling was one of finality, arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grew up thinking, `That's the place to play _ the Garden,
in the Beanpot,' '' recalled Keith Tkachuk, the former Boston
University winger who these days scores his goals _ and lots of
them _ as the NHL's premier power forward with the Phoenix Coyotes.
``I just remember it was such a thrill to step on that ice. It was
sick. Just to skate over that Bruins `B' symbol and know, finally,
you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beanpot, which opens its 47th chapter Monday night on
Causeway Street, comes to center stage each February for what is
arguably the nation's biggest college hockey tournament. For many
players, it also serves as the ultimate proving ground, two nights
to show NHL scouts, personnel directors, even general managers that
they're getting closer to the day when they might be able to cull a
living out of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, Boston College, Northeastern, and BU, the four Beanpot
brothers, have sent upwards of 100 players on to the NHL. The
Beanpot is by no means a sure road to The Show, but a good couple
of nights on Causeway, where the Garden has segued to the
FleetCenter, can be the steppingstone to something big.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what the scouts are looking for,'' said NU coach
Bruce Crowder, the former Bruin who played his college hockey at
the University of New Hampshire. ``They get to see these kids under
pressure, here in a big barn with 16,000, 17,000 people watching.
Are they watching the kid who can score a big goal, win a game, or
a kid who gets the seventh or eighth goal in a blowout _ goals that
don't mean anything? This is the place to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The '91 Beanpot final, recalled BU coach Jack Parker, was
exactly that kind of showcase for former Terrier Tony Amonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a spectacular show,'' recalled Parker.
</P>
<P>
   The season began with Amonte, in his sophomore year, setting his
aim on 30 goals. As a freshman out of Thayer Academy, where he was
Jeremy Roenick's linemate, he banged in 25 with the Terriers. But
by January the Hingham sharpshooter had scored only nine times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the Beanpot comes, the final, and he gets knocked cold by
a BC defenseman,'' recalled Parker, who will be coaching his 26th
Beanpot these next two Mondays. ``His helmet went flying and he had
to be helped off the ice. It was a big hit. But he came back in the
third period and got a hat trick, and that started it for him _ he
went on a tear and got his 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Amonte was in the Rangers' training camp the following
September, barely six months later, and scored 35 goals in his
rookie season with the Blueshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of success stories make the Beanpot, at the very
least, a convenient, tantalizing recruiting tool for all four
schools. You want to make it to The Show, kid? Look at Tkachuk and
Amonte. Or Don Sweeney and Ted Donato at Harvard. Chris Nilan at
Northeastern. Joey Mullen, Brian Leetch, and Steve Heinze at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' said Parker, ``it used to be an even
better recruiting tool. Recruits used to decide in April, May, and
June, and you'd have the Beanpot to entice them. Now they make up
their minds before the season begins.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case for Craig Adams, Harvard's senior captain
from Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Western Canada,'' said Adams, ``I'd never heard
of the Beanpot. I'd given it little or no thought prior to that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The night came during Adams's February '95 visit to Harvard. The
Crimson were in the Beanpot and Adams was in the Garden stands,
wondering whether someday he would be part of the dazzling tableau
that was playing out in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harvard admissions officer found me in the stands,''
recalled Adams, ``and handed me my letter of acceptance.''
Finality. Arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 11th season with the Bruins, Sweeney played in four
Beanpots ('85-88) with the Crimson. More than 700 games into his
NHL career, he still remembers the excitement of being in the
Garden and skating for the first time on an NHL rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it, when you're there, there's no knowing if
you'll ever step on NHL ice again,'' he said. ``I was drafted
(166th overall in '84), but you don't know if you're ever going to
make it. No one ever knows. You've got to savor it. And to be 18
years old, standing there in the Garden, I think that would have a
dramatic impact on anybody. Seeing those banners in the rafters,
that's when it really sets in.''
</P>
<P>
   Updated traditions
</P>
<P>
   The first Beanpot opened the day after Christmas 1952 as the New
England Invitational Hockey Tournament at Boston Arena (now
Matthews Arena at Northeastern). It moved to the Garden in January
'54, where first-night attendance was only 711.
</P>
<P>
   Walter A. Brown, then the Garden president, soon charged Tony
Nota, the man in charge of the Garden's mail room, with the duty of
finding an appropriate trophy. The affable Nota, who also acted as
official timer for Bruins and Celtics games, settled on the
silver-plated pot that stands as the crowning cup of Boston
collegiate supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   For some 30 years, the tournament winner carried the Beanpot
back to campus, the victors proudly parading it through the halls
of academia. Lore has it that one of those tours led it to a
Harvard frat party, where it was unceremoniously treated as an
ashtray. Nowadays, it never leaves Causeway Street, where it
remains on permanent display under the aegis of the Sports Museum
of New England on the Fleet's fifth floor. The winners parade it
around the ice and promptly hand it back over for safe keeping.
Each school keeps a Beanpot plaque on campus, updating with
commemorative tags when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy is the tournament tangible. The tournament itself is
so much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's about people,'' said Jack Grinold, NU's venerable
director of sports information, the Beanpot's longtime secretary.
``It's about the players, the coaches, even the referees _ all the
marvelous people who have worked and skated through the tournament,
through all the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's the atmosphere. You're in the Garden (now the Fleet),
where the mood of the place usually is all the Bruins fans against
those six other guys on the ice. But you go to the Beanpot, and you
can quarter the building, all four schools represented equally in
the course of a night. The bands are playing, the place is jumping
. . . just marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Fleet held its first Beanpot in '96, the bands weren't
nearly as much of the tournament's fabric as they were during the
Garden years. They took their customary places down low, near the
boards, but somehow their notes were muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a big space,'' noted Grinold. ``Not the same as skating
in the old closet.''
</P>
<P>
   The bands subsequently have been moved to the balconies, where
they can more openly exchange rhythmic blasts and Bronx cheers.
Some of the old hop is returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need is a BC-BU final,'' said Sweeney. ``It has to be
those two schools, and it also has to be a great game. Then it will
be equally as good in the new building as it was in the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze, the Bruins winger, played in three Beanpots ('89-91)
with BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and lost every one of 'em,'' he said. ``But it was still
great. Everyone builds it up so much and, I don't know, maybe
that's why we didn't do so well. Harry Sinden (Bruins
president/general manager) is up there in his box, the scouts are
watching, and you have this feeling, `Hey, yeah, I'll show them
that I can play in this rink.' ''

DAVIS MAKES STRONG CASE FOR TITLE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Terrell Davis has a sign in his hotel room: ``Take your
medication.'' Terrell Davis will have a sign this Sunday on his
locker in Pro Player Stadium: ``Take your medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis will have friend after friend, teammate after
teammate, come by his locker this Sunday and remind him to take his
medication for migraine headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on the team is going to be reminding him,'' said
Denver running back Vaughn Hebron. ``Believe me, there's no way
Terrell's going to forget this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos may have one of the more unusual game plans
of any Super Bowl team, based as it is on one premise far removed
from X's and O's: ``Terrell Davis first takes his medicine.'' Then,
and only then, can the schemes and strategems and football
chess-playing be implemented for Davis to run to his left _
seemingly always to his left _ and chew up the Atlanta Falcons'
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in charge of it this time,'' said Davis. ``I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Davis forgot to take his medication before last
year's Super Bowl in San Diego between the Broncos and Green Bay.
Like so many players before him, players who thought they might be
immune from the crushing pressure of a Super Bowl, Davis lost focus
in the hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not until after warmups and only 10 minutes before kickoff did
Davis remember the necessity for his playing well: taking
medication for the migraines that had bedeviled him since he was a
boy. For the medication to be effective, it must be taken an hour
or more before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the most famous headache in football history.
Davis was able to play in the first quarter against Green Bay and
was able to score a TD. But then he experienced the visual aura
that he knew all too well was the precursor of a migraine, and
terror overcame him on the sideline. He was forced to sit out the
second quarter as he prayed that a drug newly prescribed for him,
DHE, would be able to divert the migraine.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Davis returned in the second half and pulverized the
Packers as only he can, as only the best back in football running
behind football's best offensive line can.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has had only one migraine episode since then _ during
practice three months ago _ and he is confident that his nemesis is
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a preventive medication I'm taking,'' he said.
``Anytime I work out or practice I take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judy Lane, a Colorado neurologist and a world authority on
headaches _ not to mention a rabid Broncos fan _ was able to
instill confidence in Davis that his migraines could be diverted by
diagnosing them as ``exertion-induced.'' As long as Davis took the
medication before beginning his physical activity, the migraines _
and not Davis _ would be sidelined. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Strong combination
</P>
<P>
   Davis doesn't seem to be fast and doesn't seem to be elusive,
but his low center of gravity, his ability to spot holes and lanes
in which to cut back against the grain, and his power all make him
the most effective back in the league. Add the blocking of the line
in front of him and the result is PowerBall; not a lottery, but a
guarantee of football riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Terrell is an unbelievable back,'' said Rich Brooks,
the defensive coordinator of the Falcons. ``He's a combination of
Jim Brown and Barry Sanders because he can both break tackles and
take it downhill. The thing about Terell, he's very decisive. Above
all, you don't want him to get into the secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Where, perceptions to the contrary, Davis is fast enough to run
away from defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that fast,'' countered Davis. ``In high school they
had me at linebacker and at fullback.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said it is not necessarily physical skills but psychology
that is behind his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, the one thing that scares me the most is failing,
especially at this level,'' he said. ``I think, `Someday, it's not
going to be there. I'm not going to be on top and I'm going to have
to deal with that.' But while I'm here, and while I'm having
success, I'm trying to do everything possible to stay on this
level. Whatever that means, or whatever I have to do, I'm doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When his career is done, said Davis, he wants to be known as one
of football's all-time great backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals are long-term rather than short-term,'' he said.
``I've always said that when I leave the game, I want to leave my
signature on it. By thinking like that, I can come back next year
and be the best I can be. That's just the way I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the game
</P>
<P>
   There are no long-term goals Sunday. It will be most difficult
for the Broncos to win if Davis does not run well. It will be most
difficult for Atlanta to win if Davis is not contained. The game,
simply put, will be decided by whether Davis or the Atlanta defense
wins this battle.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy for Davis. The Falcons have one of the NFL's
best defenses against the run and, as Davis himself recognized, the
fact that linebackers Jessie Tuggle and Cornelius Bennett are so
experienced means he will not see much overpursuit that would allow
him to make his trademark cutback.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, the Falcons' defense seems to have energy
similar to Davis's, energy that usually allows him to run as well
in the fourth quarter as in the first quarter, if not better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speed over there on that defense,'' said
Davis. ``They seem to have energy throughout the game, which is
kind of difficult to play against. They're not overly big players
over there, but they're very quick and fast, and very disciplined.
It's going to be a big challenge for us _ but I welcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   In studying film of the Atlanta defense, said Davis, he sees a
disciplined unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most times when you see a defense, you hope they get out of
their lanes,'' he said. ``They have assignments to do, obviously,
but when 'backers sometimes get anxious, they run out of their
lanes and it gives me an opportunity to cut back. Usually, if they
keep hitting the front side hard enough, they'll overpursue and you
can cut back on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the key to much of Denver's running success. The
trademark Denver play is for Davis to take a toss from quarterback
John Elway, head left and, with that superb vision of his, spot a
running lane formed either because of crisp blocking or
overpursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, with Atlanta, with Tuggle and Bennett, they seem to be
very patient with what they do,'' explained Davis. ``It's kind of
like they play gap control very well and it's the type of team I
hate to see. I like to see people more undisciplined than that.''
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the ball, discipline. Davis, the most
disciplined of runners, and the Falcons with a disciplined defense.
It will be a matchup to savor.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, unlike Super Bowl XXXII, Terrell Davis should be
on the field for four quarters. He will take his medication, and
any headaches in Pro Player Stadium will be football headaches, the
pain felt by the loser of the Terrell Davis-Atlanta defense war.

HE TRADED DIAMONDS FOR A SUPER BOWL RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Guaranteed to happen sometime in Super Bowl XXXIII:
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will kick off. No. 86 will come flying downfield and
make the tackle. ``That was Ed Smith,'' Pat Summerall will say. And
somewhere in America a baseball player will come leaping off the
couch and shriek, ``Hey, I wonder if it's that Ed Smith?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' says Ed Smith, ``many of my teammates don't
know. They'll come up to me and say, `You used to play baseball?' I
get phone calls and messages all the time. They'll see me play on
TV and call. They'll say, `Is this the same Ed Smith I knew playing
in such-and-such?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Smith may have the freshest 29-year-old body in the NFL.
That's what happens when you skip college entirely to play nine
years of professional baseball. He doesn't much look like any third
baseman I've ever known, but he was indeed a third base prospect in
the White Sox, Cubs, and Indians organizations before quitting in
anger and frustration when, despite hitting .323 at the time, he
was demoted from Triple A to Double A to make way for what were
referred to as Cleveland's ``prospects'' in the summer of '96.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is, the most improbable participant imaginable in
the Super Bowl. Ed Smith has made himself into a valued member of
the Falcons' special teams. He had six solo tackles against the
Vikings two weeks ago, and in his profession that is a very good
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed is so athletically talented,'' says Atlanta special teams
coach Joe DeCamillis. ``And he keeps getting better, practice by
practice, and not just game to game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have written a better script for me,'' says
Smith. ``I'm still pinching myself to make sure it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to Pro Player Stadium began when the 1987 Pemberton
(N.J.) High School graduate turned down a combination
football/baseball offer from North Carolina to sign with the White
Sox. When his baseball career stalled, he turned to his younger
brother Irv, the Notre Dame star who currently plays tight end for
the 49ers. Irv put him in touch with the right people, and the next
thing Ed knew he was playing for former Boston College great Ernie
Stautner with the Frankfurt Galaxy, attracting some attention with
a one-handed grab that was the ``Play of the Week'' on the ``George
Michael Sports Machine'' program.
</P>
<P>
   He spent time in both the Rams and Redskins organizations before
catching on with the Falcons in 1997. He is listed as a tight end,
but, for now, his calling is with the various special teams. And he
will tell you that not even the hottest grounder to third compares
with the things that go on when someone kicks off a football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like running through a minefield, or like running down
the middle of a street with someone shooting at you,'' he declares.
``Your head is on a swivel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Smith brings an uncommon degree of latent athleticism to the
task. It is very difficult to imagine this huge man playing third
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I am very proud of manning the hot corner all
those years,'' he says. ``I made all the plays, diving plays and
everything else. Every year I'd come to camp and they'd talk about
putting me at first, but I'd always wind up at third.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was a mere shrimp when he played baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played at 225, and never more than 230, when I played
baseball,'' says the 6-foot-4-inch Smith. ``Now I'm playing at
258.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine trying to turn yourself into a professional football
player when the last time you had put on a uniform was to perform
with a small New Jersey high school nine years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I put on the uniform it felt like a suit of
armor,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   And technique, what technique? He had never needed much in the
way of technique while terrorizing Pemberton's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Equally challenging was the adjustment he needed to make above
the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference between a day-in, day-out sport and
one you play once a week,'' he reports. ``I've had those 5-for-50s
and those times you can't pick up a ground ball. Then you get on a
bus and you can't get it out of your mind. In baseball, you need to
stay calm, no matter what happens. In football, you find that
aggression is good. It's OK to be mean. That's what I like about
football. There is nothing like the excitement and adrenaline rush
I get on the day of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't anything like the wear and tear of football, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in the Marines,'' he says. ``There are a lot
of days you just don't want to do it. When I get out of bed some
days, you can hear the snap, crackle, and pop in my body. I don't
want to insult anybody in baseball, but there are plenty of times
you play the game, stay up all night, and then play another game.
In football, you need your rest. And people don't think about the
mental fatigue of needing to study a new game plan every week.''
</P>
<P>
   His feelings about baseball are guarded. He was, in fact, a
fallout victim of the baseball strike, having refused repeated
requests to become a replacement player and then, in the end,
winding up unappreciated by both parties. He doesn't follow teams;
he follows friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Phillies are on, I will wait to see Doug Glanville
bat,'' he says. ``Then I'll flip around until he comes up again.
But I don't watch games.''
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts now are concentrated exclusively on football, and,
for Ed Smith, Sunday's game has an extra meaning, over and above
the fact that it is the Super Bowl. He has spent many a day
watching little brother Irv play at Notre Dame and elsewhere. He
has even played against his brother five times professionally. But
Sunday will be the first time that his brother will be in the
stands watching him play professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can't describe how happy I am about that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Smith had the strangest resume of anyone in this game, but
there is no question he belongs. He says he was officially anointed
at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Daniel, our tight end coach, came up to me one day and
said, `You used to be a baseball player trying to play football,'
'' Smith says. `` `Now you're a football player who used to play
baseball.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Keep your eye on No. 86. I still can't picture him playing third
base.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, we know there's at least some suspense this year. Pat
Riley's observation that everyone would be playing for second as
long as Michael Jordan was around was eerily prophetic. Now Michael
is gone, his team has disassembled, and as many as six clubs in the
Eastern Conference probably think they have a legitimate shot to
make the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana starts out as the favorite, having re-signed key guys
and brought in Sam Perkins for one more paycheck, er, opportunity.
But New York, Miami, New Jersey, Atlanta, and a dark horse or two
could surface. By June, one team will have forgotten the
back-to-back-to-backers.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are ranked according to their predicted order of
finish, which, in years past, has been wholly imprecise. (The West
preview will run Wednesday.)
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 55-27, first place. Lost in first round of
playoffs to New York.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Clarence Weatherspoon, Terry Porter, Mark
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Brent Barry, Latrell Sprewell, Eric Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``The Old Ways.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Riley played one too many hands of poker last
year. He got nothing for Ike Austin (Barry left without
compensation) and missed out on the Sprewell fire sale. But none of
the losses was really critical _ Barry wasn't even on the playoff
roster _ and his core group remains intact for yet another
thugfest. There's also the lingering question of Voshon Lenard's
stress fracture and _ yikes _ the admission by el presidente that
he could stomach reprobate Dennis Rodman under certain conditions.
(What do you think the over/under would be on the first time Alonzo
Mourning clocked Rodman in practice?) Still, with Zo, Tim Hardaway,
Jamal Mashburn, and P.J. Brown, this is as good as it gets in an
otherwise even but mediocre division.

</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: This is, in many ways, a watershed season for the
Knicks. They've added Sprewell, maybe the best off-guard in the
game. But Mr. Warmth's presence won't help as much if Patrick
Ewing's knee, wrist, or karma is (still) bothersome. And who is
going to do the dirty work now that Oakley is in Toronto? The
Knicks weren't at it for a week before they were on Camby for his
Abdelnaby-ish work habits, and coach Jeff Van Gundy already is
worried about Ewing, not to mention Phil Jackson. The Knicks wisely
re-signed Chris Dudley, who should see plenty of action, especially
if the enigmatic Camby seems determined to become Elden Campbell
East.

   NEW JERSEY &QC;

Chicago.

   (FR) Team song: ``The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Do we believe the early stories out of camp that
Coach Cal is a kindler, gentler soul? He should be. The new owners
got Jayson Williams re-signed, McIlvaine and Rony Seikaly form an
interesting backup tandem, and there's talent at every position.
The only downers are the injuries to Kerry Kittles and Seikaly,
each of whom may miss a month or more. They were in the hunt last
year until injuries decimated them. They should be in it this year,
too, unless the ever-sensitive Cal implodes or the injury bug
strikes again.

<P>
   ORLANDO &QC;

   (FR) Key losses: Mark Price, Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Unable To Stay, Unable To Leave.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: We all know how far this team is going: as far as
Penny Hardaway takes it, or wants to take it, or is allowed to take
it. We also know that Chuck Daly may still be able to coach, but
that he's also back for the money, and that can be dicey if things
unravel again. (Remember the stories last year that the Prince of
Pessimism was through?) Hardaway not too long ago was one of the
best players in the game. But he has been invisible (and annoying
at times) the last two years _ coincidental, of course, with the
departure of Shaq. He's a free agent at the end of the season and
the Magic can't allow Hamlet Hardaway to control the agenda. Daly
may yearn for the days of Rodman, Salley, Mahorn, and Laimbeer if
he has another year like last year.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 36-46, sixth. Did not make playoffs.

<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Paul Pierce, Popeye Jones, Tony Battie.

<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Zan Tabak, Travis Knight, Tyus Edney, Michael
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``This Doesn't Have To Be Love.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: There is a wide range of possibilities here. If
Kenny Anderson gets hurt, we're talking cellar and another high
draft pick. If he stays healthy, we're talking possible playoffs.
The Celtics have young legs, which helps in a compacted season. But
young legs get tired, too, as we've seen already in camp. The
problems in the middle are not nearly as acute as last year in that
Battie can block shots, the workmanlike Jones can get rebounds and
keep-alives, and the mammoth Dwayne Schintzius can be an
intimidating presence who also will get his hands on the ball. This
team should again be fun to watch but not very much fun to play
against. They will score. Their problem will be stopping the other
guys.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 42-40, fourth. Did not make playoffs.

<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Mitch Richmond, Otis Thorpe.

<P>
   (FR) Key loss: Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key undecided: Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: This team has chaos written all over it. The
Wizards and arch-enemy David Falk are a scant $28 million apart
over Strickland, who merely was _ and is _ their best and most
valuable player. Chris Whitney just doesn't instill the same fear
(although he torched the Celtics last year in Game 82). Juwan
Howard may have overtaken Larry Johnson as the league's most
overrated player. Oh yes, and did we mention that the Celtics'
center spot looks omnipotent compared with that of Washington's?
Gheorge Muresan, at last check, was flirting with the Hornets, who
lost both their centers to free agency. But the really big guy
hasn't played in more than a year and is still not ready to go now.
Jahidi White, Terry Davis, and Thorpe are the by-committee
candidates at this writing. And what must the soon-to-be-free
Richmond be thinking as he sees Strickland jump through hoops? He
probably isn't thinking of hiring Falk.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 31-51, seventh. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Matt Geiger, Larry Hughes, George Lynch,
Harvey Grant, Nazr Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Joe Smith, Derrick Coleman, Brian Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``As Long As He Needs Me.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Larry Brown's record as talent procurer is a bit,
shall we say, mixed? He traded Keith Van Horn, essentially for Tim
Thomas and change. He signed Geiger and Theo Ratliff to deals
exceeding $50 million each. He passed by Paul Pierce to take Larry
Hughes in the draft, something that still might work for the 76ers.
For things to improve here, a lot of young guys have to make it
work. Thomas has to become a force at small forward and Hughes is
the shooting guard, or, at least, the other guard to Allen Iverson.
Brown did bring in some depth with Grant and Lynch, and Scott
Williams is still there to crack jokes because he can't play
anymore. Philly's fate ultimately will hinge on the talented but
still raw Iverson. Where's the rest of the scoring going to come
from? Is Geiger anything more than a backup elevated to starter
because of the dearth of centers and dilution of talent? Is Ratliff
the real deal? Too many questions, although Iverson, after all, has
a sneaker named The Answer. We'll see.

<P>
   INDIANA &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 58-24, second. Lost in conference finals to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key addition: Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: None.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Closer To Fine.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: It's all here, ready and waiting, for the Pacers.
They have all their important people back and they know the drill.
So does Perkins, who has been a Western Conference mainstay and
understands what the postseason is all about. The Pacers aren't
used to being in the spotlight, however, and they are the
fashionable choice as the season begins. People are watching.
Expectations have never been higher. Indiana is one of a handful of
teams to have made it to a conference final but never the NBA
Finals. Everything is in place for that to end.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 50-32, fourth. Lost in first round to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Mark West, Anthony Johnson, still waiting
for a small forward (LaPhonso Ellis?), Roshown McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key loss: Christian Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key retention: Alan Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: This is still the best four-man team in the NBA,
even with the loss of Laettner. Henderson stepped up big-time last
year and now is being handsomely paid to do so this year and
beyond. He joins Dikembe Mutombo, Steve Smith, and Mookie Blaylock
in the starting four. They need a fifth, not to mention a sixth,
seventh, and eighth, too. The addition of someone like Ellis, who
is leaning toward Atlanta, would help immensely. There are some
other free agents out there (KJ, Jim Jackson) who theoretically
should be interested in joining a team that has a decent shot at
supplanting the Bulls. The one imponderable is why the Hawks seem
to have so much trouble getting those certain someones.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 47-35, fifth. Lost in first round to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key addition: Johnny Newman.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: none.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``My Heart Belongs To Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Well, Shawn Kemp doesn't belong in this category,
does he? Goodness knows what made him blow up during the lockout,
but he's going to have to lose it in a hurry. The Cavs were
arguably the surprise team of the league last year, getting a lot
of mileage out of four rookies and the newly arrived Kemp. They
have basically the same gang back this year _ their top nine
scorers, to be precise _ and that should mean more improvement. The
players know the league a little better, know each other a lot
better, and big man Zydrunas Ilgauskus is developing into a very
nice package in the middle. Much of the Cavs' success rests on the
ever-widening shoulders of Kemp. He led them in scoring and
rebounding last year, but his numbers were below what he had done
in Seattle. That may be a result of the Eastern Conference style as
much as anything, but he is still their most potent force.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 36-46, sixth. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: George Karl, Robert Traylor, Donny Marshall,
Dell Curry, Vinny Del Negro.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key loss: Andrew Lang.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Which Way To The Top?''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Karl got himself a sweet deal here and now his
impressive record is on the line; the Bucks last made the playoffs
when Titanic was still afloat. Was Milwaukee underachieving last
year or is it just a good rotisserie team? Karl can't afford to
lose key personnel for extended periods, and that means Terrell
Brandon and Glen Robinson have to be healthy. Ray Allen is an
emerging star and we keep hearing that his name is on Chicago's
wish list for next season. Karl has a pretty full cupboard. Allen,
Brandon, Robinson, and Tyrone Hill are an excellent foursome. Karl
feuded with Ervin Johnson in Seattle, but Johnson is all he has in
the middle unless he goes small with Hill. Traylor should help
along with veteran Dell Curry and valuable reserve Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 37-45, sixth. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Jud Buechler, Loy Vaught, Christian
Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Grant Long, Malik Sealy.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``I Hope, I Think, I Know.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: The best news to hit Detroit had to be Michael
Jordan's retirement. The Pistons almost never beat the Jordan
Bulls. But something is missing here. How can a team with this
roster win one more game than the Celtics? New coach Alvin Gentry
has the job basically because he's the anti-Collins and Grant Hill
likes him. How long will that last? He was 16-21 last year. The
Pistons can put together a nice starting five, have Jerry
Stackhouse, Buechler, Jerome Williams (and maybe Kevin Johnson) to
come off the bench, and should be a lock for the playoffs. Maybe
they will finally do it. But this team has not won a playoff series
since 1991. This might be a nice team to put some money on _ and
hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 51-31, third. Lost in second round to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Derrick Coleman, Chucky Brown, Ricky Davis,
Brad Miller, Master P.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Vlade Divac, Dell Curry, Matt Geiger.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``This Door Swings Both Ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments: It's too bad Charlotte didn't sign Olden Polynice and
Rodman. Then they'd have the four biggest knuckleheads in the
league. The Hornets have added the terminally underachieving
Coleman to an already iffy mix featuring the volcanic Anthony Mason
and have lost Glen Rice for a while with elbow surgery. Did someone
say implosion? Gone are both centers as well as Curry, who is not
what he used to be, but still was a career Hornet. Coach Dave
Cowens has to somehow preside over this wild kingdom, and it won't
be easy. Coleman says he's a changed man; how many times have we
heard that one? Maybe he is. He'd better be, for Charlotte's sake.
Without Rice, this team is going to have to get its work done
inside, and that's difficult without a reliable outside threat.
David Wesley has to step it up or Cowens could be in for a long
shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 16-66, eighth. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Kevin Willis, Charles Oakley, Vince Carter,
Michael Stewart, Sean Marks.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Chauncey Billups, Oliver Miller.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: It's hard to pick this team ahead of anyone, but
the dismantling of the Bulls makes that possible. The Raptors went
through 24 players last year, but now have what looks, on paper
anyway, to be a better team. Willis gives them an inside option,
although he has only one shot. Oakley, if he decides to play, can
add some toughness. Newcomer Vince Carter looks terrific and it's
up to Butch Carter to rehabilitate the rest of the team. He's got
some interesting names, from Doug Christie to Dee Brown to Tracy
McGrady. A modest upgrade may be all that's possible, however.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 62-20. Won NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Brent Barry, Mark Bryant, Corey Benjamin,
Andrew Lang, Tim Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen,
Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler. (Have I
forgotten anyone?)
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Nearer My God To Thee.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Can't wait to hear the introductions at the
United Center for the first home game. (``And now, from Oregon
State . . .'') Maybe the Bulls will surprise people and be a lot
better. That doesn't appear to be what they want, which means
they'll probably end up right here. Chicago is building for next
year, hoping to bag a free agent or two (Ray Allen, Vin Baker,
Penny Hardaway) as well as a high draft pick. Add those potentials
to Toni Kukoc and Barry and you have a nucleus at least. But, this
year, it's going to be downright ugly, and there could be more
changes before the season ends. How does a starting five of Bill
Wennington, Dickey Simpkins, Kukoc, Barry, and Ron Harper sound?
This could be the most overt tank job since the 1996-97 Celtics.

SILVER CHARM ENDS UP OUT OF POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ A few minutes before Saturday's Donn
Handicap, trainer Bob Baffert was in the paddock waiting for his
entry, Silver Charm, to arrive and be saddled. Baffert was being
the usual Baffert _ relaxed and talkative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going for the Broncos,'' Baffert schmoozed. ``I
used to be for the underdog, but now that I've got the big horse,
I'm starting to like favorites. And when that guy on the Falcons
(Ray Buchanan) said Shannon Sharpe looked like Mr. Ed, that made it
for me. That was the deciding factor. I love Mr. Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert stopped talking for an instant and looked around the
paddock. Business was at hand. A horse race was to be run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did the big gray go?'' Baffert asked.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, after Baffert's horse had been found and the Donn
Handicap had been run, the 21,325 fans at Gulfstream Park were
asking the same question: ``Where did the big gray go?''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, naively sent off as the 4-5 favorite by this
tourist-heavy crowd, ran a dull, plodding race, finishing a
well-beaten third behind Puerto Madero and Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in 21 starts that Silver Charm
failed to finish first or second.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm had everything against him, starting on the far
outside in post position 12 on a track that favored inside speed,
and spotting his rivals at least 6 pounds and as much as 16. Silver
Charm would have had to have been overwhelming and dominating to
win, and ``overwhelming'' and ``dominating'' seldom have been
adjectives associated with his name. ``Courageous'' is the usual
description.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Puetro Madero, the Chile-bred horse that last May
finished second in the Massachusetts Handicap, had been training
crisply for Richard Mandella ``and he broke from the gate like a
quarterhorse,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux. ``He won the race
coming out of the gate. His feet weren't even touching the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   When Puerto Madero ($10.40 to win) crossed the wire 2 3/4
lengths in front of Behrens and nearly 3 ahead of Silver Charm, who
barely beat out 129-1 shot Hanarsaan for third, Baffert rushed down
from the clubhouse to commiserate with Gary Stevens, Silver Charm's
jockey. The $500,000 Donn, the first race of the NTRA Champions
Series, was to be Silver Charm's first step this year toward
earning the $3.3 million he needs to top Cigar's all-time earnings
mark of $9.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be on the inside today,'' Baffert said to Stevens,
who found it impossible to get inside from the far outside. ``And
then we had to go to Plan B.''
</P>
<P>
   Plan B?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping we could get a good spot from the gate,'' Baffert
explained. ``But it looked like all the outside horses went for the
lead from the start and we were left with Plan B _ just sitting
behind horses and go when we could.''
</P>
<P>
   All true, but Silver Charm never did ``go,'' falling 10 lengths
behind on the backstretch. Baffert blamed the track (``He never
took a hold of the sand'') and said the only consolation ``was that
he finished up well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once Baffert learned he had drawn post 12 (``If I'd
known that before the race, I wouldn't have come''), it was clear
that neither he nor Stevens wanted to punish the horse, instead
prepping him for the Santa Anita Derby in five weeks and then the
Dubai World Cup in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Gary that if you couldn't get over (to the inside)
right away,'' said the trainer, ``don't kill him in trying to get
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Puerto Madero had taken the lead at the top of the stretch,
Desormeaux said, ``I took a peek back and I thought I'd see
something gray coming after me. But nothing was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   So now it is Puerto Madero who may be the top handicap horse in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver Charm looked like he got shuffled back and maybe didn't
run his best race today,'' said Mandella. ``But my horse ran a big
race regardless of what happened to Silver Charm.''

SILVER CHARM IS UPSET AND SO IS NEW RACING SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Silver Charm, cast as the ``national
champion'' in a new series of races for senior horses, ran third as
the beaten favorite Saturday while the Chilean star Puerto Madero
won the $500,000 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   The race inaugurated a series of 11 events grouped as a
championship series by the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, with bonus money of $5 million based on a point system
designed to lure the country's best handicap horses. And the series
was built around the 5-year-old Silver Charm, winner of the
Kentucky Derby two years ago and winner of the Dubai World Cup last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But though he was the even-money favorite, Silver Charm could
not follow the script. He carried high weight of 126 pounds, giving
away 6 to Puerto Madero and 12 to Behrens, who finished second, and
he started on the far outside from the No. 12 post position. And
apparently both factors proved too much of a handicap. Instead,
Puerto Madero broke smartly, stalked the early pace for
three-quarters of a mile and then took dead aim on the lead as they
entered the homestretch. He pulled swiftly in front and, at the
finish, led Behrens by 2} lengths, with Silver Charm firing too
little and too late, 2{ lengths farther back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a cat out there,'' said Kent Desormeaux, who was
imported from California with Puerto Madero late last week. ``His
feet don't even touch the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the race leaving the gate and, after 100 yards, he got
into an easy gallop. He sat behind two horses in front of him, and
the tank was full. He was asking, `When are you going to turn me
loose?' He did the rest. He's a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Life was not so rosy for Silver Charm and his celebrity team,
led by Bob and Beverly Lewis of Los Angeles, the owners, and Bob
Baffert, the blithe spirit who trains him. The marketing men who
designed the series apparently staked everything on Silver Charm,
coaxing Lewis to fly him from the West Coast and even arranging a
police escort from the airport to Gulfstream Park. But Silver Charm
could not overcome the burdens of weight and distance imposed on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we gave up too much coming out of the gate,'' Lewis
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping we could get a good spot from the gate,'' Baffert
said. ``But it looked like all the outside horses went from the
start, and we were left with Plan B _ just sit behind horses and go
when we could.''
</P>
<P>
   From the viewpoint of a structured series of races for
thoroughbreds, the result might have created a quandary. Silver
Charm, the hero, ran third in the opener. And Puerto Madero, the
winner, probably will ship to the $5 million Dubai World Cup in
March and thereby compromise his appearances in the series for
``NTRA champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero is a 5-year-old bay who won eight straight races
in Chile before he was bought by Dwight Sutherland and R. D.
Hubbard, the owner of Hollywood Park Race Track, who also owns
Gentlemen, the retired champion from Argentina. Their new star won
the Native Diver at Hollywood Park in December in his fifth race
since arriving last April. He now has won 11 of 16 starts and has
run second three times.
</P>
<P>
   He covered the mile and one-eighth in the Donn in 1:48 1/5,
paying $10.40 for a $2 bet to win as the second choice. He also
earned $300,000 while Silver Charm had to be content with
third-place money of $50,000, which he will add to his career
earnings of $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mandella, who trained Gentlemen and now trains Puerto
Madero, reported that it took fine-tuning his horse's style to
adjust his speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got too good at coming off the pace,'' Mandella said.
``He'd give the field half a mile. But lately we've worked on that.
Silver Charm looked like he got shuffled back off the pace, and
maybe didn't have his best day. But the only way not to get beat is
to leave him home.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   JERRY BAILEY won five times on an expanded program of 12 races,
but finished fifth aboard Sir Bear in the Donn after his horse

BURE IS COSTLY _ AND WORTH IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one wanted to part with a big name to acquire Pavel Bure.
Hard to figure, isn't it? The Russian Rocket potted six goals in
his first three games with the Panthers, his legs barely in gear,
looking every bit the darting, dazzling magician who connected for
back-to-back 60-goal seasons earlier in the '90s with Vancouver.
Imagine what he'll do when he hits his stride.
</P>
<P>
   Every team in the NHL wants to add an impact player. At least,
every team says that, while some give the standard cash caveat. The
frightening part is, there may be only a dozen true such players in
the game. Bure is one of them, a bona fide game-breaker, and there
is every reason to believe he will keep it up for at least 4-5
years. Pencil him in now for about, oh, 225-250 goals over his next
400 games.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Canucks had to settle for Ed Jovanovski, Dave
Gagner, and a couple of prospects _ including potential No. 1
goalie Kevin Weekes _ to grant Bure's wish and get him out of
Vancouver. Granted, Bure did himself no favors with his trade
demand, solidifying his reputation as a pouting, selfish player
concerned first and foremost about cash and caring little about the
color of his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   So, were the Flyers going to give up John LeClair or Eric
Lindros for Bure? Not in a Broad Street heartbeat. Would the Ducks
have parted with Paul Kariya? Forget it. And the Avalanche wouldn't
give up Peter Forsberg, the Ducks Teemu Selanne, the Senators
Alexei Yashin. None of those names ever entered the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But Bure is going to propel the Panthers into the
playoffs. In fact, as of Wednesday night, only 10 days after
Florida acquired his rights, Bure already had his new club holding
the No. 7 playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. That, folks, is
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Why were so few clubs willing to take Bure? Reputation was part
of it. Payroll was part of it. The Panthers will pay him $3 million
this year and may soon complete a deal that will pay him upwards of
$10 million a year (five years/$47 million is the rumored figure).
Not a lot of clubs _ as we know all too well here in Boston _ want
to take on that kind of debt, even if it could mean a true
opportunity to contend rather than simply compete.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of interest in Bure also shows that GMs and player
personnel directors around the league don't always know talent,
even when it's as obvious as the Bure on their nose. What, were
they afraid of breaking up team chemistry? Come on. Team chemistry
in '99, for the most part, is getting 18 skaters to buy into a
trap. Just makes the ice bubble, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Does Bure pout? Sure. Is he expensive? Absolutely. Does any of
that diminish his skill? Not one iota. But rest assured, the longer
Bure sat, the more he became a questionable commodity in the minds
of the men who make their living deciding who can and who can't
play.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a single thing to question about Bure, not by
today's standards of, shall we say, player imperfections. Take that
chemistry bunk and toss it under the Zamboni. Loads of clubs
already suffer fools with a lot less talent, figuring that, OK,
so-and-so isn't the best team guy, but he has the skill to win a
playoff round.
</P>
<P>
   Bure is a joy to watch, a rarity in today's humdrum game. No one
can equal his combined skating and stickhandling skills, and yet,
when he was there for the asking, the silence around the league was
haunting. Bill Torrey and Bryan Murray, No. 1 and No. 2 in the
Miami front office, knew enough to make the obvious move. The fact
that so few others made serious attempts to acquire Bure ought to
tell a few club owners that their on-ice woes can be traced
directly to their front-office faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of the Rock
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leaf Gardens bids adieu to its beloved Leafs in a couple
of weeks (Feb. 13 vs. Chicago), but the barn doors will remain open
for business. The Rock, Toronto's entry in the National Lacrosse
League, kicked off their home schedule there last weekend before a
crowd of some 11,000. ``You've got to see a game, it's just wild,''
said Bruins Hall of Famer Bobby Orr, reached last week in his
office at Woolf &AMP; Associates. Orr is part-owner of the Rock, along
with the likes of Leafs tough guy Tie Domi and ex-Bruin
coach/Canadian TV icon Don Cherry. Orr's longtime pal, Bill
Watters, assistant to Leafs president Ken Dryden, put together the
limited partners. ``I played it a little as a kid, but I never took
it too serious,'' said Orr. ``It's one great sport, especially when
it's played inside.'' . . . The Stars don't need toughness behind
the blue line, but don't be surprised to see them pursue Ulf
Samuelsson before the March 23 trade deadline. The value might not
be so much the addition in Dallas as the prevention in Detroit. The
Winged Wheels obviously need something to get going, and Dallas
will do everything it can to keep that from happening, including
siphoning off the dastardly Samuelsson . . . Word around Buffalo is
that the Sabres want a second-round pick for Derek Plante _ the
same compensation they got for sending Donald Audette to the Kings
. . . The Rangers lost out in the Bure hunt, ostensibly because
they wouldn't give up top prospect Manny Malhotra. What will it
take for the Blueshirts to land Theo Fleury? Answer: Todd Harvey.
The Russian Rocket would have guaranteed the Blueshirts a trip to
the playoffs, just as he will for the Panthers (perhaps at the
Bruins' expense?). He was worth Malhotra. But is Fleury worth
giving up Harvey? Answer: No. Remember, Bure will be 28 years old
in March, Fleury 31 in June . . . Surly Sabre Matthew Barnaby
hasn't displayed much of his edge lately. He and the
ever-underperforming Geoff Sanderson, ex- of the Forever .500s,
also have been mentioned in the Fleury swap rumors.
</P>
<P>
   What's up, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruin equipment man Ken ``Doc'' Fleger, who left Causeway
Street last season for a job at the Coyotes' practice facility in
Scottsdale, Ariz., didn't find the career change to his liking. He
hopes to catch on with another NHL club for next season . . . When
Luc Robitaille notched his 500th goal at the start of this month,
his LA teammates presented him with a home entertainment system. He
returned the favor by presenting each of them with a bottle of Dom
Perignon. What, the local packie was out of Marcel Dionne? . . .
Former No. 1 pick Alexandre Daigle finally was traded Friday, from
Philadelphia to Tampa Bay via Edmonton. The Flyers had him swapped
at the All-Star break for the Oilers' Andrei Kovalenko, but the
deal crashed when Daigle snubbed a one-year, $1 million contract
extension offered by Edmonton boss Glen Sather. Another rumor, via
ESPN, had Daigle headed to the Kings for Steve Duchesne, who has
done little since returning to LaLa Land as a free agent from the
Blues. Daigle hopes to be an actor someday (someday?), and would
have preferred a swap to Anaheim or Los Angeles to pursue his
thespian aspirations (no, not something routinely treated in a
hyperbaric chamber) . . . Don't you think Bryan Smolinski would
look good again in a Bruins sweater? He's banking just shy of $1.8
million this season with the Islanders, playing on a third line.
His career has gone straight to nowhere, truly a disappointment
after his strong play in the World Cup. He's only 27, and if he's
not playing on a first or second line, his skills don't mean much .
. . NHL Players Association brotherhood update: Prior to the Devils
playing in San Jose a couple of weeks ago, New Jersey defenseman
Scott Stevens telephoned Brantt Myhres and apologized for calling
the Sharks tough guy ``a drunk'' when the clubs clashed just after
the New Year. Myhres graciously accepted the olive branch . . .
Tampa GM/coach Jacques Demers says it would be difficult to deal
Wendel Clark, but the truth is, he'll have no choice but to let him
go if somebody offers the Bolts a legit mid-20s forward or
defenseman who could contribute over the next 5-7 years. Now in
their seventh season, the Bolts will miss the playoffs for the
sixth time this April. Does it get any more basic than that? Either
they establish a franchise base, and soon, or there will be no fan
base to cultivate. Clark to Boston? Sure, nice fit. But what
mid-20s legit performer could the Bruins afford to send Tampa's
way?
</P>
<P>
   A good match
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you love to listen in on some of the conversations
between Brian Sutter and nutcase Andrei Nazarov, the 6-foot-5-inch
Russian Bear the Flames recently acquired from Tampa Bay for
Michael Nylander? Nazarov's infamous ``I even scare myself
sometimes'' line will follow him forever. And it's just that kind
of gonzo grittiness that Sutter loves. Nazarov has the oh-so-rare
good drool factor . . . From the Deep In The File Drawer Dept.:
Marc Crawford, hired last Sunday to replace Mike Keenan as coach in
Vancouver, was the Canucks winger who landed the last hit on
Normand Leveille the night of Oct. 14, 1982. Moments after the
thundering, head-banging check along the boards, Leveille was
wisked away for life-saving surgery to repair a cerebral
hemorrhage. Medical experts said it was a congenital malformation
that led to Leveille's injury and permanent paralysis. Wonder if
they ever compared their X-rays with the game film . . . USA Hockey
has notified NHL headquarters that it would like to know in the
next 6-8 weeks whether the league intends to send its best and
brightest to Salt Lake City for the 2002 Olympic Games. If not,
Colorado Springs has to begin shingling together an itinerary for a
pre-Olympic tour that would begin in the fall of 2001. The
player-selection process undoubtedly would begin during the 2000
offseason. The bet here: NHL commish Gary Bettman and his fellow
Lords of the Boards go to Olympus if they're guaranteed enough
prime-time TV exposure. It doesn't have to be a 2 1/2-hour time
slot, just, say, 45 quality minutes per night . . . You weren't
doing your hockey due diligence last week if you missed Pope John
Paul II, during his visit to St. Louis, turning his cane upside
down and pretending to use it as a hockey stick, drawing deafening
cheers from the crowd. What will happen first: the ESPN commercial,
with His Holiness doling out hip checks at Bristol headquarters, or
Nike issuing its new Papal Tiger skate line? Stay tuned.

NATO GETS GO-AHEAD FOR KOSOVO AIRSTRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ Western powers, frustrated at the crumbling of a
cease-fire in Kosovo, cleared the way Saturday for a military
attack, authorizing the leader of NATO to call airstrikes if
hastily arranged peace negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, European nations agreed to send ground troops to
enforce the peace in the long-troubled Serbian province, an idea
being discussed within the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO stands ready to act,'' the alliance's Secretary General
Javier Solana told reporters Saturday in Brussels, after NATO voted
to authorize airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take this decision in the light of both parties'
compliance with international commitments,'' he said. That comment
referred to concerns that earlier threats were directed only at
Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, and not also at the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a guerrilla force made up of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these demands are not met,'' Solana said, ``NATO is ready
to take whatever actions are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Contact Group'' of six Western nations has
demanded that both the Serbs and the Albanians meet Saturday in
Rambouillet, France, to hammer out an agreement to give
``substantial autonomy'' to the southern Serbian province in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain, meanwhile, offered ground troops to back up
any negotiated agreement. And German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said Bonn was prepared to deploy around 3,000 troops in
Kosovo if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has floated the idea, but has not made a firm
commitment to providing ground troops, which many analysts regard
as critical to keeping a negotiated peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made no decisions, and the foreign policy
team has made no recommendations,'' insisted David Leavy, the
spokesman for the National Security Council. The White House does
not want ground troops in a situation where there is combat, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's latest threat received a cool response in Belgrade, where
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook personally delivered the
ultimatum to Milosevic. The Yugoslav president, who has maintained
that he will not give autonomy to the 90 percent, ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo, has a week to start negotiations, and three
weeks to come to an agreement, or face airstrikes, Cook told
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic refused to conduct the negotiations in the French
town, near Paris, saying that Kosovo is ``an integral part of
Serbia'' and that talks should be held in-country. But Cook said
Milosevic did not outright refuse the demand to hold talks
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not expect to get a `yes' on the spot,'' Cook told
reporters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Cook then flew to Skopje, Macedonia, to meet with feuding
Albanian leaders. Divisions on the Albanian side represent another
stumbling block to peace, even though Albanians are united in
feeling wronged by the ruling Serbian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova has backed a nonviolent
solution. But he has no control over the KLA, which has waged a
guerrilla war against the Serb police and army for about a year,
and which refuses to accept anything less than independence for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, for his part, refuses to give Kosovo independence.
His armed forces have waged an aggressive assault against KLA-held
territory in Kosovo, including civilian homes. About 2,000 people,
mainly Albanians, have died since the conflict began, and 250,000
have been forced to flee their homes to escape burning and looting
of ethnic Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   A critical question now is the KLA's commitment to peace talks.
Last October's cease-fire agreement was wrested from Milosevic, and
the KLA was not at the negotiating table. It is not clear whether a
KLA representative will be at the negotiating table in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have complained that when they pull back their forces,
as specified in the October agreement, the KLA only moves in and
takes over the territory.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO airstrike against Milosevic, many fear, would only
buttress the KLA's position, provoke Milosevic anew, and escalate
the conflict. KLA members, in interviews, have said that they are
waiting for help via a NATO air assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one seems to know how to handle'' the KLA, said John
Mueller, a professor and Balkan specialist at the University of
Rochester. ``You can probably intimidate Milosevic into some kind
of deal, but it's not clear what's happening with the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair reiterated Saturday that the
peace must be adhered to by both sides. ``We're not going to step
in to fight some kind of war on behalf of the UCK,'' he told CNN,
referring to the Albanian acronym for the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The West has been very sensitive recently about appearing to be
even-handed in the conflict. Milosevic has been the main target of
air assault threats, although the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's Kosovo Verification Mission has accused
both the Serbs and the KLA of violating the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Both the violence and the tension came to a head two weeks ago,
when the verification mission discovered the bodies of 45 ethnic
Albanians, dressed in civilian clothes and dumped on a muddy, rural
hillside near Racak.
</P>
<P>
   Mission chief William Walker quickly accused the Serbs of
committing the massacre, a statement that nearly got him thrown out
of the country. Since the day of the discovery of the corpses,
there has been violence or a hostage situation nearly every day,
suggesting that the cease-fire has been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been more sharp-tongued since then in his criticism
of the KLA, referring to their taking of five Serbian hostages last
week as a ``terrorist act.'' It was the first time Walker used the
word ``terrorist,'' the word Serbs use to describe KLA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb civilian was killed and his wife was seriously injured
Saturday when a grenade exploded in their bedroom in northwestern
Kosovo, the Serbia Media Center reported. On Friday night, a
grenade exploded in a bar in the Kosovo capital of Pristina,
injuring six Serbs and one Albanian. The attack, a rare instance of
ethnic violence in relatively calm Pristina, came hours after 24
Albanians and one Serb policeman were killed in Rogovo, near the
Albanian border.

A PERFORMANCE FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of us who relish golf history, we usually find it on
our bookshelves. We blow away the dust and learn of the magic
created by the likes of Old Tom Morris and Harry Vardon, Willie
Anderson and Walter Hagen, Francis Ouimet and Bobby Jones. Gene
Sarazen made a double eagle that put an everlasting smile on the
game and Byron Nelson was truly unbeatable one war-torn summer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us were not there that fateful Saturday in 1960 when
Arnold Palmer drove the first green at Cherry Hill and helped
invent professional golf as we know it. Nor were we there two
summers later when Jack Nicklaus stole The King's thunder and set
in motion a string of major successes that would redefine the way a
champion should play.
</P>
<P>
   History all of it, but most of us must trust the written words
because we weren't there for any of it. Which is why it was so
special to watch David Duval's round of 59 last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the game's greatest moments, and to be witness to
it _ albeit from in front of a TV set _ was a treat. There are
images of sports heroes that gently, and easily, come to mind when
greatness is recalled: Willie Mays settling under a fly ball, Bobby
Orr rushing the puck, Gale Sayers returning a kick, Bob Cousy
leading the break. Now add to that the graceful performance under
pressure by Duval.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to argue that Johnny Miller's 63 at Oakmont in 1973
and Ben Hogan's 67 at Oakland Hills in 1951 were more noteworthy
because they came in final rounds of US Opens on grueling layouts,
you will find plenty of support (and no argument here).
</P>
<P>
   But Duval's effort should not be dismissed; it should be
embraced, for it was as close to perfection as we shall ever see in
golf. This was not Al Geiberger shooting 59 in the second round
with the lift-clean-and-place rule in effect. This was not Chip
Beck shooting 59 on a Las Vegas course that was much too short by
PGA Tour standards. Wonderful, historic rounds they were, but they
were not final-day efforts, and they had chip-ins and long putts
that players don't think of holing.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Duval's round was beyond description, a string of
frozen ropes off the tee, one laser-beam iron on top of another,
with more deadly accuracy than has ever been shown in heated
competition. (Did his playing partners say anything to Duval, Jeff
Maggert was asked. ``We just kept saying, `Nice shot.' '') Only one
of Duval's 11 birdie putts came from 10 feet or more, and the eagle
that put the punctuation mark on the afternoon was from 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight should have stayed on Duval's historic
accomplishment, but it shifted to incidental matters such as the
world rankings. Duval is No. 2, behind Tiger Woods, but who cares?
It is only a piece of paper, spit out by a computer that is
programmed by people who probably can't comprehend the magnitude of
skill it took for Duval to scorch that 5-iron 218 yards, with the
tournament on the line, to set up his eagle at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Being No. 1 on some mindless list gives you a moment in the
spotlight. A 59 in the clutch gives you a spot in the history
books.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the history, particularly when there's a view.
</P>
<P>
   A Hogan reminder
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday will mark the 50th anniversary of an event that had
nothing to do with golf but everything to do with the making of
arguably the game's most revered icon. It was in the early morning
of Feb. 2, 1949, that a car driven by Ben Hogan collided with a
Greyhound bus on a foggy road some 80 miles east of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan was returning to his home in Fort Worth from a tournament
in Phoenix, where he had lost in a playoff to Jimmy Demaret. At 36,
Hogan was in his prime, the best player in the game, owner of two
PGA Championships and the 1948 US Open. The accident probably would
have killed him had he not dived across the front seat to protect
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries were severe, from the broken bones _ pelvis,
collarbone, ribs, and ankle _ to the life-threatening blood clots
in his left leg. It was surgery to repair those clots that led to a
permanent circulatory problem that caused Hogan to limp.
</P>
<P>
   If he were a legend in the making before the crash (his 37th
professional victory had come at Pebble Beach the week before the
Phoenix tournament), the courageous comeback immortalized him. All
the polls and surveys and opinions that rate our greatest athletes
of the 20th century will mean nothing if William Ben Hogan is not
near the top.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Venturi may cherish his friendship with Hogan as much as he
does his 1964 US Open victory, and he knows very well that Hogan
was a man of few words _ and none when it came to that accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never brought it up,'' said Venturi. ``I never asked him
about it and I never heard him mention it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he started out in pro golf, Venturi made it a point to get
close to Hogan, to play practice rounds with him, to study
everything about him. That Hogan came back to win the US Open 16
months after the accident, then go on to win five more majors, all
while struggling to keep his stamina on a bad leg, is the stuff
Hollywood usually has to invent. But in Hogan's case, they had the
real-life script, which led to the movie, ``Follow the Sun,''
filmed in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironic that they made the movie thinking he couldn't come
back,'' said Venturi. ``But he proved them wrong _ as he always
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite's new role
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite will again be part of the Ryder Cup scene when it
arrives at The Country Club in September, though in a far less
pressure-packed role _ and one more financially rewarding _ than he
had two years ago in Spain when he was US captain. Sources say Kite
will be part of the BankBoston corporate picture, socializing with
guests, and perhaps playing golf with clients at Charles River CC
in Newton . . . When the MGA holds its spring conference March 9 at
the Westin Copley Place in Boston, the theme will be ``A Salute to
the Ryder Cup.'' The event is usually attended by member club
directors, but it is open to the public this year and a silent
auction will be held. Among the items for sale: chances to play
golf at Worcester CC, site of the 1927 Ryder Cup, and The Country
Club. For information, call 781-449-3000 . . . Kirk Hanefeld, one
of the premier club professionals in New England, has left Salem CC
to become director of golf at the Ridge Club in Sandwich . . .
Another New Englander on the move is John Brown, the popular head
pro at the Woodlands in Falmouth, Maine. He'll be carrying on his
duties at the Brookside Club in Allentown, Pa. . . . Tracy West has
been named tournament director for the annual BankBoston Classic, a
staple on the Senior PGA Tour that will be at Nashawtuc CC in
Canton Aug. 20-22.
</P>
<P>
   Painful outing
</P>
<P>
   You would have to have a heart as cold as an Anchorage winter
day to not feel for Beck. Casual fans of the PGA Tour probably are
familiar with his struggles the past two years, and it's a mystery
where his game has gone. This is a man who was 6-2-1 in Ryder Cup
matches in 1991 and 1993, a player who once shot a 59 and was
renowned for his optimistic approach to the game. But he can't make
a cut anymore, and his opening round at the Phoenix Open Thursday
was a particularly sore thing to behold _ three doubles and eight
bogeys in a round of 83. He played his front side in 9 over,
recording one par, one double, and seven bogeys . . . They were the
first pair off the tee in the final round of the Naples LPGA
Memorial last Sunday, so Britons Mhairi McKay and Alison Nicholas
decided to have some fun. They often ran between shots and spent
little time over their balls in an attempt to play the quickest
round in Tour history. Alas, they fell 14 minutes shy of the mark,
which is 1 hour 50 minutes. One hour 50 minutes? That's about three
swings for Jose Maria Olazabal . . . Woods has committed to next
week's AT&AMP;T at Pebble Beach, again paired with Kevin Costner.
Wonder if there's any chance they'll be grouped with Woods's
Stanford teammate, Notah Begay, whose amateur partner will be
Hughes Norton, the IMG agent who helped make Woods a very rich
young man, then got fired last year.

LEWINSKY RETURNS TO D.C. FOR TRIAL TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The circus returned to town Saturday, as swarms of
reporters, paparazzi, and political activists converged for the
arrival of Monica S. Lewinsky for her high-stakes deposition Monday
in President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under a heavy police escort after a flight from Los Angeles,
Lewinsky rushed from a shiny sport utility vehicle to a downtown
hotel room and the uncertainty that awaits her. The former White
House intern will be questioned for the first time Monday by the
president's lawyers and a House member who is pushing for the 42d
president's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica, Monica,'' some spectators shouted, as others waved
placards emblazoned with anti-Clinton broadsides: ``Jail to the
Chief,'' ``Treason is the Reason,'' ``God Bless the Dress.''
</P>
<P>
   It was DNA evidence on Lewinsky's dress that purportedly
confirmed Clinton's sexual relationship with her. Clinton faces two
articles of impeachment charging him with perjury before a federal
grand jury and obstructing justice to try to conceal his affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With two senators presiding over the private deposition,
Lewinsky will be questioned for up to eight hours at the
Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, where she is staying, five blocks from
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On 22 previous occasions when she has testified under oath to
FBI investigators or a federal grand jury, Lewinsky has shown a
keen recollection for the details of her relationship with Clinton
and the circumstances stemming from their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Ed Bryant, a Tennessee Republican who will
question her for the House prosecution team, is expected to focus
largely on elements of the obstruction charge against Clinton. The
Senate prohibited the House team from asking Lewinsky about details
of her sexual relationship with the president, which directly
relate to the charge that he lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   A central issue in the deposition will be several grand-jury
statements that Lewinsky made about the alleged coverup. At one
point, she testified, ``No one ever asked me to lie, and I was
never promised a job for my silence.'' At another point, she said,
``The best way for me to explain how I feel what happened was, you
know, no one asked me or encouraged me to lie, but no one
discouraged me either.''
</P>
<P>
   The House team is trying to persuade the Senate that Clinton and
his friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., helped Lewinsky try to find her
``dream job'' in New York in exchange for her filing a false
affidavit about her relationship with the president in a sexual
harassment suit that Paula Corbin Jones filed against him and
settled last year for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also is expected to question Lewinsky about Clinton's
personal secretary, Betty Currie, hiding gifts that the president
had given Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers are expected to treat Lewinsky gently in the
hope she will support their position that no evidence directly
supports the House team's theory of Clinton's alleged obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's deposition will be videotaped. The House team is
expected to ask the Senate later this week to permit Lewinsky to
testify in person on the Senate floor. Should that request be
rejected, the House members are expected to request that portions
of the videotaped deposition be shown to the full Senate.

LAWRENCE TAYLOR'S FINAL RIFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Lawrence Taylor was elected to the pro football Hall of
Fame Saturday. But far from being the no-brainer L.T. had
predicted, the vote was a wrenching moral wrestling match _ a match
that is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of news media members selected Taylor and four others
_ Eric Dickerson, Billy Shaw, Tom Mack and Ozzie Newsome. Long
after the vote was announced, members of the panel discussed,
defended and debated whether Taylor, plagued by drug problems for
years, deserved to be in the pro football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor transformed professional football the way Charlie Parker
transformed music; each made great innovations despite horrifying
drug addictions that ripped apart their lives and, in Bird's case,
took his life at the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Parker are in their respective Halls of Fame. `Bird,'
as Parker was called, was elected virtually the instant he died;
Taylor was elected on the first ballot. But Taylor was elected amid
a heated debate among a distinguished panel of voters over whether
he truly belonged in the Hall. Consistent with the climate of
self-righteous indignation, the panel grappled with whether great
performance on the field is enough. Should off-field character
count? Ultimately the decision was no.
</P>
<P>
   L.T., despite being in the Miami area while working on a movie,
did not appear before news media members Saturday and declined to
speak to them by phone. He said through a spokesman that he didn't
want to go through the ordeal of justifying why he belongs in the
Hall of Fame. His performance speaks for itself. He said in a
statement that he appreciated the debate surrounding his selection.
``Ultimately, this honor has to do with how I played the game,'' he
said. ``Obviously the majority of the committee felt the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, L.T. The majority felt honor bound to the Hall of
Fame bylaws which mandate, quite simply, that on-field performance
is the only criterion. Despite the straightforward guidelines, the
panel of voters fiercely debated the efficacy of Taylor's election.
At the end of the selection process, they voted on a motion to
include character and conduct in the bylaws. The measure failed by
24-11 with one abstention. For now, the rule of the day is
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The players in the pro football Hall of Fame are connected by
how they performed when they left the locker room and walked onto
the field; not by what they did when they left the field for the
bars, bedrooms and brothels.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty I have with L.T. has nothing to do with whether
he is in or out of the Hall of Fame, but with whether he cherishes
the institution. He certainly respects the players in the Hall, but
maybe not the Hall itself. Clearly, he doesn't cherish his own
legacy. If he had, long ago, he might have thought about how he
might be remembered in history _ as well as the history his family
must live with.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Taylor's 17-year-old son found himself in the position
not of basking in his father's glory, but of defending his father's
continuing addiction. Right now L.T.'s on-field exploits are fresh
and powerful; 10 or 20 years from now they will be diminished by
time and the most graphic memories will be those of his off-field
exploits and excesses. When I think about Bobby Layne I think of a
swashbuckling drinker who showed up for games hung over. Taylor
never traduced the Xs and Os of the game and that is why he is in
the Hall of Fame. His play was superb, consistently intense.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling than whether L.T. is in the Hall is the role the
news media plays in putting him there _ or keeping him out. There
is an irresistible temptation on the part of the media to become
more actively involved in the game, to break out of the press box
and get involved in a world many of us love and respect. This
relationship between athletes and the news media is like being in a
great zoo. There are areas you'd like to visit, but there is a
reason why those bars are there, and we cross them at our peril.
Members of the media have to remove themselves from a voting
process in which they have no business being involved. Interpret
the news, lend perspective to the news. But don't make the news,
determine and manipulate history.
</P>
<P>
   Football writers would never submit to having their careers
judged by a panel of football players led by, say Keyshawn Johnson.
What gives the news media the right to not judge athletes on their
athletic abilities, but to judge morality? Or are we saying, in our
arrogance, that we are better equipped to judge them than they are
to judge us? It's as if the media, not the United States Senate,
were to vote on the president's guilt or innocence. That is not our
role; more than that, that is not our place. Our place is in the
press box, beyond the sidelines, reporting, analyzing, discovering
and uncovering news. Not determining.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor is in the hall, where he belongs. Now the men
and women who have spent their lives building franchises, coaching
teams, playing and officiating must determine whether the Halls of
Fame will be sacred or common.
</P>
<P>
   Is the hall a temple or just another prison? &QL;

NBA AGENTS HAVEN'T LOST POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another piece of conventional wisdom passed
quietly through the document shredder over the past week, and maybe
you didn't even notice.
</P>
<P>
   Player agents _ contrary to widespread, premature reports of
their demise _ are alive and well and wreaking havoc in an NBA city
near you.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington. And Minnesota. Phoenix. Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a quick review of the lockout, and the new labor
agreement that resulted, and the hasty conclusions everyone drew.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners won big when they forced the union to accept maximum
salaries for all players. That much is true. But with that came a
common assumption: that maximum salaries would deal a major blow to
agents and their influence. Sadly, not true.
</P>
<P>
   While Milwaukee's Ray Allen has in fact forgone an agent in
favor of an hourly lawyer _ Johnnie Cochrane, and you can write
your own punch line _ there are far more indications that agents
have as much power as ever. Perhaps they can no longer artificially
drive up a player's value by threatening to test the market (see
Kevin Garnett, $126 million), now that the market is an even
playing field, with all teams offering similar money.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped David Falk (remember him?) from having
client Rod Strickland hold out from the Washington Wizards, who
don't want to pay him the max and aren't falling for the
sign-me-and-trade-me bit.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules also didn't stop Tony Dutt and James Bryant from
directing their client, Antonio McDyess, away from the success of
Phoenix to the woes of Denver. There, McDyess is united with
Dutt/Bryant client and buddy Nick Van Exel and a stable of other
Dutt/Bryant players, whose arrivals all appeared to be coordinated
by the agents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves both tried
to get Tom Gugliotta's services, his agent managed to muck things
up so badly that Gugliotta ended up signing with Phoenix _ for
millions less. That story begins and ends with Richard Howell,
agent for both Gugliotta and the Lakers' Elden Campbell. Howell,
with the Lakers' full cooperation of course, wanted to engineer a
swap of his clients, Campbell to Minnesota and Gugliotta to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota wasn't sold on the deal, even though it meant
obtaining Eddie Jones as well. But if given a choice _ let Gugs
walk away for nothing, or get an All-Star guard and solid starting
center _ you'd have to think the Wolves would opt for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Howell thought so, too. So for two weeks, he sat on Minnesota's
offer for the maximum $86.6 million. Didn't respond, didn't say,
``We'll think about it.'' He waited until training camps opened,
when teams were desperately assembling their rosters. He gambled
that Minnesota would panic and make the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bad bet. The Timberwolves, unsure of Gugliotta's intentions, not
willing to let Howell dictate trade terms, rushed out and signed
Joe Smith to a one-year deal. Now they had their power forward, and
Gugliotta, suddenly feeling pushed out the door, turned to Phoenix,
where he signed for $28 million less.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns won. The Lakers, Timberwolves and even Gugliotta lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tommy wanted to be in Phoenix, I'm happy for him,'' said
Minnesota VP Kevin McHale. ``But if he didn't, he ought to fire the
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's true that the Timberwolves never would have made
the deal with the Lakers, based on basketball reasons alone _ i.e.,
they don't think Campbell is worth the $40 million they'd have to
pay, and Jones could leave as a free agent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps, too, if Howell hadn't been playing roulette with
his client's career, things might have turned out differently.
Minnesota was determined not to let the agent run their operation,
though defying him left them empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when the Laker thing was thrown out there, Richard
(Howell) thought that was a very viable option,'' said general
manager/coach Flip Saunders. ``That, I think, intrigued Tommy. But
all I think it did was muddy the waters for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And proved once again that agents still pull the strings in this
league, even if they don't always get the results they want.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of gambles: Before Jerry Reinsdorf and Jerry Krause
decided to Huizenga the Chicago Bulls, dismantling the champions
piece by piece, they had a decision to make: Stink now or stink
later.
</P>
<P>
   Lousy options, and they chose the former. Without Michael
Jordan, the Bulls decided to disband, trading away Scottie Pippen,
Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for draft picks and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   What if they hadn't? Pippen might not lead Chicago to a
championship, but surrounding him with Toni Kukoc, Dennis Rodman
and one quality free agent would have kept the Bulls in the
playoffs for at least another couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they'll send Bill Wennington and the former roster of
the Yakima Sun Kings onto the United Center floor, shooting for a
first-to-worst trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to let them founder, get into the draft lottery,
pick up an impact rookie and use all the salary-cap space to nab at
least one big free agent. Unfortunately for the Bulls, that last
part might not work out as planned either.
</P>
<P>
   With the new maximum salaries and higher pay for players who
stay with their teams, player movement will slow to a crawl.
Already, potential free agents Allen Iverson (Philadelphia),
Shareef Abdur-Rahim (Vancouver), Antoine Walker (Boston), Kobe
Bryant (Lakers) and Zydrunas Ilgauskas (Cleveland) have signed
extensions for the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only a handful of top-flight potential free agents
from the draft class of '96: Marcus Camby, Stephon Marbury, Ray
Allen, Kerry Kittles and Vitaly Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   That rebuilding project could outlast the Bulls' eight-year
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Mastering the NBA: Hip-hop mogul Master P, who wants to double
as a pro basketball player, went to training camp with the
Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   The original hip-hop hoopster, the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal,
isn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him play. He's all right, I guess,'' O'Neal said. ``Just
keep in mind, I was the first to do both and dominate both. That's
all that matters. Everyone else is just copycats.'' &QL;

HOUSE MANAGERS HOPE TO MAKE LEWINSKY APPEAR SYMPATHETIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To tape or not to tape is not the question. It's
how the witnesses will play to the cameras that is making Democrats
on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue quiver.
</P>
<P>
   Who will sweat? Who will fidget? What secrets will be uncovered
in the body language of the three witnesses as they testify before
House managers, White House lawyers, senators, and videocameras
this week?
</P>
<P>
   And, if the nation has a chance to see and hear Monica S.
Lewinsky, will the media caricature of the lovesick intern be
replaced by the image of a sympathetic, vulnerable,
three-dimensional young woman who was used and dumped by a cad in
the White House?
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest danger to the president is that Monica will come
off as a likable, star-struck little girl seduced by a powerful
male,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at Claremont
Graduate University. ``It will be very difficult to overcome that
perception on the video. In politics, perception is reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Though conviction of Clinton still appears doubtful, Democrats
worry that unfavorable images from the videotapes could linger long
after the trial ends.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators fought last week against videotaping the
depositions of Lewinsky, Washington lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr.,
and presidential adviser Sidney Blumenthal. In particular, they
argued, it would exploit Lewinsky and dishonor the chamber to have
tapes about a sexual affair shown in the Senate chamber.
Republicans promised they would vote again before playing the
videotapes in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 1999, we're about to go into the year 2000,'' said
Senate majority leader Trent Lott. ``To not have videotape
available for senators, and maybe beyond that, is not defensible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democratic leader Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota
said he feared the videotapes would lead to to live witnesses. ``We
don't want the spectacle of Monica Lewinsky or anyone else. . . .
We don't need salacious material.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Rhode, a professor at Stanford University Law School,
was hired by House Judiciary Committee Democrats last year to be
their guide on gender issues, particularly on how to handle the
sensitive issue of Lewinsky. Rhode is skeptical that preserving the
former intern's reputation is what drives Democrats against the
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit hard to take at face value these professed
concerns, that their opposition is to protect the dignity of Monica
Lewinsky,'' Rhode said. ``I would not say that has been a high
priority through the proceedings, and I am not convinced it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are concerned about is how this will play in Peoria,
and whether there is something that comes out in the visual
presentation that will poison people's views of President
Clinton,'' Rhode said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the president's aides went into high gear to
discredit Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer, after
she appeared on ``60 Minutes'' and said Clinton groped her outside
the Oval Office. Joseph diGenova, a Republican and a former federal
prosecutor, said the Lewinsky videotape could cause the same
negative public reaction to the president, and the same
``good-to-evil turn on Lewinsky'' from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they afraid of with the videotape?'' diGenova asked.
``For one thing, people might start to tell the truth. The other is
that the image of Monica Lewinsky _ youthful, naive _ is going to
get people rethinking this whole case.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the White House and Republican managers will handle
Lewinsky with care. They remember the harsh questioning of Anita
Hill during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas, after Hill accused Thomas of sexually harassing
her. The questioning caused an angry political backlash that led to
the election of a record number of women to Congress in 1992 and
nearly cost some senators on the Judiciary Committee their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly to their benefit not to rile Lewinsky and send
her into some furor,'' Jeffe said. ``It is best not to make her
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   House managers are spending the weekend preparing for the
depositions. They hope that Lewinsky, Jordan, or Blumenthal will
deliver a bombshell, contradicting what they told the grand jury
based on a refreshed memory or a new fact. It has been reported,
for example, that when Lewinsky met with House managers last week,
she expressed surprise over the extent to which the president
portrayed her as a stalker. That could come up.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, though, House managers are looking for witnesses to
adjust their stories just enough, or leave such strong visual
impressions, that the Senate feels compelled to hear from the
witnesses in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Videotaped testimony is one step closer to live testimony, and
therefore it is viewed by the Republican side as a step in the
direction of prolonging the trial and, then, hoping something will
emerge that swings negative into positive votes,'' said Marvin
Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics,
and Public Policy at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaping depositions has become quite common, particularly in
civil litigation, and it does change the dynamic when witnesses
testify before cameras, lawyers say. A witness's appearance and
demeanor become relevant; unlike transcripts, videotapes show how
long a witness takes to answer a question, as well as gestures and
body language.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosensteil, director for the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, a nonprofit group, said he does not expect a video
camera to rattle Lewinsky. ``She is probably one of the most
videotaped women in America already,'' he said, but, he added, it
could have some effect on the senators viewing the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine a lot of senators scrolling the videos, checking
the instant replays, looking for mannerisms, sweaty palms, and
shifty eyes,'' said Rosensteil, the former media critic at the Los
Angeles Times. ``The cameras may not affect what anyone says in
their depositions, but it could cause senators to get fixated on
exactly the wrong things.''

 &HT;    Davis a headache for opponents
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Terrell Davis is ready. He has one big sign for his
hotel room, another big sign for his locker at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Take your Indocin.
</P>
<P>
   That is the drug that prevents his migraines, the one he forgot
to down until shortly before kickoff of Super Bowl XXXII last
January in San Diego, the one that almost left him alongside
Scottie Pippen in the Hall of Infamous Postseason Headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, of course, snapped out of the funk, regained his vision
and ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns to give Denver its first
Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   The headache is long gone. And now Davis is earning a reputation
not only as the NFL's best player of today _ he was named MVP for
the 1998 season _ but also as one of the best big-game athletes
ever.
</P>
<P>
   If Reggie Jackson was Mr. October, then Davis is starting to
look like Mr. January.
</P>
<P>
   In four seasons, he has played seven postseason games, scoring
at least one touchdown in each and averaging 145.2 rushing yards _
the best in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, he will be facing a defense that finished the
regular season ranked second in the NFL against the run, a defense
that for all its nice talk about Davis, believes it can stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no super-human players in this league,'' Atlanta
defensive end Chuck Smith said. ``Everybody can be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   But how?
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins did it in December. They held Davis to 29 yards in
a Monday Night meeting at Pro Player Stadium. Of course, three
weeks later in Denver, Davis took an injury-depleted Dophins'
defense and racked up 199 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He burned the Dolphins with what has become the Broncos'
bread-and-butter play: a pitch to Davis that allows him get the
ball deep in the backfield and look for a hole.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes Davis so effective is that once he
spots that hole, he makes it through. Not just most of the time.
Nearly all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't second-guess himself and dance,'' Smith said.
``There's a lot of guys out there who like to dance and sit back
there and be cute. ... When he sees that crease, he's going to hit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Tom Jackson, a former Broncos' linebacker, said: ``If you
open it up 10 times, he's going to hit it nine times.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if he doesn't, that doesn't mean you have stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one in the league more physical than Terrell
Davis,'' Jackson said. ``He can run you over or he can take it
80.''
</P>
<P>
   Or both.
</P>
<P>
   The first strategical question for the Falcons is this: Do they
stick with their traditional seven-man front, which would seem like
a hanging curveball for Davis to hit? Or do they go with an
eight-man front?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' players gave different answer to that question this
week. Linebacker Jessie Tuggle said they plan to start with the
seven-man front. Safety Eugene Robinson said they will cut the to
chase, so to speak, and use eight-man fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``(To stop him) you have to try to cut out the running lanes and
play an eight-man front,'' he said. ``I know that puts a lot of
pressure on the pass defense. Ray Buchanan and our other
cornerbacks have got to come up big against John Elway, because we
(the other defenders) have to stop Terrell Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice the verb he uses. They (ITALICS) have to (END) stop
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the consensus. If the Falcons can't stop Davis,
or at least slow down his record-setting pace, they can't win this
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to attack him,'' Smith said. ``We are not going to
sit back there and stargaze.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But there is another problem. If you worry too much
about running to the place where Davis is, you can end up being
burned by his cut-backs. Just ask the Dolphins. Once he blew
through holes in their line, he left the field littered with
linebackers and safeties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be disciplined,'' Tuggle said. ``The second time
Miami played Denver, the linebackers overpursued a little bit. We
can't play that kind of game against Terrell.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. January can be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Just give him a migraine so bad that he can't even see.
</P>
<P>
   That did the trick for a half against the Packers. Then the
emergency nasal spray that Broncos trainer Steve Antonopulos gave
Davis, began to kick in. This year, it seems unlikely that will be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has the signs ready. And his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is going to be reminding him,'' fellow running back
Vaughn Hebron said. ``Believe me, there's no way Terrell's going to
forget this time.

 &HT;    Backs stage to Anderson
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos present this gift
to football fans today: Runs in their stockings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key to the game is which running back is going to
establish his dominance,'' said former Broncos linebacker Tom
Jackson, of the backs which finished first and second in the NFL in
yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Will Terrell Davis' slashing burn Atlanta? Can Jamal Anderson
ramble downhill on Denver?
</P>
<P>
   Davis would enjoy watching this game, since he's a ''running
backs fan,'' who speaks of the ''friendly game of chess that
running backs play.'' He and Anderson move like queens, rooks,
bishops and knights all in one. Take them out, defensive coaches
and players say, and you ''check'' their offenses, by neutralizing
play-action passing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is being able to run the football,
because then you can select when you want to throw it,'' Falcons
offensive coordinator George Sefcik said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can stop (Anderson), it would put the ball in (Chris)
Chandler's hands and they have to do it that way,'' said Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski.
</P>
<P>
   Davis rushed 392 times this season, for 2,008 yards, the
third-best total in history. Anderson gained 1,846 yards on a
league-record 410 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather face Terrell Davis any day instead of facing
Jamal Anderson,'' Falcons cornerback Michael Booker said. ''Jamal
will run to you just to run over you. Terrell is strong and he's
fast and all of those things, but we're going to put two or three
guys on him and hit him early.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, these early (dirty) birds may get the worm.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammed Ali was in the hospital the day Jamal Anderson was
born, waiting to see his bodyguard's son. Twenty-six years later,
James' baby boy Jamal is more bull than butterfly or bee, some say
in more ways than one: a big talker with a big ego, but also a big,
gifted back who presents enormous problems for a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all he's fast, so he can outrun you,'' Broncos safety
Tyrone Braxton said. ''Second of all, he's quick, so he can
outmaneuver you. He's got quick feet. I remember the Detroit game
he stopped on a dime and cut back against the linebackers. And
three is power. He can run you over. Growing up watching Earl
Campbell, that's who he reminds me most of. He's strong, he's
short, he's thick, he's quick and he's fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a complete football player,'' Sefcik said of the former
seventh-round pick. ''He'll step up against the best of them and
pick up blitzing linebackers. He'll block in the running game too,
if you ask him. He runs excellent routes and can make people
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Microwaves are more complicated than Atlanta's offense. The
Falcons led the NFL in time of possession at 33:10, by bludgeoning
opponents with the 235-pound Anderson and then slipping a lithe
receiver deep. Atlanta was 14-0 this season when Anderson carried
the ball at least 20 times. He gained at least 100 yards in 12 of
16 regular-season games, scored 14 touchdowns and averaged 11.8
yards on 27 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to pound it until it works,'' Falcons fullback
Brian Kozlowski said. ''You're not going to make every tackle on
Jamal, and sooner or later he's going to break one on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Falcons guard Calvin Collins suggests, break your arm if
you get lazy and don't square up. The Broncos, who use safety Steve
Atwater as a fourth linebacker, are good tacklers and skilled at
plugging gaps. Greg Robinson's unit finished second in the league
in rush defense, and allowed 14 yards on 13 carries to both the
Dolphins and the Jets in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They attack well,'' Anderson said. ''They hit the line of
scrimmage fast and they play off the blocks really well. The key
for us is being able to sustain blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, ``I think we can run the ball against anybody.
No question.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What you try to do is eliminate as many big plays as you
possibly can,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ''He's going to
get his yardage. You have to gang-tackle him and slow him down.
He's consistent and durable, and I like his enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a combination of a Napolean Kaufman and Jerome Bettis
runner,'' Broncos linebacker John Mobley said. ''He's got the power
of Jerome and he's shifty enough like Kaufman.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes to use the stiff arm to fend off tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to somehow get that arm away from him, whether it be
grab it or go low on him, there's definitely ways to defend it,''
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said. ''If you have three guys
tackling him, a stiff arm doesn't do any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was hardly stiff this week, drawing on his experience
hanging out with his father's clients, people like Ali, Sugar Ray
Leonard and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always learned to relax in these situations and to enjoy
yourself, and if you do that, the atmosphere won't be a problem,''
he said. ''I'm not nervous in this setting. This is like a natural
environment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The grass at Pro Player Stadium isn't, but Anderson prefers it.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, I'm a little more confident in my football on grass,''
Anderson said. ''I can let it all hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Broncos hang on for dear life.

THE DEVILS FAIL TO HOLD EARLY LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils scored the first two goals
Saturday against the expansion Nashville Predators, then lost in
overtime by 3-2, and afterward they were looking for answers for
their lackadaisical performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunham, Martin Brodeur's former backup with the Devils, had
27 saves for the Predators as they ended the Devils' season-high
four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Devils were overconfident and looked past Nashville
to Monday night's visit by the Detroit Red Wings, one of the
league's elite teams, Coach Robbie Ftorek said to ask the players.
</P>
<P>
   The players maintained that they had just been outworked by
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't hear anybody talk about Monday,'' Randy McKay said.
Lyle Odelein agreed, saying: ``Nobody talked about Detroit. This
was a must win for us and it is unacceptable. They outworked us in
our zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek, who usually praises his team's play regardless of its
performance, pointed to one reason for the Devils' losing a game
they should have put away after first-period goals by Odelein and
Denis Pederson gave them a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play together as a team, and if you don't do that,
you're not going to have success against anybody,'' Ftorek said.
``We just didn't play for 60 minutes and they played hard. They
made some mistakes but they covered up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, the Devils' leading scorer and usually an objective
analyst of the team's performance, was closest to the reason for
the loss to one of the league's weaker teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the tape,'' Holik said, ``you won't see enough
white jerseys around the puck. That means we didn't work hard
enough to support the puck. We have to support each other and do
better as a team. When we turned it on, we were the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils did just fine in the first period. Odelein scored his
first goal of the season, on the power play, with 2 minutes 35
seconds left in the period after a pass by Holik, and Pederson
scored his seventh with 26.9 seconds left. But they never looked
forward after that and rarely threatened with any seriousness the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 2-0, maybe we thought it was going to be an offensive
fest,'' Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who registered his third shutout of the season and 35th
of his career on Thursday night in Boston, faced 23 shots Saturday
afternoon, including two in the overtime. He did not have any
spectacular saves and could take part of the blame for the goals.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Johnson's 11th of the season, 4:13 into the second period,
went in off Brodeur's left arm to cut the Devils' lead to 2-1.
Scott Walker's sixth, which tied the game with 8:25 left in
regulation, started when Brodeur's clearing attempt went to an
opponent in his zone.
</P>
<P>
   And Sebastien Bordeleau's winning goal, 2:43 into overtime, went
through Brodeur's pads to the disappointment of the Continental
Arena matinee crowd of 17,808.
</P>
<P>
   ``He surprised me when he took the shot,'' Brodeur said of
Bordeleau's seventh goal of the season. It gave the Predators
(18-26-4) their second consecutive victory and handed the Devils
(27-15-5) their first overtime loss in eight such games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a moral booster for us,'' said Tom Fitzgerald,
the captain of the Predators, who made the pass for Bordeleau's
winner. ``It's really huge for us because it came on top of winning
in Buffalo. This is one of the toughest teams in the conference,
but we stuck to our system and persevered.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's first goal, by GREG JOHNSON, was the first one
MARTIN BRODEUR allowed in 108 minutes 42 seconds, going back to the
second period of the victory in Los Angeles on Jan. 21. ... MIKE
DUNHAM, Brodeur's understudy last season, was the winning
goaltender in his first meeting against his former team. Dunham
faced 29 shots and improved his record to 12-11-1. ... SERGEI
BRYLIN was scratched for the second game in a row after playing 12
in a row with no goals. ... SHELDON SOURAY was the other healthy
scratch for the Devils, who sent SASHA LAKOVIC to Albany for
conditioning and now have one extra forward.

 31-COX &HT;    Anderson, Davis grew up in different worlds, but arrive at same
destination: Greatness
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Donna Summer, the disco diva, taught him to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali _ whom he simply called Uncle Muhammad _ taught him
magic tricks and later instilled in him the human touch when
dealing people of all persuasions. Sugar Ray Leonard _ at the time
champ of the world _ rode a bicycle to his grade school to say
hello and years later showed him, first-hand, how to handle a press
conference with a touch of class.
</P>
<P>
   Boyz II Men _ who fascinated him with stories of their ascension
from Philadelphia's street corners _ let him try to harmonize with
them. Arsenio Hall slept on the floor of his house. Magic Johnson
would stop by for backyard barbecues and Mike Tyson let him drive
his Mercedes, his Jaguar, the Lamborghini and the Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   This was part of growing up for Jamal Anderson, the star running
back of the Atlanta Falcons and the son of James Anderson, security
chief for dozens of big-name athletes and entertainers from Ali,
Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Richard Pryor to his current
handling of Tyson
</P>
<P>
   When Jamal Anderson talks of reaching for the stars, he means
just that...literally.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, the record setting Denver Broncos ball carrier,
also knows about aiming high _ though his childhood was quite a bit
different than Anderson's.
</P>
<P>
   With Davis, Dad meant little security.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Davis' life too often was alcohol and drugs, and that led to
prison stints for robbery and grand theft, guns around the house,
scales for weighing cocaine and pot and plenty of frightening and
bizarre late-night scenes for young Terrell.
</P>
<P>
   One night in the fall of 1981, Joe _ fueled on malt liquor and
macho _ stumbled home with a taped-up and loaded .38 in his fist.
He woke up his four youngest sons _ Terrell was just nine _ and
said he wanted to find out how tough his kids were.
</P>
<P>
   He backed them against the wall and had them raise their hands.
Then he began shooting into the wall just above them. Plaster flew,
the kids quaked and, through the acrid smell of cordite, Terrell
claims to have felt the hot air of a bullet passing near his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't scared, Davis said. `` I knew he wasn't going to kill
us. He loved us too much.''
</P>
<P>
   This love-hurts style of parenting _ waking the boys at 2 a.m.,
telling them to scoop up their new puppies he suddenly didn't like
and walking the crying kids through the neighborhood as he made
them throw the animals over neighbors' fences _ didn't work. Joe
died young and then Mom took over.
</P>
<P>
   Kateree Davis was 16 when she quit school and married. She got
her GED, took college courses and received a nursing degree. She
worked two jobs, made monthly house payments and did the best to
keep her kids in line.
</P>
<P>
   And right from the start, she made sure Terrell, the youngest of
her six boys, was linked to celebrity. She named him after R&AMP;B
singer Tammi Terrell because she liked the words of her hit song:
Ain't nothing like the real thing, bay-bee. Ain't nothing like the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   So, when it comes to the security business, when it comes to the
real thing, you get a pair of running backs like Jamal Anderson and
Terrell Davis, whose championship match-up today in Miami is like
nothing else in the history of the Super Bowl
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, Davis rushed for an NFL best 2,008
yards and 21 touchdowns. Anderson, second best, ran for 1,846 yards
and 14 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have the league's two biggest ground threats met in
the roman numeral championships. That both of their teams run the
ball with unparalleled vigor means that Super Bowl XXXIII could
give us a game of basic, physical, old-school football. None of the
trendy West Coast offenses. No run and shoot. These teams key their
attacks with a pair of workhorse, outta-my-way backs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of it, defensive linemen and linebackers step up to stop
the run. Pass defenders cheat toward the line to help out and then:
GOTCHA. Each team can and will knock you out with the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, at 210 pounds, is strong, has great vision and a
tremendous burst when he first touches the ball. He is, in the
newly birthed-vocabulary of the ever-talking Denver tight end
Shannon Sharpe, simply ``Terrellian.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpreted by Atlanta defensive coordinator: ``Terrell's a
combination-Jim Brown-Barry Sanders.'' And that comparison is not
as far-fetched as you may think. Davis' career average of 105.1
yards a game is tops all-time in the NFL, just ahead of Browns
104.3 and Sanders 99.8.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led the NFL this season with a dozen 100-yard games. He
weighs 234 pounds and most of the weigh seems to be in his legs,
which keep churning and make him difficult to bring down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal has had an outstanding year,'' said Atlanta coach Dan
Reeves. ``I've been around running backs like Tony Dorsett, Calvin
Hill and Walt Garrison and I don't know that anybody had as good a
year as Jamal had.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, Davis is the better known. He was the league's MVP
this season and last year was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXII when he
demolished Green Bay with 157 yards rushing yards and three
touchdowns. His autobiography _ TD: Dreams in Motion _ just came
out and a movie on his life is in the works. Last July, he signed
an eight-year contract extension worth $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons' brass say Anderson's contract is being reworked so it's
closer to Davis' dough. And that will be just one more thing that
makes them amazingly similar.
</P>
<P>
   Neither back is particularly fast or elusive and they both came
into the league with absolutely no fan fare. Both had
undistinguished college careers _ Anderson at Utah, Davis at Long
Beach State and then Georgia. Combined they ran for less than half
the yards of this year's Heisman hero, Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was a seventh round pick _ the 24th running back _
chosen in the 1994 NFL draft. Davis was selected in the sixth round
_ 21st running back _ in 1995. Each went to his first NFL camp as
the fifth-rated halfback on his team. Neither was supposed to make
the cut, much less carry a team to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal had the same situation I did, we came along late in the
draft and showed people you can't count someone out because of some
report on paper,'' Davis said. ``Knowing where we came from, maybe
it will bring people a lot of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said this Super Bowl is ``the reward for all late round
picks. I'm not unlike Terrell's situation. You have to fight and
claw your way to where we are now. It's something I've worked for
my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Anderson _ as his dad relates _ it's a childhood dream come
true.
</P>
<P>
   James Anderson tells of sitting in front of the TV watching
Pittsburgh defeat the L.A. Rams in Super Bowl XIV and little Jamal
announcing: ``I'm going to be in that game!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's a good one, Jamal,'' said Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Still it was thanks to James that his boy learned his patented
stiff arm move. It almost got the kid banned from his Pop Warner
League, but it sure worked wonders in the playoffs when he used it
twice on 49ers safety Merton Hanks _ on the same play _ during a
34-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   As for Davis, it was his mom who kept him pointed in the right
direction even as violence took its toll on others around him. One
of his older brothers went to prison after shooting a pregnant
woman whose fetus died during a robbery. Then his best friend was
shot to death over a gambling debt.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of their childhoods shaped Anderson and Davis into
caring players of today. This Super Bowl week both were involved in
high-profile fund raising projects for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Davis takes special care of his mother, whom he has moved out of
San Diego and built a home around the corner in his Aurora, Colo.,
neighborhood. Anderson is taking care of his offensive linemen with
ever-increasing gestures of appreciation. When he passed the
1,000-yard mark early in the season he ordered a truck load of
20-inch televisions for his blockers. Once he topped 1,800 yards,
he bought them 36-inch flat screen TVs that cost $2,700 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boxes are getting bigger,'' Falcon left tackle Bob
Whitfield said. ``When I saw this last one I just said, 'He's the
greatest running back ever.'''
</P>
<P>
   In turn the lineman take Anderson to lunch every Friday and they
pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says, 'Hey that's not the way it goes. The running
back is always supposed to reach for the check,''' Anderson said
with a laugh. ``I just tell 'em, 'Hey, it's the '90s. Just like
women asking guys out on dates and paying the bill. These are new
times. Those old notions are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ...Except on the football field, today.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta meets Denver, it's likely to be an old-school Super
Bowl, a game where guys don't just reach for the stars, they make
the defenders see them.

   LOS ANGELES _ After the NFC and AFC championships, oddsmakers
examined the Super Bowl teams through the eyes of the betting
public and saw the following: a defending champion, and a
historical failure; a team of familiar stars, and a team led by a
less-famous running back; a team that dominated its
conference-title game, and a team that was the underdog in its
conference-title game and won it by a mere field goal.
</P>
<P>
   That describes last year, when the oddsmakers hung up a point
spread favoring the Green Bay Packers by nearly two touchdowns,
only to see the Denver Broncos and Terrell Davis win the Super Bowl
to vindicate those of us who judged them the Packers' equals.
</P>
<P>
   That also describes this year, when the Broncos are 7{-point
favorites over the Atlanta Falcons and Jamal Anderson, even though
any analysis of who beat whom and by how much suggests today's game
can go either way.
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't ``How can the Falcons win the Super Bowl?''
It's ``Why shouldn't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Since Nov. 16, 1997, Atlanta has a 21-3 record in regular-season
and playoff games. That's not just better than Denver (23-5),
that's best in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's 11-game winning streak includes five victories over
playoff-caliber teams. In the same stretch, Denver is 9-2 and faced
just three playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   In games against the teams' common opponents this season,
Atlanta was 4-1 and scored 47 points more than it gave up. Denver
was 3-2 and plus-37.
</P>
<P>
   None of which means the point spread is wrong. It's right for
the bookmakers, whose aim is to pull in equal wagering on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   That's what point spreads are designed to do _ reflect the
general public's opinion of a game. They are not an objective
appraisal of the difference between the teams. The upshot in the
Super Bowl, because it attracts more uneducated money than any
other sports event, is that the spread sometimes has little
relation to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a lot of bettors dismissed the Broncos' chances
because of the franchise's 0-4 record in Super Bowls, the Packers'
3-0 mark and the AFC's 13-Super Bowl losing streak, factors that
had little to do with the strengths of the 1997-98 Broncos and
Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a regular-season game, (even) if it was being played
in Green Bay, the spread probably would be lower,'' an oddsmaker
for Michael ``Roxy'' Roxborough's Las Vegas Sports Consultants
admitted before that Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The line settled at 11{ and underdog Denver won 31-24 in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't this year be more of the same, with Atlanta in the
role of the winning underdog in Miami?
</P>
<P>
   _Because Denver has the league's second-best offense (measured
by points scored)? No. The Minnesota Vikings had the league's
!ital!best!off! offense and the Falcons beat them to get to the
Super Bowl. Against the league's top eight scoring teams, the
Falcons are 3-2, both losses occurring on the road, one against the
New York Jets in a game quarterback Chris Chandler missed with an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   _Because Denver has the league's eighth-best defense (measured
by points given up)? No. The Miami Dolphins had the league's
!ital!best!off! defense and the Falcons scored 38 points on them in
a late-season victory. Against the league's top eight defensive
teams, the Falcons are 3-1, and again the loss was in the Jets game
that Chandler missed.
</P>
<P>
   _Because Denver has a combination of good offense and defense?
No. So did Minnesota. Other than the Broncos, Vikings and Jets, the
best-balanced team is the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   _Because the Falcons aren't used to playing on grass fields like
Pro Player Stadium's? No. It's true they haven't played on grass
since they faced the playoff-bound New England Patriots in Foxboro
on Nov. 8. But that game produced a 41-10 victory for the Falcons
and the most resounding defeat at home for a playoff team since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   _Because the upstart Falcons, 3-13 just two seasons ago, might
not handle the Super Bowl pressure as well as the more seasoned
Broncos? OK, that might be true. On the other hand, ``big game''
pressure didn't kill the Falcons in Minnesota. And who's the
pressure really on, considering it's the Broncos who are expected
to win?
</P>
<P>
   John Elway and the Broncos will be deserving champions if they
win. But the Falcons _ who are 15-1 with Chandler in the game this
season _ are the way to bet.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a repeat of '98, all right. Just not the kind the
Broncos would like. &QL;

MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR WILL BE MANEUVERED INTO FINAL ORBIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A series of white-knuckle maneuvers over the
next few days will determine the fate of the Mars Global Surveyor
spacecraft, which has spent a year and a half slowly, gradually
spiraling closer to Mars. If all goes well, the craft will finally
be able _ exactly a year behind schedule _ to begin a two-year
program of mapping the red planet with unprecedented detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be going through some of the most critical events of the
mission,'' said Michael Malin, head of the mission's imaging team
and designer of its high-resolution camera, which will be able to
make out desk-sized objects on the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvers to adjust the craft's orbit around Mars involve
``high risk activity,'' Malin said, comparable to what Mars
Observer was doing just before it was lost. In 1991, Mission
controllers lost contact with the $1.5 billion Mars Observer just
as it arrived at Mars and was supposed to fire its main engine to
propel it into orbit around the planet; it has not been heard from
since.
</P>
<P>
   If controllers lose radio contact with the Mars Global Surveyor
spacecraft during this critical period, the craft would crash into
the planet's surface within two days, dragged from orbit by
friction from the thin atmosphere of Mars. But if the maneuvers go
as planned, the craft will end the week close to its final orbit
high above the atmosphere, where it should remain safe and stable
for the two years it will take to complete its work.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in the most critical of the five planned
maneuvers, Global Surveyor is supposed to fire its main engine for
the first time in four months and lift its orbit out of the
atmosphere and into a near-circle instead of the long ellipse,
dipping in and out of the air, that it has been following since it
arrived at Mars in September 1997. The new orbit will keep it a
constant distance from the planet so it can map its entire surface
in a consistent way.
</P>
<P>
   If that engine burn works the way it's supposed to, ``then we'll
celebrate,'' said Joe Beerer, the spacecraft's operations manager.
``That's when we start to breathe easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time coming, Beerer said in an interview last
week at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, where the mission was designed and is
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Global Surveyor was supposed to have completed its innovative
aerobraking in March 1998, using the drag of the planet's
atmosphere to slow the craft and bring it into its intended orbit
without having to use heavy rocket fuel to do it. But that process
was hampered by a solar panel that was damaged shortly after
launch.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, it turns out, was cracked when it sprang open in
orbit after having been sent aloft tightly folded. A device that
was supposed to slow the spring-loaded opening failed, and the jolt
cracked part of the panel, which is working now, but has needed
extra care.
</P>
<P>
   That won't matter anymore if the craft reaches its intended
nearly circular orbit this week, which will keep it above the
atmosphere where the solar panel should be safe. But the engineers
worry that they could encounter a similar problem when they release
a spring-loaded antenna soon after the craft reaches its final
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be on the safe side, the craft is expected to complete
three weeks of mapping of the surface of Mars before the antenna is
released. In the meantime, the data will be sent back using a much
lower-speed link through another antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is in full swing, Mars Global Surveyor's views of the
surface should begin to answer some important questions about that
planet, whose surface area equals that of the Earth's dry land. For
one thing, it should provide some long-awaited information for the
planners of the Mars Polar Lander, which was launched Jan. 4 and is
due to land on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   That craft is not equipped with airbags to cushion its landing,
as the 1997 Mars Pathfinder was. It will instead control its
descent with rocket motors, like the Apollo lunar landers and the
Viking landers on Mars in 1976. But this means the final landing
site, close to the planet's southern polar ice cap, must be chosen
with great care so that the craft will end up safe and level on the
surface. Mission planners are eager to get their hands on the
Global Surveyor pictures and topographic maps as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Global Surveyor has already provided some tantalizing previews
of the kind of detailed pictures of Mars that it will routinely
send back once it reaches its precise final orbit in early March.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Malin said, its pictures have already provided the
first evidence that Mars, now drier than any earthly desert, once
had water over a sustained period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Some planetary scientists have argued that features on Mars that
have been interpreted as signs of an early history of abundant
water, with rivers, lakes, and maybe even oceans, are nothing more
than remnants of brief, sudden floods. But Malin said a Global
Surveyor image showing a narrow channel in the floor of a wide
canyon, much like the Colorado river's channel inside the Grand
Canyon, is a clear sign of sustained flow over a long period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   It shows ``a continuous flow of water rather than a catastrophic
flood,'' Malin said. Still, he said, there is no visible evidence
that it ever rained on Mars. No tiny branches of the tributaries in
terrestrial rivers can now be seen on Mars. Maybe such features
will be seen in the new images, he said, or perhaps they have been
buried under millions of years' accumulation of dust.
</P>
<P>
   In another surprise, Global Surveyor pictures show layers of
land that appear to have built up over time in distinct stair-step
fashion through some kind of long-term climate cycle, perhaps
something like Earth's ice ages.

LESSON LEARNED: GO WITH BRONCOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I blew the call last year. Like referee Phil
Luckett, I had a 50-50 chance of getting it right and I just plain
flubbed it.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Green Bay to beat Denver in Super Bowl XXXII and a
couple of you with memories longer than Jason Elam's field-goal
range haven't let me forget it.
</P>
<P>
   No Siree Bob . . . or is it John? David? Mark? I'm not quite
sure since you keep forgetting to include your names when you leave
those very pointed messages on my voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be willing to bet that the bookmakers in Vegas who installed
the Packers as 11{-point favorites last year didn't receive a voice
mail with time left on the Qualcomm Stadium clock from a smug
stranger telling them Denver's win was proof of why they should be
on the chorus line, not setting the line.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say I learned my lesson. Never pick against a team
with John Elway, Terrell Davis and Bill Romanowski on it and a
pills-and-potions producing company called Experimental and Applied
Sciences behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine, Crockett and McCaffrey rock!
</P>
<P>
   No way do I want to be like Broncos defensive end Neil Smith and
have people calling for me to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, an 11-year veteran, will rise above the commonality of
his surname today against the Falcons at Miami's Pro Player
Stadium. He has predicted as much, though his words didn't command
anywhere near the attention that Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan's
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play well for our team,'' Smith said, ``but I also
need to play well to prove again that I can play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler is in for a long
day. Count on Smith and Romanowski to remind everybody why
Chandler, before he was being hailed as the best quarterback in
today's matchup, was nicknamed ``Crys-tal Chandelier.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg best not misplace his helmet a la Thurman Thomas.
It wouldn't surprise me if the 45-year-old DeBerg, who was
supplanted as the Broncos' starter in Elway's first NFL game, winds
up a footnote in Elway's final one.
</P>
<P>
   That would be almost as apropos as the decisive score coming on
a pass from Elway to Ed McCaffrey, whom then-Giants coach Dan
Reeves released in July of 1994 when the wide receiver was three
games shy of qualifying for his NFL pension.
</P>
<P>
   It would be really fitting for Broncos coach Mike Shanahan to
hand Reeves, his ex-boss, his fourth Super Bowl loss as a coach. Or
are you the last one to hear how there's no love lost between the
two men?
</P>
<P>
   If Reeves were smart, he'd watch his head during pregame
warmups. Once, before an exhibition game against Oakland, Shanahan,
then an assistant coach in San Francisco, goaded 49ers quarterback
Elvis Grbac into throwing a tight spiral toward the Oakland
sideline that barely missed the noggin of another Shanahan nemesis,
Raiders owner Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Another guy who better watch his head is big-mouth Buchanan.
He's the one who boldly predicted a Falcons upset victory.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have taken to calling him ``Broadway Ray'' after
Jets quarterback Joe Namath, who delivered on his victory guarantee
in Super Bowl III, which also was played in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe they should be calling him ``Hammer Ray'' after Fred
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson was a Kansas City cornerback who spent the week
leading up to Super Bowl I bragging about how he was going to use
his ``hammer'' arm blows to nail Green Bay receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the game.
</P>
<P>
   Late in a resounding Packers victory, Williamson was knocked
unconscious and had to be carried off the field on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe Falcons defensive end Lester Archambeau, the
Broncos' stalwart offensive line has borrowed a few techniques from
ol' Freddie. Archambeau has accused Mark Schlereth and Co. of chop
blocking.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's what they were doing that day early last week at
Joe's Stone Crab restaurant, practicing their chopping technique on
the specialty of the house while ringing up a four-figure tab.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say those stone crabs made the lightest offensive
line in the NFL work harder than Archambeau, Travis Hall, Shane
Dronett and Chuck Smith will have to.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson will have to work extra hard
for his yards. The Broncos' defense against the rush has been
positively persnickety in the playoffs, holding the Dolphins and
Jets to a combined 28 yards on the ground. The Broncos' last four
opponents have run for fewer yards (98) than Anderson's
regular-season average (115.4).
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will be in deep swamp land if Anderson isn't able to
run with any more abandon than he did against the Vikings in the
NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and the Falcons might as well pack their wading boots
along with their cleats. Because every Denver player who gets into
the game will have the kind of added motivation that no amount of
zeros in a playoff bonus check can buy.
</P>
<P>
   All they'll have to do is look at No. 7, who'll today dot the
``i'' in icon, which is what he has become since leaving Granada
Hills High for Stanford and then Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This is likely Elway's last game and there isn't a Bronco worth
saluting who wants to be responsible for the quarterback's Hall of
Fame career ending on a downer.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that when he's in the huddle and Elway says ``This is
you, Terrell,'' all he can think is ``Don't let that man down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why I say Davis dashes for more than 100 yards, his
backup Vaughn Hebron becomes the fourth player in Super Bowl
history to run a kickoff back for a touchdown, fullback Howard
Griffith catches a touchdown pass, the defense contains Anderson
and Elway becomes the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl and
only the sixth to guide his team to back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be Denver over Atlanta, 27-17. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain
told Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian leaders on Saturday that they
must appear in France on Feb. 6 to negotiate effective
self-government for Serbia's battle-ravaged Kosovo province or face
NATO bombing and other military action to force them to negotiate
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia promised
him a speedy response to the demands of the six-nation ``contact
group'' on the Balkans. As usual, Milosevic did not appear in
public, speaking instead to his domestic and foreign audiences
through news media and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbian audience, the official Yugoslav news agency,
Tanyug, quoted him as reiterating to Cook that Kosovo's problems
should be solved in Serbia _ rather than at a conference abroad.
Meanwhile, other Serbian officials in interviews Saturday expressed
a wary willingness to attend the talks in France.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Serb forces in Kosovo continued to hit the
ethnic-Albanian fighters hard, to seize as much ground as possible
before negotiations begin, Western diplomats here said, while there
was a grenade attack on a Serbian cafe in the Kosovo capital,
Pristina, and another reported attack on a Serbian couple in a
fiercely contested village.
</P>
<P>
   Cook acted on behalf of the Balkan Contact Group _ the United
States, Britain, France, Russia, Germany and Italy. He said he
emphasized to Milosevic the need to reach a settlement in February
and the unity of the international demand for Kosovo's
self-government in the Yugoslav Federation, which is made up of the
republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Cook then flew to Skopje, Macedonia, to meet ethnic Albanian
leaders including Ibrahim Rugova, the nonviolent elected leader of
the Albanians, and Adem Demaci, who has connections to the armed
Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Cook also told them
to go to France prepared to negotiate and reach an interim
settlement that will let Kosovo run its own affairs, but not give
it independence, with Kosovo's future status to be determined after
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Cook told reporters afterward that Rugova was willing to attend
the talks, but that Demaci would reply in a few days, Agence
France-Presse reported from Skopje. ``I insisted that we would
expect that to be a positive reply,'' Cook was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials close to Milosevic said he was likely to send
a delegation to the talks. He would not go there himself, but
instead probably send Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, a
Milosevic loyalist, whom Cook also met Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is said by these officials to resent the pressure of
the West to sacrifice Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo, which was
the heart of the Serbs' medieval empire and is the cradle of
Serbian nationalism, and to fear that he could be arrested on a
secret indictment for war-crimes charges if he leaves Belgrade now.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is widely considered the main architect of the Bosnian
Serbs' aggression during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, but Western
leaders have never given any public indication he could or would be
called to account for alleged war crimes there by facing the United
Nations' tribunal for war crimes in The Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian officials, insisting on anonymity, said that
Milosevic was likely to concede only when pressed very strongly by
NATO and its bomb threats, so he can explain his concessions to his
people without paying a significant political price.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The same officials noted that Kosovo is a political and
financial drain for Belgrade, and if NATO is willing to take
responsibility for restraining the rebels and keeping Kosovo from
independence for three years, Milosevic may see that as an
advantage. This would be especially true if he can also win a
lifting of harsh international economic sanctions against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, state television in Belgrade showed Milosevic
telling the visiting Russian Communist Party leader Gennadi
Zyuganov that Yugoslavia ``advocates a peaceful solution to the
problems in Kosovo through direct political dialogue with
representatives of national communities in Kosovo and state
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, in an interview Saturday,
said ``there is no reason for us to say `no' now.'' He noted,
though, that the federal government and Milosevic had not yet made
a decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic, a recent addition to the Milosevic government who
describes himself as a nationalist democrat, said that
international law, which recognizes Serbian sovereignty over
Kosovo, ``must be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he favored a negotiated solution, but with these
preconditions: that there be ``no independent Kosovo, no `greater
Albania,' and no equal status for Kosovo as a third republic within
Yugoslavia _ that is a secret name for an independent Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also important, Draskovic insisted, to guarantee equal
rights to all citizens of Kosovo, including the minority Serbs, who
make up only about 10 percent of the 2 million but currently run
all its affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There should also be no independent state institutions set up by
the ethnic Albanians, Draskovic said. That means, he said, no
separate Albanian police force, for instance, but only a state
police force that could contain a large majority of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But the ethnic Albanian leaders all seek independence, and the
Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for it. The Albanians are
finding it hard _ even under strong Western pressure _ to unite
under one negotiating position and one delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians insist that Belgrade respect a cease-fire and draw
its troops and special police forces down to levels agreed on last
October. That is also a demand of the Contact Group. But the
Albanians find it much harder to renounce, as the Contact Group
insists, their goal of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Pleurat Sejdiu, a rebel spokesman based in London, reacted
cautiously to the Group's demands, saying: ``We are not rejecting
the Contact Group statement. We just can't say anything positive
about it. This is not the time to talk. The fighting has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, another 24 Albanians, three of whom were dressed in KLA
uniform, were killed by the Serb police. International monitors
said a number of them appeared to have been shot in the head at
close range. The monitors' leader, U.S. diplomat William Walker,
said in an interview Saturday that an investigation into the deaths
was in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday night, six Serbs were badly wounded when a grenade
exploded outside a Pristina cafe owned by Serbs. In Pristina, the
Serb Media Center on Saturday said a Serb civilian was killed and
his wife seriously wounded when assailants threw a grenade into
their bedroom. The attack occurred in the contested northwestern
Kosovo village of Rakos.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the 30-page Contact Group proposal offered the
population of Kosovo, which is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
self-government, stability, democracy and control of their own
police force and legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Belgrade it offers an opportunity to get themselves out a
conflict that they cannot win,'' he said. ``It is in the interest
of both sides that they accept this offer and that within the very
tight timetable we have set they get down to reaching an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were backed Friday night by the United Nations
Security Council, where the Russians also went along, and NATO
countries were meeting Saturday in Brussels to authorize
Secretary-General Javier Solana to launch air strikes if the
parties _ especially Milosevic, Western officials make clear _ do
not comply or negotiate in good faith.

NBA QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA was in jeopardy a month ago, still may be a month from
now, and smells reasonably ripe for some serious questioning today.
</P>
<P>
   So we have decided to double the jeopardy. We also hope to
double the fun, while wondering if this game will be resurrected to
the level of fan-tastic. You should begin seeking questions,
because we think we have the answers:
</P>
<P>
   1. Answer: Suspect rebounding. Question: Why won't the Knicks
win the championship? And by suspect, we weren't referring to
Latrell Sprewell, who's a pretty mediocre rebounder - as a guard.
But Jeff Van Gundy has installed the squeezer at small forward, a
bold move when we point out that power forward Charles Oakley now
is unleashing his dirty tricks to further the cause of the Toronto
Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   How about playing Sprewell at off-guard? No, that's where Allen
Houston lives. Well, why is not having Oakley such a problem? Easy.
Marcus Camby, a twig, and Larry Johnson, a towering 6-foot-5
veteran with a questionable back, are the candidates at power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   2. Answer: Yes. Question: Will the Lakers be able to defeat Utah
in a playoff series? The reason could be Derek Harper, their
oldcomer at backup point guard. Even though Harper has been in the
league long enough to remember when Don Nelson was considered a
genius, he is willing and able to guard another playmaking
antiquity, John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm still in the league because of defense and my desire to win
a championship,` Harper said. `All I'm missing is a ring. That's my
purpose.`
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' committee approach to power forward should be enough
when factored with the expected maturity of Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie
Jones and Kobe `Jumpingbean'' Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   3. Answer: Not without a trade. Question: Will Dennis Rodman
pick up his sixth championship ring, giving him one more than he
has hanging from his nostrils and ears? The unemployed Worm's
current free-agent option is taking the $1 million exception from
Orlando, where he would re-enlist with old Pistons den leader Chuck
Daly.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck is a bit short on good players. With Rodman at power
forward, the Magic could attempt moving Horace Grant and his
massive contract in exchange for help elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   4. Answer: Because they almost won it last season. Question: Why
will the Pacers win the Eastern Conference championship?
</P>
<P>
   5. Answer: `Just Chew It.` Question: What will Nike us as its
marketing slogan for a new shoe with a high-pressure air sole
designed for phat players who practiced the pick 'n' sweet roll
during the lockout?
</P>
<P>
   6. Answer: Anything else. Question: What will casual fans watch
when NBA games are telecast without Michael Jordan in the starring
role?
</P>
<P>
   subhead UCLA update
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, in part, to expanded rosters, three Bruins selected in
the second round of the 1998 draft figure to still be on NBA
rosters next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani McCoy, selected by Seattle with the 33rd pick, could earn
a musical chair along the Sonics' bench row. But wayward 6-10 high
school hotshot Rashard Lewis (No. 32) and 7-0 first-round choice
Vladimir Stepania (No. 14) could make McCoy's Seattle adventure a
brief one. Add to the frontcourt logjam another ex-Bruin, Don
MacLean, who's a probable keeper because of his shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Bailey, the 45th pick by Phoenix, provides an aptitude for
defense and enough athletic intrigue for the Suns to temporarily
overlook his sporadic jumper.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Henderson, taken at 56 by Vancouver, has battled back from
an injury sustained during a tour of the CBA. But Henderson happens
to play the same position (small forward) as the Grizzlies' budding
superstar, Shareef Abdur-Rahim. A week or two at the Shawn Kemp
Buffet could make J.R. a power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O'Bannon reportedly cleared waivers and was re-signed
for a second season with the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead More cash for Nash
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Nash signed a six-year extension with Dallas last
week, the total haul was reported to be $18. Sounds like a bargain
for the point guard Nelson pried away from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it wasn't exactly a bargain because - according to agent
Bill Duffy - the number was off. How off?
</P>
<P>
   `Off by about 50 percent,` said Duffy, who listed the actual
retail cost of locking up Nash at $33 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   subhead Shot clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Percy Miller, known in hip-hop circles as rap superstar `Master
P,` has taken his CBA scoring average of 1.9 points-per-game to the
Charlotte Hornets' camp. It has been reported that Miller was a
scholarship player at the University of Houston until a knee injury
prevented him from making Cougar fans forget about Clyde Drexler.
According to Bob Bass, the Hornets' vice president of basketball
ops, `He's not a totally unskilled player.'' Good thing Bass isn't
his agent. ... Former Long Beach State ace James Cotton has started
his second season by scoring points with new Seattle coach Paul
Westphal... Second-year Utah point guard Jacque Vaughn says he
developed his open-court ballhandling skills by dribbling around
his mother's flower pots stationed at strategic points on the
driveway. ... Rookie guard Felipe Lopez, coverboy for `Sports
Illustrated` before he even played a game at St. John's, has been
impressive in the Vancouver camp. ... The Sixers look scary with
young talents Allen Iverson, Tim Thomas and rookie Larry Hughes,
but also provide flashback shudders with Benoit Benjamin and Stacey
King on their training camp roster. .. A knee injury to New Jersey
guard Kerry Kittles should mean big minutes for former Cleveland
High and Long Beach State star Lucious Harris.

CHALK THIS ONE UP: FALCONS WILL WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Here in South Florida, the just-off-the-airplane
tourists are strongly advised not to drive the streets in an
automobile with a ``Rent Me'' bumper sticker. In these parts, the
translation apparently reads ``Mug Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Also high on the list of local don't's would be the ``Viva
Fidel'' window decal. And while in Miami traffic, never cut off a
suspected Colombian drug lord, unless, of course, you paid extra at
Hertz for a bullet-proof Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   But on a personal note, I ain't scared of greater Miami ...
well, except for the waiting-list line at Joe's Stone Crab, or
trying to beat the chalk at Gulfstream Park. That's real fear.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, my only other concern after a week in Miami actually
amounts to nothing more than a nagging worry over a football
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   I keep thinking Atlanta wins today's Super Bowl XXXIII. Been
thinking that way for two weeks. Can't talk myself out of it. Don't
want to talk myself out of it. I feel strongly about it.
</P>
<P>
   As you will read this morning, Mr. LeBreton totally disagrees,
him being a strong backer of the Backstabbing Brothers, Elway and
Shanahan. Sure, they knifed Dan Reeves a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Gil takes Denver anyway. As you know, Denver is a rather
solid favorite, so consider this the easy way out for LeBreton, who
also bets nothing but the chalk at Gulfstream. Where's the thrill
in that, Gil? Loosen up. Live a little. Go to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, picking Atlanta to win this Super Bowl goes against all
end-of-January football logic.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs don't often win these games, which, of course, has nothing
to do with mutts, although point-spread underdogs usually end up as
Super Bowl Alpo. In 32 previous encounters, the favorite has won
24, more often than not in a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Shockingly enough, I have sound football reasons for liking the
Falcons today ... OK, sound might be stretching it. But here's what
I've got:
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining game breaks out today, and a good time will be
had by all observers, TV and live audience. Points will be scored
on a consistent basis. But once the Falcons have won _ make it
30-24 _ the reason will be defense.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, all-world running back for Denver and best
overall player in the NFL, fits into that category of ``you can't
stop him, you can only hope to contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have an obscure front four on defense, but this
Chuck Smith-Shane Dronett-Travis Hall-Lester Archambeau quartet
climbed into the spotlight two weeks ago in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with linebackers Jessie Tuggle and Cornelius Bennett,
they trashed a good Vikings running game. No, Robert Smith is not
Terrell Davis. But Minnesota's offensive line was much more highly
regarded than Denver's.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to drag a safety into run-stoppage due to the high-octane
Minnesota receivers, the Falcons went straight seven against the
run, and prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Give Davis his 100 yards rushing today. But if that's all the
Atlanta defense allows, give or take 10 yards, then the Falcons
spring the upset. Davis has to have a very large game because these
days he carries John Elway and the Denver offense.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what was seen in Minnesota, the theory from here is the
Falcons can put the ``contain'' on Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's one other thing that swings me over to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Spunk.
</P>
<P>
   It was a team repeatedly programmed for an el foldo throughout
the Minnesota game. The expected blowout win for the Vikings
appeared to be happening in the first half when offensive turnovers
and offensive ineptness hit the Falcons. But they hung in, got the
break on a fumble just before halftime, scored off it, and stayed
upright.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth quarter, the game again appeared to be over,
several times. Like the Vikings up by 10 and Atlanta going nowhere.
Like the Vikings up by seven and needing a gimme field goal to cap
the win. But the Falcons had the right combination of spunk and
luck (on Gary Anderson's missed field-goal attempt) to eventually
pull off the shocking upset in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate spunk. Or, for that matter, Chris Chandler,
who for this season has been a better quarterback than Elway.
</P>
<P>
   I take my chances today with both Atlanta and a rental car on
Miami streets. If I'm wrong, mug me.
</P>

BRONCOS WILL DANCE TO VICTORY BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As I write this, from down on the street below, I can
hear the rhythms of a live band, playing a Brazilian samba.
</P>
<P>
   At a cafe two blocks further down, I can order filet of
crocodile with a robust tapa of chickpeas with sausage and ham.
</P>
<P>
   According to my Haitian cab driver last night, the problem in
Miami isn't that the area is a cultural melting pot _ on the
contrary, it's more of a simmering bouillabaisse. The lines between
the cultures are clearly drawn.
</P>
<P>
   So let's not confuse a silly dance like the Dirty Bird with a
true tango like the Denver Broncos, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons, who do the Dirty Bird, are one Chris
Chandler catastrophe from being nothing more than the funky
chickens _ without the sausage and ham. What I'm trying to say is,
just a few weeks ago John Elway and the Broncos were bulletproof
and 13-and-0.
</P>
<P>
   But some people forget. They have leaped onto the Falcons'
bandwagon. Do they think Tommy Nobis is still the middle
linebacker? Don't they realize that the Atlanta Falcons making the
Super Bowl is one of the signs of the apocalypse?
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the Broncos were being hailed as, perhaps, the
greatest NFL aggregation ever. The Cowboys' defense never did stop
them. They scored 74 points in two games on the Oakland Raiders.
They won at Kansas City, 30-7. Denver had two receivers who scored
at least 10 touchdowns and the league's best player this year,
running back Terrell Davis, reached the end zone 23 times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, thanks to one show-stealing afternoon in Minneapolis, the
Falcons have swayed a few foolish hearts _ like that of our new guy
here, Mr. Galloway's.
</P>
<P>
   My pick in Super Bowl XXXIII? Dull, granted. But dull and safe.
</P>
<P>
   In that NFC title game, Randy says he saw an underrated,
run-challenging defense that battled and eventually outplayed the
vaunted Vikings for 60 minutes-plus.
</P>
<P>
   I say the Vikings choked. It was one of the biggest choke jobs
in NFL playoff history since, well, the Broncos lost to
Jacksonville in the 1996 divisional round and the Colts lost to the
Jets in Super Bowl III. That big.
</P>
<P>
   So-called experts have suggested that the Broncos' inability to
sustain a pass rush without blitzing could be their undoing. With
time, they say, quarterback Chandler will pick apart the Denver
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Everybody blitzes. Chandler was sacked 45 times during the
regular season. The Broncos defense, as a group, had 47 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: If Chandler gets shaken up and has to leave, which
can happen, Atlanta's quarterback becomes 45-year-old Steve DeBerg.
Quit laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of our defense is to stop the run,'' Denver
cornerback Ray Crockett said. ``When you try to stop the run,
sometimes you put your secondary in some uncompromising situations.
We know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're very aggressive. In our secondary, we may give up
some plays, but we're going to come up with some big plays
ourselves. Look at the turnovers we've had in the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Dolphins and Jets to get to the Super Bowl, the
Broncos recovered five fumbles and stole four passes. Nine
turnovers to none by the opponents.
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos are in a slump, what are the Cowboys in?
</P>
<P>
   Denver manhandled Miami in its first playoff game, 38-3, making
Jimmy Johnson think he'd be better off unemployed. The Broncos
trailed New York at halftime the next week, but won, 23-10, in a
game where the icy winds made two very good teams look like less
than they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen these guys on film,'' Denver linebacker Bill
Romanowski said of the Falcons. ``We know how good they are. But we
know it's really not about them _ it's about us. It's about playing
our style of football and playing our best game on Sunday. If we do
that, we'll win the game and go back-to-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. There is another factor here as well. The Elway's
Last Game factor. If you're going to go with the Dirty Birds,
you're going to have to convince me that the football gods would
allow somebody to spoil Elway's last hurrah. I don't see it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Super Bowl, the best team almost always wins. It's dull.
It's not very thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   But it's like my guess _ Broncos 27, Falcons 21. Boring and
safe.

MOORE PROVIDES SUBTLE SPARK FOR UNDEFEATED UCONN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Guys like Quinn Buckner, Scott May and Kent Benson
have been waiting for Connecticut to fall off the edge it has been
living on. Say this about the Huskies _ they've got a strong grip.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Connecticut overcame a 12-point deficit in the final
17 minutes to defeat No. 9 St. John's, 78-74, in a scintillating
Big East Conference game yesterday at Madison Square Garden. The
Huskies, who trailed at halftime for the fourth consecutive game,
are 19-0 and the nation's only unbeaten Division I team.
</P>
<P>
   That won't sit well with Hoosiers like Buckner, May and Benson,
key players on the last team to run the table. Indiana was 32-0 in
1976. Now, the pressure is too great, the sport too balanced, for a
team to be perfect from November to March. UNLV couldn't do it,
Duke couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut is undefeated _ for now _ and a serious national
championship contender because of players like Ricky Moore. The
Huskies' lone senior, Moore exerted a subtle, beyond-the-box score
influence on victory No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   His team trailing by eight in the second half, Moore was the
only defender on a 3-on-1 Red Storm fast break. He stole the ball,
sprinted back the other way, was fouled and made both free throws.
Four-point swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' junior forward Richard Hamilton (22 points) said in a
serious tone, ``was a huge play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later Moore broke St. John's press and bounce-passed
to junior center Jake Voskuhl. His slam gave the Huskies the lead
for good, 67-65 with 4:41 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a player play as hard all the time as Ricky
Moore,'' said Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, whose team plays No.
17 Syracuse tomorrow and is at No. 3 Stanford on Saturday. ``This
is the happiest I've ever seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   He could be a sad or angry former point guard, a bad influence
on a young team. The point guard job became Khalid El-Amin's last
season. Moore is ``the other guard'' and is asked to play defense
first, everything else second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at who he gets matched up with,'' Voskuhl said. ``He
shuts down the other team's best guys. He should be Big East
defensive player of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's defensive assignment was Bootsy Thornton, who had 40
against Duke and 61 in his past two games. Thornton finished with
15.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game fit for a facility that bills itself as ``the
world's most famous arena.'' The Garden was rocking, two-thirds Red
Storm, one-third Huskies. Connecticut blitzed to a 16-3 lead; St.
John's stormed the offensive boards to go up, 43-38, at halftime.
Then the lead reached 12 and the Huskies said, ``Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't won, we wouldn't have lost,'' Calhoun said in his
best Casey Stengel. ``We would have been beaten. That's what we
strive for. Make the other team beat you. St. John's has some
tremendous warriors. They're as good as anybody we'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's five losses have been to Stanford, Purdue, Miami
(Fla.), Duke and Connecticut by a total of 16 points. And the Red
Storm will get better when their best post player, Tyrone Grant,
returns from his broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, we didn't deliver the knockout punch,'' said St. John's
coach Mike Jarvis, whose team is 17-5. ``But our day is coming.
Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's is a team with marvelous talent that plays zealously,
but has yet to learn how to win. What the Red Storm needs is a
player like Ricky Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 12 and I wanted to win bad,'' Moore said. ``If we
go out and don't quit, we've got the talent and experience to win.
We showed a lot of heart today. Again.''

AFTER YEARS OF REJECTION, CHANDLER FINDS A HOME IN ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It would be easy for Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler
to use his Super Bowl platform and yell out a hearty, ``Ha, I told
you so'' to the teams that gave up on him.
</P>
<P>
   First, he would probably run out of breath, as the list is
numerous _ namely the Colts, the Buccaneers, the Cardinals, the
Rams and the Oilers. None of the teams viewed Chandler as a
franchise quarterback that could take them to pro football's
greatest stage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chandler, 33, the former castoff who is now a Pro Bowl
quarterback and who will lead the Atlanta Falcons into today's
Super Bowl XXXIII matchup with the Denver Broncos at Pro Player
Stadium, chooses to savor the moment rather than search for
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here is satisfaction for sure,'' Chandler said. ``But I
don't feel I'm getting back at anybody. The teams that gave up on
me, I think it's proven they made a mistake. But I try not to look
in the past. I think the best way to deal with it is forget about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's satisfaction, the way my career has gone to be in a
situation like this, to be with a good team and to be in the Super
Bowl. But, sure, sometimes I think about, wow, it's been a real
strange trip for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What a trip it has been.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's 11-year career includes the dubious distinction of
having started for more teams (six) than any NFL quarterback since
the 1970 merger. The five teams before the Falcons all discarded
him for someone else, someone they thought had more potential.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted by the Colts in 1988 and earned all-rookie
honors. The next year he was injured, and the Colts drafted Jeff
George in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win nine games my rookie year with the Colts and almost go
to the playoffs,'' Chandler said. ``I think I'm going to be in Indy
forever. But I hurt my knee the next year and they totally give up
on me. I was on the golf course when I found out about them
drafting George.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay traded for him, but made him the backup to Vinny
Testaverde for a year and half. The Cardinals were next. There he
met quarterbacks coach Jerry Rhome, whom Chandler credits with
teaching him how to play quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   However, what looked to be a breakthrough _ considering that
Chandler passed for a then-career high 2,832 yards and 15
touchdowns in 1992 _ was only a mirage. The Cardinals signed Steve
Beuerlein in the off-season and made him their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a move by them to point the finger at me for the team
not winning games,'' Chandler said. ``We were in a lot of games and
lost a lot of close games. I thought we had a pretty good year,
considering the team we had. When they brought in Steve, it was a
big disappointment, then a year later I was going somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on to the Rams, until the Rams decided Chris Miller was
their man. The Oilers followed, but he was only a stop-gap move in
the grooming process for Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, the ninth of 10 children growing up in Everett, Wash.,
knows the meaning of waiting your turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team basically does kind of give up on you and decides
that maybe another direction would be better, it's disappointing,''
Chandler said. ``It's hard when you keep going through those
things. It's nice to finally be in a situation where I don't have
to worry about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler found a home and a coach he could trust when Dan Reeves
joined the Falcons in 1997 and acquired him from the Oilers for two
low-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been with a few football teams, questions come to
your mind like `Can I do it?' '' Reeves said. ``We knew he was a
capable quarterback. His toughness has been tested. But he was a
good quarterback when he came here and he's as accurate as any
quarterback I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   After fighting through injuries last season, Chandler rewarded
Reeves' faith with a Pro Bowl season in 1998. He passed for 3,154
yards and 25 touchdowns and was the league's fourth-ranked passer
with a quarterback rating of 106.1. No one was better in the fourth
quarter, when Chandler fashioned a league-best quarterback rating
of 121.8.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who was given a four-year, $25 million contract
extension, said the key for him is finally finding an organization
that believes in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a chance to be a leader of the team,'' Chandler
said. ``When you have belief from the head coach, the front office,
the players and the whole organization it makes your job easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Chandler is considered by many experts as the key to
the Falcons' reversal from a 3-13 squad in 1996 to a Super Bowl
team two years later. The Falcons are 22-4 when he has started at
quarterback the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good quarterback and we believe in him,'' Falcons
receiver Terance Mathis said. ``Chris Chandler being here is
probably the driving force for us being in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy nobody wanted.

DEBERG THROWS HIMSELF BACK INTO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The envelope showed up empty, which is what most people
thought of Steve DeBerg's idea of making a comeback. Maybe that is
what made this most odd thing possible.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a guy who was named the NFL's Comeback Player of the
Year nine years ago had the kind of idea guys too often have when
they hit their mid 40s. DeBerg decided he wanted to go back to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   With his future cloudy, his past fading, and his present on
hold, the former quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, Denver
Broncos, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Kansas City Chiefs, and Miami
Dolphins wanted to be a kid again before it was too late. His
friends thought he'd gone middle-age crazy, but not because he
bought a sports car or took up disco dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual middle-age ventures into temporary
insanity, DeBerg decided he'd play professional football _ five
years after he'd retired from the game and a year after he stopped
coaching with the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg did not come to this decision lightly. He tested himself
first. He went back to the wars, back under center _ although a bit
more gingerly than before. What he did was join a coed flag
football league in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   After success at that level, why not the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried like hell not to let people know who I was,'' said
DeBerg, who is now 45. ``Playing with girls really made me work on
my touch. That's really where this all started. I was throwing well
enough to realize I still had some skills.''
</P>
<P>
   After a divorce and a drunk-driving arrest refocused his life,
DeBerg was trying to decide whether he truly wanted to continue
making the kind of sacrifices NFL assistant coaches make,
sacrifices he tried for two seasons under Dan Reeves with the
Giants and hated.
</P>
<P>
   The long days and longer nights, the endless hours watching film
in stuffy rooms, the absence of free time even to exercise
convinced him this might not be the way he wanted to spend the rest
of his professional life. But now that he was alone, DeBerg was
looking for something, and football had always been the answer. So
why not one more time?
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was just trying to get back into shape,'' he said.
``I was a long way away from the game last year. I had seen what a
tremendous personal sacrifice it took to be an NFL coach, so I was
trying to figure out a way to stay in professional football without
those 16-hour days. What I came up with was as a backup
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what I did was throw footballs into nets to get back
in shape, and eventually, I got the idea I might possibly get
invited to a training camp this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   To facilitate that, DeBerg sent out letters to most NFL teams.
One landed on Reeves's desk in Atlanta last June. But when he
opened it to see what his former quarterback and assistant was up
to, the Falcons coach found nothing inside, so he picked up the
phone, and a resurrection had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan called and said, `Steve, what is this empty envelope?' ''
DeBerg recalled. ``I told him it was supposed to be a letter that I
was interested in restarting my career. I had no idea Dan was in a
predicament with his quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Serendipity? Perfect timing? Call it what you will, but DeBerg's
envelope arrived just as Reeves was learning that his newly signed
backup quarterback, Mark Rypien, was considering retirement because
his young son was seriously ill with a disease that proved fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing he needed someone and being familiar with DeBerg both
from when he coached him in Denver (1981-83) and had him on his
staff with the Giants (1995-96), Reeves decided to take a look at a
man who apparently wanted to become the George Foreman of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, he didn't expect much. But seeing would be believing,
and Reeves saw more than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer we got to training camp, with what we had and what
we were willing to spend _ which was nothing _ there were very few
people that had experience with our offense, so we gave him one of
the longest workouts ever,'' Reeves recalled. ``He just threw the
ball great. If a guy can do it, I don't care if he's 25 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, because when Reeves's Falcons challenge the
defending champion Broncos at Pro Player Stadium Sunday in the
Super Bowl, Steve DeBerg will be one hard hit away from replacing
starter Chris Chandler and carrying the hopes of a team and a city
on his 45-year-old shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   To say this is remarkable is an understatement. To say it is
absurd is not far from the truth, either. To say it is fun for the
oldest quarterback in the NFL is as precise as any pass DeBerg has
ever thrown, because few people get a chance like this, and no one
understands that better than the man who has been given it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity of a lifetime to even be invited to a
training camp,'' DeBerg said. ``To earn a backup position and be as
involved as I've been, I feel like the luckiest person in the
world. Really. There's a great sense of personal achievement making
an NFL team this year. That was a Super Bowl for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of letters and calls from people my age who are
really excited about what I'm doing. I'm satisfied to just help the
team from the sidelines, but I know I'm one hit away from
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   To find himself in this position is doubly odd because 16 years
ago, DeBerg was starting ahead of the now-aging quarterback of the
Broncos, John Elway. This week there has been much talk about
whether this game will be Elway's last even as DeBerg says he hopes
to come back next season. It's a turn of events Elway finds
remarkable, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' Elway said. ``He's got nine lives. To
play as long as he has, you have to do a great job taking care of
your body, and that's what he's done. He seemed old to me when I
first came into the league (DeBerg was 30). I thought he was
ancient. Now I feel ancient.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Steve has always had the physical and mental attributes to
do it, and I'm sure with his experience and his coaching experience
with the Giants under Dan and now coming back as a player, he's
like another coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right spot
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely how DeBerg sees his role. When he made the
decision in 1994 to retire, it was because he feared he could end
up in Miami or with the New York Jets in another role. Each was a
team DeBerg felt might need him to become a full-time starter
because Dan Marino was struggling to recover from a torn Achilles'
tendon and the Jets had no one to play the position. At 40, DeBerg
knew his body wanted no part of that, so he left the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When the decision was made to reverse that decision last summer,
DeBerg did not kid himself. He understood that starting in a coed
flag league in Tampa is not quite the same as starting even one
Sunday in the NFL. The latter he knew he could handle, just as he
believes he could handle replacing Chandler Sunday in the biggest
game of his career, if necessary. But he also understood the limits
of being a coach on the field, so he decided to try a comeback that
wouldn't exceed his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there would have been a team that presented an opportunity
to do what I did with the Falcons this year in 1994, I probably
wouldn't have retired,'' DeBerg said. ``It was the physical part of
starting 16 games that I was worried about. I figured I was pushing
the envelope there.''
</P>
<P>
   So for five years, DeBerg left the NFL until the day an empty
envelope was pushed onto Reeves's desk and a football resurrection
began. Sunday it will culminate in Super Bowl XXXIII, a game that
won't be coed and won't be touch football but will be a crowning
moment for an old guy who's still young at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next July, I plan to try to make a football team,'' DeBerg
said. ``I really think that my concept of coming into this
situation and believing that I could contribute to a football team
is valid. I'm like a quarterback tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so much more fun than coaching, I'd like to try and
do it again. Chris had a quarterback coach and a quarterback tutor
this year. It was a tremendous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed that _ for the student and for the tutor.

BRUINS REMAIN IN A FUNK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ He doesn't say much; never has. As a leader, Ray
Bourque has always preferred to let his play speak for itself, but
Saturday the Bruins captain felt that wasn't nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bourque called a rare players' meeting after the abysmal 5-2
loss to the Penguins at the Igloo. He implored his teammates to
wake up out of the funk they're in, pay attention to business, and
straighten out whatever it is that has caused the team to lose four
straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's aggravation has been growing. After the team's 4-1
loss to the Islanders in New York last Tuesday, Bourque, who
normally takes his time and is one of the last to leave the
dressing room, was among the first to exit, and his face was the
picture of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   It's even rarer to hear coach Pat Burns say he was out of things
to say, which is as startling as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates
saying he has run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' top line of Jason Allison, Dmitri Khristich, and
Sergei Samsonov continues to disappoint. The most damning statistic
with regard to the trio is that they totaled just one shot in the
first 40 minutes, despite the fact that the Bruins had four
power-play attempts. They are taking up a third of the available
ice time and doing nothing with it.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, if there was any, was the team shut down Jaromir
Jagr's line (ending Jagr's point streak at 13 games), but that
opened the floodgates for the line of Alexei Kovalev (two goals,
one assist), German Titov (one goal, two assists), and Robert Lang
(two assists).
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he is frustrated by the repeated mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old thing,'' he said. ``We played pretty well,
we had a couple of missed assignments, and we come in 2-2 after the
first, playing not bad. It's not good enough. We should've been
leading after the first. Same old thing. We keep making mistakes
that are costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Burns) keeps harping on it. He keeps telling us and there's
not much more (the coaches) can do. Guys in this room have to pay
attention a little more to what's going on out there. Until we take
care of the little details, things we go over every day, every day
. . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Burns is increasingly frustrated by the inertia that has set in
with his first line. He benched Allison, Khristich, and the left
wing du jour _ Steve Heinze _ in the third period against the
Islanders. Samsonov was reunited with his linemates Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what their problem is,'' said Burns. ``I just
talked about it in the room. Nobody's being too hard on them. I
don't think anybody should be nervous about anything. I think we
should settle down and play as a team instead of maybe playing as
individuals. I don't care, I'll play five or six of my best
forwards, the guys who want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who you are, but you're going to have some kind
of commitment in what you want to do for the team. It could be a
little bit of the sophomore part, they think, `Hey, we're great.'
You're not great, you're not great at all right now. You're not
very good right now, so you'd better have a better look at
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Being benched) is a part of hockey. I've seen the greatest
players benched before. If that's what bugs you, you'd better
change occupations.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ferraro gave Boston a 1-0 lead at 4:31 of the first, but
Kovalev pulled the Penguuins even at 7:44. Joe Thornton made it 2-1
at 11:33, but Kovalev knotted it again at 14:24.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was scoreless and the third was a nightmare
for the Bruins, as they gave up an even-strength goal to defenseman
Kevin Hatcher at 2:29, a shorthanded goal to Martin Straka at 7:26,
and a final goal to Titov at 15:14.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time since November 1997 that they've lost four
consecutive games.

FAMILY OF BLACK VICTIM SAYS THEY FORGIVE THREE WHITE MEN ACCUSED OF
KILLING HIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JAMIE STOCKWELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Nearly eight months after a black man from East Texas
was chained to the back of a truck and dragged to his death,
members of his family said they have forgiven the three white men
accused of killing him.
</P>
<P>
   The family of James Byrd Jr., whose death sparked national and
international attention, said they are past the anger and animosity
and are now looking toward the potential positive effects Byrd's
violent death will have on a torn society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I hate in return?'' asked Byrd's 17-year-old
daughter, Jamie Byrd. ``That would be what the men who killed my
dad did and I'm not like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Byrd's family is hoping for passage of a new hate
crimes bill in the Legislature that would be named the ``James Byrd
Jr. Hate Crimes Act.'' The bill, sponsored by Sen. Rodney Ellis and
Rep. Senfronia Thompson, both Houston Democrats, was the focal
point of a rally Saturday afternoon on the steps of the Capitol
where Byrd's family and a slew of legislators, lobbyists and
anti-violence organizations gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Byrd said the deep anger she felt toward the accused
killers when her father's dismembered body was found June 7 on a
back road outside Jasper has subsided. Her hope is that no one else
will ever be victimized by such a crime again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first heard about it, I was seeing all this stuff in
my head. Of course I was mad and I just thought, `Let me take them
and drag them.' That's how I was feeling, but then I was thinking
about it and I was like, `God can do anything. God will take care
of it,' '' said the Lufkin High School student.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's death, she said, has made her more aware of
people's intentions and even more cautious of who she trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not racist or anything. But now I'm more aware of
everything and I can't tell who's a Klansman,'' she said. ``When I
go to school and I see the Confederate flags on trucks I picture my
dad and when he was on the back of the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a loss of innocence, perhaps, but not a loss of hope, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't see her father's death as a ``white people issue,''
but something caused by the hatred of a particular group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a best friend who's white and I walk around with her
and people are like, `How can she do that?' and I guess they think
I'm supposed to hate but she's been my best friend for years and
this could've happened to her dad, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's rally came at the end of the first week of jury
selection in the trial of one of the men accused of capital murder
in Byrd's death. John William ``Bill'' King, 24, of Jasper, who has
served time in prison for burglary, is the first to stand trial. He
has denied killing Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   The other two defendants are King's friends, Lawrence Russell
Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs and Shawn Berry, 23, of Jasper.
Trial dates have not been set for them.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's nephew, Darrell Verrett of Houston, said the tragedy has
united the family and he urged them to push for change in a state
that has often been resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in supporting this bill is to show how we
retaliate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to clarify Texas' hate crimes law _ which
doesn't list specific groups that might be victims of a crime of
prejudice or violence _ died in the 1995 and 1997 legislative
sessions. Many legal and law enforcement officials believe that it
is difficult to enforce the current law, which was adopted in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would change the definition so that any offense
motivated by race, disability, religion, or sexual orientation
could be prosecuted as a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister, Louvon Harris of Jasper, said her brother would
be proud to know that his sacrifice contributed to such positive
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is a good thing. It's very much needed in this
state,'' Harris said. ``I think my brother would be proud to have
his name associated with something this good.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rally of Hope,'' which was organized by the Lesbian and
Gay Rights Lobby of Texas, attracted several anti-violence groups,
including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People and the American Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200 people, carrying posters bearing such phrases
as ``Who will they come for next?'' and ``Show some compassion,
George Bush,'' applauded the efforts of legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that his (Byrd) legislators let him down, I think that
his police let him down and that his neighbors, all of us let him
down and we can't let that happen again,'' said Gal Lahat of the
American Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Hardy-Garcia, the executive director for the Lesbian and
Gay Rights Lobby, said that 2,400 hate crimes were documented in
Texas between 1992 and 1997, and that the number of crimes would
increase unless the Legislature intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett, Byrd's nephew, said that his family will take turns
attending King's trial. He said ``the penalty should fit the
crime'' when asked whether he believed in the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has forgiven the ones who killed my uncle. There's no
use for us to show hatred back,'' Verrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said she wants people to remember her brother for the
kind and good man he was, not the black man whose body was found
along a road early one Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved people. He spent his life entertaining people and was
well-known in Jasper. His death is a loss to the town and he will
always be remembered for who he was and remains to be,'' she said.

UCONN KEEPS STREAK ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The question still is ``when'', not ``if'', UConn
will lose, which is what you must deal with if you are the only
unbeaten team remaining in Division 1; are a No. 1 team more than a
few people think is not as good as once-beaten and No. 2 Duke; and
are a team many people thought would lose to No. 9 St. John's
Saturday at Madison Square Garden in what was billed as the most
signficant Big East game in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. In a setting that had a tournament feel to it, with
the sellout crowd of 19,528 and a national television audience,
UConn did what it has done all season, posting a 78-74 victory that
should at end _ at least temporarily _ any question about the
Huskies' credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team,'' said coach Jim Calhoun with a mixture of pride
and awe, ``is not ready to let go of that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows St. John's, which is now 17-5 (8-2 in conference) and
getting better each game, tried to take it away. The Red Storm
tried as hard as anyone the Huskies have played in this storybook
season in which UConn's record now is 19-0, with games against No.
17 Syracuse Monday night and at No. 3 Stanford Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm surge was constant after a slow start in which
they fell behind, 16-3, in the first five minutes. By the half they
were ahead, 43-38. Three minutes into the second half they were up
12, and all the sages out there predicting a fall from the
mountaintop for the Huskies were nodding their heads, wearing their
I-told-you-so-looks.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun was so upset with what was happening that he called a
timeout. ``I very rarely take a full timeout (that early),'' said
Calhoun, who then used most of it letting his team think about
where it was _ or wasn't _ going. ``Khalid (El-Amin) said some
things. Ricky (Moore) said some things.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, as they have in their last three games, against Miami,
Seton Hall and Georgetown, when they found themselves trailing in
the second half, the Huskies found a way.
</P>
<P>
   This time help came in the form of Moore, the senior guard who
has changed roles the past two years and been shuffled behind
Richard Hamilton and El-Amin on the list of UConn's ``go-to'' guys.
</P>
<P>
   But in one five-minute stretch, Moore showed some vintage skills
on offense, defense, and in running a team. ``He simply took over
the game,'' said Calhoun, who watched Moore stop a three-on-one
fast break, block a shot, go end-to-end, get fouled, and make a
pair of free throws, and go end-to-end again, dumping off a pass to
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to speed the tempo up, get the game going the
way we wanted,'' said Moore, who only had 6 points but had six
assists and also shut down Bootsie Thornton (15 points, but only 3
in the second half when Moore was covering him).
</P>
<P>
   Moore provided the first UConn surge. From there, Hamilton (a
team-high 22 points, El-Amin (15), and Kevin Freeman (16) pushed it
to the point where the Huskies and Johnnies were matching baskets
and big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the game of basketball is about,'' said St.
John's coach Mike Jarvis, who has watched his team play its guts
out this week and still be saddled with losses to No. 1 UConn and
No. 2 Duke. ``It's about runs and who will be the last team to make
the last run.''
</P>
<P>
   That was UConn. The Huskies got a Jake Voskuhl dunk that made it
67-65 with 4:34 left and gave them their first lead in the second
half, and they went from there.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had a run left and St. John's didn't and that was
the difference in the game, the most anticipated Big East matchup
since a 1985 when the Johnnies knocked off No. 1 Georgetown, 66-65.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn is one of the most arrogant teams,'' said St. John's
forward Ron Artest, shaking his head at another disappointment (the
Johnnies have lost their five games by a total of 16 points). ``But
they always back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 19-0, and how many teams have done that in the Big
East,'' said Calhoun, knowing that the end of the streak could come
as quickly as Monday if the Huskies continue to play from behind.
``But we're not giving this one back and we're just not going to
just give teams a win.''

LOSS TO STANFORD HELPED UCLA'S GADZURIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While handing UCLA its most disappointing defeat of
the season, Stanford did the Bruins a favor they won't soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal angered Dan Gadzuric, and he's been a terror ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-10 freshman, Gadzuric cannot specify exactly what the
Cardinal did to invoke his wrath. But sometime early in the second
half, Gadzuric got mad. And when he got mad, he got aggressive. And
when he got aggressive, he became unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm establishing stronger position inside than I was earlier
in the season,'' Gadzuric said. ``During the Stanford game, it just
happened. It was a personal thing. A feeling took over me. I don't
know what it is. But I'm hanging with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronger position in the low post means Gadzuric is in better
position to receive passes from his teammates and better position
to score. He carved up the Cardinal for 15 points, his best game of
the season by far, and he has scored 47 points in his last 75
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of passive positioning, Gadzuric now overpowers
defenders for real estate in the low post and foul lane. He has a
variety of rapidly improving moves, from a soft turnaround to a
fledgling hook. Sometimes, he'll be in good enough position to
simply catch and dunk. In the last three games, he's shooting 77
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the ankle he sprained at USC has slowed Gadzuric. He
missed the Louisville game, then scored 16 points in 21 minutes
Thursday in UCLA's lethargic win at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the real pluses,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said. ``I was struggling to find any positives to put on the
chalkboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric did not practice Saturday because of soreness in his
right ankle and knees. But he's expected to play today against his
biggest challenge of the season _ Washington's 7-foot senior, Todd
MacCulloch, who averages 18.3 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The ankle) is a concern going against MacCulloch,'' Lavin
said. ``He's so big. He's a mountain. Collectively, we have to have
an awareness of where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Gadzuric's recent rise, the Huskies probably will have an
eye on him, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup shuffle? Freshmen Matt Barnes and Ray Young practiced
with the starters Saturday in place of the injured Gadzuric and
slumping forward JaRon Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin indicated he might make a change today. Rush is the weak
link on offense _ 35 percent shooting, 21 percent from 3-point
range _ but his defense and rebounding are indispensable. He leads
the Bruins in rebounding in conference play and preserved
Thursday's win with two deflections in the final 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray gives us more perimeter shooting,'' Lavin said. ``JaRon
has played well when he's come off the bench. They all have. They
know they'll still play the equivalent of a starter's minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who is 6-8, may be used to offset Washington's 6-8 power
forward, Chris Walcott.
</P>
<P>
   Point of attack: MacCulloch, Deon Luton and Donald Watts
generate most of Washington's offense, but freshman point guard
Senque Carey is quickly becoming an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   Since replacing Dan Dickau (broken foot) six games ago, Carey
has averaged 13.8 points and run the offense capably. (He had 19
points and five assists Thursday against USC.) No doubt, he's high
on UCLA's priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has given Washington a different dimension,'' Lavin said.
``They're a more difficult matchup than when Dickau was in the
game.''

<P>
   Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway is a punk and a juvenile
delinquent and you'd know it if you got your first real
professional job the year Elvis died, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Laverne &AMP; Shirley was on TV (not in reruns). Star Wars was in
the theaters (not in reruns.) Jimmy Carter was president (he
re-ran, but lost).
</P>
<P>
   And a quarterback named Steve De- &QL; 
Berg got drafted into the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg signed a contract for $18,000 that year, about four times
the deal I negotiated for myself as a newly hired reporter with the
Burlington County Herald in Mount Holly, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg passed for 33,782 yards, 13th in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before this past season, the ``retired'' quarterback
(he'd been coaching since 1993) got a tryout with the Atlanta
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him one of the longest workouts ever,'' Coach Dan
Reeves said at the time, ``And he just threw the ball great. If a
guy can do it, I don't care if he's 25 or 45.'' &QL; 
INSPIRING, THRILLING
</P>
<P>
   There's something heartening, something inspiring, something
thrilling about a guy appearing in the Super Bowl at 45. At least
there is to guys like me, who are 44.
</P>
<P>
   The year Madame Curie turned 44, she won her second Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   At 44, Puccini composed the opera Madame Butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   At 44, Orwell wrote 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, in our country, none of that sissified highbrow stuff
matters.
</P>
<P>
   However, an American male does begin to reassess his life and
his accomplishments, to sense that he's slipped into middle-age,
when there's no longer anyone older than him playing professional
football or baseball or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   For us, for now, there's DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been a great experience for me,'' he told a
reporter recently. ``Some guys were asking me the other day if we
wore face masks when I first started playing.''
</P>
<P>
   I know how this goes.
</P>
<P>
   Young journalists, curious about how it was when I started,
sometimes ask me if newspapers provided reporters with supplies
back then, or if we had to buy our own chisels and stone tablets. &QL; 
DOING IT FOR LOVE
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg doesn't dwell on the old days. He says even the money
he's earning now doesn't mean as much to him as simply being in the
game, doing what he loves to do, having an impact.
</P>
<P>
   It's all that any man asks.
</P>
<P>
   Dostoyevsky published Crime and Punishment when he was 45.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne published The Scarlet Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Tolkien published The Hobbit.
</P>
<P>
   Men like this prove beyond any doubt that a viable, hard-working
intelligent individual, no matter what his age, can become a
pompous blowhard once he loses his ability to throw the ball
downfield or scramble out of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Some fellows defy the odds and manage to set an example in
professions outside the world of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Berry recorded My Ding-a-Ling at the age of 45. Mark Twain
learned to ride a bicycle at 55. Ambrose Bierce wandered off in
Mexico, and disappeared, at 71.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's Pablo Picasso, whose common-law wife
left him after finding out that he'd been cheating on her _ at 82.
</P>
<P>
   Among quarterbacks, however, there's only DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   When Broncos superstar John Elway first came into the league 16
years ago, he replaced an ``aging'' DeBerg in the Denver backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was ancient then,'' Elway said recently of
DeBerg. ``Now, I feel ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in this country when we'd have expected
something more deferential from a 38-year-old like Elway. Something
more respectful.
</P>
<P>
   But, whatta ya gonna do?

SETON HALL IS HUMBLED BY THE ORANGEMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the opening minute of the second half
on Saturday night, Seton Hall point guard Shaheen Holloway raced up
the floor as a teammate dribbled up the middle on a fast break. As
he passed his bench, Holloway lost his footing, skidding past Coach
Tommy Amaker. When Holloway got back on his feet and hustled to the
other end, he found himself the victim of a 3-point play by his
counterpart, Syracuse's Jason Hart. Amaker mercifully pulled
Holloway out of the game. But if Holloway was enduring one of those
nights, his teammates were not faring much better against a
vengeful Syracuse squad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen led from start to finish, coasting past the
Pirates, 76-62, at the Continental Arena. While the teams had been
tied with 5-5 records in the Big East Conference entering the game,
they bore little in common on Saturday night as Syracuse (15-6,
6-5) handed Amaker his first loss to the Orangemen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holloway went head to head with Hart, the pair ranking No. 1 and
2, respectively, in the conference in assists. And Holloway clearly
got the worst of it. Actually, when Hart connected on a 3-point
field goal just 2 minutes 46 seconds into the game, he had gotten
the better of it.
</P>
<P>
   Hart finished with 24 points, matching his career high, while
Holloway (1 for 10 from the field) finished with just 3 points, his
only field goal coming on a lay-up with 1:17 remaining. He also had
six turnovers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one point in these teams' rivalry, the Orangemen defeated the
Pirates 23 times in a row, a streak that ended in 1992. Before
Saturday, Seton Hall had won eight of the last 15 games, including
victories in the last two games. When Seton Hall defeated Syracuse
earlier this season, the Pirates were in the midst of a seven-game
winning streak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they looked like a different team from the opening tip
Saturday, displaying the flaws that have contributed to losses in
their last three games. And Syracuse, which entered the game ranked
No.17 in the nation, bore little resemblance to the team that had
been embarrassed by the Pirates in the Carrier Dome on Dec. 12. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates fell behind by 12-2 in the opening minutes and never
seemed to recover. Seton Hall turned the ball over four times in
its first seven possessions, missed a layup, and had another shot
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes continued as the Pirates had three more turnovers
before the game was seven minutes old. At that point, the Pirates
started trying to beat the Orangemen with 1-on-1 moves, which did
not work, but may have seemed like a good idea since almost every
pass was either errant or deflected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the Orangemen had built a 43-31 advantage and the
only thing that kept the Pirates that close was the unlikely
offensive production by Ramon Cespedes, and Syracuse's inability to
take advantage of the mistakes, missing 12 shots from within five
feet of the basket. Cespedes, who had attempted just two 3-point
field goals this season, hit a pair from behind the arc, and added
another jumper, scoring 8 points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hart had 12 points and three steals in the half for the
Orangemen. The usual scoring threats struggled for the Pirates _
Holloway was 0 for 5 with three turnovers in the half, Rimas
Kaukenas was 1 for 5 and Duane Jordan was 2 for 6. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall's struggles have coincided with a decidedly tougher
portion of its schedule. The three losses entering this game came
on the road, at Notre Dame, at No. 1 Connecticut and at No. 23
Miami. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was ancient then,'' Elway said recently of
DeBerg. ``Now, I feel ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in this country when we'd have expected
something more deferential from a 38-year-old like Elway. Something
more respectful.

STATE GOP REJECTS PRIMARY DATE SOUGHT BY MCCAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX _ The Arizona Republican Party voted unanimously Saturday
to rec ommend leaving the state's presi dential party primary just
where it is, beating back a push to move it from mid-February to
March 14.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the 400 Republican delegates believe the proposal to
hold a later primary was floated to help presidential aspirant John
Mc Cain avoid an early showdown with Steve Forbes in McCain's own
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get jerked around for the benefit of one person,''
Arizona Republican Caucus Chairwoman Becky Fenger, who advocated
keep ing the earlier primary, told the delegates to applause.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Forbes spent $2 million in political advertising in
Arizona and walked away with Arizona's delegates to the national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote was largely sym bolic, because the final decision
will be made by the state Legisla ture, but it will be difficult
for GOP lawmakers to ignore the wishes of their own state party
members.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was opening his presi dential campaign office in New
Hampshire on Saturday and was not available for comment following
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, McCain spokes woman Nancy Ives denied that the
proposal was being pushed by McCain, saying only that the Mc Cain
forces supported the idea because ``it is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at the Civic Plaza in downtown Phoenix focused more
on national than on state issues.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with criticism from some Americans who say that Republi
cans have been too aggressive in their pursuit of Clinton and that
the GOP will suffer in 2000, speaker after speaker expressed
confidence that, in the end, Republicans would not be hurt by their
votes to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many said, they will likely benefit and be vindicated
for standing their ground in the face of poll data favoring
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz. ``But I believe in the end that if we do what's right,
we'll have nothing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The loudest ovations went to a speaker who was not even
originally on the program but who nonetheless twice brought
delegates to their feet. Former Vice President Dan Quayle dropped
in to the convention to say a few words about impeachment, Arizona
Republicans and his own presidential plans.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, a Paradise Valley resi dent, praised Republicans in Con
gress for casting their votes to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never witnessed such congressional courage as I did on
that day,'' Quayle said. ``And when you stand up for what's right,
you'll be vindicated. Maybe not in the short term, but in the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also told delegates to expect him to announce his own
presidential candidacy soon, perhaps as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In other business, Republicans also passed a resolution to
increase outreach efforts to minority voters, but only after
stripping it of most of its original language.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, proposed by Jesse Hernandez, chairman of the
Arizona Hispanic Republican Council, was attacked by some delegates
as a ``feel good'' measure that would weaken the party's base.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed only after more than half its language was
removed, including the last line: ``The Republican Party rejects
the forces of hatred and bigotry that would set us against one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez expressed disappoint ment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying: `This is our club, and we don't want anyone
else in it,' '' Hernandez said. ``Their attitude is, `We don't care
if the world is changing, we don't have to change.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In other business, delegates named Mike Minnaugh as state
Republican Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Other elected officials who ad dressed delegates included Gov.
Jane Hull and U.S. Reps. Matt Salmon, J.D. Hayworth and John
Shadegg. &QL;

RANGER VICTORY OVER RED WINGS COMES AT PRICE AS GRETZKY IS HURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A late goal by Niklas Sundstrom gave the Rangers a 3-2
victory Saturday over the Detroit Red Wings, the two-time Stanley
Cup champions, and it gave the Rangers two victories in a
three-game road trip. This, normally, would be reason for
unmitigated happiness.
</P>
<P>
   But their joy was somewhat tempered by the loss of Wayne
Gretzky, who leads the team in points with 47. Gretzky aggravated a
muscle strain in his ribs and left the game midway through the
third period. It is not known if he will miss any games. The
Rangers have a light week coming up. They play at home on Monday
night against Washington and on Thursday night against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrom poked a loose puck from close range past goalie Chris
Osgood at 15 minutes 18 seconds of the third period. Petr Nedved
got the assist after his pass bounced off a Detroit player's skate.
Also starring for the Rangers was goalie Mike Richter. The Rangers
were outshot by 40-14.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky sustained a rib injury in the previous game, on Thursday
night, a 3-2 loss in overtime in Carolina. He said he was in some
pain on Friday but practiced with the team. In Saturday's game, he
played 11:43 of the first two periods, but missed a couple of
shifts midway through the third, with Manny Malhotra taking his
place. Gretzky then left the bench and walked down the corridor for
examination. In his three seasons with the Rangers, Gretzky has not
missed a game, but has played with various illnesses and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered Saturday's game with five defeats in their
previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third of a three-game road trip, and as is often
the case when the Rangers tour, Gretzky attracted great attention.
Nobody knows if this, his 20th season, will be his last, so there
was the usual fuss about him. The angle this time was worthy. With
a total of 1,070 goals _ in the World Hockey Association and in the
National Hockey League, in both regular season and in the playoffs
_ Gretzky came into the game one goal behind Gordie Howe in the
same compilation.
</P>
<P>
   Howe was a star for the Detroit Red Wings when Gretzky grew up
in Brantford, Ontario, about a four-hour drive from here. When
Gretzky was young, Howe was Gretzky's favorite player. Howe wore
No. 9; Gretzky wears No. 99. Howe starred at the old Olympia
Stadium, and Gretzky talked about that building during a television
interview between periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of the only guys that played in that building,''
Gretzky said, referring to current players. ``It's a special place,
Detroit, to play hockey.'' Gretzky's father, Walter Gretzky, drove
in for Saturday's game, and Gretzky said: ``He has always been a
big Detroit fan and for him to come down here, he loves coming down
here. He was telling the guys today about the old Olympia.'' The
building, which was about two miles from here, has been demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky assisted on the second Ranger goal as the teams each
scored once in each of the first two periods and entered the third
in a 2-2 tie. Getting the first was Igor Larionov, the veteran Red
Wings center, who took a pass from Slava Kozlov on the power play
and beat Richter at 14:04. Nedved evened the score at 1-1 just 21
seconds later when he shot from behind the goal line and banked it
in off Osgood's skate. Brian Leetch got his first of two assists on
that play.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead at 5:30 of the second
period when he finished off a two-on-one rush by taking a pass from
Leetch and drilling it past Osgood. The play formed at the other
end when Ulf Samuelsson, the Rangers defenseman, upended Sergei
Fedorov, the Detroit center.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov helped even the score at 2-2 at 12:34 when he dazzled
the Ranger defense by skating from right to left, drawing the
coverage toward him and setting up the wide-open Brendan Shanahan's
shot. It was Shanahan's first goal since Dec. 23, and his face
showed great relief as the fans cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The center matchups were interesting. Gretzky played a number of
shifts against Fedorov; Nedved was matched against Steve Yzerman.
Another subtheme was the play of Leetch, who came into the game
without a goal in his previous 21 games. In the first period,
Leetch took two minor penalties, which are rare for him. Later, he
wrestled with Tomas Holmstrom while play continued at the other
end. No penalty was called for that one.  &QL;
</P>

   JOHAN WITEHALL made his Rangers debut. He was called up from the
Hartford farm club this week. &QL;

SENATORS' ONSLAUGHT OVERWHELMS THE ISLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ Bill Stewart got the Islanders to play hard
for him in his first three games behind the bench. But he couldn't
keep the team's true colors from showing through against the Ottawa
Senators on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders fell behind early, and big, giving up seven goals
in the first two periods and losing to the Senators by 9-2 at the
sold-out Corel Center. The nine goals were the most ever by a
Senators team.
</P>
<P>
   For three games under Stewart, who replaced Mike Milbury as head
coach, there was false hope floating in the Islanders' locker room
of perhaps regaining some respectability, if not getting back into
the playoff chase. But Saturday's loss further proved that this
group of Islanders is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another shoddy performance in goal by Felix Potvin opened the
floodgates. Potvin, who started for the first time in three games,
allowed seven goals on 36 shots before being relieved by Tommy Salo
to start the third period. Ottawa is a good young team, but Potvin
made the Senators look like the Edmonton Oilers of the mid 1980s;
he made Radek Bonk look like Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Ten different Senators recorded at least two points. Shawn
McEachern and Aleksei Yashin each scored two goals, and Bonk,
Magnus Arvedson, Steve Martins, Shaun Van Allen and Marian Hossa
each scored once to hand the Islanders their first loss under
Stewart (2-1-1). Zigmund Palffy and Robert Reichel scored the
Islanders' goals.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing loss must have left Stewart scratching his
head, coming a day after the Islanders' inspiring, come-from-behind
4-4 tie with the Phoenix Coyotes at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   While playing bits and pieces of 10 seasons in the National
Hockey League, Stewart had to work harder than his teammates on
practice days just to be considered for the lineup on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fringe player who not only had to look good on the
ice, I had to look good getting on the plane,'' the 41-year-old
former defenseman said last week. ``If I had a bad day getting on
the plane, I might be sent back to the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years removed from playing the game, Stewart has not
changed his hard-nosed, hard-work philosophy. He demands that same
level of effort from all of his players, whether they are elite
scorers like Palffy or fourth-line grinders like Steve Webb. ``Put
out for me,'' Stewart says. ``I'll put out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, like most coaches, can live with defeat, so long as his
team competes hard for the entire 60 minutes. That, obviously, was
not the case on Saturday. So it will be interesting to see how
Stewart deals with this weak effort.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Micheletti, the color commentator on Fox broadcasts of
Islanders games, was a teammate of Stewart's on the St. Louis Blues
in the early 1980s and recalled one incident that Micheletti said
personified Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Micheletti remembered a run-in Stewart had with the Boston
Bruins' tough guy Stan Jonathan. ``Stan Jonathan cross checked him
in the face,'' Micheletti said. ``Smack! Broke his nose. Stewie
went after Jonathan but couldn't get him the way he wanted to. So
Stewie waited until the next game. And on the first shift, he went
right after Jonathan. Stewie got him good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's resolve will be tested on Long Island, where he faces
his toughest challenge yet. He inherits a team with as many holes
to fill on the ice as it has problems to resolve off the ice. The
Islanders are headed for their fifth straight season without making
the playoffs. There are also ownership problems, which last off
season affected player personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milbury's best decision as general manager this season
could prove to be promoting Stewart, who guided the Islanders to
their first victory in 11 games in his debut. ``We hired Bill
Stewart over the summer knowing that he had been successful at
every level that he coached and that someday he might get the
opportunity here,'' said Milbury, who stepped down as coach on Jan.
21 but remained as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, that opportunity may not have looked so
attractive. &QL;

<P>
   The last scene in ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is a sort of
parable of the World Wide Web. The carefully crated Ark is carried
into a gigantic government warehouse. The camera plays over row
after row after row of crates. You know the Ark is about to be
lost, once again.
</P>
<P>
   It's there. But no one knows where. So it is with the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned libraries share common organizing principles: a
card file, the Dewey decimal system. But there's no standard
taxonomy of information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helpful librarians, you have search engines like
Yahoo!, Infoseek, and Excite. They aren't interchangeable. Some,
like Yahoo!, are organized by subject and may produce very limited
responses to queries.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like AltaVista, read and index every word of every file
they can find on the Web. Conducting a complete search on AltaVista
could be your life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shows the variations among search engines better than a
hunt for information about 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask HotBot to search for two different keywords _ ``40l(k)'' and
``401k'' _ and it will return with 10,866 documents containing
``401k'' and 92,115 documents with the more precise ``401(k)''
phrasing. AltaVista retrieves 70,120 documents containing ``40lk''
and 40,556 containing ``401(k).'' Yahoo! yields a mere 60 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: How far you can go depends on where you start. Start
with Yahoo! and you will probably be frustrated at the paucity of
choices. Start with AltaVista and there is a good chance you'll be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Excite (www.excite.com) offers a comfortable middle course. When
I searched for ``40lk'' or ``401(k),'' the engine returned with a
list of 20,218 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where I wanted to go, I could visit sites put up by
corporate giants, such as www.quicken.com and
www.fidelityatwork.com (Fidelity's omnibus site for tax-deferred
savings plans), or sites maintained by individual enthusiasts such
as economist William Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other sites worth visiting, arranged according to
the three main issues in 401(k) saving:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETIREMENT PLANNING &LR;  &QL; : Am I saving enough and getting enough
return to
retire at the appointed age?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSET ALLOCATION &LR;  &QL; : How should I invest my money? How much risk
should I
take for a given return?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAN FEES &LR;  &QL; : Is my employer's 401(k) plan a good one? The
central issue
here is how much the plan costs and who pays for it. Diligent
saving and smart asset allocation won't mean much if a plan sinks
from the weight of its expenses or the mediocrity of its choices.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with retirement planning. One of the most attractive
basic retirement calculator sites belongs to an individual, Tracy
Paul, on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Her site (members.aol.com/tracy/paul/private/index.html) offers
a 401(k) accumulator and a retirement withdrawal plan. But like
other simple calculators, it omits factors like Social Security,
private pensions, and spousal earnings, so its usefulness is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The online retirement calculator offered by Fidelity combines
your expected Social Security benefits, your expected private
pension, if any, and the projected results for your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's site has no provision for private pensions, but it
does allow you to specify expected future living expenses, which
are just as important to a successful retirement as investment
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can substantially improve their retirement outlook
by moving into housing that costs less or by moving to a part of
the country that is less expensive to live in.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, your retirement plan will work when your
accumulated financial assets equal about 20 times the annual
expenses not covered by other income sources. You get to that point
through asset allocation. The question is how to mix your
investment choices to get the highest return at the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   For a primer on how asset allocation can help produce a higher
return or lower risk, check out the Index Investor,
www.indexinvestor.com. Then look at William Bernstein's ``Efficient
Frontier: An Online Journal of Practical Asset Allocation''
(www.efficientfrontier.com), a site that combines dark humor with a
solid grounding in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Another good site is Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe's new
venture, Financial Engines, at www.financialengines.com. Intended
as a service for 401(k) plans, Financial Engines forecasts the
chances that a saver will reach his or her goal with a given asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   And my own site, www.scottburns.com, provides a Couch Potato
Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the investment community regularly complained
that people were too conservative as investors. But a new study by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, www.ebri.org, indicates
that 401(k) holdings are now invested much as conventional pension
portfolios are, with just more than 60 percent in equities.
</P>
<P>
   To see if that trend holds true in the future, check in every
once in a while at www.hewitt.com/401kindex, an index of activity
in 401(k) plans; this site is maintained by Hewitt Associates, an
employee-benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the cost of 401(k) plans was a non-issue for
most savers, but that's beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from traditional, defined-benefit pension plans to
defined-contribution 401(k) plans has transformed money management
from a wholesale business into a retail one. In many cases, the
price of managing retirement assets has risen from less than 1
percent a year to more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about how these costs can affect long-term
performance, read the reports on fees from the Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration at www.dol.gov/dol/pwba.
</P>
<P>
   A site that discusses the subject with, well, a good deal less
objectivity is 401k Scam at
http://members.aol.com/scam401k/index.html. &QL;

card file, the Dewey decimal system. But there's no standard
taxonomy of information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helpful librarians, you have search engines like
Yahoo!, Infoseek, and Excite. They aren't interchangeable. Some,
like Yahoo!, are organized by subject and may produce very limited
responses to queries.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like AltaVista, read and index every word of every file
they can find on the Web. Conducting a complete search on AltaVista
could be your life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shows the variations among search engines better than a
hunt for information about 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask HotBot to search for two different keywords _ ``40l(k)'' and
``401k'' _ and it will return with 10,866 documents containing
``401k'' and 92,115 documents with the more precise ``401(k)''
phrasing. AltaVista retrieves 70,120 documents containing ``40lk''
and 40,556 containing ``401(k).'' Yahoo! yields a mere 60 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: How far you can go depends on where you start. Start
with Yahoo! and you will probably be frustrated at the paucity of
choices. Start with AltaVista and there is a good chance you'll be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Excite (www.excite.com) offers a comfortable middle course. When
I searched for ``40lk'' or ``401(k),'' the engine returned with a
list of 20,218 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where I wanted to go, I could visit sites put up by
corporate giants, such as www.quicken.com and
www.fidelityatwork.com (Fidelity's omnibus site for tax-deferred
savings plans), or sites maintained by individual enthusiasts such
as economist William Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other sites worth visiting, arranged according to
the three main issues in 401(k) saving:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETIREMENT PLANNING &LR;  &QL; : Am I saving enough and getting enough
return to
retire at the appointed age?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSET ALLOCATION &LR;  &QL; : How should I invest my money? How much risk
should I
take for a given return?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAN FEES &LR;  &QL; : Is my employer's 401(k) plan a good one? The
central issue
here is how much the plan costs and who pays for it. Diligent
saving and smart asset allocation won't mean much if a plan sinks
from the weight of its expenses or the mediocrity of its choices.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with retirement planning. One of the most attractive
basic retirement calculator sites belongs to an individual, Tracy
Paul, on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Her site (members.aol.com/tracy/paul/private/index.html) offers
a 401(k) accumulator and a retirement withdrawal plan. But like
other simple calculators, it omits factors like Social Security,
private pensions, and spousal earnings, so its usefulness is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The online retirement calculator offered by Fidelity combines
your expected Social Security benefits, your expected private
pension, if any, and the projected results for your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's site has no provision for private pensions, but it
does allow you to specify expected future living expenses, which
are just as important to a successful retirement as investment
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can substantially improve their retirement outlook
by moving into housing that costs less or by moving to a part of
the country that is less expensive to live in.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, your retirement plan will work when your
accumulated financial assets equal about 20 times the annual
expenses not covered by other income sources. You get to that point
through asset allocation. The question is how to mix your
investment choices to get the highest return at the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   For a primer on how asset allocation can help produce a higher
return or lower risk, check out the Index Investor,
www.indexinvestor.com. Then look at William Bernstein's ``Efficient
Frontier: An Online Journal of Practical Asset Allocation''
(www.efficientfrontier.com), a site that combines dark humor with a
solid grounding in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Another good site is Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe's new
venture, Financial Engines, at www.financialengines.com. Intended
as a service for 401(k) plans, Financial Engines forecasts the
chances that a saver will reach his or her goal with a given asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   And my own site, www.scottburns.com, provides a Couch Potato
Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the investment community regularly complained
that people were too conservative as investors. But a new study by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, www.ebri.org, indicates
that 401(k) holdings are now invested much as conventional pension
portfolios are, with just more than 60 percent in equities.
</P>
<P>
   To see if that trend holds true in the future, check in every
once in a while at www.hewitt.com/401kindex, an index of activity
in 401(k) plans; this site is maintained by Hewitt Associates, an
employee-benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the cost of 401(k) plans was a non-issue for
most savers, but that's beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from traditional, defined-benefit pension plans to
defined-contribution 401(k) plans has transformed money management
from a wholesale business into a retail one. In many cases, the
price of managing retirement assets has risen from less than 1
percent a year to more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about how these costs can affect long-term
performance, read the reports on fees from the Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration at www.dol.gov/dol/pwba.

objectivity is 401k Scam at

<P>
   If the stronger U.S. dollar lures you abroad for some shopping,
don't be one of the two out of three Americans who forget to get a
hefty rebate on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Asia, a consumption
tax is built into the price of many goods and services. As a
visiting American, you're entitled to a refund on many of those
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking real money here? In some cases, yes. The rates
for consumption tax vary from country to country, from a relatively
modest 2.9 percent in Singapore to a whopping 20 percent in
Denmark, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Ireland, you must spend a minimum amount to claim a
refund. The minimum amount also varies (as little as $45 in Denmark
and as much as $340 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), but in most
countries, you can accumulate purchases over time in order to reach
the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers may also be eligible for refunds on
business-related expenses, depending on the country. For example,
if you stay in a hotel in Germany for business, you (or your
company) can claim a refund on the 16 percent tax you pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, a company not based there may claim a
refund of the 17.5 percent value-added tax its employees pay for
hotels, rental cars, meals, telephone calls, trade shows, and even
marketing consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in knowing how to get your money back. Let's say
you're in Milan, and you have no choice but to spend $2,000 on a
fabulous dress. You're entitled to a VAT refund of $400.
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk will need your passport _ always carry it when
shopping _ when he or she fills out the refund form. Each purchase
you make will be listed on the form, which must be presented to a
tax official when you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   You must also be prepared to show the goods you purchased to the
tax-refund agent at the airport when you're flying out of any
country that's a member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where many Americans get tripped up. If you check
your luggage before you locate a tax-refund kiosk, you might be out
of luck. The tax man can't be certain you're not trying to claim a
refund on goods purchased for a friend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Have the goods available for display. The refund
papers from the places of purchase will be stamped; simply mail
them in, and your charge card will be credited or you'll be sent a
check. Or you may even be handed a cash refund on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit more complicated for the business traveler. The
rules differ widely from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   France, for example, will rebate only the 20.6 percent in VAT
paid for phone calls, marketing-consultant services, and trade-show
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K., on the other hand, is relatively generous in rebating
taxes but won't do so for individuals _ only companies. And
companies can file only four times a year for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   There are firms such as EuroVAT (800-828-0609) and Fexco
(800-865-4561) that specialize in recapturing taxes due American
businesses. Their fee is generally 20 percent of the taxes
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in the retail arena, the savings can be enormous.
Let's say the employees of an American-based company spend, in
total, 223 days a year in the U.K. on business.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that these road warriors spend an average $150 a night
on hotels, $35 a day on rental cars and gasoline, and $35 a day on
meals _ all told, about $49,000 a year in travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.K. levies a 17.5 percent VAT, a company can obtain a
refund of about $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Canada began honoring corporate claims for
refunds as well. The rates vary from province to province, but
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Quebec will
refund not only the federal sales tax but also the provincial sales
tax, which alone can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says it rebates 5 percent on most business expenses, but
Karen Bostrom, a vice president of sales and marketing with
EuroVAT, says that in practice Japan generally refunds 5 percent
only on hotel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's 5 percent or 20 percent, that money is yours. Ask
for those pounds, francs, yen, or marks back. &QL;

<P>
   France, for example, will rebate only the 20.6 percent in VAT
paid for phone calls, marketing-consultant services, and trade-show
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K., on the other hand, is relatively generous in rebating
taxes but won't do so for individuals _ only companies. And
companies can file only four times a year for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   There are firms such as EuroVAT (800-828-0609) and Fexco
(800-865-4561) that specialize in recapturing taxes due American
businesses. Their fee is generally 20 percent of the taxes
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in the retail arena, the savings can be enormous.
Let's say the employees of an American-based company spend, in
total, 223 days a year in the U.K. on business.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that these road warriors spend an average $150 a night
on hotels, $35 a day on rental cars and gasoline, and $35 a day on
meals _ all told, about $49,000 a year in travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.K. levies a 17.5 percent VAT, a company can obtain a
refund of about $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Canada began honoring corporate claims for
refunds as well. The rates vary from province to province, but
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Quebec will
refund not only the federal sales tax but also the provincial sales
tax, which alone can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says it rebates 5 percent on most business expenses, but
Karen Bostrom, a vice president of sales and marketing with
EuroVAT, says that in practice Japan generally refunds 5 percent
only on hotel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's 5 percent or 20 percent, that money is yours. Ask
for those pounds, francs, yen, or marks back. &QL;

<P>
   If the stronger U.S. dollar lures you abroad for some shopping,
don't be one of the two out of three Americans who forget to get a
hefty rebate on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Asia, a consumption
tax is built into the price of many goods and services. As a
visiting American, you're entitled to a refund on many of those
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking real money here? In some cases, yes. The rates
for consumption tax vary from country to country, from a relatively
modest 2.9 percent in Singapore to a whopping 20 percent in
Denmark, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Ireland, you must spend a minimum amount to claim a
refund. The minimum amount also varies (as little as $45 in Denmark
and as much as $340 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), but in most
countries, you can accumulate purchases over time in order to reach
the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers may also be eligible for refunds on
business-related expenses, depending on the country. For example,
if you stay in a hotel in Germany for business, you (or your
company) can claim a refund on the 16 percent tax you pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, a company not based there may claim a
refund of the 17.5 percent value-added tax its employees pay for
hotels, rental cars, meals, telephone calls, trade shows, and even
marketing consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in knowing how to get your money back. Let's say
you're in Milan, and you have no choice but to spend $2,000 on a
fabulous dress. You're entitled to a VAT refund of $400.
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk will need your passport _ always carry it when
shopping _ when he or she fills out the refund form. Each purchase
you make will be listed on the form, which must be presented to a
tax official when you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   You must also be prepared to show the goods you purchased to the
tax-refund agent at the airport when you're flying out of any
country that's a member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where many Americans get tripped up. If you check
your luggage before you locate a tax-refund kiosk, you might be out
of luck. The tax man can't be certain you're not trying to claim a
refund on goods purchased for a friend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Have the goods available for display. The refund
papers from the places of purchase will be stamped; simply mail
them in, and your charge card will be credited or you'll be sent a
check. Or you may even be handed a cash refund on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit more complicated for the business traveler. The
rules differ widely from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   France, for example, will rebate only the 20.6 percent in VAT
paid for phone calls, marketing-consultant services, and trade-show

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most American borrowers _ which is to say most American
homeowners _ down is up.
</P>
<P>
   However, the financial markets perform in the coming year, it's
very likely that the biggest financial opportunity for U.S.
consumers in 1999 will be the refinancing of their homes via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The math explains why mortgage lenders and brokers are swamped
with applications. The rate on a refinanced mortgage is likely to
be at least 160 basis points (1.6 percentage points) lower than the
original mortgage rate, approximately the yield on the stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the principal amount of the typical home mortgage
equals about two years' worth of the owner's income. Closing costs
average about 2 percent of the face value of the mortgage, or about
two weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, refinancing a mortgage is like investing two weeks' salary
to collect the dividends on a portfolio worth more than two years'
salary _ with no risk.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a refinancing is as good as a salary increase for
most borrowers. Maybe better. While the major benefits-consulting
firms were forecasting 4.5 percent raises for 1999 only a few
months ago, economic angst may dampen that figure.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of homeowners will be able to increase their
spending power by more than 3 percent by refinancing _ even more if
they roll consumer debt into the new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers still have to deal with lenders, alas, and their
endless and intrusive requests for information. But at least the
Net brings some welcome anonymity to the seven-step process,
described below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCOUTING THE MARKET &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, the mortgage market consisted of whatever
the local lender or broker had to offer. But the Web allows
consumers to shop among mortgage lenders, comparing rates, fees,
maturities, and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the Federal Reserve site
(www.bog.frb.fed.us/releases). Download the ``historical data''
version of release H.15 to see if rates have risen or fallen in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Median home prices in cities across the country are available
through the ``NAR Press Releases'' link at www.realtimes.com.
Real-estate-information publisher HSH (www.hsh.com) features a
three-year graph of typical mortgage rates, a collection of
calculators, and a regularly updated report on average rates.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to compare what specific lenders are offering is
through the Web sites of mortgage brokers, most of which do
business with several lenders around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active brokers are HomeShark (www.homeshark.com),
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), and QuickenMortgage
(www.quickenmortgage.com).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHECKING CREDIT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates depend largely on the borrower's credit rating.
Quick credit tests can be found at www.mortgage-net.com and
www.hsh.com. And consumers can obtain a copy of their credit report
from www.creditreport-net.com.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest taking the test and foregoing the report: One of the
markdowns in credit scoring systems is the number of credit
inquiries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOOSING THE MORTGAGE YOU WANT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, home mortgages came in one flavor: 30 years,
fixed rate. Now maturities on fixed-rate loans range from 15 to 30,
and rates can be fixed or vary according to changes in one of three
common indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are balloon notes payable in three, five, or
seven years and adjustable thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage world is further subdivided into ``conforming''
loans (which carry principal amounts of $227,150 or less and are
eligible to be pooled and turned into tradable securities) and
``jumbo,'' or nonconforming, loans (which carry higher principal
amounts and interest rates).
</P>
<P>
   These days, fixed-rate mortgages have it all over
adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate borrowers, after a
brief, low-rate introductory period, pay about 7.46 percent at a
time when fixed-rate borrowers are paying 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination instruments also look pretty dubious right
about now, so homeowners should spend most of their search
comparing 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers can shorten the terms by increasing the amount they
pay each month _ an idea popularized by Marc Eisenson in his book,
``The Banker's Secret,'' which can be ordered at
www.goodadvicepress.com.
</P>
<P>
   But most people hear about a money-grubbing variant on the idea,
the biweekly mortgage, hyped at www.usmr.com. I challenged the hype
in a newspaper column, archived at www.scottburns.com/980614su.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DETERMINING FEES AND EXPENSES &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most lenders on the Web now provide potential borrowers with a
list of closing fees and expenses. Make sure you comparison shop _
not all of these lenders underprice conventional lenders.
</P>
<P>
   HomeShark is one that aims to cut about $1,000 out of the
standard mortgage cost and pass the savings along to the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUALIFYING FOR THE LOAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A borrower now making a mortgage payment of $1,000 a month
should easily qualify for a new mortgage with a lower monthly
payment, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The problem, at least with conforming loans, is often
something called the back-end ratio. This is the total of a
borrower's mortgage, home insurance, and real-estate tax payments
(which are usually limited to 28 percent of gross income), plus all
other fixed commitments _ car loans, credit-card debt, child
support, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The combined total is limited to 36 percent of gross income. In
other words, non-home-buying commitments can't exceed 8 percent of
gross income. If they do, the mortgage amount is reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to exceed 8 percent. Consider a two-earner
couple with a combined income of $100,000 who are financing two
$25,000 cars for five years at 8 percent. Their total monthly
payments will be $1,014 a month, or 12.2 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   Add two credit-card balances of, say, $2,000 and minimum monthly
payments of $40 each, and they've lost another 1 percent. (Strictly
speaking, most lenders look at 10 months' worth of payments or so
to estimate the level of monthly installment debt.)
</P>
<P>
   With all these pitfalls, it's a good thing the Web is loaded
with qualification calculators. Two good ones can be found at
www.financecenter.com/calcs.html and www.interest.com/hugh/calc.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSEMBLING DOCUMENTATION &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   No two ways about it, this is a headache. A checklist of the
required items can be found at www.hsh.com, and it's a bit
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Where are those W-2s? Where did last month's bank statement get
to? The load is even worse for the self-employed, who need at least
two years' worth of personal tax returns as well as their most
recent corporate tax returns and profit-and-loss statements.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Make a numbered list of documents, number the
documents, and make a complete copy of the application package.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPLYING AND CLOSING &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is the easy part, comparatively speaking. Computers have
accelerated the decision-making process, so an answer _ an
affirmative answer, we hope _ should be forthcoming in short
order. &QL;

2 CLEARED ON SOME COUNTS OF SLAYING AT STRIP CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A jury acquitted two brothers of several charges
Saturday in connection with two 1996 slayings at Scores, a strip
club on the Upper East Side. But the jurors continued to debate
more serious charges, signaling that they were wrestling with the
credibility of the main prosecution witness, a Mafia turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in state Supreme Court in Manhattan cleared one of the
brothers, Victor Dedaj, 39, in the death of one of the men, Michael
Greco 22. But the jurors remained deadlocked on a second-degree
murder charge against Dedaj in the death of Jonathan Segal, 25. And
they remained undecided on the most serious charges against Simon
Dedaj, 35, first-degree murder in both killings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors from Westchester County are closely watching
the trial of the Dedaj brothers. Willie Marshall, 33, a Mafia
turncoat who was a key witness against the brothers, is also
considered a lead prosecution witness in the upcoming trial of John
A. Gotti, the son of imprisoned Mafia leader John J. Gotti. The
younger Gotti is scheduled to be tried later this year in
Westchester County on extortion and fraud charges
</P>
<P>
   The Dedaj brothers were accused of murdering the two men, a
bouncer and a waiter at the club on East 60th Street, after an
argument broke out at an early-morning birthday celebration.
Marshall and other prosecution witnesses testified that the
brothers shot Greco and Segal, but defense lawyers said that the
brothers acted in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, the jurors sent a note to the judge saying
that they had reached a verdict on some of the counts, but were
deadlocked on others. Justice Edwin Torres called the jurors to the
courtroom to hear the partial verdicts. The jury acquitted the two
brothers on several burglary and second-degree murder charges, but
said that they were deadlocked on nine other counts.
</P>
<P>
   Torres ordered the jurors to continue deliberations. At 7 p.m.,
after about two more hours of debate, the jurors, with Torres'
permission, ended their discussions for the evening. They are
scheduled to resume deliberations Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The family members and friends of the Dedaj brothers were
distraught Saturday morning as the jurors began their third full
day of deliberations. Simon Dedaj's girlfriend, Donna Kelly, wept,
and Marika Dedaj, the mother of the two men, prayed with other
family members. After the partial verdicts were read, they seemed
to find hope. ``It is reassuring to hear the not-guilty verdicts,''
said Robert P. Kelly, an lawyer for Victor Dedaj.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the trial, prosecutors and defense lawyers presented
starkly different versions of what happened. The prosecution said
that Simon Dedaj shot and killed Greco, a bouncer, and Segal, a
waiter. The defense contended that Victor Dedaj fired the gun, but
only in self-defense. The partial verdicts cast little light on
which version the jurors believed, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, a former bouncer and a former prison guard, was as
much the focus of the trial as the Dedaj brothers. Jurors faced a
complicated task in deciding whether they believed Marshall. As
part of his long history of criminal activities, Marshall testified
that he and his associates extorted money from the owners, disk
jockeys and strippers at Scores for the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor in the Scores case, Daniel McGillycuddy,
urged the jurors to trust Marshall, noting that a FBI wiretap
recorded him giving his brother the same description of the
killings that he gave during his testimony in court. Saturday,
before the verdicts, the jurors took a break from their
deliberations to listen to several of the FBI tapes for a second
time.

   Furthermore, the principal amount of the typical home mortgage
equals about two years' worth of the owner's income. Closing costs
average about 2 percent of the face value of the mortgage, or about
two weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, refinancing a mortgage is like investing two weeks' salary
to collect the dividends on a portfolio worth more than two years'
salary _ with no risk.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a refinancing is as good as a salary increase for
most borrowers. Maybe better. While the major benefits-consulting
firms were forecasting 4.5 percent raises for 1999 only a few
months ago, economic angst may dampen that figure.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of homeowners will be able to increase their
spending power by more than 3 percent by refinancing _ even more if
they roll consumer debt into the new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers still have to deal with lenders, alas, and their
endless and intrusive requests for information. But at least the
Net brings some welcome anonymity to the seven-step process,
described below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCOUTING THE MARKET &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, the mortgage market consisted of whatever
the local lender or broker had to offer. But the Web allows
consumers to shop among mortgage lenders, comparing rates, fees,
maturities, and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the Federal Reserve site
(www.bog.frb.fed.us/releases). Download the ``historical data''
version of release H.15 to see if rates have risen or fallen in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Median home prices in cities across the country are available
through the ``NAR Press Releases'' link at www.realtimes.com.
Real-estate-information publisher HSH (www.hsh.com) features a
three-year graph of typical mortgage rates, a collection of
calculators, and a regularly updated report on average rates.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to compare what specific lenders are offering is
through the Web sites of mortgage brokers, most of which do
business with several lenders around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active brokers are HomeShark (www.homeshark.com),
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), and QuickenMortgage
(www.quickenmortgage.com).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHECKING CREDIT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates depend largely on the borrower's credit rating.
Quick credit tests can be found at www.mortgage-net.com and
www.hsh.com. And consumers can obtain a copy of their credit report
from www.creditreport-net.com.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest taking the test and foregoing the report: One of the
markdowns in credit scoring systems is the number of credit
inquiries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOOSING THE MORTGAGE YOU WANT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, home mortgages came in one flavor: 30 years,
fixed rate. Now maturities on fixed-rate loans range from 15 to 30,
and rates can be fixed or vary according to changes in one of three
common indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are balloon notes payable in three, five, or
seven years and adjustable thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage world is further subdivided into ``conforming''
loans (which carry principal amounts of $227,150 or less and are
eligible to be pooled and turned into tradable securities) and
``jumbo,'' or nonconforming, loans (which carry higher principal
amounts and interest rates).
</P>
<P>
   These days, fixed-rate mortgages have it all over
adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate borrowers, after a
brief, low-rate introductory period, pay about 7.46 percent at a
time when fixed-rate borrowers are paying 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination instruments also look pretty dubious right
about now, so homeowners should spend most of their search
comparing 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers can shorten the terms by increasing the amount they
pay each month _ an idea popularized by Marc Eisenson in his book,
``The Banker's Secret,'' which can be ordered at
www.goodadvicepress.com.
</P>
<P>
   But most people hear about a money-grubbing variant on the idea,
the biweekly mortgage, hyped at www.usmr.com. I challenged the hype
in a newspaper column, archived at www.scottburns.com/980614su.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DETERMINING FEES AND EXPENSES &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most lenders on the Web now provide potential borrowers with a
list of closing fees and expenses. Make sure you comparison shop _
not all of these lenders underprice conventional lenders.
</P>
<P>
   HomeShark is one that aims to cut about $1,000 out of the
standard mortgage cost and pass the savings along to the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUALIFYING FOR THE LOAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A borrower now making a mortgage payment of $1,000 a month
should easily qualify for a new mortgage with a lower monthly
payment, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The problem, at least with conforming loans, is often
something called the back-end ratio. This is the total of a
borrower's mortgage, home insurance, and real-estate tax payments
(which are usually limited to 28 percent of gross income), plus all
other fixed commitments _ car loans, credit-card debt, child
support, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The combined total is limited to 36 percent of gross income. In
other words, non-home-buying commitments can't exceed 8 percent of
gross income. If they do, the mortgage amount is reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to exceed 8 percent. Consider a two-earner
couple with a combined income of $100,000 who are financing two
$25,000 cars for five years at 8 percent. Their total monthly
payments will be $1,014 a month, or 12.2 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   Add two credit-card balances of, say, $2,000 and minimum monthly
payments of $40 each, and they've lost another 1 percent. (Strictly
speaking, most lenders look at 10 months' worth of payments or so
to estimate the level of monthly installment debt.)
</P>
<P>
   With all these pitfalls, it's a good thing the Web is loaded
with qualification calculators. Two good ones can be found at
www.financecenter.com/calcs.html and www.interest.com/hugh/calc.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSEMBLING DOCUMENTATION &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   No two ways about it, this is a headache. A checklist of the
required items can be found at www.hsh.com, and it's a bit
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Where are those W-2s? Where did last month's bank statement get
to? The load is even worse for the self-employed, who need at least
two years' worth of personal tax returns as well as their most
recent corporate tax returns and profit-and-loss statements.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Make a numbered list of documents, number the
documents, and make a complete copy of the application package.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPLYING AND CLOSING &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is the easy part, comparatively speaking. Computers have
accelerated the decision-making process, so an answer _ an
affirmative answer, we hope _ should be forthcoming in short
order. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For most American borrowers _ which is to say most American
homeowners _ down is up.
</P>
<P>
   However, the financial markets perform in the coming year, it's
very likely that the biggest financial opportunity for U.S.
consumers in 1999 will be the refinancing of their homes via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The math explains why mortgage lenders and brokers are swamped
with applications. The rate on a refinanced mortgage is likely to
be at least 160 basis points (1.6 percentage points) lower than the
original mortgage rate, approximately the yield on the stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the principal amount of the typical home mortgage
equals about two years' worth of the owner's income. Closing costs
average about 2 percent of the face value of the mortgage, or about
two weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, refinancing a mortgage is like investing two weeks' salary
to collect the dividends on a portfolio worth more than two years'
salary _ with no risk.
</P>

   What's more, a refinancing is as good as a salary increase for

<P>
   As a shopper, no matter how high your credit-card limit, there
is one thing you almost never have: perfect information. Is $521
the best deal on that Nikon? You'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   Or will you? Visit CNET's Shopper.com, enter the description of
a product you're looking to buy, and in seconds you'll have a list
of stores that carry the item.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any list, but a shopping mega-list _ database-driven
and info-packed _ that's almost certain to save you time and money.
The list tells you what you'll pay at retailers from Irvine,
Calif., to Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, $521 is not the best price on that Nikon digital
camera, the Coolpix 600. Shopper.com lists 25 stores that carry the
product, as well as each store's phone number and location, the
approximate shipping cost, and the product's availability.
</P>
<P>
   One store wants $498.95, while another _ a popular mail-order
retailer _ wants $599.95. Complete information, or something close
to it. A shopper's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Shopper.com and its brethren, the Web's
comparison-shopping sites, as search engines for products and, more
importantly, prices at far-flung merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, books, CDs, toys, home electronics _ all the major
products peddled on the Web can be found at one of the
comparison-shopping sites, from Bottom Dollar to Robo Shopper.
</P>
<P>
   For price and convenience (those mantras of the serious
shopper), these sites just can't be beat, especially during the
holiday season, when mall frenzy disrupts suburban traffic patterns
and lines twist around cash registers in a consumption-crazed
version of Dante's ``Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy any products online, you can use these
sites to compare prices with those at your local retailer.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a few caveats are still in order:
</P>
<P>
   l) Avoid sites that list prices for only a few merchants. Either
the site's database is puny or, worse, the site charges merchants
to be listed. ``That's ultimately limiting,'' says James McQuivey,
an analyst at Forrester Research. ``The consumer will eventually
learn he's getting something that's fundamentally at odds with the
value the Internet provides.''
</P>
<P>
   2) Beware of stale information. The best sites reveal when a
price was last updated. Always confirm the price by phone or at the
merchant's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   3) Even at sites that don't charge merchants for listings,
expect some intermingling of objective information with
advertisements. At Shopper.com, the initial sale list places
sponsors at the top. Does that help you? Not at all. Choose the
``Re-sort by Price'' link.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes comparison shopping is integrated into search engines,
as at Excite. More common are stand-alone comparison-shopping
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, expect to see comparison shopping everywhere
you turn on the Web: portal sites like Yahoo!, news and
entertainment sites, even personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, these sites will provide entirely new ways of
deciding what to buy, allowing you to generate detailed
side-by-side comparisons, read customer reviews, and otherwise
match your desires with the right product.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the consumer,'' says McQuivey, ``this is phenomenal.''  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   As a shopper, no matter how high your credit-card limit, there
is one thing you almost never have: perfect information. Is $521
the best deal on that Nikon? You'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   Or will you? Visit CNET's Shopper.com, enter the description of
a product you're looking to buy, and in seconds you'll have a list
of stores that carry the item.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any list, but a shopping mega-list _ database-driven
and info-packed _ that's almost certain to save you time and money.
The list tells you what you'll pay at retailers from Irvine,
Calif., to Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, $521 is not the best price on that Nikon digital
camera, the Coolpix 600. Shopper.com lists 25 stores that carry the
product, as well as each store's phone number and location, the
approximate shipping cost, and the product's availability.
</P>
<P>
   One store wants $498.95, while another _ a popular mail-order
retailer _ wants $599.95. Complete information, or something close
to it. A shopper's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Shopper.com and its brethren, the Web's
comparison-shopping sites, as search engines for products and, more
importantly, prices at far-flung merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, books, CDs, toys, home electronics _ all the major
products peddled on the Web can be found at one of the
comparison-shopping sites, from Bottom Dollar to Robo Shopper.
</P>
<P>
   For price and convenience (those mantras of the serious
shopper), these sites just can't be beat, especially during the
holiday season, when mall frenzy disrupts suburban traffic patterns
and lines twist around cash registers in a consumption-crazed
version of Dante's ``Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy any products online, you can use these
sites to compare prices with those at your local retailer.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a few caveats are still in order:
</P>
<P>
   l) Avoid sites that list prices for only a few merchants. Either
the site's database is puny or, worse, the site charges merchants
to be listed. ``That's ultimately limiting,'' says James McQuivey,
an analyst at Forrester Research. ``The consumer will eventually
learn he's getting something that's fundamentally at odds with the
value the Internet provides.''
</P>
<P>
   2) Beware of stale information. The best sites reveal when a
price was last updated. Always confirm the price by phone or at the
merchant's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   3) Even at sites that don't charge merchants for listings,
expect some intermingling of objective information with
advertisements. At Shopper.com, the initial sale list places
sponsors at the top. Does that help you? Not at all. Choose the
``Re-sort by Price'' link.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes comparison shopping is integrated into search engines,
as at Excite. More common are stand-alone comparison-shopping
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, expect to see comparison shopping everywhere
you turn on the Web: portal sites like Yahoo!, news and
entertainment sites, even personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, these sites will provide entirely new ways of
deciding what to buy, allowing you to generate detailed
side-by-side comparisons, read customer reviews, and otherwise
match your desires with the right product.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the consumer,'' says McQuivey, ``this is phenomenal.''  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Who besides Dr. Seuss's Grinch would impose a penalty on gift
giving? The U.S. government, of course, which makes sure that the
generous have to worry about not just income taxes but gift taxes
as well.
</P>
<P>
   An unpleasant light was briefly shone on the tax treatment of
gifts last year when baseball fans began wondering aloud whether
someone who gave St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire back his
62nd-home-run ball would be liable for a gift tax.
</P>
<P>
   Proving just how tricky gift-tax rules can be, the IRS made two
different statements within 48 hours about tax liability. At first
the donor owed big time, then he or she was off the hook. The ball
was retrieved by an employee of the Cardinals, ending the debate.
</P>
<P>
   For people making more prosaic gifts, there are still several
considerations to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   If you give any one person a gift worth more than $10,000, you
will have to file a gift-tax return. But that doesn't mean you'll
actually have to pay tax on the gift this year. Instead, the effect
of the gift tax will be to reduce the amount (currently $625,000)
that can be transferred free of estate tax at the time of your
death.
</P>
<P>
   You can give up to $10,000 to an unlimited number of people
without worrying about gift tax. If you're married, you and your
spouse can give $20,000 to any individual without having to file a
gift-tax return, but you must file Form 709 to notify the IRS of
the ``split gift.''
</P>
<P>
   One other goody: There's no limit on the size of your gift if
it's for tuition or medical care. So feel free to pick up the cost
of your grandchild's Ivy League education. You'll want to be sure
to write the check to the institution, though, and not to the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to give a child or other relative non-appreciating
assets, such as cash, instead of appreciating assets like stocks.
Reason: Whoever receives your gift of an appreciating asset will
have the same cost basis that you had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought $1,000 worth of stock that is now worth $7,000,
the recipient of that gift will have to pay income tax on
everything above $1,000 when the stock is sold,'' says Ed O'Hanlon,
a certified public accountant in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you hold the stock until you die, the recipient will
get it with a stepped-up basis _ that is, the value of the stock at
your death. If you're not otherwise subject to estate taxes, that
can be a better deal for the person you want to have the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are going to have a large estate,
making a gift of an appreciating asset can be beneficial in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that future appreciation out of your estate,'' says
Bruno Graziano, senior analyst with tax-guide publisher CCH. ``The
appreciation will be taxable to the recipient, but that tax could
be less than the tax your estate might have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   If you give someone a painting, jewelry, or other rarity, you'll
need to have it appraised. ``I would recommend getting three
independent appraisals and going with the middle or average of the
three,'' says Mark Rigotti, a CPA in Taylor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The appraisal value _ which should be the amount for which you
could sell the item on the open market _ is the amount you will
declare on any gift-tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of all: There are no gift taxes on contributions
to qualified charities. Happy donating.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Who besides Dr. Seuss's Grinch would impose a penalty on gift
giving? The U.S. government, of course, which makes sure that the
generous have to worry about not just income taxes but gift taxes
as well.
</P>
<P>
   An unpleasant light was briefly shone on the tax treatment of
gifts last year when baseball fans began wondering aloud whether
someone who gave St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire back his
62nd-home-run ball would be liable for a gift tax.
</P>
<P>
   Proving just how tricky gift-tax rules can be, the IRS made two
different statements within 48 hours about tax liability. At first
the donor owed big time, then he or she was off the hook. The ball
was retrieved by an employee of the Cardinals, ending the debate.
</P>
<P>
   For people making more prosaic gifts, there are still several
considerations to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   If you give any one person a gift worth more than $10,000, you
will have to file a gift-tax return. But that doesn't mean you'll
actually have to pay tax on the gift this year. Instead, the effect
of the gift tax will be to reduce the amount (currently $625,000)
that can be transferred free of estate tax at the time of your
death.
</P>
<P>
   You can give up to $10,000 to an unlimited number of people
without worrying about gift tax. If you're married, you and your
spouse can give $20,000 to any individual without having to file a
gift-tax return, but you must file Form 709 to notify the IRS of
the ``split gift.''
</P>
<P>
   One other goody: There's no limit on the size of your gift if
it's for tuition or medical care. So feel free to pick up the cost
of your grandchild's Ivy League education. You'll want to be sure
to write the check to the institution, though, and not to the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to give a child or other relative non-appreciating
assets, such as cash, instead of appreciating assets like stocks.
Reason: Whoever receives your gift of an appreciating asset will
have the same cost basis that you had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought $1,000 worth of stock that is now worth $7,000,
the recipient of that gift will have to pay income tax on
everything above $1,000 when the stock is sold,'' says Ed O'Hanlon,
a certified public accountant in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you hold the stock until you die, the recipient will
get it with a stepped-up basis _ that is, the value of the stock at
your death. If you're not otherwise subject to estate taxes, that
can be a better deal for the person you want to have the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are going to have a large estate,
making a gift of an appreciating asset can be beneficial in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that future appreciation out of your estate,'' says
Bruno Graziano, senior analyst with tax-guide publisher CCH. ``The
appreciation will be taxable to the recipient, but that tax could
be less than the tax your estate might have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   If you give someone a painting, jewelry, or other rarity, you'll
need to have it appraised. ``I would recommend getting three
independent appraisals and going with the middle or average of the
three,'' says Mark Rigotti, a CPA in Taylor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The appraisal value _ which should be the amount for which you
could sell the item on the open market _ is the amount you will
declare on any gift-tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of all: There are no gift taxes on contributions
to qualified charities. Happy donating.  &LR;  &QL;

FORMER `ARIZONA REPUBLIC' PUBLISHER WALSH DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mason Walsh, a former publisher of ``The Arizona Republic'' and
``The Phoenix'' ``Gazette'' known for his public-spirited
journalism, died Saturday at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn of
complications from pneumonia. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, a music lover who once performed in the Dallas Symphony,
worked for the Phoenix newspapers for more than 20 years, retiring
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In his 46-year journalism career in Texas and Arizona, he
conducted newspaper campaigns against crime and for free medical
forums and polio immunization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mason Walsh was a great force for professionalism in his work
and for public good in the cities where he worked,'' said John F.
Oppedahl, president, publisher and chief executive officer of
Phoenix Newspapers Inc., which publishes ``The Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an effective editor and businessman in his several
roles at Phoenix Newspapers and helped lead the company into the
modern age. He aspired to high standards and met them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he worked tirelessly to make sure that the Valley of the Sun
grew wisely as well as quickly, former Phoenix Mayor Sam Mardian
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He exuded integrity and character,'' Mardian said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Mitchem, director of corporate relations for Northern
Arizona University, said Walsh was dedicated to the public good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a person who had the best interests of the city
and community at heart,'' Mitchem said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchem, who, like Walsh, was a charter member of the Phoenix 40
_ now known as Greater Phoenix Leadership _ said Walsh was
concerned more with the group's accomplishments than with its
image.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Moyer, who did stints as managing editor of ``The Gazette''
and ``The'' ``Republic,'' recalled Walsh as a calm force in the
news operation, a peacemaker who had a deep feeling for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sort of a newsman's publisher,`` Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was born Nov. 27, 1912, in Dallas, into a newspapering
family. One of his great-grandfathers and two of his uncles were
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh got his first newspaper job at the age of 11, delivering
papers for the ``Dallas Times Herald.'' In 1929, he won a cub
reporter job with the ``Dallas'' ``Journal'' and used it to help
pay for his studies at Southern Methodist University.
</P>
<P>
   He majored in political science at SMU and wanted to go to work
for the State Department, but the tight job market caused by the
Depression quashed that plan after he graduated in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Walsh temporarily took up a music career, playing
violin, viola and violoncello in movie and vaudeville theaters, on
the radio, in dance bands, and with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, he returned to reporting, taking a job at the
``Journal.'' He later worked at the ``Dallas Dispatch-Journal,''
which was formed in the merger of two afternoon dailies.
</P>
<P>
   While news editor there, he rushed out an extra on the Dec. 7,
1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, rounding up staffers at home
because the paper didn't normally put out a Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh later was employed by the ``Austin Tribune'' before going
to work with North American Aviation in Dallas, first in public
relations and then as head of employee services.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, he went to work for the ``Dallas Times Herald,'' where
he rose from city editor to managing editor before taking a job as
managing editor of ``The'' ``Gazette'' in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when President Kennedy was assassinated in
Dallas, Walsh used his knowledge of the city to help a ``Gazette''
staff artist put together a map of the shooting site moments after
the story hit the wire services.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he became general manager of ``The Gazette/The
Republic,'' and in 1975 was given the additional job of assistant
publisher. He was named publisher of the papers in 1978, was made
publisher emeritus in 1980, and retired in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gazette'' was closed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was a past president of the Associated Press Managing
Editors organization, and a board member of the Phoenix Symphony
Association and of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Anne; daughter, Peggy, a media
consultant; and sons, Timothy, an attorney, and Kevin, chief of the
Associated Press bureau in Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements will be handled by Messinger Mortuary, 7601 E.
Indian School Road, Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The date and time of services have not been announced, but the
location will be St. Barnabas of the Desert, 6715 N. Mockingbird
Lane, Paradise Valley. &QL;

<P>
   A dead-in-the-water stock investment is no fun. But when you own
more than 17 percent of the stock in question, at least you get to
punish somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when it became clear that the aggressive growth
projections trumpeted by Sunbeam chief Albert Dunlap were just so
much balloon juice, money manager Michael Price demanded Dunlap's
swollen head. And Price's 17.5 million Sunbeam shares ensured that
he got it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about smaller investors? In absolute terms, they may
not have as much at stake as a major player like Price, but their
losses can be just as painful, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   Do they stand a chance of making their voices heard when they
think one of their companies is being mismanaged?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, yes. Just ask Nell Minow, a principal in
Lens, an activist investment fund based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, Lens was the extremely dissatisfied owner of a
tiny percentage of Sears, Roebuck stock. The source of Minow's
discontent: the Sears board, which essentially stood by while the
company frittered away its franchise as Middle America's retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, Lens took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal
accusing Sears's directors, by name, of being ``non-performing
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the ad ran, Sears held its annual meeting, where
a stunningly large percentage of the company's normally docile
stockholders endorsed Minow's plan to return the Big Store to its
retailing roots.
</P>
<P>
   She proposed that the company jettison its Dean Witter
financial-services arm and its Coldwell Banker real-estate unit. In
1993, Sears did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Minow's tactics aren't usually so flashy or brash, but they all
are designed to send the same message. ``Everything I do is to let
the company know that it's being observed,'' says Minow. ``Once
this happens, it reacts differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of effective shareholder activism is that
frontal assaults are rarely successful. ``You have to go through
the back door,'' confirms Amy Domini of Domini Social Investments.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite tactics is to introduce resolutions for
shareholders to consider at a company's annual meeting. The best
resolutions are the ones that promise, if passed, to make
management's lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll file a resolution on a sensitive matter like management
compensation,'' says Domini, ``and only agree to withdraw it if the
company will speak to us about the issues we're really concerned
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite pressure tactic is what's called the 220 demand
letter. Many companies are incorporated in Delaware because of that
state's pro-management legal code. But one key part of the code is
actually a shareholder's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under section 220 of Delaware General Corporation Law, investors
can, upon written request, inspect the books and records of any
company whose stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Lens recently played the 220 card against Juno Lighting, a
company in which Lens holds 721,000 shares. Concerned about the
dearth of outsiders on the company's board, Lens had for months
pressed Juno to appoint several outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   Juno agreed, but the effort proceeded slowly until Minow fired
off a 220 letter demanding to see all records pertaining to the
company's search. Juno subsequently opened a line of communication
with Lens, but Minow hasn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management's credibility is questionable,'' she says, ``and I
am currently drafting a shareholder proposal and preparing for a
proxy fight in case they don't keep their promises. As Reagan said,
`Trust, but verify.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minow expects shareholders to become even more aggressive about
defending their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is not just about being smart in finding value
anymore,'' she says. ``It's also about being smart in creating
value.'' And if creating value means playing rough sometimes, hey,
that's business.  &LR;  &QL;

   Fed up, Lens took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal
accusing Sears's directors, by name, of being ``non-performing
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the ad ran, Sears held its annual meeting, where
a stunningly large percentage of the company's normally docile
stockholders endorsed Minow's plan to return the Big Store to its
retailing roots.
</P>
<P>
   She proposed that the company jettison its Dean Witter
financial-services arm and its Coldwell Banker real-estate unit. In
1993, Sears did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Minow's tactics aren't usually so flashy or brash, but they all
are designed to send the same message. ``Everything I do is to let
the company know that it's being observed,'' says Minow. ``Once
this happens, it reacts differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of effective shareholder activism is that
frontal assaults are rarely successful. ``You have to go through
the back door,'' confirms Amy Domini of Domini Social Investments.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite tactics is to introduce resolutions for
shareholders to consider at a company's annual meeting. The best
resolutions are the ones that promise, if passed, to make
management's lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll file a resolution on a sensitive matter like management
compensation,'' says Domini, ``and only agree to withdraw it if the
company will speak to us about the issues we're really concerned
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite pressure tactic is what's called the 220 demand
letter. Many companies are incorporated in Delaware because of that
state's pro-management legal code. But one key part of the code is
actually a shareholder's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under section 220 of Delaware General Corporation Law, investors
can, upon written request, inspect the books and records of any
company whose stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Lens recently played the 220 card against Juno Lighting, a
company in which Lens holds 721,000 shares. Concerned about the
dearth of outsiders on the company's board, Lens had for months
pressed Juno to appoint several outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   Juno agreed, but the effort proceeded slowly until Minow fired
off a 220 letter demanding to see all records pertaining to the
company's search. Juno subsequently opened a line of communication
with Lens, but Minow hasn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management's credibility is questionable,'' she says, ``and I
am currently drafting a shareholder proposal and preparing for a
proxy fight in case they don't keep their promises. As Reagan said,
`Trust, but verify.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minow expects shareholders to become even more aggressive about
defending their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is not just about being smart in finding value
anymore,'' she says. ``It's also about being smart in creating
value.'' And if creating value means playing rough sometimes, hey,
that's business.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   It is hard to imagine Jordan without King Hussein _ or so runs
the old saw. He has dominated the country for 46 years, first as
authoritarian ruler, more recently as a hands-on constitutional
monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of ten of his subjects were born during his reign. He
is the one symbol that all Jordanians, rich and poor, secular and
religious, Palestinian refugees and indigenous citizens, have in
common.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jordan will lose its king, and probably sooner rather than
later. King Hussein himself implied as much by coming home for a
few days to attend to the succession, before unexpectedly rushing
back to America this week for more medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Only 63, he could now be facing a fourth bout of cancer, and the
choice of an heir is clearly on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Hassan, had served loyally as crown prince since
1964, when the king's oldest son, Abdullah, was still a baby. But
King Hussein had long made it clear that he would like the crown
eventually to pass to one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, in unnecessarily humiliating fashion, the king
demoted Hassan and elevated Abdullah as heir by royal decree.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem: as with every detail of his reign,
King Hussein managed the change personally. Although Jordan is
theoretically a constitutional monarchy, neither the Jordanian
people, nor their representatives in parliament, had any say over
the selection of their future king.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution does state that the king's eldest son will
succeed him. But King Hussein had had it altered in favor of Hassan
before, and many thought he might fix it again to install one of
his younger sons.
</P>
<P>
   At no point, apparently, did King Hussein consult anyone. As
always, he knew best.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, King Hussein often does know best. His stewardship
has seen Jordan develop from an artificial, divided and fragile
polity into a reasonably stable, united and well-governed country.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the despots of neighboring Arab countries, King
Hussein is a model of benign and competent rule.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, too, shows every sign of benevolence and ability,
albeit in his rather sheltered career in the army. But Jordan's
luck cannot last forever. Good rulers, history shows, do not grow
on family trees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of agonizing over which of Jordan's many princes should
succeed him, King Hussein should be making sure that the country's
institutions are strong enough to make the choice irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the king has concentrated power in his own hands.
Although he introduced some democracy in 1989 after decades of
martial law, he has taken care to rein in debate and preserve his
ultimate authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a weighted electoral law, parliament is dominated by
tribal elders fiercely loyal to the king. The main opposition party
boycotted the last elections in protest, and so has been excluded
from political debate.
</P>
<P>
   The press, too, has been brought to heel by a law that forbids,
in effect, any criticism of the king or his strategy of alliance
with America and peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Before the king's illness, Jordan's unions and professional
associations, which are among the few remaining bastions of
independent political power, had also been under attack.
</P>
<P>
   And one reason for the humbling of poor Prince Hassan was that,
while acting as regent, he had tried to make some military
appointments without consulting the controller-in-chief on his
sickbed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps King Hussein believes that by bequeathing a blend of
strong royal rule and limited democracy he will increase his
dynasty's chances of survival. But he himself has had trouble
imposing this system in the face of public protest, and the chances
that any successor would handle dissent as adroitly are slim.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for Jordan's monarchy, and the best future for its
people, lies in the king gradually handing over most of his powers
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein should spend whatever remains of his reign making
himself dispensable. Otherwise, the old axiom notwithstanding, it
is not so hard to imagine what will become of his heirs. &QL;

<P>
   &QL; 
AZ-GOP (Phoenix) _ The Arizona Republican Party voted unanimously
Saturday to recommend leaving the state's presidential party
primary unchanged, rejecting a plan to move it from mid-February to
March 14. Many of the 400 delegates believe the proposal to hold a
later
</P>
<P>
   primary was floated to help presidential hopeful John McCain
avoid an early showdown with Steve Forbes in McCain's own state. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RIMSZA (Phoenix) _ Smiles, speeches, photos, handshakes _ they are
daily rituals for Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza. He reads The Three
Little Javelinas to first-graders, explains later how he saved the
name of the Phoenix Coyotes, then zips off to a reception with the
governor.Rimsza seems always on the go. But even his friends are
beginning to ask where he's headed _ whether he's more concerned
with stoking the city's image than taking on weighty problems. City
Council members and neighborhood leaders worry that he is standing
idly by while urban sprawl goes unchecked and the municipal transit
system remains one of the worst for a city its size in the country.
BY CHRIS FISCUS. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WALSH (scottsdale) Mason Walsh, a former publisher of The
Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette known for his
public-spirited journalism, died Saturday at Scottsdale Healthcare
Osborn of complications from pneumonia. He was 86. By CHUCK KELLY.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIGLEY (Higley, Ariz.) _ Frustrated with the red tape preventing
their protests from reaching Gilbert Town Council, Higley residents
on Saturday decided to think pink. Ed Welsh and about 35 of his
neighbors painted a 50-foot wall a shade of pink _ a hot color to
match their moods. They are fighting mad at a Shea Homes proposal
to turn 273 acres of farmland into 768 cookie-cutter homes, 3.7
homes per acre. By JAIMEE ROSE. Story will move in the ``A''

them to the highest bidder.

itself out of existence (and its lawyers will jealously guard its

</P>
<P>
   Nor are sponsorship and other contracts _ in 1995 the IOC
concluded television deals worth more than $5.1 billion over the
succeeding 13 years _ about to be torn up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the arguments are flawed. When it is genuine,
amateurism makes sport the preserve of the rich; when it is phoney
(as in the pre-Samaranch era), it pays athletes less than they
should rightfully get.
</P>
<P>
   As for a straightforward auction, that would merely ensure the
games were forever held in the rich world, where the television
audience has bigger pockets and the sponsors are better rewarded
for their investment.
</P>
<P>
   The better answer is not to recreate the system but to reform
it. That must involve more than the handful of IOC expulsions
recommended by the committee's leaders last weekend, and more than
the proposed establishment of an independent ethics committee and a
small team, both with non-IOC members, to visit candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
   Other rules could be added, such as one stipulating a rotation
of the games between continents. But what is really needed is a
change in the IOC's composition.
</P>
<P>
   Because its members serve, without pay, until the age of 80, the
present mix of businessmen, former athletes, retired politicians
and sundry aristocrats is a recipe for quid-pro-quo cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Better to have members elected by national sporting
organizations (rather than, as now, nominated by each other), paid

two cycles of the Olympic calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it time to lift sanctions on Iraq? On the face of it, the
answer must be no.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since the Gulf war, yet Saddam Hussein
is still in power in Iraq, still oppressing his people, still
shooting at the American and British warplanes that try to contain
him, still hiding some of the arms, or the wherewithal for making
them, that the U.N. Security Council said he should give up before
the trade embargo would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Simply to abandon sanctions now would be to hand victory to
Hussein and to give him a free hand to rebuild his arsenal of
chemical, nuclear and biological weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a change in policy is required, and at least some sanctions
should indeed be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A change is needed for two reasons. One is that over the past
year the impediments placed by Iraq before the U.N. inspectors
monitoring the weapons made their job virtually impossible, and now
they have been thrown out. The most useful check on Hussein is thus
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is that the old policy has come to be seen as
inflicting appalling suffering on 20 million or more innocent
Iraqis and not much on their guilty, and unelected, masters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Iraq is allowed to sell some oil and spend the proceeds,
under U.N. supervision, on food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies, once deductions have been made to compensate Iraq's
victims and pay the U.N.'s expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedures are cumbersome, Iraq's dilapidated equipment
is unable to pump even as much oil as it is allowed to sell, and
Hussein is too often able to present his people's plight as the
fault of sanctions, rather than of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Four days of air strikes last month served to strengthen the
feeling, by no means confined to the Arab world, that the Iraqi
people have suffered enough.
</P>
<P>
   It is an iron law that the longer any sanctions regime is in
place, the harder it is to enforce it. Already the trade embargo is
widely breached _ even, where Turkey is involved, with a nod and
wink from the United States, supposedly its fiercest upholder.
</P>
<P>
   But the breaches bring no benefits to most Iraqis. Their misery,
coupled with the other manifest failures of the present policy,
make it likely that the existing sanctions will be increasingly
disregarded if the policy is not changed.
</P>
<P>
   True, the U.N.'s arms monitors want no lifting of sanctions,
and, perhaps less predictably, the Arab League, meeting on Jan. 24,
likewise gave Hussein no encouragement. But Arabs feel much more
sympathy for Iraqis than for their leader, and even Saudi Arabia
has recently floated ideas about a change in sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   France, too, has made some new suggestions. Russia and China
have long been critical, and the skeptics' corner of the Security
Council has just been strengthened by the arrival of Malaysia and
Namibia as temporary members.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the pressure for change, the new prime minister of
Turkey, which has in the past allowed its territory to be used for
strikes against Iraq, has warned America not necessarily to count
on its continued support.
</P>
<P>
   In so far as a new consensus is emerging, it is a sensible one:
that the pressure should be relaxed on Iraqis at large but
maintained, or if possible intensified, on the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how. The French proposals seem to offer a
possible way. If, regrettably, the U.N.'s weapons inspectors cannot
resume their work, forget about them and the blanket trade embargo;
instead set up a new outfit to monitor all sites that have already
been inspected and enforce an embargo only on weapons, on imports
that could be used to make weapons, and on related financial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not free from objections. One is that Hussein might veto
it. Yet the fact that the plan would have the support of many, if
not most, of his traditional friends would make his opposition less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   More probable is that he would grudgingly accept it, but then
try to frustrate it. In that event, the customary response _ air
strikes against military objectives _ would always be available;
they might even win wider support than in the past, given that he
would be even more unambiguously seen as the reason for them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the main objection is the difficulty and expense of
operating a system that would involve monitors at the borders of
Iraq, who would have to check everything going in and out. Some
forbidden imports would inevitably get through.
</P>
<P>
   If the oil price stays low, such a plan might put little more
money in Iraq's coffers, and make only a small difference to
ordinary Iraqis. But it would deny their true oppressor a
propaganda weapon, and it would preserve the essential ingredient
of current policy, which is the containment of Saddam. &QL;

chemical, nuclear and biological weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a change in policy is required, and at least some sanctions
should indeed be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A change is needed for two reasons. One is that over the past
year the impediments placed by Iraq before the U.N. inspectors
monitoring the weapons made their job virtually impossible, and now
they have been thrown out. The most useful check on Hussein is thus
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is that the old policy has come to be seen as
inflicting appalling suffering on 20 million or more innocent
Iraqis and not much on their guilty, and unelected, masters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Iraq is allowed to sell some oil and spend the proceeds,
under U.N. supervision, on food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies, once deductions have been made to compensate Iraq's
victims and pay the U.N.'s expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedures are cumbersome, Iraq's dilapidated equipment
is unable to pump even as much oil as it is allowed to sell, and
Hussein is too often able to present his people's plight as the
fault of sanctions, rather than of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Four days of air strikes last month served to strengthen the
feeling, by no means confined to the Arab world, that the Iraqi
people have suffered enough.
</P>
<P>
   It is an iron law that the longer any sanctions regime is in
place, the harder it is to enforce it. Already the trade embargo is
widely breached _ even, where Turkey is involved, with a nod and
wink from the United States, supposedly its fiercest upholder.
</P>
<P>
   But the breaches bring no benefits to most Iraqis. Their misery,
coupled with the other manifest failures of the present policy,
make it likely that the existing sanctions will be increasingly
disregarded if the policy is not changed.
</P>
<P>
   True, the U.N.'s arms monitors want no lifting of sanctions,
and, perhaps less predictably, the Arab League, meeting on Jan. 24,
likewise gave Hussein no encouragement. But Arabs feel much more
sympathy for Iraqis than for their leader, and even Saudi Arabia
has recently floated ideas about a change in sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   France, too, has made some new suggestions. Russia and China
have long been critical, and the skeptics' corner of the Security
Council has just been strengthened by the arrival of Malaysia and
Namibia as temporary members.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the pressure for change, the new prime minister of
Turkey, which has in the past allowed its territory to be used for
strikes against Iraq, has warned America not necessarily to count
on its continued support.
</P>
<P>
   In so far as a new consensus is emerging, it is a sensible one:
that the pressure should be relaxed on Iraqis at large but
maintained, or if possible intensified, on the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how. The French proposals seem to offer a
possible way. If, regrettably, the U.N.'s weapons inspectors cannot
resume their work, forget about them and the blanket trade embargo;
instead set up a new outfit to monitor all sites that have already
been inspected and enforce an embargo only on weapons, on imports
that could be used to make weapons, and on related financial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not free from objections. One is that Hussein might veto
it. Yet the fact that the plan would have the support of many, if
not most, of his traditional friends would make his opposition less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   More probable is that he would grudgingly accept it, but then
try to frustrate it. In that event, the customary response _ air
strikes against military objectives _ would always be available;
they might even win wider support than in the past, given that he
would be even more unambiguously seen as the reason for them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the main objection is the difficulty and expense of
operating a system that would involve monitors at the borders of
Iraq, who would have to check everything going in and out. Some
forbidden imports would inevitably get through.
</P>
<P>
   If the oil price stays low, such a plan might put little more
money in Iraq's coffers, and make only a small difference to
ordinary Iraqis. But it would deny their true oppressor a
propaganda weapon, and it would preserve the essential ingredient
of current policy, which is the containment of Saddam. &QL;

   Is it time to lift sanctions on Iraq? On the face of it, the
answer must be no.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since the Gulf war, yet Saddam Hussein
is still in power in Iraq, still oppressing his people, still
shooting at the American and British warplanes that try to contain
him, still hiding some of the arms, or the wherewithal for making
them, that the U.N. Security Council said he should give up before
the trade embargo would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Simply to abandon sanctions now would be to hand victory to
Hussein and to give him a free hand to rebuild his arsenal of

Taylor gets fitting spot among elite
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ Lawrence Taylor told the media he deserved to be elected to
the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and it seems they agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants linebacker was elected Saturday. Joining him
will be running back Eric Dickerson, also a first-year candidate,
tight end Ozzie Newsome, and offensive linemen Tom Mack and Bill
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor clearly deserved the election based on a 13-year career
that included one league Most Valuable Player honor, three
Defensive Player of the Year titles and 10 Pro Bowls. But his
actions off the field caused some to question whether he deserved
the honor. Taylor has been arrested twice since retirement,
including a drug possession charge last September. He was suspended
once during his career for violating the league's substance-abuse
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Another whose career was unequaled was Dickerson, a Sealy native
and former SMU running back who came into the NFL with the Los
Angeles Rams and also played with the Indianapolis Colts, the Los
Angeles Raiders and Atlanta Falcons. Dickerson set a single-season
rushing record of 2,105 yards in 1984. He ranks third on the career
rushing list with 13,259 yards in 11 years. His career was cut
short because of a neck injury in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dickerson's lasting memories is facing Taylor during his
rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing the Giants and they told me to cut Lawrence
Taylor,'' Dickerson said. ``And I said, `OK.' I didn't want to do
that, but it was my job. So I cut him, and when he got up, he said,
`Don't ever cut me again.' I went back to the sidelines and said,
`That man said don't ever cut me again.' They called the play
again, and I said, `Put some other guy in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson said he expects his records to fall, most likely to
Denver's Terrell Davis, who rushed for 2,008 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, it seems someone gets closer and closer,'' he
said. ``If someone breaks my records, I'll be happy for him because
then you guys (media) will have to say something about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson was a No. 1 pick, second overall after John Elway in
the 1983 draft. He holds the rookie rushing record with 1,808 yards
and 18 touchdowns. Dickerson was the NFL Player of the Year in 1984
and Offensive Player of the Year in '86. He played in six Pro
Bowls, but never made it to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my Super Bowl right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's legal problems did not fall under any category of the
football bylaws, which contain no ``good citizenship'' clause.
Though there was plenty of debate, Taylor received the necessary 80
percent vote (of 36 voting members).
</P>
<P>
   And though he has granted interviews all week to lobby on his
behalf, Taylor was the only one of the five electees who was unable
to meet with the media. Taylor was in Florida for the filming of an
Oliver Stone movie and the shooting schedule didn't allow interview
time, Hall of Fame officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did release a written statement: ``I appreciate the
debate and the consideration that was given to my nomination.
Ultimately, this honor has to do with how I played the game.
Obviously, the majority of the committee felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsome holds a tight end receiving record with 662 catches for
7,980 yards and 47 touchdowns in 13 seasons with the Cleveland
Browns. Newsome, who retired in 1990, was a finalist last year, but
was not selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the longer it takes to get in, the more you appreciate
it,'' Newsome said. ``Not getting in in the first year, not even
making it into the final 15, I began to really appreciate just what
making it into the Hall of Fame means.''
</P>
<P>
   And making it this year is special for the lifetime Cleveland
Brown. The Browns will resume play this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the opportunity to go in when the Browns are going
back on the football field is a double whammy,'' he said. ``It
makes it more special for myself. I'm a Cleveland Brown. I wore
that orange helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack played 13 seasons as a guard with the Los Angeles Rams.
Selected to play in 11 Pro Bowls, Mack never missed a game to
injury, anchoring the Rams' offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, another guard, made the Hall of Fame as a senior candidate
in his final year of eligibility. Shaw was selected to play in
eight AFL All-Star Games and played on Bills championship teams in
1964 and '65.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates, defensive end Howie Long and wide receiver
Lynn Swann, were finalists but were not selected. They will
automatically be finalists next year.

A&AMP;M lets Oklahoma State off the hook
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
STILLWATER, Okla. _ Texas A&AMP;M had a chance to pull off its biggest
upset of the season Saturday at Oklahoma State, but that
opportunity vanished down the stretch when the Aggies failed to
score in the last 4{ minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made up an 11-point halftime deficit and took
control in the final seconds to earn a 66-61 victory in front of
6,270 fans at Gallagher-Iba Arena.
</P>
<P>
   A dunk by center Joe White gave A&AMP;M a 61-60 lead with 4:31 to go
and left OSU without two of its starters. Desmond Mason, the Big
12's top scorer, fouled White for his fifth foul, and center Alex
Webber had fouled out three minutes earlier. But the Aggies
couldn't take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M (9-9 overall and 2-6 in Big 12 play) trailed 62-61 after OSU
forward Adrian Peterson made a one-handed jumper as he drove the
baseline with 2:15 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team would make another shot the rest of the way, but
the Aggies had a chance to take the lead when they got the ball
back with 24.2 second left, still trailing 62-61.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M called timeout to set up a play, hoping to get the ball
inside to Shanne Jones. But point guard Clifton Cook had to take a
difficult 10-foot jumper from the baseline that bounced off the
rim. A&AMP;M forward Michael Schmidt leaped in the lane and tried to
tip it in, but the ball rolled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure (the tip) was going in,'' Schmidt said.
``But the ball just rolled in and out over the hoop. When it came
out, it broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Montonati grabbed the rebound, his 10th of the half and
11th of the game, and was fouled by Cook with 3.3 seconds to go.
Montonati made both free throws to put OSU in front 64-61.
</P>
<P>
   White attempted to make a full-court pass on the inbounds play,
but the ball hit the scoreboard that hangs over midcourt, giving
OSU possession.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Adkins, who was the top scorer for the Cowboys with 18
points, was fouled on the inbounds play and made the last two free
throws for OSU (15-5, 6-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances, but we just couldn't close it out at the
end,'' said A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins. ``Oklahoma State picked up
their intensity in the second half and did what they had to do. We
hoped we could withstand their run, but we got a little careless
and had some turnovers that were unforced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies entered the game with a two-game winning streak, but
they had a season-high 30 turnovers, including 10 by Cook. But Cook
also had 23 points, eight rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, the basket just wouldn't cooperate for us,'' Cook
said. ``We didn't get those last couple of shots we needed. It's
real frustrating because we had them in the same situation at our
place (a 64-59 win by OSU). But we're confident now that we can win
against good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statistical quirk that would qualify for a ``Believe it or
Not'' book, the Aggies had 16 turnovers in the first half and still
led 40-29.

HIGLEY STAGE PINK PROTEST TO FIGHT DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGLEY, Ariz. _ Frustrated with the red tape preventing their
protests from reaching Gilbert Town Council, Higley residents on
Saturday decided to think pink.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Welsh and about 35 of his neighbors painted a 50-foot wall a
shade of hot pink _ a color to match their moods.
</P>
<P>
   They are fighting mad at a Shea Homes proposal to turn 273 acres
of farmland into 768 cookie-cutter homes, 3.7 homes per acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our Boston Tea Party,'' said Jim Staples, a Higley
resident of 20 years who helped coat the wall with a pink paint
plea. ``We're not trying to stop progress, we just want it
controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh's decidedly pink wall faces the pasture in question.
</P>
<P>
   The bright block beacon conveys the group's opposition to the
proposed Gilbert annexation and rezoning case that would make
Higley a rural county island surrounded by dense development.
</P>
<P>
   Since the land is currently under Maricopa County jurisdiction
and zoned as rural residential, like Welsh's land, meaning
approximately one house per acre is allowed, Gilbert must annex and
rezone the land for Shea to begin construction.
</P>
<P>
   This move would triple the size of the Higley School District,
turn Welsh's residential road into a six-lane straightaway, and put
an end to the quiet life Higley homeowners enjoy, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are not official Gilbert citizens, Higley residents
have no voting power in deciding the future of their surrounding
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Staples said that the group would be appeased if the farmland
was built upon under the current, more rural zoning. He also thinks
that Higley residents deserve a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the town) is going to take this (land), they should take
us as well,'' he said. ``Nobody will stand up for the people out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gilbert Councilman Phil Long is ready to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hear all sides,'' he said, ``and the fence
certainly would attract attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Welsh's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the colors on that wall are loud enough to be seen all
the way to the state Capitol,'' he said. ``Give us some respect.
Give us a voice.'' &QL;

Cold front stalls over frostbitten Tech
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ A winter weather system brought subfreezing temperatures
and snow to this part of West Texas overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, a different type of cold front blew through
the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum, bringing with it a fourth
consecutive defeat for Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders made five of their first six shots to take a
quick 12-7 lead before suffering through a painful 12-minute
stretch during which they made just 1 of 15 shot attempts and had
nine turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma took advantage, outscoring Tech 25-3 over that time, en
route to ending its own four-game losing streak with a 72-54 Big 12
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tech cut the Sooners' lead, which ballooned to 22 points at one
point, down to nine midway through the second half, but Oklahoma
pulled away again to give the Red Raiders their worst home loss of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners' top three scorers matched the Red Raiders' total,
as again Tech struggled offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Tech, which was playing its third straight game without shooting
guard Stan Bonewitz, was only 9-for-31 from the field in the first
half (29 percent). The Red Raiders are averaging 54.5 points a game
during the losing streak, and have dropped below the .500 mark for
the first time this season to 10-11 overall and 2-6 in the
conference.
</P>

   ``It's really difficult for us to run our offense without him
because Stan creates so many problems for a defense, and we play so
well together,'' Tech point guard Rayford Young said of his
backcourt mate. ``But I'll take the (blame) for this loss. I missed
a big shot that could have broke the momentum in the first half and
then I missed some big free throws. I believe those were the big
turning points of the game.''

   Young, Tech's leading scorer at 14.3 points a game, had another
poor night from the field (5-of-14). In the three games Bonewitz
has sat out after having hernia surgery, Young is shooting 37.8
percent from the floor (14-of-37).

   The 5-11 junior missed three 3-pointers during the fateful
first-half stretch, but he was far from the lone Red Raider to
struggle. Oklahoma switched from its man-to-man defense to a
trapping 1-3-1 zone, and the Red Raiders did not adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every time Tech did get a good look inside, Ryan Humphrey
was there to block the shot. The 6-8 sophomore scored 15 points on
5-of-6 shooting, but was an even bigger factor on defense with five
blocked shots.

<P>
   ``It seemed like he blocked about 15 shots,'' Oklahoma coach
Kelvin Sampson said. ``If he didn't block more than five, he
certainly altered a lot more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The more shots the Red Raiders missed, the more tentative they
became.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think really the problem was all five guys on the floor were
waiting for the other ones to take charge and get us a big
bucket,'' Tech forward Cliff Owens said. ``We really looked kind of
stagnant. I don't think we got the ball inside-out like we need to,
to get some open shots for the guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't execute, point blank. I don't think it was
anything Oklahoma did, although they played hard and are very good
defensively, but we just didn't execute on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech, which trailed 37-24 at the half, trailed 48-26 with about
15 minutes to play after Eric Martin hit one of his five
3-pointers. Martin led all scorers with 26 points on 9-of-14
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, Oklahoma's offense went into a
turnover-plagued, five-minute scoreless stretch, while Tech's got
into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ellis, Owens and Mario Layne each scored consecutive
baskets and Jevon Banks hit two free throws to account for a 12-1
burst for the Red Raiders to cut the lead to 49-40 with 9:40
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Tech would get no closer. Oklahoma made nine straight free
throws down the stretch, while Tech misfired on the front end of
two one-and-one opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners, who closed with a 16-8 run, improved to 14-7 and
5-3 in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game we needed to win for a smorgasbord of
reasons,'' Sampson said, ``not just for getting back into the
conference race and not just for to get off that 13 number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really practiced hard this week and this was an important
game. This game gives us some validation. Every time you lose at
home you need two road wins to replace that. So this does not
replace the loss to Texas (last Monday). We have to win at Baylor
on Wednesday to do that.''
