<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Russian
communists and nationalists gathered here today to show their
support for communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in the presidential
election on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The rally at a Moscow sports hall was organized by the Congress
of the Bloc of National Patriotic Forces, which brought together
more than 200 parties and movements to support Zyuganov, who is
running as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov told the rally, "We will confidently march to the
future, not to the past." He also called for a just and fair
election to be held.

His nationalist ally Aman Tuleyev used the occasion to announce
that he would withdraw from the presidential campaign on June 12

<HEADLINE> Sales, Profits of Japan's Shipbuilders to Rise: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Five out of Japan's top six
shipbuilders are likely to see bigger sales and profits in fiscal
1996 up to March next year, a business daily said today.
</P>
<P>
The companies are expected to increase exports, particularly to
Southeast Asian countries, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the increase of sales and profits to the
companies' robust performance despite stiffer competition from
South Korean rivals, rationalization measures and the correction
of the dollar's fall against the yen.
</P>
<P>
On an unconsolidated basis, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
is expected to have its biggest-ever pretax profit of 175
billion yen (1.60 billion U.S. dollars), up five percent from
fiscal 1995, on sales of 2.7 trillion yen (248 billion dollars),
two percent higher than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Record pretax profit is also anticipated at Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd., up 18 percent to 32 billion yen (293 million
dollars), with sales at 1.0 trillion yen (9.17 billion dollars), a
five percent rise, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Another company seen likely to post a record profit this fiscal
year is Hitachi Zosen Corp. Its pretax profit is projected to
grow 15 percent to 30 billion yen (275 million dollars) on sales
of 500 billion yen (4.59 billion dollars), up eight percent from
last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co. is predicted to rake in
a pretax profit of 3.5 billion yen (32 million dollars), up eight
percent, while sales are seen to rise 24 percent to 360 billion
yen (3.30 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.'s pretax profit is projected to
jump 57 percent to four billion yen (36.7 million dollars), with
sales up 13 percent to 310 billion yen (2.84 billion dollars), the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, IHI, whose delivery dates for its
environmental plants and industrial boilers come after March, is
likely to see pretax profit fall 11 percent to 22 billion yen (202
million dollars) in fiscal 1996, and sales dip three percent to
830 billion yen (7.61 billion dollars).

and I am not in medal shape."

<HEADLINE> Bildt Favors Bosnian Election On Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO,June 8 (Xinhua) -- The international community's High
Representative to Bosnia, Carl Bildt, favors holding elections in
Bosnia as scheduled, even though it is a flawed one.
</P>
<P>
There are two schools of thought in Western countries with
regard to the elections which should be held no later than
September 14 under the Dayton agreement, said Colum Murphy,
spokesman for Bildt, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One school believes the elections should be postponed if
conditions such as freedom of movement and equal access to media
do no exist, while the other insists on carrying out elections.
</P>
<P>
"The high representative leans towards the school that
elections are better than on elections," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that if elections were delayed, the establishment
of common institutions to overcome partition in Bosnia would also
be postponed, which is "more damaging to the peace process".
</P>
<P>
But he did not explain how the partition can be overcome if the
nationalist parties advocating ethnic separation are elected, as
many observers here believe will be the case in the upcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
a special international conference in Florence, Italy, next
week, will decide the date for the election.

<HEADLINE> US Modem Maker Enters Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The US Hayes Computer Telecom
Co,. the second largest modem maker in the world, will set up a
representative office in Beijing late this month, its chairman,
Dennis Hayes, announced today.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the world, the Hayes modems are widely used
as the link between personal computers and Internet and other
regional computer networks, the chairman said, and China is
expected to be the next major consumer of Hayes products for its
growing market potential for data telecom products.
</P>
<P>
According to industrial analysts here, Hayes' confidence mostly
comes from the decision of Chinese government to open Internet
service nationwide by the end of this month. The Chinanet, the
Chinese branch of Internet, first opened to public service last
June in several major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, will
extend its coverage to 30 provincial and regional capitals across
the country this time.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Chinanet, the country has launched two
national public data telecom networks, the China Packet Exchange
Data Network (Chinapac) and Digital and Data Network (DDN), and
more than 10 special networks of this kind.
</P>
<P>
China's data telecom industry will see a fast growth over the
next five years, with the scale of public and special networks
further expanding, and number of individual users greatly
increasing, Hayes noted.
</P>
<P>
He promised to bring more advanced products and technologies to
China, so as to enhance its leading position on the emerging
market for data telecom business. Also, the establishing of
maintenance centers in major Chinese cities will be another task
for Hayes this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the company scored a 50 percent increase in its
sales on the Chinese market.

MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 Russian soccer fans were
denied by the British embassy in Moscow to enter Britian for
cheering on their team during the European championships opening

<P>
DAMASCUS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Syria, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia pledged here today their commitment to realize a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a communique released upon the conclusion of the two-day
summit, Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz said that
their commitment is a strategic option that also necessitates
Israel's serious adherence to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the only way for realizing peace
demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, south
Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian lands, the foremost of which
is Arab Jerusalem, in implementation of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242, 336 and 425.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that the land-for-peace formula is the basis
for materializing peace in the region. They agreed to hold a
summit conference in Cairo on June 21-23 for more Arab
consultations and coordination in view of the new situation in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Mubarak will extend invitations to the
Arab parties to attend the projected summit conference.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders, who began their meeting here Friday to
discuss the effect of the political change in Israel on the Middle
East peace process, also urged the international community,
especially the co-sponsors of the peace process, to continue their
support for the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
The leaders renewed their call for clearing the Middle East of
weapons of mass destruction, mainly nuclear weapons, and again
urged Israel to join the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, the three leaders discussed the
effects of last month's election of Israeli rightwing Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We have come here for the sake of peace ... We're for peace,
not for surrender or submission," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the three leaders also called for
strengthening Arab solidarity and closing Arab ranks.

third day of the Beijing international basketball challenge here

</P>
<P>
Hu's last 3-pointer put China ahead 92-87 before Darryl Johnson

who edged Brazil 98-96 on Friday, from their first defeat in three
outings at the four-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
Later Saturday night, Brazil overcame a slow start to routed
the winless Chinese 555 union team 109-74.

The Brazilians, a 88-76 winner over China on Thursday, finished
second after the U.S. All-Stars. China came in third with points
difference in the three-day preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, Brazil will play the U.S. All-Stars for the

"The Chinese team shot the ball exceptional well while our
defense was not so good since we are far more tired after climbing
the Great Wall in the morning," said the American coach Mike Deane
at the post-game press conference.

<P>
The Chinese team was 8-16 from the arc while the Americans made
only five long range goals from 17 attempts.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Mobile Phone Firms Warned to Drop Unfair Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's leading mobile phone
companies have been told to drop unfair terms in their contracts
or face legal action by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT),
the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
OFT Director General John Bridgeman said the contracts took
advantage of customers' lack of familiarity with the service and
were unfairly weighted in favour of the companies.
</P>
<P>
He said he would seek an injunction preventing the use of the
contracts if the companies did not agree to drop the unfair terms.
</P>
<P>
Contract terms are probably the biggest cause for complaints by
Britain's 5 million mobile phone users, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some customers who have not read the small print in the
contracts can find themselves locked into paying for a mobile
service for as long as 15 months, even if they are dissatisfied
with the phones' poor geographical coverage or other drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
The mobile companies include subsidiaries of British Telecom
and all four cellular network operators -- Cellnet, Vodafone,
Orange and mercury One-2-One. The others, Astec Communications,
Motorola Tel-co, the Peoples Phone Company and Unique Air, in
effect sell air time on the big network but are allowed to have
their own tariff packages and contracts.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Association welcomed Bridgeman's "firm and
public stand," saying that only the OFT could take effective
action against mobile phone service providers.
</P>
<P>
The move was also hailed by Oftel, an agency which receives
about 4,000 complaints a year about mobile phones but is powerless
to act if a customer has signed a contract.
</P>
<P>
The industry, however, expressed surprised at the OFT
statement, since discussions on improving contracts were already
underway, the Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies agreed that improvements in presentation
and clarity could be made, but they rejected the OFT's criticism
of long initial contracts, pointing out that they had to be able
to recover the subsidies on hand sets.
</P>
<P>
A phone sold for 10 pounds (15 US dollars) to the subscriber
actually costs the service provider about 300 pounds (450 US
dollars), they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Public health supervision
enforcement has an irreplaceable social function, embodying the
government's protection of people's proper rights and demand for
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
This understanding was indicated by Yin Dakui, vice minister of
Public Health at a national public health supervision working
conference opened today in the coastal city in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
More effort will be put into finding harmful factors for
people's health, and working for measures to prevent and control
the factors. The measures will resort to administrative forces to
take effect, said Yin Dakui.
</P>
<P>
The supervision activities are a kind of governmental behavior,
aiming at guaranteeing and protecting public health, emphasised
Yin.
</P>
<P>
China should expand coverage of the supervision up to 100
percent, focus supervision on foodstuff, cosmetics and in
operation areas producing poisonous matters, and strengthen the
enforcement of the measures, said Yin Dakui.

<HEADLINE> Cost-cutting Toyota Buys More Parts Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's largest automaker Toyota
Motor Corp. is stepping up procurement of parts overseas to cut
costs, Kyodo reported today.
</P>
<P>
The company's procurement costs have declined by about 20
percent in the past four years, the report said. This is
equivalent to a reduction of prime costs by tens of billions of
yen or more, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Toyota is using a computer system to compare prices of
necessary components on a global basis. Data on more than 40,000
kinds of U.S. auto parts, for example, can be retrieved in an
instant, Kyodo quoted company officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since August 1995, the Toyota database has stored information
on prices of parts supplied by U.S., European, Australian and
other foreign as well as domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Toyota has used this system to buy 5.69 billion U.S. dollars
worth of U.S.-made auto parts in the fiscal year ending March
1995, up 22 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
With a similar cost-cutting step taken by Japan's second biggest
automaker, Nissan Motor Co., analysts here said that the inflow of
foreign parts is expected to affect domestic parts makers.

BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Thailand's ruling partner

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Ensures Hospitalization to The Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's hospitals will reserve 20
percent of their beds for the poor, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a conference on health care for the
poor held here on June 5-6, VNA said.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 million Vietnamese -- 20 percent of the population --
live below the poverty line, and nearly four million of them live
in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
Poor people occupy between 40-50 percent of Vietnam's hospital
beds, though 73 percent of all the poor usually treat themselves
when they fall ill, statistics show. Five percent of the
population do not have access to medical care for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
VNA said the country's health care network is "in great
difficulty" with as many as 600 communal clinics throughout the
country in serious disrepair.
</P>
<P>
Most of the communal clinics and many district hospitals are
poorly equipped and lack basic medicines, VNA said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the economic boom in Vietnam, VNA said, many poor
people still cannot afford medical care.
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, 275,000 people have been given free
health insurance cards but they make up only four percent of the
people who need financial assistance to pay for health care.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is striving to provide free medical insurance for the
poor with funding from the hunger elimination and poverty
alleviation fund and other sources. The government is also trying
to establish a medical insurance fund in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Exports Passion Fruit to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan farmers are selling
passion fruit on the European market for the first time, thanks
to technical assistance from the Agribusiness Development Center
(ADC) here.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by ADC today said passion fruit is one
of the first fruits to receive support since it has been grown in
large quantities in Uganda, and market prices are high enough to
pay for the expensive air freight to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Uganda could achieve sales of up to 150,000 US Dollars per
annum from passion fruit, which would provide cash income to
small growers in rural areas, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The ADC was set up by the USAID (United States Agency of
International Development) -funded IDEA (Investment in Developing
Export Agriculture) project in a bid to support agribusiness
investors in developing new products and markets.
</P>
<P>
The center provided technical assistance for eight trial
shipments of passion fruit in 1995 and has stepped up activities
in training programs in post-harvest handling in Kasese and
Bushenyi districts, southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Training covers aspects of production and grading for export.
265 growers attended practical demonstrations in the two
districts.
</P>
<P>
The ADC promotes farmer-trader interactions both domestically
and internationally.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Regulates Tourist Charges To Protect Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A new set of standards for lowest
charges for tourist groups have been imposed in the south China
island province of Hainan since the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
The standards apply to comprehensive service charges for
tourist groups and hotel room fees for group travelers.
</P>
<P>
The imposement of the standards, according to an official with
the provincial price bureau, aims at increased regulation of the
tourist market to check unfair price cuts by some travel agencies
and to improve overall tourist service in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, the standards of lowest
service charges for a three-day visit to Hainan is 180 yuan each
day for each person, and 175 yuan for a four-day visit. The
service charge refers to a combination of hotel room fee, dining
fee, transportation fee, ticket fares for tourist sites and
insurance payment and some other fees.
</P>
<P>
For lowest hotel room charges, it is 300 yuan each day for
five-star hotels, 260 yuan for four-star ones, 180 yuan for
three-star ones, 140 yuan for two-star ones, and 100 yuan for
one-star ones.
</P>
<P>
Hotels grant the lowest charges only to travel services that
have paid in full amount to the quality insurance fund, a special
contribution required by the government supervisory bodies to
ensure service quality, and the prices may rise no more than four
percent in peak seasons, says the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
Many travel agencies and hotels voice their support for the new
regulation, believing it will prove effective in checking unfair
competition and guarantee a good market order and improve Hainan's
image as a tourist area.
</P>
<P>
This latest measure shows the province's commitment to better
regulation of its tourist industry. Back in April and May, the
province conducted a major shake-up of its tourist market by
cracking down on illegally run and profiteering travel services.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Hainan has received a total
of 1.3 million domestic and overseas travelers, and the figure for
the whole year is expected to reach 3.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Curbs Robbing of Ancient Tombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The government authorities of
Jingmen, a city of central China's Hubei Province, have adopted
effective measures and dealt serious blows at criminals who rob
ancient tombs, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the local government department overseeing the
protection of cultural relics show that there are more than 1,700
underground ancient tombs with their tops sealed off in Jingmen,
which was one of the originations of the well-known Chu State
Culture of the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
However, unlawful digging of ancient tombs dating back to as
early as more than 2,000 years ago has staged a comeback in
Jingmen since 1993, bringing disastrous consequences to some of
the most priceless historical relics, said Zhao Zhonghe, director
of the city's culture bureau.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the issue, the city government has stepped up its
efforts to publicize and disseminate state laws and local
regulations concerning the protection of cultural relics. It has,
among others, resorted to ordering the establishment of a relics
protection committee, and 144 teams patroling major cultural
relics sites.
</P>
<P>
"The measures have been proved effective in curbing and stopped
the evil and dirty business of robbing ancient tombs," Zhao said,
noting that a total of 21 tomb-robbers were brought to justice
over the past two years.

</P>
<P>
He said that while Latvia would take an active part in the

</P>
<P>
Li said China respects the Latvian people's choice of their
social system, values and path of development. China understands
and respects Latvia's determination to protect its independence
and sovereignty, as the two countries share similar experiences of
atrocities in their history.

China is concerned not only with peace and development in Asia,
but also with security and stability in Europe, Li added.
</P>
<P>
On trade and economic relations, Li said Latvian and Chinese
enterprises are discussing cooperative projects and China is
willing to set up more joint ventures in the Baltic country.

NINGBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Beilun Power Plant in Ningbo in
east China's Zhejiang Province today officially launched its
second-phase project to build three 600,000 kw generating units.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will involve more than 12.2 billion yuan
worth of investment, including loans of 482 million US dollars
from the World Bank, is expected to be completed by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
By then, the Beilun Thermal Power Plant will become one of the

<HEADLINE> Australian Carps to Jump Export Bar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian fishermen are eager to
find an international market for one of the country's largely
untapped aquatic resources -- carp.
</P>
<P>
As a delicacy in Asia and an angling fish in Europe, carp is
regarded as an environmental pest in Australia.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting of a special task group on carps, which
was held in Canberra this week, experts said they were considering
turning the disliked species into a multi-million dollar export
industry.
</P>
<P>
The experts said at the meeting that carp has become the
largest bio-mass in Australian rivers. It is estimated that carp
population has exploded to eight billion in the past 25 years and
is still growing.
</P>
<P>
But the fish is missing from Australians' dishes because people
think it is dirty and has too much bones.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are also concerned that carps are squeezing
off native fish species, destroying aquatic vegetation and
damaging river banks.
</P>
<P>
However, demand for carps in the international market exceeds
five million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
The special task group was set up to investigate ways to abate
carps' impact on Australia's bio-system.
</P>
<P>
Henry Jones, a commercial fisherman from South Australia state,
said that commercial harvest and export of carp were a win-win
solution to the present problem.
</P>
<P>
He said South Australia alone could harvest 100,000 tons of
carps every year on the basis of the existing resources.
</P>
<P>
This will bring 45 million US dollars of exports revenue to
Australia at the current international prices.
</P>
<P>
"This is only an indication of how large the potential is," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bryan Pierce from the South Australia Research and Development
Institution for Water Resources said commercial harvest was the
most feasible way to control carp population at present.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprinus carpio, or European carp introduced into Australia
in the last century, is extremely adaptable to the shallow, slow
flowing rivers in the country and impossible to be eliminated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Other methods such as genetic manipulation, introduction of
predator fish and release of fish virus still had a long way to go
before being used on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Jones said they had sent carp samples to the United States,
Poland, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia for assessment.
</P>
<P>
"The response said that this was just the fish they need," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest barrier for Australian exports is the cost.
</P>
<P>
Jones said intending buyers from the US offered 0.66 Australian
dollars (0.52 US dollars) per kilogram for packaged carp.
</P>
<P>
But Australian exporters had to receive 1.5 Australian dollars
(1.19 US dollars) per kilogram to cover the cost, though the
fishermen only got 0.3 Australian dollars (0.24 US dollars) per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
"Packaging costs 50 cents, freighting costs another 10 to 15
cents," he said.
</P>
<P>
Processing of the fish was done by hand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pierce said the cost efficiency of carp harvest was out of the
range of best international practice. The fishing industry was
trying to overcome such problems as long-distance transport to
make carp exports profitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jones said the industry was eager to cooperate with overseas
counterparts who have the expertise in harvesting, transporting
and processing carps.
</P>
<P>
He said that under current regulations, licensed fishermen
could directly set up joint ventures with overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a great prospect of export market for
Australian carps, especially in the increasingly affluent Asian
region.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's armed policemen seized 5,228
kilograms of narcotics across the country in May, Iran's
Anti-Drug Campaign Headquarters announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that 151 smugglers along with more than 2,000
drug dealers were arrested with 14 assault rifles, 70 vehicles and a
considerable amount of ammunition seized in the past month.
</P>
<P>
It said that about 76 percent of the drugs had been seized at
border crossings and heights in the provinces of Khorasan,
Sistan-Baluchestan, Kerman and Hormuzgan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the police rounded up 3,566 addicts during the
period and handed them over to judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
Drug is regarded as one of the main social ills of Iran since
the country constitutes one of the best transits for drugs to
reach Europe and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border
area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest
drug-producing centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
In its borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iran has built
1,400 kilometers of roads and 150 kilometers of canals in order to
prevent drug smugglers from entering the country.

<HEADLINE> PLO Statement Calls For Resumption Of Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The PLO Executive Committee and
Palestinian Authority cabinet issued a joint statement today
calling on prime minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu to resume the
final-status negotiations without delay.
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of their joint marathon meeting
in Gaza, which started Friday evening and concluded early this
morning. PNC President Salim Zanoun and PC Speaker Ahmed Qrei'

Prominent in the draft policy guidelines are three "Noes" -- no
to a Palestinian state, no to a dividing of Jerusalem, and no to
concessions on the Golan Heights.

continued existence and development of the new settlement, and
will allocate for this purpose the required resources.

the clauses states that "the government will conduct negotiations
with the Palestinian Authority to achieve a permanent peace
agreement, while strictly maintaining Israel's security needs,
including a materializing of the Palestinian commitment to
prevent terror, to extradite murderers, and not to incite against
Israel."
</P>
<P>
The guidelines include furthering relations with Egypt and
Jordan and raising level of diplomatic relations with other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>

funding for the city in order to expand housing and municipal
services.

<HEADLINE> Pele Says Venables' English Side Too Timid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's soccer legend Pele said the
England side coached by Terry Venables was too timid to win modern
attack-dominated match, a Liverpool newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"(England) still play not to lose the game rather than to
win," Pele told the Liverpool Echo. "Of course, they don't want
to lose the first game but if you want to win, you must play for a
win."
</P>
<P>
"I am from a different school. In mine, you go for the win. If
you play positively, you win," Pele was quote as saying before the
kick-off of the European Football Championship in England on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pele, who won three World Cup with Brazil, was also critical of
the English formation that features just one striker -- usually
the Blackburn forward Alan Shearer.
</P>
<P>
"I saw them against Portugal and the defenders were afraid to
go forward. Shearer scores goals and plays well for his club but
it is difficult with the national team because no one supports
him. Then people complain that he doesn't score," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pele said the Netherlands and Germany were the two best teams
in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
But England could also do well provided they wake up for more
attacking power, he said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's National Assembly Fails to Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea Party
(NKP) failed to convene a National Assembly meeting again here
today to elect a speaker and two vice speakers due to the
opposition parties' obstructive maneuver.
</P>
<P>
This was the second failure for the ruling party to hold a
parliament meeting in two days.
</P>
<P>
The New Korea Party wants to elect Kim Soo-han as the speaker
and Oh Se-eung vice speaker, who were nominated by President Kim
Young-sam on June 4.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), joined by the
fellow opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD) deputies,
physically blocked key parliament officials from entering the
chamber or taking the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
The opposition did not allow acting speaker Kim Ho-nam of the
ULD to attend the session and when the NKP tried to have Kim
Myong-yoon, the second oldest deputy of the NKP after Kim Ho-man,
take the rostrum, opposition solons prevented him from walking
toward the rostrum from his chamber seat either.
</P>
<P>
In the course, abusive languages were exchanged between ruling
and opposition legislators, although it did not lead to any
physical clash.
</P>
<P>
At the first plenary session of the new parliament on June 5,
lawmaker Kim Ho-nam was designated as acting speaker because he is
the oldest member of the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
The acting speaker introduced a motion for the election of a
speaker and vice speakers but declared the meeting adjourned until
June 12 without taking action on the motion.
</P>
<P>
By law, the oldest lawmaker presides over the inaugural session
of a new National Assembly until a new speaker and vice speakers
are selected.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp, angered by the NKP's attaining of simple
legislative majority by recruiting independent and opposition
lawmakers, demands that the ruling NKP make an apology to the
people.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP won 139 seats, 11 short of a simple
majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the NKP later lured into its fold 12 lawmakers-elect,
mostly independents, to secure 151 seats.

<HEADLINE> Help Called For to Save Liberia from Warlords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- An Liberia official has urged the
international community, particularly ECOWAS, not to sit idly-by
and watch Liberia to be turned into a huge human abattoir by the
warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's Ambassador to Nigeria, Benin and Togo James T.
Tarpeh said the horrendous crime against the civilian population
has caused unquantified human suffering, hunger, displacement of
families and the outbreak of epidemics in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"This calls for concerted effort at resolving the age-long
structural crisis caused by some self-seeking and over-ambitious
warlords," said the ambassador, quoted by the New Nigerian
newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
He ascribed the renewed armed banditry currently being
witnessed and seriously threatening the relief work by some
international aid organizations to two factors: the failure to
implement the Abuja peace accord by the factional leaders and the
lack of trust and confidence in reference to their own security
during and after disarming.
</P>
<P>
Tarpeh therefore urged the international community, especially
the economic community of west african states (ECOWAS), to give
Liberians another opportunity to discuss their future.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledged the fact that there must be the willingness
on the part of the Liberians themselves that they are willing to
talk. thus the so called warlords and representatives of other
groupings in the Liberian melodrama could be made to reconvey in
Abuja to chart a new course based on the Abuja peace accord," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, since the outbreak of renewed
fighting in Liberia, there seems to be no effective government on
ground, as most members of the Council of State have fled the
country or been in consultation with brotherly nations on how to
bring lasting peace to Liberia.

<HEADLINE> W. African Transporters Blaming Road Blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- West African road transport
operators are urging removal of the numerous road blocks along
sub-regional borders, saying it is a good way to boost trade
among West African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the West African Road Transport Union, multiple
check points have resulted in huge losses, weakened cooperation
and escalated cost of goods and services in the sub-regional
market.
</P>
<P>
"Duplication of check points and its effect on transportation
was frustrating the aims and targets of cooperation in the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)," said Alhaji
Lawal Isa, chairman of the union.
</P>
<P>
Isa, who said the problem is more acute along the Nigerian
borders, observed that fare between Lagos, the commercial hub of
Nigeria, and Cotonou in Benin is currently hovering between 700
and 800 Naira, compared with 200 in the past.
</P>
<P>
The most annoying aspect of the situation is the hostile
attitude of government officials along most borders in the
sub-region, the chairman said, adding that travelers including
transporters and businessmen from member states are usually
treated as enemies by the officials.
</P>
<P>
He thus cautioned that ECOWAS governments need to complement
efforts by removing unnecessary expenses being imposed on
transporters through road blocks.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
Chandra Shekhar has said that the mushrooming of regional parties
all over the country is not a healthy sign in national interest,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Thursday in Himachal Pradesh, Shekhar
said the programs of regional parties are "realms of their
imagination which contribute in the least to national
development."
</P>
<P>
Talking on the present United Front government headed by H.D.
Deve Gowda, the former prime minister said though in the present
circumstances, a coalition government was an extreme necessity,
all depended on its functioning and durability.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his past experiences in a coalition government,
Shekhar said a week central government cannot hold the
accountability of the nation for a long time because of the
failure of certain parties to observe the proper standards of
political life.
</P>
<P>
During the general elections held from April 27 to May 7, some
regional parties won an unprecedented number of parliament seats.
Four regional parties, including Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), formed the federal front with 58
seats, which became the largest block of the 190-seat United
Front.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea, Japan Develop Super-Small Flash Memory Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Electronics Company (SEC) of
South Korea has developed a super-small flash memory card in a
joint project with Toshiba Corporation of Japan, a SEC official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Unlike conventional memory devices such as floppy disks, the
new flash memory card, also known as a solid-state floppy disk
card (SSFDC), is not magnetic. Instead a non-volatile
semiconductor, called a flash memory ship, is embedded in a thin
plastic card one third the size of a standard credit card, the
official explained.
</P>
<P>
The SSFDC can read data 10 times faster than conventional
devices, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The flash memory card with one to eight megabyte memory
capacity is expected to be used as an external memory for portable
multimedia products, such as digital still cameras, hand-held
communications devices, voice recorders and games, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The new concept memory card is especially well suited for use
in consumer electronics devices because of its small and cost
effective form factor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the market for flash memory cards is still in its
infancy, experts predict that the global market for the cards will
reach 10 million units annually within the next three or four
years.
</P>
<P>
Samsung plans to begin mass production of two megabyte SSFDC at
the end of this year. It is working on one megabyte, four megabyte
and eight megabyte versions, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Issues Statement On Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs issued a statement on nuclear test here today.
Following is the full text of statement:
</P>
<P>
 Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
</P>
<P>
of the People's Republic of China
</P>
<P>
China conducted a nuclear test on June 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
China stands for the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons, and is in favour of reaching a
comprehensive nuclear test ban in the process towards this
objective. As early as in October 1993, the Chinese government
publicly announced that China stands for the conclusion of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) no later than 1996. Since
then, the Chinese delegation has taken an active part in the CTBT
negotiations in Geneva. China will continue to work with other
countries for the conclusion, within this year, of a fair,
reasonable and verifiable treaty with universal adherence and
unlimited duration.
</P>
<P>
The limited amount of nuclear weapons China possesses is solely
for the purpose of self-defense and does not constitute a threat
to any country. China has unilaterally and solemnly undertaken not
to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any
circumstances. It has also committed itself not to use or threaten
to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or
nuclear weapon-free zones. At the same time, China strongly calls
on other nuclear weapon states for a positive response to China's
initiative by immediately concluding, through negotiations, a
treaty on mutual non-first use of nuclear weapons, and reaching an
agreement on the unconditional non-use or non-threat of use of
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear
weapon-free zones.
</P>
<P>
In the world today, there still exist huge nuclear arsenals and
the threat of a nuclear war caused by the first use of nuclear
weapons. Against such a background, for the purpose of the supreme
interests of the state and the nation, China cannot but conduct
the necessary and the minimum number of nuclear tests. We have all
along exercised utmost restraint in conducting nuclear tests, and
the number of tests we have conducted is extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
Together with the governments and peoples of other countries in
the world, the Chinese government and people will work
unremittingly and do their utmost for the realization of the lofty
goal of a nuclear weapon-free world at an early date and for the
maintenance of lasting peace and universal security.
</P>
<P>
Based on the afore-mentioned position, the Chinese government
hereby announces that before September this year, China will
conduct another nuclear test to ensure the safety of its nuclear
weapons. After that, China will exercise a moratorium on nuclear
testing.

<P>
He urged Kenya to ensure that cargo meant for Rwanda reaches
its destination, noting that the escorting of cargo to the border
to ensure it does enter the local market should continue.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Appoints Son as Chief of Presidential Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani has appointed his oldest son as head of the
Presidential Office in a bid to enhance his leadership over the
administrative branch.
</P>
<P>
The appointment on Thursday appeared in almost all Iranian
newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Hashemi, 35 years old, is the oldest son of the
61-year-old president. He was head of the special inspection
office under the Presidential Office before the appointment.
</P>
<P>
Educated in Belgium and Canada, Mohsen Hashemi is the
president's second child. After receiving his Master of Science in
mechanical engineering, he returned to Iran in 1986 and began
working in Iran's missile industry. He also serves on the board of
directors of Iran's Defense Industries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Rafsanjani's appointment was aimed at
helping Mohsen Hashemi edge his way out to the front in the
political arena, so he can launch a better and bright political
career.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, President Rafsanjani might intend to secure
his leadership during the next and crucial 12 months of his
presidency because his position has been weakened and more and
more high-ranking officials give much heed to Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi Rafsanjani also wants to expand his family's influence
in the political arena. His brother Mohemmad Hashemi serves as
Vice-President for Executive Affairs and his daughter Faezeh
Hashemi was elected deputy to the Fifth Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi KDP Delegation Visits Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A delegation representing Iraq's
Kurdish Democracy Party (KDP) is here for talks with the
Jordanian officials and an Amman-based opposition Iraq National
Accord (INA), local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two-member KDP delegation, including Mohsin Dazae, the
personal representative of the group leader Massdu, and the
group's Politburo member Hoshyar Zibari, is expected to discuss
the recent developments inside Iraq and ways to strengthen
coordination between the two Iraqi opposition factions.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss with Jordanian officials on launching a
"mission" for the KDP in Amman.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation will discuss means to strengthen political as
well as military coordination between the two groups and ways to
speed up the political change in Baghdad," said INA spokesman
Haroun Mohammed, quoted by the English-language daily, Jordan
Times, today.
</P>
<P>
The KDP delegation arrived here Friday. Their visit to the
Kingdom is the second by a Kurdish opposition group in less than
two months.
</P>
<P>
A delegation representing the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK) visited Amman in April and decided to open an office here.
</P>
<P>
The PUK is scheduled to send a representative to Amman "soon"
to run this office, the spokesman disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The government allowed the INA to open an office here and
expressed its readiness to permit other Iraqi factions to
establish offices in Amman.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan does not allow any group to have any military
presence in the Kingdom to use it as a launching pad.
</P>
<P>
In April, the INA office launched a four-hour daily Arabic
radio service and said that it would publish a weekly newspaper,
named Iraq Al-Moustaqbal (Iraq of the Future).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Wafiq Samerae, the former
chief of Iraq's military intelligence who fled to Syria and later
on arrived in Jordan to live here, will return soon from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Samerae's visit to Damascus is a "temporary" one and he would
bring his family and come back by the end of this month, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Price War Ends in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The price war among the
Chinese-language newspapers in Hong Kong ended this week with Hong
Kong Daily News announcing its price to raise from three to four
HK dollars (38 to 50 US cents) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Oriental Daily News increased its price from three to four HK
dollars Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that all the existing newspapers
have resumed their original prices before the end of the price war.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper price war started a year ago at the publication
of the Apple Daily, which was launched at an initial price of
three HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the daily later raised its price to five HK dollar (64
US cents), it became the chief rival to the Oriental Daily News in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In December, Oriental Daily News cut its price from five to two
HK dollars (64 to 25 US cents) and the action was said to be
mainly aimed at the Apple Daily.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese-language newspapers, including Sing Pao Daily
News, Tin Tin Daily and Hong Kong Daily News, followed suit by
announcing their price reduction plans.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the first quarter this year, some of the
newspapers gradually resumed their original prices as Tin Tin
Daily took the lead in withdrawing from the price war. Tin Tin
Daily now sells at five HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the price war, nine newspapers and monthly publications
closed including the Express News and the United Daily News.

<HEADLINE> Australia Tests Method to Repair Cracks for Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Defense Science and
Technology Organization (DSTO) is testing a method of using a
certain kind of glue to repair stress cracks in jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The test is undergoing on a bulkhead from a F-16 jet fighter at
the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory under the DSTO.
</P>
<P>
The technique, called composite bonded repair system, uses an
Australian developed glue to repair aircraft fatigue, corrosion
cracks and foreign subject damage.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,500 F-16s in service worldwide are faced with a
common problem. Many of them suffered stress cracks in three rear
fuselage bulkheads to which the vertical fin was attached.
</P>
<P>
Conventional revetment repair method requires that the
bulkheads be dismantled and the damaged parts be replaced.
</P>
<P>
The Australian technology repairs the cracks without taking the
aircraft apart, thus saving much time and money.
</P>
<P>
The technology has already saved 700 million Australian dollars
(553 million US dollars) for the Royal Australian Airforces
(RAAF).
</P>
<P>
Following the current test on the bulkhead of a F-16, further
tests will be conducted before the technology is approved for
commercial use.
</P>
<P>
Alan Baker from the DSTO's Airframes and Engines Division said
that the technology had a big export potential and could be used
to repair aircraft other than F-16s.
</P>
<P>
"FA-18 aircraft in service in Australia have several
requirements for bonded composite repairs in which the stressing
in the adhesive is similar, so the experience we gain from
undertaking the current tests will be of help in repairing or
reinforcing our own aircraft," he said.

his top spot in the men's badminton world rankings, the
International Badminton Federation said in a press release

</P>
<P>
But one of the biggest jumps was made by Sun Jun of China who

<P>
Ye Zhaoying slipped down to second place, with Bang Soo Hyun of
South Korea ranked third.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Defense Forces Chief on Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- African countries can undertake
limited peacekeeping operations due to inadequate resources while
large-scale operations should leave to the U.N., Zimbabwe's
Defense Forces chief General Vitalis Zvinavashe has said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks on Friday after returning here from Addis
Ababa where he attended a meeting of army chiefs from the
16-member central organ for conflict management under the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Zvinavashe said African countries should continue to benefit
from the United Nations (U.N.) since they are also members of the
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We are members of the U.N. and the U.N. should still be
responsible for large-scale operations. If the OAU takes over
peacekeeping operations, it can only be on a limited scale
because of resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
His comments tally with the decisions of the meeting in Addis
Ababa which endorsed recommendations and guidelines for peace
missions and peacekeeping operations under the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were based on the decisions taken by
African leaders at the Cairo summit in 1993 where the organ for
conflict management was established.
</P>
<P>
The army chiefs also proposed the establishment of peace
mission structures at the OAU headquarters and at field levels to
enable the organization to plan better for such missions.
</P>
<P>
He added regional military chiefs meeting regularly to discuss
defense and security matters should consolidate such meetings
into preparations for peacekeeping operations.

<HEADLINE> Kony Rebels Accept Talks with Acholi Elders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Lord's Resistance Army (lra) rebel
leader Joseph Kony has agreed to hold peace talks with Acholi
elders, according to a memorandum issued here today.
</P>
<P>
the memorandum addressed to Prime Minister Kintu Musoke said
elders had earlier on April 11 this year written to Kony, urging
him to accept peace talks with them.
</P>
<P>
He told the premier that the return home of former rebel
leader Priestess Alice Lakwena would facilitate efforts to end
rebellion in the north.
</P>
<P>
Elders stated that since the idea of peace talks has now been
accepted, there should be ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister praised efforts by the Acholi elders to
restore peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
Musoke, however, said the government would not relax efforts
to protect the population.
</P>
<P>
The premier added that Kony is not a rebel because he has no
political agenda but a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
Musoke also conveyed President Yoweri Museveni's message to
the Acholi, saying participation of the Acholi in a free and fair
election is their democratic right.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated assurances that he will not victimize
them for voting for his rivals in the presidential elections held
last month.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also said the results of the elections will have no
bearing to the allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Minister of State for the Pacification of the
North Belty Bigombe and Presidential Advisor Caleb Akandwanabo
had held closed meeting with Acholi elders over peace talks with
Kony rebel.
</P>
<P>
The initial plan of the elders and chiefs was reportedly to

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China's fifth urban cooperative
bank has opened for business in this capital city of north China's
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The Shijiazhuang Urban Cooperative Bank (SUCB), the first in
the northern Chinese province, was set up following the opening of
four others in Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south China's
Guangdong Province, Shanghai, Beijing, and Nanjing, capital of
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the SUCB has already massed deposits
of five billion yuan (about 600 million US dollars) and extended
loans valued at three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The effort to establish urban cooperative banks, which are
often based on urban credit cooperatives, is part of the Chinese
government's effort to deepen financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
Last year China's State Council selected Beijing, Tianjin,
Shanghai, Shenzhen and Shijiazhuang, as the first cities to set up
urban cooperative banks on an experimental basis. Such banks will
be established in another 30 cities across the country this year.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Reportedly Gets 130 Million Dollars for Failed Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of
Korea has reportedly received 130 million dollars in compensation
from Western insurance firms for last year's disastrous harvest.
</P>
<P>
The insurance money came from eight Western reinsurance
companies last January, an unidentified diplomatic source was
quoted as saying by a Yonhap news agency report today.
</P>
<P>
The amount, according to the source in South Korea, would be
enough to buy 420,000 ton of rice or 600,000 ton of corn, enough
to feed DPRK's 20 million people for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
However, the source said, DPRK officials were negotiating with
the Western insurers to receive more compensation for crop damage
sustained in devastating floods last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Friday announced
the approval of a 425 million US dollar credit to India for a
primary education project in the country, the Patriot reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve the education quality for about 10
million elementary students in the age group of six to 10 years,
enable an estimated 1 million additional children to attend school
and allow another 4 million children to complete primary
education.
</P>
<P>
The credit is made through the International Development
Association (IDA), the world bank's concessionary lending arm.
The government of the Netherlands and the government of India will
also provide financing for the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, education and literacy in India
show progress but need further improvement.
</P>
<P>
The illiteracy rate in 1991 for children aged seven years and
above in India was 64 percent for males and 39 percent for
females.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high population growth rate in the country, the
number of illiterate people actually increased from 302 million to
324 million between 1981 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
Today, about 33 million children in the 6-10 year age group in
India, among which 60 percent of them are girls, remained out of
school.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Worried Over Netanyahu's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Hannan Ashrawi, member of the
legislative Palestinian Council, has expressed concern over the
draft policy guidelines of the soon-to-be-formed rightwing Israeli
government, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said Friday night that she didn't see how the new
government can reconcile peace with expanding the Jewish
settlements, refusing creation of a Palestinian state and keeping
Jerusalem exclusively.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft text of the document published in the
local press Friday, the new government led by Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu will not pull back from the Golan Heights
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War. The document
mentions no Oslo accords, but does foresee negotiations with the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, who was spokeswoman of the Palestinian delegation to
the Madrid and later Washington Middle East peace conferences,
said that if this is direction the new government is headed for,
it certainly has set itself an impossible task.
</P>
<P>
Dore Gold, senior foreign policy adviser of the prime
minister-elect, said that Netanyahu wants to reach final peace
agreement with the Palestinians, but in no rush to meet with
Yasser Arafat and will not be pressed by the existing deadline to
complete the accord.
</P>
<P>
Gold told reporters: "You have to have a realistic pace. Anyone
who negotiates with gun to his head reaches a bad agreement. If
you race ahead on the peace process you can put the whole country
at risk."
</P>
<P>
Gold declared that a Netanyahu-Arafat summit is unlikely for
the time being. "When you have so many issues in which there are
serious violations of the Oslo agreements, you do not run into
high-level meetings," he said.

<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Slams Britain for Blackmail on Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene today accused Britain of political blackmail for
blocking European Union decision-making in retaliation for its ban
on British beef.
</P>
<P>
"We won't accept political blackmail," said Dehaene, who is on
a brief visit here to discuss EU matters, at a news conference
jointly held with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
Guterres also criticized Britain for its non-cooperation policy
in refusing to end its blockade of EU business.
</P>
<P>
Britain has refused to vote on over 20 EU measures requiring
unanimity in its bid to force a total lifting of an EU ban on
British beef exports set on March 27 after London triggered a
Europe-wide panic by acknowledging that mad cow disease has a
potential to be transmitted to humans.
</P>
<P>
But the beef war between Britain and the EU showed the first
sign of easing on Thursday when London softened its tone by saying
that it would show "goodwill" by not blocking the signing of an EU
agreement with Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The British approach followed the European Commission's
decision on Wednesday to lift the ban on exports of three British
beef by-products -- gelatin, tallow and bull semen despite
six nation votes against within the 15-member EU.

<P>
The premium between the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market and the London

week.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market closed the week lower due to lack

External Affairs Minister Gujral also welcomed reports that
Bhutto had given "go-ahead" for establishment of formal trade with

<HEADLINE> Tax Rates Should Encourage Growth: Thai Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's taxation rates must be
set with an eye for encouraging economic growth and enhancing the
competitiveness of Thai investors overseas, Thai Finance Minister
Bodi Chunnanonda has said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is comparing its tax structure with neighboring
countries and making changes on taxation to boost business growth,
local newspapers today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
As competition in world markets intensifies, taxation changes
are necessary to encourage investment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he supported tax changes to encourage
household savings, particularly for the lower and middle classes,
and tax exemption is being considered on interest of fixed savings
accounts for longer than three years.
</P>
<P>
Value-added tax reimbursements must be strictly enforced
through clear procedures to win public understanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that the Finance Ministry is
considering four factors -- unemployment, inflation, domestic
investment rates, and the amount of investment in rural areas --
in determining changes in personal and corporate income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also considering tax measures aimed at
promoting company mergers, the newspapers said.

<HEADLINE> Former Balkan Foes Fail to Seal Arms Control Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Balkan factional leaders have failed
to reach an arms control accord for a difference over the status
of each party, officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian mediator Vigleik Eide said despite agreement on arms
reduction, negotiators have not initialled the accord because
there is no agreement on the status of the parties.
</P>
<P>
The talks faltered over the Bosnian government's insistence
that the self-styled Bosnian Serb Republic should not be given
equal status as itself in the document, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Eide said however, the parties have voluntarily agreed to
accept limits on their armaments and have agreed on extensive
measures for regular exchanges of military information and a
program of inspection.
</P>
<P>
But no details on agreed limits would be released until the
accord has been signed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs, Yugoslavia and Croatia have agreed to reduce
their heavy guns, tanks, armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft
and attack helicopters to strike a military balance in former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
An arms advantage Bosnian Serbs inherited from the Yugoslav
army helped Serb forces once control 70 percent of Bosnia after
war erupted in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The poorly equipped Muslim-Croat federation, which is to
receive 98.4 million dollars worth of U.S.-made guns, tanks,
armored vehicles and helicopters this year, will not make cuts
under the accord, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
Eide said he hoped the difference would be smoothed and the
agreement signed by the June 11 deadline as being laid down in the
Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He warned that a failure to initial the agreement could be a
heavy blow to the Dayton accord, which was signed last december to
end the four-year bloody war in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton accord required the arms control talks to end by
June 6 and a pact to be signed in Oslo on June 11. If not, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will have to cut its troops by 25
percent and the Bosnian government will be allowed to maintain a
military force twice as strong as that of the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Talks began here on January 5. The five parties attending the
talks included Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Bosnian Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The major thorny problem has been that Bosnian Serb insisted on
being designated as a "party" to the final accord, whereas the
Muslim-led Bosnian government said they should be an "entity," as
defined in the Dayton agreement, which designated two entities,
Serb and Muslim-Croat, as parts of a united Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Changes Drive Investors to Securities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Interest rate changes have in part
driven many Chinese investors to the country's fledgling
securities market.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics by Shenzhen Securities Settlement Co.,
Ltd, show that the January-May period saw the opening of 915,100
trading accounts for A shares listed on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange. A shares are restricted to domestic investors only.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, newly-opened trading accounts for B
shares, which are restricted to overseas investors, numbered 8,246.
</P>
<P>
Sources here say that the new domestic investors are mainly
from Shanghai, Beijing, and the provinces of Jiangsu, Fujian,
Shandong, Zhejiang and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that registered securities investors had
numbered 6.1159 million in Shenzhen by the end of May and that
291,400 new accounts were opened in April and 579,500 in May.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the surge in new accounts is to a great
extent in response to the cancellation of an inflation-beating
interest rate subsidy as of April 1 and the lowering of interest
rates on bank deposits starting May 1.
</P>
<P>
They also say that the interest rate cut is expected to improve
the listed companies' prospects for profits, hence more new
investors in stocks.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken by the city authorities of Shenzhen to
vitalize the stock market this year have also made securities
investment more attractable, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that stock trading in Shenzhen was
worth 204.5 billion yuan (about 24.3 billion US dollars) in the
first five months of this year, more than twice the total amount
for the whole of last year. The composite subindex on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange at the end of May was nearly 50 percent higher than
at the start of this year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans to Issue Passports for Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Agriculture Ministry, in a
new move to curb mad cow disease, plans to issue cattle with
passports to record all their movements.
</P>
<P>
The proposed passport system, now pending public comment, is
"intended to improve animal identification and traceability," the
ministry said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to fight mad cow disease, formally known as
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and gain European Union
(EU) permission to resume the country's beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the keeping of central records to link ear
tag numbers with the animals' date of birth, breed, sex,
identification of dam, and their movements.
</P>
<P>
"It will be illegal to move cattle born after the new
legislation comes into force without a cattle passport," said the
Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The system is expected to make it easier to track if the
original herds later is found to have mad cow disease, which
continues to infect British herds despite a ban on using feed
containing animal protein.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found BSE, which reached epidemic proportions in the
late 1980s, was caused by feeding cattle the remains of sheep that
had been infected with scrapie, their own version of the disease.
</P>
<P>
It was the fear of BSE's possibility of infecting humans that
prompted the EU to ban Britain's beef exports -- a measure that
has caused tensions in the Britain-EU relationship.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Army to Keep away from Polling Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Army troops will be posted on duty to
maintain law and order during Bangladesh's June 12 election, but
they will be away from the polling centers, Chief Election
commissioner Abu Hena said.
</P>
<P>
Hena said this in an interview with the state-owned Bangladesh
Television last night.
</P>
<P>
Army troops will rush in aid of civil administration only when
summoned by returning officers, assistant returning officers,
presiding officers or magistrates on duty, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain law and order during the polls, the
authorities have decided to deploy 400,000 members of
law-enforcing agencies across the country. Among them, 40,000 army
troops began deployment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the Awami (people's) League (AL), the former largest
opposition party in the country, has blamed the Defense Ministry
under President Abdur Rahman Biswas for keeping the armed forces
portfolio in his hands to rig the election in favor of the
ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The AL has sought a clarification from the government whether
the defense forces deployed during the polls period would remain
under the direct control of the caretaker government led by Chief
Adviser M. Habibur Rahman or not.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the objectives underlying the deployment of armed
forces, Hena stressed that the purpose for the deployment is to
maintain the law and order during the polls.
</P>
<P>
Polling would be suspended at centers disturbed by acts of
terrorism, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chief election commissioner also noted that
polling would be postponed in centers which would be adversely
affected by inclement weather on the polling date.
</P>
<P>
But the election schedule would not be changed in case of minor
changes in weather, he said, adding that "I hope voters will turn
up at polling centers with umbrellas on their heads in the event
of rains."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Introduces Uniform System for Rice Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry is
ushering in a uniform system for local and export rice market to
facilitate domestic and export rice transactions.
</P>
<P>
The system involving new standards for grain size and moisture
content in rice, which is already in use unofficially on a
voluntary basis for traders, will become mandatory some time in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Minister Chucheep Harnsawat said Friday that the
new system will end disputes among millers, brokers and exporters
over rice standards and pricing.
</P>
<P>
Currently, prices set for rice are mainly based on rice quality
samples in Thailand, while its transactions for rice exports are
based on standards set in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Thai millers often complain that exporters offer them unfairly
low prices, while exporters counter by saying that the millers
fail to match their promised standard.
</P>
<P>
The new uniform system would streamline marketing by ending the
need for sample tests and also enable millers themselves to export
rice instead of selling to brokers.
</P>
<P>
Rice pricing under the new system will be more in tune with the
market and benefit rice growers, Chucheep said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's top rice exporter, supplying 5-6
million tons of rice a year.

<HEADLINE> Farming to Revive in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 8 (Xinhua)-- Large quantities of onion, chili and
vegetable seeds have been despatched to the Jaffna Peninsula to
revive vegetable farming there, according to Agricultural Ministry
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Agriculture, Lands and Forestry
Ministry has taken steps to send 400 metric tons of fertilizers
to the peninsula in response to requests made by farmers there.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna Peninsula is famous for its intensive agriculture and
commercial crop cultivation. Due to the 13-year civil war in the
areas, the farmers had to abandon their fields and agricultural
activities in the whole peninsula were neglected.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka depended heavily on Jaffna Peninsula farmers for
chili, onions and other food crops. The worsening of the conflict
in the 1980s saw production of these items in the North collapse
and these items had to be imported to meet the market demand.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that government is hopeful that the revival
of agriculture in the peninsula will help reduce the expenditure
on food imports.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said today that priority will be given to the
development in science and technology, in which great manpower and
material resources will be put.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Kazakhstan's
Academy of Sciences, Nazarbayev said that reforms in science and
technology had lagged behind those in economy.
</P>
<P>
He said science and technology had failed to do their duty to
stablize the country's economy because technological innovation
has failed to meet actual needs and advanced technology has not
been popularized in industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The country will put its emphasis on the development in basic
research, applicable science and other new scientific fields, and
step up its protection of infrastructure for scientific research,
Nazarbayev added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Paris Mayor to Take Accusers to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Paris mayor Jean Tiberi said today he
is taking to the court of law those who have implicated him in a
political payoff scam involving city contracts.
</P>
<P>
Tiberi, appearing on TF1 television, said the allegations "have
nothing to do with the truth" and he had instructed his lawyer to
file slander suits against the accusers.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR), took
office last year after Chirac, the founder and leader of the
party, was elected French president.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Tiberi served as Paris' deputy mayor and housing
authority chairman.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, there have been charges that companies bidding
for government-funded city housing contracts routinely paid
commissions that were in turn channelled to the RPR.
</P>
<P>
Francois Ciolina, a former deputy director of the city's
housing authority, told the French daily Le Monde last week that
Tiberi "was aware of everything" in the payoff.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Raises Quota For Iraq, Freezes Others' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The OPEC ministers agreed in Vienna
today to move up its production ceiling to 25.03 million barrels
daily (MBD), with the increased portion given to Iraq for its
limited oil export revived by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A quota deal today at the 100th conference of the 36-year-old
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), scaled up
Iraq's allocation from 0.4 to 1.2 MBD but froze mandated volumes
for the 10 other members.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's three-year-old output levels of 24.50 MBD, reduced to
24.23 MBD with the exit of the African state of Gabon, now rose to
25.03 MBD with an extra sum allocated to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In its first move to raise the ceiling since 1993, OPEC will
give the entire 0.8 MBD addition to Iraq alone to match the
limited Iraqi sales allowed by the U.N. -- 2 billion U.S. dollars
for six months to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Gabon chose the session to follow a 1992 lead by Ecuador and
quit the cartel, complaining about its indiscriminate
appropriation of yearly 1.8 million U.S. dollar membership fees
regardless of the members' different liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, devoted to discussions on the adjustment of output
levels to manage Iraq's revived oil export under a U.N. accord
ending its 1990 Gulf War embargo, opened Thursday amid strong
demands for bigger quotas and a higher ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The delegates, having elected the United Arab Emirates Oil
Minister Rakadh Bin Salem Bin Hamed Rakadh and Libya's Abdalla
Salem El-Radri to the cartel's top portfolios, agreed to meet
again on November 27.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for 40 percent of the world's total oil output every
year, the OPEC's proven reserves amount to 70 percent.

According to the official the municipal government of Chongqing
also sent letters to governments at the locations of the

<HEADLINE> Rift Arises Again Within Nepal's Ruling Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Difference over the present
ruling coalition arose Friday within Nepal's second ruling party,
the National Democratic Party (RPP), as leaders issued a statement
against their party colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two RPP central members in a statement Friday criticized
22 other leaders who earlier pledged to continue to support the
present coalition government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the
Nepali Congress (NC) Party.
</P>
<P>
Those leaders, most of them holding posts in the Deuba cabinet,
in a statement made public Wednesday said that trying to topple
the present government would not in favor of the national interest
and the people.
</P>
<P>
The Friday statement by another group of RPP leaders said the
Wednesday statement was against the policy of the party and was
not in conformity with the party's constitution.
</P>
<P>
"It is an irresponsible act on the part of responsible leaders
to issue such a statement prior to a party Central Committee
meeting," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
RPP is to hold a central meeting later today where the party
was expected to decide its future policy regarding the present
coalition.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the RPP leaders who signed the Friday
statement are loyal to RPP parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur
Chand.
</P>
<P>
However, hours after their statement was issued Friday, 14 of
the 22 leaders issued another statement saying that it would be
wise to sustain the present government.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal
(UML) recently have vowed that they would topple the coalition
government during the forthcoming parliament session within a
month at any cost.
</P>
<P>
It was believed the UML party is using its earlier tactics to
allure Chand loyalists within the RPP to withdraw from the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
At a special session of the parliament last March, a
no-confidence motion tabled by the UML was defeated by a narrow
majority in the 205-seat Lower House.
</P>
<P>
RPP holds the key to the survival of the three-party government
with its 19 seats in the House as main ruling NC and main
opposition UML have 86 and 88 seats respectively.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Darryl Johnson outscored world top
gun Oscar Schmidt 7-5 in a two-men-show in the last two minutes,
lifting the Klim All-Stars U.S. team to a 98-96 cliff-hanger
victory in the Beijing International Basketball Challenge Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two side played neck-to-neck till the last 2:40 minutes
when Schmidt, the 38-year-old Brazilian shooter, broke the 91-91
tie with a five-meter jumper. But Johnson, the former Michigan
State university guard, answered with a driving hook.
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, who will play his fifth Olympic Games 42-days later in
Atlanta, sank a three-pointer in the next Brazilian ball possesion
with 1:45 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Johnson also found the rim from behind the arc
and tied it 96-all for the Americans within one minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, who carried the Brazilian team with a game-high 37
points including six 3-pointer bombs, missed his 14th attempt
behind the arc and Caio Silveira missed a tip on an open offensive
rebound.
</P>
<P>
The Americans held the time down and Johnson hit the winning
jumper with only six seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
Mike Brown, a 2.11-meter former Chicago Bulls center, grabbed
the ball from Brazilian guard Conrado Ferraciu' hands in the dying
seconds to anchor the win for the Americans, who also won 105-84
over the Chinese 555 Team.
</P>
<P>
"The American team's defense are very tough and we lost a lot
of rebounds," said Brazilian coach Carlos Rodrigues after the
game, in which they lost 36-20 in rebounding against the Americans.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Releases Directory on Listed Companies' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Securities Group today
released its third directory since the 1991 Gulf War, giving an
overview of the performance of companies listed in the stock
market over the past five years and an assessment of their
financial indices.
</P>
<P>
The group's Board Chairman Bader Fahad al-Humaidi said the
directory would help investors and researchers in the fields of
economy and finance as well as those interested in the activities
of the economic sectors in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The directory was published in Arabic as well as English
languages.
</P>
<P>
It contains data on assets and liabilities and how they are
distributed among the listed companies in addition to profits and
losses and vital financial indicators.
</P>
<P>
Profits on shares, book value, price movements and profit
distribution as well as company statements on dealings from 1991
to 1995 also could be easily acquired from the directory.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti stock market is one of the strongest compared with
other newly developed markets in the Gulf region. It registered a
record high performance last year.
</P>
<P>
Al-Humaidi said his group believes that the performance of the
market in the first half of 1996 is promising. Bourse activities
in the first quarter of the year increased by 250 percent
compared with the same period of 1995 while dealings rose by
about 256 percent in the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The daily average dealings in shares from January to May this
year were 60 million shares valued at 12.2 million Kuwaiti dinars
(40.26 million U.S. dollars) compared with 36 million shares worth
7.6 million Kuwaiti dinars (25.08 million dollars) in the
corresponding period in 1995, according to official figures
available.
</P>
<P>
Al-Humaidi predicted even better performances in the remaining
period of this year.

<HEADLINE> Monkey Study Shows AIDS Risks Through Oral Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The virus that caused AIDS can
infect individuals through oral sex, even though there were no
sores, cuts or gum disease in their mouths, the scientists
report in today's issue of the Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
In a study that underscored the risks of oral sex, scientists
have found that the monkey AIDS virus, or S.I.V., can infect
monkeys after it is dabbed on the backs of their mouths. Six of
seven rhesus monkeys in the experiment became infected and two of
them died of AIDS and some of the remaining have symptoms related
to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
But the researchers stressed that there is still no evidence
that casual contact, or even mouth-to-mouth contact such as
kissing or sharing utensils, can spread HIV that causes AIDS in
people.
</P>
<P>
Scientists consider S.I.V. the best animal model for human
AIDS because HIV-1, the strain of the virus responsible for
virtually all AIDS cases around the would, and S.I.V. are
closely related, and monkeys infected with S.I.V. develop
clinical problems similar to those of HIV infected people.
</P>
<P>
The new findings surprised the researchers. One reason is that
epidemiological studies show that oral-genital exposure has been
implicated in transmission of HIV only rarely. Another surprise is
the amount of S.I.V. needed for infection is one six-thousandth of
the amount required for infection through the rectum.
</P>
<P>
Unprotected receptive oral intercourse, even in the absence of
cuts or other breaks in the lining of the mouth, should be added
to the list of risk behaviors for transmission of HIV, the
researchers concluded.

KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni met Aido
Ajjello, envoy of the European Union (EU) for the great lakes
region at Rukungiri in southwestern Uganda on Thursday to discuss
the situation in central Africa, reported Radio Uganda today.
</P>
<P>
Ajjello briefed Museveni on efforts and a proposal by the
European Union to solve problems and establish peace in the
lakes region.
</P>
<P>
He said he just visited Rwanda and Burundi, noting that he is
proceeding to Brussels to brief the council of EU ministers about
his findings and proposals from the leaders in the region about
the deteriorating situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told the envoy that there is particularly need for
patriotic leaders in Burundi to lead the country into an
evolution of a healthy coalition.
</P>
<P>
He condemned an indiscriminated use of violence by certain
groups there which he said has complicated the problem.
</P>
<P>
Museveni noted that only the patriotic group can unite the
people, adding that sometimes, even political pressure works as
patriots are committed to doing good to their country.
</P>
<P>
He told the envoy that other possible solutions should be
considered including intervention by a regional military force.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Deports Over 4,000 Zimbabweans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 4,500 zimbabweans were
deported from South Africa between January and April this year.
</P>
<P>
A South Africa's High Commission official in Harare said on
Friday the reasons for the deportations vary from criminal
offences such as house-breaking, robbery, theft, murder, to
residing or working in South Africa without necessary permits.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe was one of the countries which generated the
most illegal immigrants in South Africa. The others include
Mozambique and Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
''The presence of illegal Zimbabwean citizens in South Africa
has become a serious issue because of the South African
government's commitment towards the successful accomplishment of
the reconstruction and development program, and the negative
impact that the illegal aliens have on that program, and on the
socio-economic welfare of the country,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of an estimated 300,000 Zimbabweans working in
south Africa are believed to have fraudulently acquired residence
or work permits.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government is not against deportations and has
already warned citizens against illegally crossing into
neighbouring countries, saying they should not expect sympathy or
protection from the government. enditem

<HEADLINE> Sampras Loses to Kafelnikov in French Open Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras bowed
to sixth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 7-6 (7-4), 6-0, 6-2
in the French Open semifinals here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
American Sampras, apparently out of form, struggled to a 4-2
lead in the tiebreaker in the first set but lost the following
five points.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, 22, then kept the momentum going to take nine
consecutive games and 14 out of the last 16 to become the first
Russian to reach a French Open final.
</P>
<P>
This was also Kafelnikov's first Grand Slam final, while for
Sampras, the loss doused his hope to win the title at Roland
Garros.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had won seven Grand Slam titles but never the French
Open, making furthest to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In the final, Kafelnikov will meet German Michael Stich, who
scored a straight-set victory over Marc Rosset in an earlier
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The 15th-seeded German, who had upset Austria's defending
champion Thomas Muster, took the match in just one hour, 35
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Stich, 27, broke the Swiss Olympic Rosset four times, but never
lost his own serve.
</P>
<P>
The German won Wimbledon in 1991 and lost the U.S. Open final
to American Andre Agassi in 1994.

<HEADLINE> WWF Urges Effort to Save Marine Fishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
Thursday urged efforts to stop global overfishing in order to
reverse the crisis in marine fisheries and to restore abundant
seas.
</P>
<P>
It said it is planning to invest over 1 million dollars
annually to build the necessary political will globally to take
steps to save marine fishes, including halt to overfishing and
reduced use of destructive fishing practices.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) as reporting that 70 percent of the world's commercially
important marine fish stocks are either fully fished,
overexploited, depleted, or slowly recovering.
</P>
<P>
In addition, indiscriminate fishing practices kill and waste
fully one-third of world catch --between 18 and 40 million tons of
unwanted fish, seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals and other
ocean life every year, threatening the marine biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing has reduced spawning populations of many of the
large ocean-wandering predators such as tunas, swordfish, marlins
and sharks, by more than 80 percent in the past two decades, said
WWF, the formerly World Wildlife Fund based in Gland, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, staple species such as Atlantic cod and Atlantic
halibut have become commercially extinct. In 1993, the Canadian
cod fishery was shut down off the Grand Banks, resulting in the
losses of more than 40,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to WWF, about 1.2 million commercial vessels are
scouring the world's oceans today. Increasingly volatile "fish
wars" occurred due to disputes over the remnants of rapidly
declining stocks, the most notorious recently of them the
Canadian-Spanish "turbot war" in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many fleets of developed countries are now plundering the
fishing grounds of developing countries after overfishing their
own waters. The European Union (EU) now gets more than 25 percent
of its catch from outside its home waters.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, EU spent more than one-third of its fisheries budget
to subsidize access to foreign fishing grounds. Globally, the
governments pay a total of 54 billion U.S. dollars a year in
subsidizing the 70 billion dollar-worth fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
WWF said fishing fleets should be cut to allow the recovery of
fish resources. The EU has about 40 percent more vessels than
necessary to catch fish on a sustainable basis, it added.

OTTAWA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada's six big banks have reported
a huge profit of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter of
the fiscal year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 43.6 Million Dollars in Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Thursday appealed
for over 43.6 million U.S. dollars in addressing the humanitarian
emergencies in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
arising from the devastating floods last year.
</P>
<P>
The UN consolidated inter-agency appeal covers the period from
July 1 1996 to the end of March 1997, focusing on the three
priority sectors of food aid, the recovery of arable lands and
health.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 27 million dollars of the funds will address the food
crisis in the country, where flooding destroyed about 1.5 million
tons of grain harvest and stocks, and a shortfall of some 1.9
million tons of cereals is predicted by experts for the year 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some 10.3 million dollars are sought for the recovery of arable
lands in order to resume normal agricultural production and ease
the food shortages. Floods had damaged an estimated 360,000
hectares of arable lands in DPRK, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
It accounts for nearly 6 million dollars of the appealed money
to restore the DPRK's basic health services, which had been
severely disrupted by the floods.

HONG KONG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy's first division champion
A.C. Milan trounced Hong Kong's newly-crowned Senior League
champion Instant Dict 7-0 in a friendly game here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
In spite of absence of its World Footballer of the Year George
Weah of Liberia as well as Montenegrin playmaker Dejan Savicevic
and sweeper Franco Baresi, the Italians launched wave upon wave of
offensives.
</P>
<P>
Apparently far short of the caliber of their Italian opponent,
host Instant Dict failed to control the midfield, thus losing the
initiative in the match.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Baggio made the pace of the Italian attacks and he
himself scored the team's second goal 25 minutes into the first
half.
</P>
<P>
But substitute forward Tomas Locatelli was obviously the hero
of the visiting side as he scored four consecutive goals within 30
minutes in the second half.
</P>
<P>
He netted in the 51st, 66th, 74th and 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
Nicola Caccia opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a
close-range shot while Riccardo Maspero completed the mauling with
a goal in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving here Thursday, A.C. Milan beat Chinese national
eleven 2-0 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It also visited the southern city Shanghai and Changchun in
Northeast China, winning both games against the local sides.

<HEADLINE> Deer Breeders' Plight Heightens Wildlife Protection in Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Deer breeders in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are in desperate search of studs
of red deer, a wild animal existing in large quantities a decade
ago and now close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
The red deer is an animal with high economic value, whose
antlers, horn, heart, kidney, placenta, muscle, blood, and tail
are all precious raw materials for Chinese traditional medicines.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that each red deer can generate some 10,000
yuan a year, making red deer breeding a highly lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenzhong, a farmer who started deer breeding with several
fawns in 1975, is now the richest person in his town with three
farms with a total of 170 red deer.
</P>
<P>
"The deers bring me an annual income of over 2 million yuan,
while each can sell for some 38,000 yuan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with artificial deer raising techniques coming
close to maturity, more and more farmers and herdsman in Xinjiang
are encouraged by local governments to engage in red deer breeding
for economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
However, most of them saw their plans upset before their
business started, as there was no way to get wild red deers as
studs for the farms.
</P>
<P>
A township in the Manas County last year spent some 100,000
yuan setting up a deer farm. The warehouses of the farm are filled
with deer fodder, while dozens of deer houses remain empty.
</P>
<P>
"I went everywhere across the autonomous region in the past
months, trying to buy some studs for my farm, but could not find
even a hair of the deer," said the man in charge of the farm.
</P>
<P>
He said he just could not believe that such a thing could ever
happen in Xinjiang, long reputed as "the hometown of red deer."
</P>
<P>
According to a local zoologist, in mid 1980s, there were still
some 200,000 red deer of four subspecies in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
"Some ten years ago, we often saw red deers coming down the
mountains to rival our cattle and sheep for grass, and it was a
hard job to scare them off," an elderly herdsman recalled.

<TEXT>
<P>
Disasters started to befall red deer in early 1986, he said,
when merchants arrived in Xinjiang to purchase deer antlers at
high prices. Thousands of poachers flooded into the mountainous
areas and rampantly killed red deer.
</P>
<P>
"The number of red deer had been sharply reduced to less than
20,000 before the hunting craze was finally brought to a halt by
the government through three years' efforts," an expert on
wildlife protection said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that this figure is already close to the minimal
number required for the survival of species.
</P>
<P>
"Any more hunting will turn the red deer into an endangered
species," he said.
</P>
<P>
Forbidden to get any wild red deers from the mountains, deer
breeders in Xinjiang are forced to buy studs from northeast
China's Jilin Province, some 5,000 km away.
</P>
<P>
With an extra transportation fee, each stud deer from Jilin
will cost some 12,000 yuan, which most ordinary farmers and
herdsmen cannot afford. And the price of Jilin deers is much lower
than those from Xinjiang on the global market.
</P>
<P>
The plight of deer breeders have taught the autonomous region a
good lesson in the importance of good protection and reasonable
usage of wildlife resources.
</P>
<P>
During the past one month pictures and banners appeared in the
streets of all major cities across Xinjiang, giving wide publicity
to the state law on wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
By the side of the city government of Urumqi, passers-by were
attracted by a display of pictures staged by local middle school
students.
</P>
<P>
"The wildlife resources belong not only to the state, but also
to each of us. It is the duty of every Chinese citizen to protect
the wild animals well," preached a 14-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Hong, a local zoologist, noted that the government should
also make full use of those wild animals which have both high
economic value and are available in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them can be turned into new species of domestic
livestock or poultry through artificial breeding, bringing wealth
to farmers and herdsmen," he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments in Xinjiang are now carrying out a
research project on artificial breeding of some local wild
creatures, including 10 species of animals and seven kinds of
birds.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Cut Public Service by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government was
considering to cut its public service to reduce the national
budget by 20 percent, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Windhoek, the Department of Information
and Broadcasting said the Namibian economy could not sustain the size
of the present civil service, which ''consumes about 55 percent of
the annual budget in personnel expenditure''.
</P>
<P>
The decision to trim the public service was taken at a cabinet
meeting in Windhoek on Tuesday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources there are about 65,000 public service
staff serving a population of approximately 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Contracting out, creating agencies within government,
commercialisation and privatisation of non-essential functions were
being investigated as ways of bringing personnel expenditure down to
35 percent of the national budget, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The services targeted included cleaning, security, gardening,
laundry, government garage, government stores and catering.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the cabinet had also seriously considered the
possible adverse impact the retrenchment process might have on the
public service and suggested it be approached ''with circumspection
and care''.

<HEADLINE> World Military Spending Drops Sharply, IMF Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Military spending worldwide
dropped to a low of 2.4 percent of world GDP in 1995 from 3.6
percent in 1990, according to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Survey, a publication of IMF, said that the
decline in military spending has been widespread both
geographically and by level of development based on data of 130
countries.
</P>
<P>
Survey listed figures of different groups as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Military spending by developed countries as a group fell to
2.4 percent of the GDP in 1995 from 3.2 percent in 1990;
</P>
<P>
-- Developing countries as a group cut their military spending
nearly in half as a share of GDP -- to 2.6 percent in 1995 from
4.9 percent in 1990;
</P>
<P>
-- The transition economies registered the most dramatic
decline in military expenditures, trimming from 7.9 percent of GDP
to 3 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- African countries steadily reduced their spending to 2.1
percent of GDP in 1995 from 3 percent five years earlier;
</P>
<P>
-- Asian countries sustained their reduction in military
spending by equivalent of 0.5 percentage point of GDP to 2.3
percent in 1995;

BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The 15-nation European Union's
trade surplus with other parts of the world widened to 24.2
billion Ecus (29.7 billion U.S. dollars) last year, figures
released today by the EU's Statistical Office (EUROSTAT) showed.
</P>
<P>
This was the third positive year in a row with a surplus of 1.2

(8.06 billion dollars) in 1994.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian Prisoners Live in Despair: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A high proportion of inmates in
Canada's prisons have been beaten or have been living in fear of
violence, a recent survey by the Correctional Service of Canada
(CSC) showed.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,285 inmates questioned, 20 percent of them said they
have been beaten or threatened while seven percent said they have
been assaulted with a weapon. Almost half of them said they do
not feel safe from an assault by other inmates.
</P>
<P>
Eight percent of the inmates reported having been assaulted by
CSC staff members in the six months preceding the survey, today's
Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that three percent of inmates have been
sexually assaulted behind bars. An additional six percent have
been pressured to provide sexual services.
</P>
<P>
For many inmates, thought of suicide is a dominant part of
life. One in five inmates in maximum-security jails had
considered suicide in the preceding week of the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was limited to male inmates serving sentences of
more than two years in federal jails.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 15,000 inmates in Canadian jails.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Rate Goes Up Slightly in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
U.S. edged up to 5.6 percent in May even though businesses added
to their payrolls at the fastest pace since February.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported today the unemployment rate
was up slightly from a 14-month low of 5.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percentage point increase occurred because the labor
market swelled by 549,000 in May, but only 367,000 of those job
seekers found jobs, according to a survey of the nation's
households.
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 months, the jobless rate in the U.S. has been
in a lower level between 5.4 percent to 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that business payrolls shot up by 348,000
workers last month, with an increase of 181,000, or 52 percent of
the total gain, in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
This year big jumps in payroll jobs have sent bond and stock
prices tumbling as fears were heightened that faster-than-expected
economic growth would increase inflationary pressures and force
the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to slow economic growth by raise
interest rates. The Fed policy-makers will meet on July 2-3.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. government said recently the inflation had been kept
well under control with a 2.4 percent annual rate in the first
three months this year.

LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Success in business with China is
most likely to come to companies prepared to commit to long-term
partnership with the country, a British business leader said today.
</P>
<P>
"No company with international aspirations could afford to
ignore China," said Sandy Leitch, Chairman of Eagle Star, at a

The country is "a giant that has now well and truly awoke from

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibia was to introduce a
public service charter aimed at bringing prompt and professional
public services to all its citizens, the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Windhoek on Friday, the Department of
Information and Broadcasting said the charter, to be introduced
by April next year, would be based on seven principles and
standards.
</P>
<P>
Full, accurate information was to be readily available in
plain language about how public services were run, what they
cost, how well they performed and who was in charge, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The public should also be provided with choices and there
should be regular consultation with users of services.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: ''Services are to be available to all who
are entitled to them, and run to suit their convenience.''
</P>
<P>
Public servants were expected to be helpful and courteous, it
said, adding an apology, full explanation and a swift and
effective remedy were to be made if things went wrong.
</P>
<P>
However, the department stressed that public services were to
be delivered efficiently and economically within the resources
the nation could afford. enditem

ATHENS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Foreign Ministry today

<HEADLINE> More Cambodians Carry HIV Virus, WHO Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 7 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 to 150,000
Cambodians are estimated to be HIV virus carriers and the number
is still rising, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The estimates mark a dramatic increase in numbers released by
the World Health Organization (WHO) and the national AIDS testing
program in November, when 50,000 to 90,000 Cambodians were said to
have been infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, WHO put the number at 30,000.
</P>
<P>
"From the data we have now, we project that by the year 2000
there will be 40,000 cumulative AIDS cases," Annie Macarry, a
medical officer with WHO, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Between 1,500 and 2,000 AIDS cases have been reported in
Cambodia. By the turn of the century, there will be 12,000 new
AIDS cases each year, she added.
</P>
<P>
WHO said the virus, which leads to AIDS, is spreading faster in
Cambodia than in any other Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
It surveyed "high risk" groups, such as prostitutes, military
police, pregnant women and tuberculosis patients, to find out the
scale of the HIV-carriers.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that a survey of 1,173 prostitutes in
1995 showed that an average of 38 percent of sex workers
nationwide were infected with the virus. In some provinces, the
rate was as high as 48 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Attract Foreign Investment to Tax-Free Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will set up tax-free industrial
parks and commercial areas to offer new opportunities to foreign
investment and generate more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Investment and Collaboration Minister Ibrahim
Ferradaz told a press conference today that the decision was made
by the Council of the State Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the tax-free zones, industrial, commercial, agricultural and
livestock, technological and service activities will be performed
under a special system.
</P>
<P>
The similarly arranged industrial parks will allow
predominantly industrial performances and supporting services.
</P>
<P>
Concessionaires and operators of these zones will enjoy more
generous privileges in customs, banking, labor, migration and
public order, which were offered as incentives for investment.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers of Cuba
will take charge of granting concessions in the tax-free zones.
</P>
<P>
The validity of the concession, 50 years at most, can be
successively extended, but will not be longer than doubling the
period originally agreed up.
</P>
<P>
While the Cuban Foreign Investment and Collaboration Ministry
largely controls the establishment of operations within the
installations in the zones, concessionaires also have a say herein.
</P>
<P>
Total exemption of taxes on income and the use of labor will be
offered to concessionaires and operators engaged in production,
manufacturing, assembling, processing of finished and semifinished
products and livestock products, during the first 12 years and a
50 percent cut during the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Environmental Problems Blamed on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- African experts and officials today
blamed the unchecked environmental problems in the continent on a
lack of awareness and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-week conference on ''environmental reportings'
organised by the Ghana Journalists Association in capital Accra,
32 environmental experts and officials agreed that ''education"
is the ''prime demand'' for the protection of environment in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
''The people violate the environment because of a lack of
awareness and poverty in their struggle for survival'', said
Ghana's Deputy Minister of Environment, Science and Technology,
Sam Valley.
</P>
<P>
Another local expert regreted that in spite of the ''magnitude
of environmental problems in the west African sub-region, the
media concentrated attention on political issues to the neglect
of other spheres of social development.
</P>
<P>
They said journalists, as ''agenda setters of their
societies", must give prominence to environmental issues which
they said affected every aspect of human existence by creating
awareness about environmental discipline and sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials said there is also a need to educate the
politicians and government leaders of the continent on
environmental issues in a bid to strengthen their ''political
will'' in protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Some of the environmental problems peculiar to the sub-region
are deforestation, desertification, erosion, air and water
pollution and improper national plans.
</P>
<P>
Participants from Nigeria, Ghana, the Gambia, Sierra Leone,
Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin and Cameroun attended the meeting
designated to enhance reporting of environmental issues in the
African continent. enditem

<HEADLINE> South Korea Gets Less Shipbuilding Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean shipbuilders received
orders for 34 vessels weighing 1.47 million gross tons (GT) from
overseas in the first five months of this year, down 33 percent
from the same period last year, the Korea Shipbuilders'
Association (KSA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was attributed to the 2-3 percent price advantage
of Japanese shipbuilders due to the weak Japanese yen, according
to the KSA.
</P>
<P>
"The trend is expected to continue as long as foreign shipping
firms are reluctant to build new vessels because of trends that
suggest a global economic slowdown. So we cannot rule out the
possibility that the total orders this year will decline compared
with that last year," a KSA official said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea received orders for 194 vessels weighing 7.13
million GT from overseas last year.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 figure was a 11.9-percent increase from the 6.37
million GT recorded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the second largest shipbuilding country in the
world following Japan with the annual shipbuilding capacity of
seven million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Lee
Soo-sung today denounced Japan's wartime enslavement of "comfort
women," calling it "representative of past human rights atrocities
committed by imperial Japan."
</P>
<P>
In refuting the recent claim by senior Japanese lawmaker
Seisuke Okuno that the comfort women were engaging in "commercial
activities," Lee said, "these elderly women are not comfort women,
but are victims of violent rape."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean Foreign Ministry expressed deep
regret over the Japanese lawmaker's remarks on comfort women.
</P>
<P>
"We are very sorry about the remarks denying and distorting
facts that even the Japanese government officially admitted in
August 1993," said a statement released by the ministry today.
</P>
<P>
Okuno, a former justice minister, claimed on June 4 that the
sex slaves were engaging in "commercial activities" and weren't
forced to serve in military brothels during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were
recruited as "comfort women" -- a euphemism for sex slaves -- for
the Japanese imperial army as it swept through east and southeast
Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 until Japan's World War
II defeat in 1945.

<HEADLINE> Sharia law urged to be implemented in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of Religious men met in
south Mogadishu today, discussing the ways to implement sharia in
south Mogadishu and all areas under General Mohamed Farah aidid.
</P>
<P>
South Mogadishu Radio reported today these men welcomed the
statement recently made by General Aidid on the implementation of
sharia in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The radio asserted that "Somali scholars" are always ready to
implement Islamic laws in Somalia while foreigners are always
against the holy act all the time.
</P>
<P>
The support of this group came after General Aidid called on
Somali religious men to unite and form an Islamic forum which
would see to it that sharia courts should begin working in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The general did not say how and when the Islamic courts will
be effective. This change of mind by General Aidid on the
religious issue was not taken seriously by most of the religious
scholars.
</P>
<P>
However, jubilant religious sympathizers for General Aidid
fully supported the call made by the general.
</P>
<P>
In an early speech, Aidid once condemned the Islamic sharia
courts in north Mogadishu, considering them to be puppets for
what he called fugitive politicians.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid said he will use tractors to erase all Islamic
courts in north Mogadishu and that the rights of those who lost
their limbs will be restored.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists close to General Aidid claim that the characters,
behavior, and emotions of the general change at times with those
near and dear and those who support him.
</P>
<P>
For instance, when meeting religious groups, General Aidid
would speak mainly about the religious affairs and calls for the
restoration of the rights deprived of them earlier.
</P>
<P>
And when meeting his mujahidin followers, he would tell them
that a special ministry of strugglers will be formed to take care
of them and when talking to women groups he would say he will
share with them all the power of his administration and so forth.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Urges Israel to Show Seriousness on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua here today, urged
the soon-to-be-formed new Israeli government to make "big efforts"
to show its seriousness on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Until now, all that has been said by the Israeli government
is not encouraging, and is characterized with negativity more
than with positivity," Hariri told Xinhua in his Beirut residence.
</P>
<P>
"However, the new Israeli government should start big efforts
to convince the public opinion, of both the Arab states and the
world, that it is serious on the subject of peace," Hariri pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the rightwing Israeli Likud
Party, won a victory over incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres in
the May 29 elections, which has raised fears in the Arab states
that the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations might be derailed.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Middle East region in view of
Netanyahu's election victory, the Lebanese prime minister said,
"Until now, things do not seem clear, and we are overwhelmed by a
negative impression."
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts made by the Lebanese government, especially
by the prime minister himself, to attract more international
contributions to a proposed consultative committee were
interrupted by the Israeli elections, adding that he hoped that
the efforts could be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are now waiting for the United States, the sponsor of the
peace process, to ask us to continue the negotiations regarding
the consultative committee and to set up the mechanism for its
execution," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
The committee is aimed at drawing international aids for
rebuilding the war-devastated infrastructure in south Lebanon and
in the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Touring Europe last month, the Lebanese prime minister
announced that his country needed 1 billion U.S. dollars per year
in the next five years to continue the reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Sunni prime minister said his government would
continue to implement the plan it laid down when he took office in
October 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan contained three basical points, including
enhancing the national security, carrying out the programs of
reconstruction and restoring Lebanon's position in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I think that these three points are being equally carried out
at the present," Hariri underlined.
</P>
<P>
He denied that there are major difficulties hindering the
reconstruction process, noting that "the important difficulty, if
any, is the financing which we are trying to overcome."
</P>
<P>
Foreign countries, mainly the oil-rich Gulf states, had
promised to offer loans and grants of 2,600 million dollars until
August 1995, and the Lebanese government has also issued a large
quantity of Euro-bonds to accumulate capital for the ambitious
reconstruction plan masterminded by Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has achieved improvements in the fields of security and
economy in the past four years, the most remarkable of which is
the revaluation of the Lebanese currency by over 30 percent to the
present level of 1,570 Lebanese pounds to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth of the Lebanese economy reached an average of 7
percent in the last three years, which has also helped enhance
the confidence of the Lebanese people.

According to a report reaching here today, the vessel, identified
as the Zolotitsa, left the Liberian capital 11 days ago and
is currently off Lome, Togo, which has refused it to dock.
</P>
<P>
About 368 passengers are aboard the vessel, which is lacking
in food, water and medicine and having mechanical troubles.
The Togolese authorities have apparently provided some food and water,
but sent it back out to sea on Wednesday night,
</P>
<P>
The United Nations earlier urged west African states to allow
the ship to dock, while the United States indicated it could
provide some financial or material aid to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
''We are urging diplomatically as well as politically that
Nigeria, Benin or Togo allow this ship to land,'' said the US
State Department Spokesman, Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
''That is the humanitarian thing to do. And the United States
is willing to provide necessary food, water and medicine to the
refugees,'' said Burns. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkish Welfare Party Leader Gets Mandate to Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
today gave the mandate for forming a new government to Necmettin
Erbakan, chairman of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) which came
first at the general elections in December.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the president's press office said that
Demirel made this nomination following today's consultations with
all other parliamentary party leaders and the resignation of
Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that at present, no parliamentary party can
be in power itself.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Demirel assigned Necmettin Erbakan,
leader of the RP which has the most seats in the parliament, to
form the government, it said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz resigned due to the Turkish Constitutional Court's
cancellation of the vote of confidence in March for the
center-right coalition government between the ANAP and True Path
Party (DYP), and DYP's opposition to the government led by Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
After the general elections in December, Demirel assigned
Erbakan to form a coalition government in January. But Erbakan
failed to find a partnership in the parliament for the formation
of the coalition and returned the mandate to Demirel.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade With Eastern US on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China's trading activities with
the eastern region of the United States have been increasing
rapidly for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the newest report of the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey, commodities from both sides passing through
local transport facilities hit 5.5 billion U.S. dollars in value
in 1995, up from 2.7 billion dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"This doubled in value and grew faster than any other country,"
said Henry Raimondo, chief economist of the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Port Authority, established in 1921, covers a wide range of
business scope, from management of harbor, bridges and tunnels
to running the three major international airports of the region.
</P>
<P>
"China's share of the region's trade increased from 2.4 percent
in 1991 to 3.9 percent in 1995," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the growth in China's trade was across
all the modes. Exports increased by 94 percent, while imports more
than doubled, growing by 102 percent.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, the
economist said, "We are very much concerned about the disputes,
because China is a growing trade partner for this region."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to analyze if the list (of sanction) put out by
the U.S. trade representatives will have a disproportion of impact
on this region," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has shown an impressive growth rate over
the past several years.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be foolish to ignore how important China can be for this
region," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Team Arrives in Baghdad for Discussion of Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. team arrived here today for
discussion with Iraqi officials on the distribution of food and
medicine for Iraqis under the oil-for-food accord signed between
Iraq and the U.N. on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by Raymond Sommereyns, director of West Asian
Affairs at the United Nations, comprises six experts specialized in
oil and customs affairs.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Sommereyns said that his mission was sent by
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to ensure that accord
can be implemented as soon as possible. "It is a technical
mission, we will probably stay here for one week," he added.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Iraq, the six-member team will also survey
sites related to oil exports and the import of humanitarian
supplies desperately needed by Iraqis who have been suffering
tremendously from six years of the sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the oil-for-food deal by Iraq and
the U.N., the Iraqi government has stepped up its efforts to get
everything ready for an early export of limited quantity of oil to
pay for the food and medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
A detailed plan for exporting of oil and distribution of food
and medicine, which is to be submitted to the U.N. for discussion,
is expected to be finalized soon by the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting held on Thursday, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein expressed his desire for a quick implementation of the
partial oil sale accord, allowing Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months, the first in six years
of the U.N. sanctions, to pay for the foodstuff and medicine.

MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged his ruling party members to stop their acrimonious
debates on the constitution amending and concentrate their energy
on improving the people's life.
</P>
<P>
He said regional chairmen and senior leaders of the party
should focus on the pending items in the common

</P>
<P>
"The highest objective is a better life for the Filipinos that
is sustainable and permanent," he added.

<P>
The opposition has vigorously objected to amending the
constitution.

<P>
Under the present charter, the president cannot run for
re-election. The constitution provides for a fixed six-year term
for the president and the vice president.

Ramos himself reiterated several times that he will not run for
a second term in accordance with the constitution.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fairness Worried for Bangladeshi Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- With Bangladesh now set on an
apparently irreversible track for general elections next week, the
focus of attention has been shifted to law-enforcing agencies for
their role in maintaining law and order to ensure fairness of the
polls.
</P>
<P>
All political parties and ambitious individuals contesting the
June 12 polls have pledged their full cooperation with the
authorities under a non-party caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
However, violence and tension have been haunting the run-up to
the polls, the weekly Dhaka Courier noted in its latest editorial.
</P>
<P>
Both the major power contenders -- the ex-ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and the former largest opposition party,
the Awami (People's) League (AL) -- have announced that winning
the coming elections is a "life and death" question for them.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that such desperate wording might forebode likewise
attempts, including unlawful means, to win a majority, one local
analyst said it was difficult to envisage that the coming polls
would be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
The AL accused President Abdur Rahman Biswas, who is a BNP
member and controls the country's defense and armed forces, of
serving the BNP's "well-planned conspiracy" to foil the polls.
</P>
<P>
The BNP retaliated by charging the AL with creating anarchy in
the army in its attempt to grab power "through the back door."
</P>
<P>
On May 20, the then chief of army staff A.S.M. Nasim and six
other senior army officers were sacked from their posts and put
under military custody by the Defense Ministry under President
Biswas for his involvement in an alleged mutiny backed by an
unnamed political party.
</P>
<P>
The developments, though seemingly in favor of the president,
are far from making things easier for holding the coming polls as
they have been widely interpreted in terms of political and
partisan confrontation between the former ruling party and the
former opposition.
</P>
<P>
Local observers warned that the country's election and
post-election scenario would be adversely affected if any final
word is said on the incident before the votes are cast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deaths and injuries of political activists are
adding to the dark clouds over the country.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday alone, at least 80 persons were injured in clashes
between BNP and AL supporters in Chittagong, the largest port
city in Southeast Bangladesh, and Mymensingh district in the
north.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the caretaker government led by Chief Adviser M.
Habibur Rahman appeared determined to accomplish its main task of
holding a free and fair election. "Violence won't be tolerated,"
Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Since the caretaker government took over power in early April,
4,000 fire arms and a huge quantity of explosives and ammunition
have been recovered by the police while 40,000 people arrested for
possession of illegal arms and on various criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Wednesday, the country's law-enforcing agencies
mapped out measures to rally and coordinate efforts for a peaceful
election.
</P>
<P>
Reports said 400,000 law-enforcing agency members will be
deployed across the country to maintain law and order to ensure
fair and peaceful polls. Some 40,000 of them started their
deployment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the chief adviser's declaration of his "full
confidence" in the law-enforcing agencies, law and order remain at
the center of widespread worries for the fairness of the coming
elections in Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Foreign Ministry today
summoned the Turkish charge d'affaires in Athens and conveyed a
verbal note protesting reported Turkish violations of Greece's
airspace over the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The verbal note was conveyed by Foreign Ministry Director
General in Charge of Greek-Turkish Affairs George Savvaidis to
Turkish Charge d'Affaires Tacan Ildem.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
briefed the ambassadors of the European Union member states
accredited in Athens as well as the ambassadors of the U.N.
Security Council permanent members on "the escalations of Turkish
provocations" and Greece's arguments on the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Greek government, Turkish warplanes violated
Greek national airspace and infringed the Athens Flight
Information Region Thursday in at least 15 instances over the
eastern Aegean, mainly east of the island of Chios.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos also left open the prospect of Prime Minister Costas
Simitis personally sending letters to international personalities
on the recent Turkish provocations, in the context of a campaign
being launched by the government to brief foreign governments and
the international public opinion.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Renews Appeals to Donor Countries for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today renewed his appeals to the donor
countries to honor their pledges of providing financial aid to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to representatives from 30 donor countries which are
meeting in the Gaza Strip, Arafat said that the Palestinian
autonomic areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are heading for
starvation due to the closure imposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also urged the Israeli government to
transfer 30 million U.S. dollars in tax revenues to help ease the
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly issued such calls to the donor
countries, which pledged to provide 2.4 billion dollars in aid,
for living up to their promises.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side complained that more than 400 million
dollars should have been provided this year under the commitments
made during a January donors conference, but only 27 million
dollars had been produced by May.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the United States in early May, Arafat won
President Bill Clinton's promise to persuade the donor countries
to deliver the aid to help boost Palestinian economic revival.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian autonomic areas, targets for Israel's
retaliation against terror attacks by Islamic extremists, are
suffering from severe economic difficulties due to the crippling
closure imposed by Israel since March after Islamic terrorists'
suicide bombings killed 58 people in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The closure left about 60,000 Palestinians losing their jobs
in Israel, and inflicted a daily economic loss of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government started relaxing the closure
immediately after the May 29 elections, allowing Palestinian
workers over the age of 35 to return to their jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, some 32,000 Palestinian workers were issued work
permits to work in Israel.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Is Tehran-Manama Crisis Over? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Is the crisis between Tehran and
Manama over even though Bahrain and Iran degraded their
diplomatic relations from ambassador level to charge d'affaires
one?
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats and neutral observers hold that the crisis
between the two countries has not yet been over and the tension
will continue to remain for a while.
</P>
<P>
In fact, this is not the first time for Bahrain to accuse Iran
of interfering in its internal affairs and supporting
terrorism. Tehran has been accused of having a hand in the
turmoil in Bahrain for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The tension in relations between Iran and Bahrain was
due to the religious riots in October, 1994, and finally led to
the expulsion of diplomats from both sides.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from an Arab country who asked for anonymity told
Xinhua that it seems very hard for Iran to give up its attempt in
Bahrain because Iranian authorities have persisted in exporting
the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, Iranians will never forget that 60 percent
of the total population in Bahrain are their Shiite brothers and
sisters. So it is their divine duty to support them.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst said on condition of anonymity that many
Iranians still maintain that Bahrain is part of the Iranian
territory for the fact that Iran had ruled Bahrain for 180 years
from 1602 to 1820.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iranians believe that they have the justification of
building up pro-Tehran forces inside Bahrain, and foreign forces
will control the tiny island country, which will constitute a
threat to the national security of Iran, if Iranians fail to do so.
</P>
<P>
However, it is a matter of survival for Bahrain's ruling
al-Khalifa family which belong to the Sunni sect. Bahrain, which
has a population of 563,000 in a territory of 662 square
kilometers, faces a major threat from a big regional power, Iran.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstance, specialists predicted that Bahrain
might follow Kuwait's example to turn to the United States for
protection.
</P>
<P>
They said that Bahrain will ask for more foreign forces
from not only the United States but also other countries such as
Britain which had occupied the oil-rich country for 150 years until
1971.
</P>
<P>
The military forces of foreign countries, the United States in
particular, will naturally constitute a grave threat to the
security of Iran.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Mourns Former Head of State Tito Okello </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua)-National mourning day is observed in
Uganda today in honour of former Head of State Tito Okello who
died here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Flags flew at half-mast in Kampala and other cities all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
The burial took place at his ancestral home in Namu Kora,
northern Uganda, this afternoon, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni and his wife Janet yesterday visited
Okello's home at Mutungo near Kampala, to pay their last respects
to the late head of state.
</P>
<P>
General Tito Okello came back in November 1993 after nearly
eight years of exile in the neighboring states of Sudan, Tanzania
and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Ugandan interim parliament passed a bill,
permitting Okello to come back home and giving him all benefits
as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
Okello masterminded the coup ousting the Obote regime
in July 1985 and later he was instated as the Head of State of
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He left Uganda on January 24, 1986, shortly before the
National Resistance Army led by the incumbent President Yoweri
Museveni captured Kampala.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Is Tehran-Manama Crisis Over? (II) (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran announced Thursday that it had summoned its ambassador
from Bahrain in protest against the Bahrain government's charges
that Iran was interfering in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has to recall its ambassador from Manama because
Bahrain had first quietly withdrew its ambassador from
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Bahraini ambassador had returned home,
Bahrain Information Minister Mohammed al-Muttawa announced Monday
that Iran was involved in a plot to overthrow the Bahraini
government.
</P>
<P>
Muttawa also said that 29 Bahrainis had confessed that they
planned to topple the ruling family and establish an Iranian-style
government.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Bahrain information minister naturally
dealt a blow to the Iranian Islamic regime and brought it into a
very awkward position.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts noted that the event and Bahrain's
charge against Iran would seriously affected Iran's image in
the Persian Gulf region since it is trying to join in the
confidence-building program with Arab countries in a bid to
thwart international isolation led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Iran and Bahrain would naturally affect the
relations between Iran and other Arab countries such as the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
To confront such allegations, Iran made an instant response to
the Bahraini charge at the same day. Iranian Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi strongly refuted allegations of any
Iranian interference in the internal affairs of other countries,
including Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He called the Bahraini allegations against Iran as "totally
baseless."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, two cabinet members of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's government -- Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati -- denied any Iranian
interference in Bahraini affairs and called on the Bahraini
authorities to stop accusations against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said Bahrain officials are mistaken if they think they
can solve their country's internal problems by making accusations
against others.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Qatari Ambassador to Tehran Ali Abdul Aziz
al-Kwari, Besharati said, "Accusing other countries will prove the
ground for presence of foreign powers in the Persian Gulf
sensitive region and will make the enemies of peace and security
very happy."
</P>
<P>
The statements revealed that the main worries of the Iranian
leaders are the presence of foreign forces, especially the
U.S. forces, in the region, instead of the deteriorating relations
with the tinny island country of Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Calls for Arab Unity to Face Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz called here today for a revival of the Arab unity to
encounter the challenge caused by a victory of Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israeli rightwing Likud leader, in the May 29
elections.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in his office this afternoon,
Boueiz said that a meeting of the Syrian, Egyptian and Saudi
Arabian heads of state in Damascus today was a threshold to a
"more comprehensive Arab summit."
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are observing Israel's reshaping its new
policy, and observing the worry resulted from Netanyahu's
election victory due to the traditional position of Likud Party,"
Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
he said, "It is necessary to reshape the new Arab policy and to
revive the Arab unity to encounter this challenge."
</P>
<P>
The victory of Netanyahu, who defeated incumbent Prime Minister
Shimon Peres in the Israeli elections, has raised doubts in Arab
states on the prospect of the Middle East peace process. Netanyahu
has 45 days to form a new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that today's meeting in Damascus held by Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz was "in
preparation for a more comprehensive Arab summit."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Netanyahu's recent remarks about
Israel's refusal to retreat from Golan Heights, the Lebanese
minister said, "If Netanyahu upholds the traditional criteria of
the Likud Party, I think that the peace process will be in
danger, and the region will face big challenges in the next
stage."
</P>
<P>
"But there are some elements which could make Netanyahu's
policy to gradually become in the more realistic direction," he
said, noting that is why he preferred to wait and see a
possibility to resume the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz listed the three elements according to which the
Israeli new policy would be defined: a transitional stage of
Netanyahu from the candidate capacity to a responsible position,
the nature of a coalition which Likud Party had to set up for the
formation of the new government, and an expected meeting between
Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Governments which possess
suspects of the Rwandese genocide of 1994, have been called upon
to co-operate with the International Tribunal for Rwanda (ITR) to
make the work of the tribunal move faster.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the ITR deputy Honore Rokotomanana during
a press briefing held at the Arusha International Conference
Center today.
</P>
<P>
He complained that some countries are reluctant to co-operate
with the court, especially in extraditing the suspects to
Tanzania, as a result, delaying the prosecution process.
</P>
<P>
Rokotomanana spoke highly of the good co-operation from
the governments of Zambia and Rwanda. The ITR has been facing
several problems including that of how to protect the
witnesses, he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prosecutor said that the tribunal needs 80
investigators, but only 30 invstigators are available at present.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is reported that four suspects who are
provisionally detained in Cameroon are expected to be transferred
to the tribunal soon.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Prime Minister Defends Non-party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's Acting Prime
Minister Sishayi Nxumalo today lashed out at local and foreign
pressure groups which call for a multi-party democracy to replace
the kingdom's existing non-political party system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of parliament and constituency leaders
during the launch of a government publication, Nxumalo said they
should learn from African countries where there have been no
peace since they adopted the political party system.
</P>
<P>
Nxumalo defended Swaziland's non-party parliament system where
two thirds of the senators were appointed by King Mswati III, as
well as the prime minister and cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi people have tried the multi-party style of
constitution at independence, but within five years the system
proved unsuited to Swaziland's close knit, non-tribal society,
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that recent civil unrest and violent
demonstrations, which were sparked off by emerging unofficial political
groups in Swaziland, showed that the country was ''not yet ready
for political parties''.
</P>
<P>
''The term democracy should be defined as a system which best
suits that country's background and needs of its people,'' added
Nxumalo.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties are banned. Mswati's father late King Sobhuza II outlawed
all political activities when he suspended the constitution in
1973.

<HEADLINE> Britain Forecast to Be Ousted From G7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain will be ousted from its
ranking as one of the seven biggest world economies in the next 20
years and its influence in international organizations reduced,
according to a leaked Treasury document.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported today that the substantial
document, called Strategic Considerations for the Treasury 2000 to
2005, was drawn up by officials to help the most powerful
government department remodel itself for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
It said that the United Kingdom's role in international
organizations, the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, the
International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and the World Trade Organization, will "change as
we move down the ranking."
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing economies will demand "great political power"
in these organizations, it said. Therefore, it argued for the
Treasury to draw up plans to reform them in such a way that the
U.K. can "retain influence in the future."
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that "if recent growth trends continue," China
will become the "single largest nation" in 2015. It predicted
India will be the fourth-largest economy, Brazil sixth and
Indonesia seventh.
</P>
<P>
While the United States, Japan and Germany will remain in the
top seven, France, the U.K. and Italy will slip into the second
division, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The document highlighted the U.K.'s main weakness as its
reliance on exports markets, predicted to "grow more slowly than
world trade."
</P>
<P>
The pessimistic prediction came ahead of next week's
publication of a white paper on competitiveness, which will
highlight the skills gap between the U.K. and its competitors.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Stresses Need for Direct Talks Basis on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali has emphasised to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash the urgent need to find a basis for direct talks between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides, Ghali's resident
representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel said today.
</P>
<P>
Ghali outlined his views to Denktash at Thursday's meeting in
Istanbul, according to Feissel, who has just returned here from
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Various issues relating to the Cyprus problem were discussed
extensively. Ghali underlined the importance of urgently creating
the basis which will enable the two leaders to get together in
direct talks and work toward an overall Cyprus settlement,"
Feissel said at the Larnaca Airport.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "nothing emerged that I would qualify as moving
things forward but perhaps what the secretary-general said might
yield some positive results as the time goes on."
</P>
<P>
Denktash, Feissel said, made remarks and "left a copy of
talking points with Ghali but that is not a paper in the sense of
a proposal."
</P>
<P>
Ghali is due to meet Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides Tuesday
in Geneva. Ghali's special representative for Cyprus, Han
Sung-joo, as well as Feissel will also attend the Geneva meeting.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said Monday's killing of a Greek Cypriot soldier in
the U.N.-controlled buffer zone was also on the agenda of the
Ghali-Denktash meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ghali voiced concern and sadness at the needless loss of
life and said everything must be done so that such things do not
repeat themselves," Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also stressed that the U.N. believes there
should be further unmanning along the ceasefire line in those
areas where the two sides are in close proximity and that the two
sides should not carry loaded weapons along ceasefire line.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. will pursue these two goals with the military on
both sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Denktash neither accepted nor opposed the
U.N. position on this matter. The U.N. intends to talk to the
military on both sides to try and reach an arrangement on the
unmanning.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
took control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong U.N. peace-keeping force patrols the
180-kilometer long buffer zone across this East Mediterranean
island.

<TEXT>
<P>
New York, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China Trade Expo'96, the seventh
of its kind ever held in New York, opened here today, providing
another great opportunity for businessmen from China and the
United States to do business.

research achievements which will help visitors to have a general
view of the latest economic development of China.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech delivered at an inauguration ceremony
held at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, An Chengxin, Vice
Chairman of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade
and China Chamber of International Commerce said that the United
States is the world's largest developed country and China is the
largest developing country and the two giants are highly
complementary in the economic and trade fields. There exists great
potential for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China had done a great deal to improve its
investment environment and enlarge its scope of cooperation with
outside world.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that with joint efforts of Chinese
and U.S. businessmen the economic and trade cooperation between
China and the United States will surely develop further on the
existing basis.
</P>
<P>
Another main speaker is Mei Ping, Consul General of Consulate
General of China in New York. He recalled the rapid development of
trade and economic relations between China and the United States
in the past few years. "Last year, according to the Chinese
Statistics, the total trade volume reached 40.8 billion U.S.
dollars, while the figure provided by the U.S. customs was much
higher."
</P>
<P>
"Its is our common belief that further development of economic
and trade relations between the two countries are in the best
interest of China and the United States," he said.

countries, "many of them are not trade-related ones, but they
hinder the smooth development of economic and trade relations."
"The annual debate on the renewal of China's MFN status has
created a strong sense of uncertainty among the business circles
on both sides. The threat of sanctions has always invited
counter-sanctions and therefore threatened to trigger off a trade
war, in which both sides will stand to lose."
</P>
<P>
He thanked American businessmen for their tremendous amount of
work to help maintain MFN treatment for China. "We hope that we
could have their continued support in our joint efforts to solve
this issue once and for all."

BELGRADE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini, who presides over the EU Council of Ministers, and President
of the European Commission Jacques Santer visited Sarajevo today,
opening their two-day tour of the states emerging from the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Dini and Santer met first with Muslim Prime Minister Hasan
Muratovic, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Muratovic told reporters that the European

<P>
Dini and Santer had also met in Sarajevo with Bosnian Serb
Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic and High Representative for Bosnia
Carl Bildt, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Dini told reporters that the talks had focused on the
organization of Bosnia's elections, because the international
community believed it was crucial for the implementation of the
Bosnia peace process that the elections be held by September 14 at
the latest.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, the elections securing freedom of movement,
large-scale repatriation of refugees, pluralism of media and
freedom of association for political purposes were the minimum
conditions foe a fair and free election in Bosnia, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister also said these conditions had not been
met so far, and there were still three months to go before
September during which time he said a lot could be done.

After their several-hour stay in Sarajevo, the two EU officials
then arrived in Belgrade later today for talks with Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic to discuss regional issues.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav-IMF Talks to Be Held in Geneva Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Talks between a Yugoslav
delegation and representatives of the International Monetary Fund
will resume in Geneva on June 13-14, the Yugoslav Information
Secretariat said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government's commission for relations with the IMF
and and other international financial organizations and commission
for following the working groups of the peace implementation
council held a joint session, chaired by Yugoslav Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic, and reviewed activities and bases for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming talks between the Yugoslav delegation, headed by
Belgrade School of Economy Professor Oskar Kovac, and IMF
representatives will be held in keeping with the Yugoslav
goverment's commitment and decision to secure a speedy
normalization of relations with international financial and trade
organizations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav delegation failed to reach an agreement with IMF in
their last talks early April in Paris because Yugoslavia insisted
on being the sole successor of the former Yugoslavia. The failure
to join IMF has prevented Yugoslavia gaining access to hard
currency credits it needs to revive its economy, which is
virtually at standstill despite the suspension of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation to the talks was expected primarily to
discuss legal and economic aspects of regulating Yugoslavia's
status in the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia will try to resolve the issue of its status in the
IMF in a pragmatic way, which can satisfy both sides, without
harming any of them," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> University of California to Curb Backdoor Admissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Political influence in admission
was existing in many U.S. universities, but the University of
California now took the lead to curb the backdoor activities, an
Associated Press report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At universities around the country, trustees, alumni, big
donors and politicians have long used their influence to get
students into top schools, while admissions officials balanced the
school's needs against its standards, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It's something that has always been entrenched," Stanley
Henderson, associate vice president for enrollment at the
University of Cincinnati, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I would venture to say there is no moderately selective
institution anywhere in the United States that has not had
legislators or donors or trustee members acting as advocates for
children or the children of associates," Henderson added.
</P>
<P>
After reports revealed that VIPs had been using influence on
behalf of donors and friends in admissions, the University of
California's Board of Regents in May adopted a resolution warning
that regents and elected officials "should not seek to influence
inappropriately the outcome of admissions decisions beyond sending
letters of recommendation."
</P>
<P>
However, some say that the resolution is vague. It does not
define "inappropriate" intervention and provides no punishment for
violations, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Smith Says No Change of Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the NATO-led Bosnia
peace Implementation Force Admiral Leighton Smith said today that
his departure would not alter the mission of the 60,000-strong
force.
</P>
<P>
"There will not be a major change of mission," Smith, who is to
be replaced by American Admiral Joseph Lopez in a few days, told
reporters in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the situation in Bosnia, Smith said that the
West did not want to see an ethnically divided Bosnia and he
accused local politicians of lacking the will to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the number of NATO troops in Bosnia would not
be reduced until the Bosnia elections, scheduled for
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
"The latest guidance I have got is I will not reduce the force
until the elections. After the elections gradual scale down will
commence but until December 20 I will have an effective fighting
force," Tanjug quoted the outgoing IFOR commander as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time a NATO official has said that the
Bosnia peace implementation force will remain in Bosnia when
IFOR's one-year mission expires at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik
said today in Serb stronghold Pale that IFOR would have an
important role in the expected elections in Bosnia, Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik held talks with Smith today in Pale and the two sides
discussed the freedom of movement, the opening of the Banja Luka
airport for commercial flights, cooperation with the Hague war
crimes tribunal and the endangered position of Serbs in Sarajevo,
the news agency added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations General
Assembly today appropriated 1.44 billion dollars to finance
peace-keeping activities and 63.6 million dollars to finance the
International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The new budget for peace-keeping operations represents more

The General Assembly took action on 23 draft resolutions and
five draft decisions contained in 22 reports of the Fifth

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks staged a stunning
turnaround Friday, transforming the latest inflation scare into a
buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.92 to 5,697.11,
recovering from an 85-point plunge in the first half hour of
trading.
</P>
<P>
Before the stock market opened, the Labor Department reported
that payroll jobs surged by 348,000 last month, more than double
what had been expected. It again added to pressures that could
push up wages and consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
More spending can lead to rapid inflation, which hurts the
value of fixed-income investments such as bonds. It also
heightened concerns the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
to slow the economy -- a negative for corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond ended at 7.03 percent,
but stocks began to rally toward the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 8 to 3 on the New York
Stock Exchange, rebounding from an early margin of more than
14-to-1. NYSE volume totaled 445.54 million shares at the closing,
down slightly from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.49 to 360.61, but the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.28 to 673.31.

The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.76 to 1,229.76, rebounding
from a loss of more than 25 points, and the American Stock

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says Sarajevo Serbs Harassed by Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Spokeswoman for the U.N. office in
Belgrade Susan Manuel said here today the Serbs who remained in
Sarajevo after March 19 handover have been harassed by Muslim in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The crime rate have increased in the parts of Sarajevo which
Serbs had transferred to the Muslim-Croat federation in March
under the Dayton agreement, she said.
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 Serbs fled the five Sarajevo municipalities before
they were handed over to the Muslim-Croat federation. Only a few
thousand Serbs, most of whom elderly people, remained in their old
homes in hopes of living peacefully with the Muslims the Serbs had
fought for three and half years.
</P>
<P>
But the Serbs who stayed in the capital "are maltreated and
harassed and international police force have stepped up patrols in
Sarajevo," Manuel told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
To check the violence, a special team has been set up to
monitor the region, the U.N. spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the freedom of movement and repatriation of
refugees, Manuel said that this was not being implemented
according to plans and that although no visible lines separated
ethnic communities in Bosnia, a whole wall of other things had
separated them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same press conference, Coordinator of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees for the former Yugoslavia Rene Van
Rooyen said as conditions were far from satisfaction in Bosnia, a
mass repatriation would not be possible at the moment, especially
for refugees from Croatia.
</P>
<P>
So far only 70,000 refugees and displaced persons have returned
to their old homes or settled down in Bosnia. In Croatia, only
6,000 Serb refugees have been allowed to go back home.
</P>
<P>
Two million Bosnian people have become refugees in the past
four years. In Croatia, 250,000 Serbs fled their homes in 1995
when the government troops seized most part of the Serb republic
of Krajina. Many of them flooded into Yugoslavia and could not
return even after the war because the Croatian government has
hampered their return.

Dayton agreement, the Yugoslav news agency said.
</P>
<P>

context was to prepare for the forthcoming elections, which will

Bosnia, it added.

representatives of the five-nation Contact Group agreed in Geneva
last Sunday that the elections in Bosnia speculated for September

improving cooperation, both bilateral with EU member states and
with the organization as a whole, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>

between Yugoslavia and EU member-states is the best possible
contribution to that effect.
</P>
<P>
Santer and Dini arrived here this afternoon from Sarajevo to
discuss the latest development of Bosnian situation, especially
the elections in the war-torn country, with Yugoslav leaders. They
are expected to visit Croatia and Macedonia Saturday before

<HEADLINE> Mercosur GDP Up 19.9 Percent in 1991-1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The South American Common Market
(Mercosur) has chalked up a 19.9 percent increase in the gross
domestic product (GDP) from 1991 to 1995, the Economic Commission
for Latin America (ECLA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The figure exceeded by 5 percentage points the average growth
rate in all of Latin American and the Caribbean countries during
the same period under survey, the ECLA said.
</P>
<P>
The growth can be attributed to the positive performance of the
Argentine economy, which increased by 31.4 percent during the
period.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay registered a 15.9 percent increase in the GDP and
Uruguay an 18.2 percent increase. Brazil recorded a 14.1 percent
rise, the lowest in the four-member Mercosur, the largest trade
bloc in south America.
</P>
<P>
The opening to foreign capital, the drop of inflation and the
increase of inter-regional trade activities are among the factors
that help improve the GDP of the Mercosur countries, namely,
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign telecommunication companies
have expressed a great interest in China's communication markets.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba Electronics Asia Ltd, attending the on-going
International Exhibition on Telecommunication and
Electronic '1996, said that China is currently the world's largest
potential market for telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Other companies attending the exhibition, such as Ericsson
Company and the Alcatel Telecommunication and Cable Group,
expressed the same view about China's telecommunication market.
</P>
<P>
A manager from Ericsson said that they valued China, which may
be the largest and the last big telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson has invested more than one billion US dollars in
China, setting up 13 offices and seven joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Their business volume in China accounted for eight percent of the
the companies total.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Alcatel noted that China has listed the
information industry as a top priority, which provides great
opportunities for world telecommunication and electronics
producers.
</P>
<P>
Alcatel, as the largest telecommunication equipment producer in
the world, entered Chinese market as early as in 1983. It has set
up more than ten joint ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the Ministry of the Electronic Industry
show that China has approved 8,000 foreign-funded companies in
the sector, using foreign funds of more than four billion US
dollars by the end of 1994.

<HEADLINE> OAS Rejects U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American
States (OAS) closed its 26th General Assembly here today with
concerted opposition to the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which was
designed to impose sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Although the issue of the Helms-Burton law was not on the
agenda of the assembly, the participants, after three days of
heated discussions, passed 23-to-1 a resolution rejecting the
U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
The United States promulgated the Helms-Burton law, named after
its sponsors, on March 12 to harden the economic embargo against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The law, criticized by many countries such as Canada, was
criticized for its extraterritorial character, and the OAS
assembly requested the Interamerican Juridical Committee to
analyze its legality in accordance with international law.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech, Richardo Arias, acting Panamanian
foreign minister, said that "We have observed at this assembly two
positive facts, two quality jumps of great scope for the
organization on the one hand, that increase the transparency of
our discussions of contentious themes, which our organization has
tried to avoid for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, (we have observed) that multilateralism has
become a firm ground for democratic debate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from 35 OAS member countries discussed
several themes, such as economic integration, the fight against
drug trafficking and corruption, and the drive against poverty in
the region.
</P>
<P>
At the assembly, OAS foreign ministers also adopted the
"Declaration of Panama on the Inter-American Contribution to the
Development and Codification of International Law," which aims at
defending and perfecting democracy in accordance with the
international law.
</P>
<P>
OAS Adjunct Secretary Christopher Thomas also made a speech at
the closing ceremony, saying that the assembly created a firm
ground to advance the organization's programs in the face of the
21st Century.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares For Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's reservoirs and
irrigation and drainage facilities damaged by last year's floods
have been reconstructed to minimize any damage that might be
caused by flooding this summer.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reports that 80 percent of the damaged or
demolished projects have been renovated so far this year and
prepared to withstand this season's floods which are predicted to
hit certain areas between the Yellow and Huaihe river valleys or
parts of the area between the Yangtze and Huaihe river basins.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, provinces suffering heavily from floods last
year - especially Liaoning, Jilin, Hubei, Hunan and Anhui - have
spared no efforts to reconstruct their water-conservancy projects
as part of a nationwide campaign to ensure a bumper harvest this
year through improving the infrastructures of agriculture and
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Zhang Chunyuan, an official with the Ministry
of Water Resources, as saying that "a good summer harvest is in
sight this year, but local authorities must get well prepared from
possible damage from disasters in the following days."
</P>
<P>
The official called for more investment in measures to minimize
damage from both flooding and drought this year to help guarantee
people's safety, a good harvest and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China has invested a record 29.2 billion yuan on water
conservancy projects since last winter, up 62 percent over the
figure for the same period of last year, with a record 7.9 million
workdays, according to the ministry's latest statistics.

<HEADLINE> New Solar Firm Aims At European Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German joint venture near
Beijing has gone into operation to produce vacuum tubular solar
collectors, aiming at the European market, especially Germany.
</P>
<P>
Located in Sanhe, 50 km outside Beijing in neighboring Hebei
province, Sunda Solar Energy Technology Co Ltd is a high-tech
venture jointly founded by Daimler Benz Aerospace of Germany and
Beijng Sunpu Technology Co., with a total investment of more than
100 million yuan (12 million US dollars), according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The German company holds 51 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
The paper reports the collectors can be used to heat water in
both private homes and large buildings. Taking up four square
meters of floor space each, it is considered to be an ideal model
for the European market.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 units of the collectors will roll off the
assembly lines next year, with 60 percent earmarked for export to
European markets, bearing the trademark of Daimler Benz Aerospace,
the paper quotes Martin Reiss, the venture's general manager as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The technique of the collector, which was developed by Beijing
Sunpu Technology Co., is to absorb solar energy through an
aluminum plate in the tube and heat the water in the tank in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
Lured by the state-of-the-art solar technology, the European
partners said that their commitment to environmental protection
motivated this joint venture, so as to transform central Europe's
sunshine into energy, the paper says.

<P>
BUDAPEST, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States has started to
pay compensation to Hungary for the damages brought by its peace
implementation force (IFOR) stationed in the east European country.
</P>
<P>
Local press said today that the U.S. has provided more than 500
million forint (about 3.3 million U.S. dollars) to Hungary as the
first sum of compensation. The amount of other payments is still
in discussion.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in March between the two countries,
the U.S. agreed to shoulder the complete cost of the damages
caused by traffic accidents involving the U.S. IFOR and 75 percent
of the cost of the damages to roads and buildings incurred in the
IFOR's activities.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has repeatedly complained that the U.S. troops,
stationed on its territory to provide logistics service to the
U.S. IFOR in Bosnia, have brought tremendous damages to its
infrastructure facilities in transportation and other activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO and its partners for peace
(PfP) are scheduled to hold their first joint air exercise outside
NATO territory at Szolnok Air Base, Hungary, from July 22-26, the
Hungarian Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, called Cooperative Chance'96, will be based on a
humanitarian aid operation plan, with elements of peacekeeping,
searching and rescuing.
</P>
<P>
It aims to develop the NATO-PfP interoperability of air forces,
especially at the headquarters level, in order to improve
expertise and procedures that can be used in response to events in
the real world.
</P>
<P>
A NATO-led multinational air headquarters, incorporating PfP
nations, will be set up to conduct live-flying operations and
coordinate all air assets engaged in humanitarian and disaster
relief, air policing, reconnaissance flights, search and rescue
missions in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was expected to show how air assets can contribute
to the full-scale peace support operations, and how to manage the
multinational engagement.
</P>
<P>
So far as many as 15 countries, including the United States,
Germany, Canada, Romania, Slovenia, Poland, Bulgaria, Czech
Republic and Slovakia, are ready to participate in the exercise

<HEADLINE> Philippines' MNLF Drops Major Demand in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) has dropped its demand for a provisional government in
Mindanao, breaking the impasse that stalled the Mindanao peace
talks, the Philippine government chief negotiator said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his report to Philippine President Fidel Ramos, former
ambassador Manuel Yan said that the MNLF was receptive to the
government proposal to form a southern Philippines council for
peace and development and a consultative assembly to assist the
government in administering the 13 provinces and nine cities in
Mindanao as stipulated in the Tripoli Agreement of 1976.
</P>
<P>
This development has paved the way for the resumption of peace
talks with the Muslim secessionist group, probably within the next
two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yan and other government representatives had formal
consultations with the MNLF in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta
last week. The consultations were hosted by the Organization of
Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
"There's no more impasse. We have overcome that. We now have
basis to continue with our negotiations," Yan said after his
meeting with Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has initially pushed for the creation of a provisional
government but the government said it cannot allow this without
calling for a plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
Yan said that the government and MNLF representatives will meet
in Mindanao in two weeks to discuss vital matters.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks at the mixed committee level will focus
on the proposed "transitional implementing structure" for the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has been fighting for autonomy in the southern
Philippines over the past two decades. Thousands of people were
killed during the fighting between government troops and MNLF
members.

<HEADLINE> China Provides Aid to Ukraine for Chernobyl Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China and Ukraine today signed a
document on China's provision of 1-million-yuan (about 120,482
U.S. dollars) aid to help remove the aftermath impact of the
Chernobyl nuclear power station accident.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Chinese Ambassador to Ukraine Pan
Zhanlin and the Ukrainian Minister V.I. Kholeshe in charge of the
protection of civilians from the aftermath impact of the Chernobyl
accident.
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl accident in 1986, the world's worst nuclear
disaster, claimed the lives of 4,300 people and made 350,000
clean-up workers ill, according to Ukraine's official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has said it will close the nuclear power station by
2000. But delays of fund provision by western countries are
threating to postpone the shut-down.
</P>
<P>
The document signed today said the humanitarian aid from the
Chinese government shows the good-will feelings of the Chinese
people towards the Ukrainian people, and their attention and
sympathy towards the Chernobyl victims.
</P>
<P>
Kholeshe expressed gratitude to the Chinese aid, and said it
will help promote the friendly relations between China and
Ukraine.
