   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officer Lakers lineup was thrown into
disarray by other forces, and they could be without both starting
forwards in tonight' season opener against Houston at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox, nursing sore ankles caused by too-hard insoles, was
declard a probable scratch after missing a third straight day of
practice. A couple of hours later, Robert Horry boarded a 5 p.m.
flight home to Houston after he got word that wife Keva was in
labor with their second child. So while Horry welcomes little
Cameron Horry into the world and Fox contemplates his shoe linings,
the Lakers will try to withstand the superstar lineup of the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers' much-vaunted depth will come into play much
sooner than expected as NBA teams test themselves for the first
time after a six-month lockout and an abbreviated training camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (tonight's) game will be basically survival of the
fittest,'' guard Derek Fisher said. ``It won't really be about who
executes the best or whatever. It's basically going to come down to
who has the most key players in the best shape. In the fourth
quarter, (it's) whether or not Shaq (O'Neal) can run up and down
the court, whether or not (Hakeem) Olajuwon can run up and down the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Or for the Lakers, whether any bodies are left.
</P>
<P>
   As practice concluded, coach Del Harris said he would start
Horry at small forward, his old position, in place of Fox, though
Fox might be available off the bench. That meant Horry's
power-forward slot would be taken by Travis Knight, Corie Blount or
Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Horry's pager delivered the news from
Houston. It's possible he could return in time for tipoff tonight,
but more likely, Horry won't be back until Saturday. So if Fox is a
scratch, watch for Kobe Bryant _ itching to win a starting job _ to
start at small forward. That scenario had been ruled out by Harris,
but that was before his other options disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Kobe coming in off the bench,'' Harris had said. ``The
day we start Kobe, if it's for some reason other than illness or
injury, it won't be something that will be temporary. When that
happens, it will be for a period of time, and one would assume, for
the rest of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting or subbing, Bryant said he's fine with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going go out there and I'm going show everyone I'm ready
to play, start or no start,'' he said. ``I'm going to start
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork lineup will have, at least, returning starters
Fisher and Eddie Jones in the backcourt and O'Neal at center.
They'll be tested quickly against a Rockets' team featuring three
of the NBA's 50th-anniversary team, in Olajuwon, Charles Barkley
and Chicago Bulls alumnus Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some legends, they've got some Hall of Famers . .
. and we've got some wanna-be legends on our squad,'' O'Neal said.
``We're gonna be at home and we just have to step up to every
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Those challenges will come fast and furious in the days ahead.
Sunday, the defending conference champion Utah Jazz comes to the
Forum, and on Monday, the Lakers play the Spurs at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   That's three Western Conference powers in four days, and it
doesn't get much better. The Lakers will play road games against an
improved Denver Nuggets team and a hot, young Minnesota
Timberwolves squad, then come home to face Eastern Conference
favorite Indiana. In all, the Lakers face eight playoff teams (San
Antonio twice) from 1998 in their first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we started off and (won) the first 11 straight,''
Harris said. ``You've just got to believe you're going to be as
ready to play as anybody. We're hoping that we can come out of the
gates strong and in that case, you might as well play the good
people.''
</P>
<P>
   They could be aided by a bad-as-he-wants-to-be power forward,
but there was no news on the Lakers' pursuit of free agent Rodman
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' Fisher said, ``I don't think it's going to
happen.''

   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>

   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the

his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

<P>
   Inevitably, the story of the Hashemites has become the story of
the Plucky Little King, who now lies dying in the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan). &QL;

<P>
   Having lost the West Bank, the king had to face the
consequences: Palestinian contempt, and what amounted to an
attempted coup d'etat by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>
<P>
   What he had, he would hold. The Plucky Little King would be a
friend of the West. When a Washington newspaper claimed that the
king had received millions from the CIA, the stories were
suppressed in Amman. &QL;

   Hassan, the youngest brother, married a Pakistani wife, and
devoted himself to Jordan's development before ambition took
control of his loyalty. A friend of the king once dangerously
compared him to Cecil Rhodes.

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   And overnight, the treacherous ally of the beastly Saddam became
again the Plucky Little King. &QL;

<P>
   His appointment of Crown Prince Abdullah as regent may safeguard
the Hashemite inheritance. But the pressures will grow greater in
the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?

The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost

<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   And overnight, the treacherous ally of the beastly Saddam became
again the Plucky Little King. &QL;

<P>
   His appointment of Crown Prince Abdullah as regent may safeguard
the Hashemite inheritance. But the pressures will grow greater in
the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

   IRAN-ANNIVERSARY (Tehran, Iran) _ As Iran marks the 20th

Ittusardjuat already was defrosting a seal. It was an entire ringed
seal about three feet long that the Inuit hunter had caught in the
fertile waters around the island of Igloolik and then allowed to
freeze in the 30-below temperatures until he needed it. But
Ittusardjuat was only dimly aware that the seal was probably
contaminated with dangerous substances like the pesticide DDT and
industrial compounds like PCBs, which are released into the air all
over the earth and drift north. By Anthony DePalma.

AS AID IS CUT, HOSPITALS PREPARE FOR A TOUGH YEAR 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two years of cuts in government aid, a sharp
increase in uninsured patients and the growing dominance of managed
care, hospitals in the New York area are bracing for what many
people say will be one of the most difficult fiscal years ever.
</P>
<P>
   With recent proposals from Albany and the White House that would
squeeze hundreds of millions of dollars more from local medical
centers, hospital executives and many health care experts are
predicting significant budget cuts and warning of possible hospital
closings and an erosion in patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to be hit hard are the city's public hospitals and
others that serve the poor and are most dependent on income from
the government health insurance programs, Medicaid and Medicare.
Last year, amid rising fiscal problems, the public hospital system
laid off more than 900 workers. The system's president says as many
as 1,000 more jobs are likely to be lost in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   New York's prestigious private medical centers seem worried as
well. Among the many that have already started to make reductions
in their new budgets is New York Presbyterian Hospital, where every
department has been asked to cut spending by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts proposed last week in Gov. George E. Pataki's budget
would amount to $727 million to $850 million in Medicaid spending
in the state. This week, President Clinton said he wanted to
squeeze $400 million more out of the state's share of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the dire prognostications from the hospitals largely are
lacking in specifics.
</P>
<P>
   While the hospitals are not yet required to close their books on
1998, the Healthcare Association of New York State, a trade group
representing hospitals, recently surveyed more than a dozen
hospitals and found that for the first nine months of the year,
profits fell an average of 1.8 percent _ from 2.24 percent of
revenues to a razor-thin four-tenths of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Pataki issued his budget, his administration was
arguing that the hospitals were in far better fiscal shape. On Jan.
26, The Health Department issued a report _ based on data from 1997
_ that showed hospitals recording a 42 percent gain in net profits
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state used the wrong measure for looking at net income,''
said William O. Cleverley, president of the Center for Healthcare
Industry Performance Studies, a health care data organization in
Columbus, Ohio. ``They should have looked at revenues made from
patients, less expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals are also at the mercy of large economic forces
that go far beyond fine points of accounting. The Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 decreased Medicare revenues for hospitals nationally by
$44 billion, or $3 billion for hospitals in New York City. This
reduction alone peeled about 4 percent off net profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Further, New York has a high rate of uninsured patients. The
number of uninsured under the age of 65 rose to 19.1 percent in
1997, versus the national average of 17.6 percent, draining many
hospitals' profits. What is more, the city has a high percentage of
Medicaid recipients, who have never been a great source of profits.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, managed care has taken over a significantly
higher portion of the hospitals' business in the last two years,
and many hospitals have seen reimbursement rates come down greatly.
They owe a lot of money _ 37 percent of the money invested in New
York hospitals comes from debt, compared with the national average
of 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears of further bad news from the state capitol: the
governor has said he wants to use only 30 percent of the state's
share of the tobacco settlement for health care. This spring,
legislators will debate the state's continued financial commitment
to graduate medical education and the charity pools used to help
hospitals deal with the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Cleverley's independent report ranked the financial condition of
hospitals in New York state the second worst in the nation. The
bond-rating agencies that monitor hospital bonds have offered poor
outlooks on several local hospitals in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospital executives are feeling grim about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, we lost $4 million and in 1998, we will have a loss
of at least twice that,'' said Frank J. Maddalena, the chief
executive officer of Brookdale University Hospital and Medical
Center in Brooklyn. He asked doctors to take a 15 percent pay cut
this year, and trimmed staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the Health and Hospitals Corp., which runs the city's public
hospitals, a variety of administrative cuts are under way, said Dr.
Luis Marcos, the agency's president. Of the jobs expected to be
lost this year _ none affecting doctors or nurses _ about 500 will
involve layoffs and 300 will come from attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is a limit to how many administrative cuts
hospitals can make. James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United
Hospital Fund, a health care philanthropic group, said, ``At some
point there is a loss of services to people.''

BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS WELCOMES `THE GREATEST' 
</HEADLINE>

 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took more than three decades, but Muhammad Ali
finally made the cover of the Wheaties cereal box, which in popular
culture has become synonymous with athletic achievement and high
esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Ali and his wife, Lonnie, were at a news conference at Madison
Square Garden on Thursday to unveil the cereal box cover that has a
photo of Ali in his prime throwing a punch. Ali becomes the first
boxer to be on the cover of the Wheaties box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty picture,'' Ali, 57, said. ``That's when I
weighed 212 pounds, and now I weigh 250. I'm still pretty though,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 75th anniversary of the cereal. General
Mills, the company that manufactures Wheaties, is holding a
campaign asking consumers to vote for their 10 favorite athletes
who have graced the cereal box's cover.
</P>
<P>
   Ali is not on the ballot, but the company said it would provide
a write-in space.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take so long for Ali, who won a boxing gold medal in
the 1960 Rome Olympic Games, who became the first man to win the
world heavyweight championship three times and who is arguably the
most recognized sports figure in the world, to be on the cover of
the Wheaties box?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of his career in the 1960s he might have been a
little too controversial,'' Lonnie Ali said. ``It's still an honor,
even though it was a long time coming. I think it's the right time.
A celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali was indeed a controversial figure in the 1960s, when he
joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay
to Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his religious beliefs, he refused to be inducted into
the U.S. Army to fight in Vietnam and was banned from boxing for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murphy, the marketing manager for Wheaties, offered one
theory as to why a boxer had never been on the cover of the cereal
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a culture thing,'' Murphy said. ``At the time
when the greatest boxers were boxing, the people weren't ready to
accept them on the cover of the Wheaties box.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the company periodically reviews the covers and
recently did a more thorough search because of the 75th
anniversary. After finding that Ali had not been on the cover, the
company asked Ali about it this past summer and he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muhammad Ali, for the character and the equity of what he
represents, was an easy decision for Wheaties now,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the next boxer to make the cover could be Evander
Holyfield, because ``he's got the type of values and ideals that
Wheaties embodies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conversely, it could be a long time before Mike Tyson, the bad
boy of boxing, makes the cover of the Wheaties box, although Ali
has become a visible supporter of the troubled former heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ali appeared in support of Tyson regaining his boxing license at
a hearing Oct. 19 before the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Last
month, Ali sat ringside for Tyson's comeback bout against Francois
Botha in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a defender of the underdog,'' Lonnie Ali said
of her husband's relationship with Tyson. ``Ali feels people
deserve more than one chance. In his heart of hearts he feels he's
a good person if you peel away the layers of trouble. Muhammad
knows Michael needs a friend, not a critic. Muhammad will always be
there, available to Michael as long as he wants him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will be in a Montgomery County, Md. courtroom Friday to be
sentenced on his plea of no contest to two misdemeanor assault
charges that were filed against him after a traffic accident Aug.
31, in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   One elderly man contended that Tyson punched him in the face and
another said Tyson kicked him in the groin following a
chain-reaction collision in which the car Tyson was a passenger in
was hit from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's wife, Monica Turner, was driving the car. If Tyson draws
jail time, he faces the prospect of having his parole on a rape
conviction in Indiana revoked and could be sent back to prison. &QL;

EXAMINING IMPEACHMENT FOR FARCE, FEMINISM AND CULTURAL SHIFTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Denouncing the impeachment trial of President Clinton
as a farce produced by right-wing zealots, a panel of scholars,
politicians, cultural critics and journalists gathered at Columbia
University Law School on Thursday night to mine the events in
Washington for their cultural significance.
</P>
<P>
   The public discussion, which led off with the satirist Al
Franken and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from Manhattan,
attracted a standing-room-only crowd of over 500 students and
others.
</P>
<P>
   While the event had a moderator _ the novelist Mary Gordon _ the
only major disagreements during the two-hour forum arose over
precisely what kind of farce the impeachment proceedings
constituted. The trial was alternately described as a ``post-modern
coup attempt,'' a fundamental confusion between sins and crimes or
_ at $50 million _ a ``fairly cheap bad movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists also advanced varied explanations for the
developments: a fear of the 1960s, a decade that Clinton
represents, and reporters hungry for scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months a number of prominent academics have been vocal
in criticizing the impeachment proceedings. Last fall,
constitutional scholars and historians circulated an Internet
petition against impeachment. Historians including Stephen E.
Ambrose and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. issued a statement that
called on the public to oppose the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   But the participants at Thursdayt night's boisterous town-hall
style meeting advanced far more off-beat views.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Klein, a doctoral candidate in sociology, elicited
whistles and applause when she proposed that Clinton was the first
man in high office to be persecuted as a woman might be, and was
being made to wear a ``scarlet letter'' for adultery. Ms. Klein
described men's loss of sexual sovereignty as a significant
cultural shift.

MESSIER RETURNS AGAIN, BUT SO DOES RANGERS' OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his second return to Madison Square Garden, Mark
Messier had no goals or assists and his team didn't win. He looked
like one pretty good player on one pretty bad team as the New York
Rangers beat his Vancouver Canucks 8-4. But several of Messier's
former friends and teammates, from both his New York and Edmonton
days, enjoyed successful performances for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves, Messier's left wing in his Ranger days, scored
twice to lead the rout. Wayne Gretzky, who helped Messier fashion
the Edmonton Oilers' dynasty of the 1980s, scored a goal that
equaled Gordie Howe's last major scoring record. Brian Leetch,
Messier's successor as Ranger captain, scored to break a goal-less
drought that had lasted for more than a quarter of the season. John
MacLean _ with little connection to Messier _ also scored twice for
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Rangers 47 points in the Eastern Conference
standings after 50 games, and moved them over Montreal into 10th
place in the conference. Only eight teams will qualify for the
playoffs from each conference. Florida holds eighth place, three
points ahead of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Edmonton, Messier played for the Rangers as their
captain from 1991 through 1997 and led them to the Stanley Cup in
1994. He left for Vancouver as a free agent in July of 1997, a
departure that was surrounded by bitterness with the front office
and disillusionment among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   In his first return to the Garden, an emotional game last
season, Messier scored a key goal and led his new team to a 4-2
victory. The Canucks appear here only once a year. Markus Naslund
scored twice for Vancouver Thursday night. The Rangers led by 7-2
in the fistic third period before Vancouver made the score
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's goal, his first in 10 games, gave him 1,071 for his
career, combining both regular season and playoff games in the NHL
and the World Hockey Association. It tied him with Gordie Howe for
the only major scoring record that Gretzky did not hold coming into
the game. Gretzky left wincing late in the third period after being
boarded by the rookie Bill Muckalt. He has been playing with sore
ribs in recent games.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said the ribs were reinjured in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't hit me that hard,'' Gretzky said, adding that the
impact was ``right where my injury is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said he had taken another pain-killing injection before
the game, but that did not stop the new discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to get worse,'' Gretzky said. ``Best to get in and
ice it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves scored the first two goals of the game, giving him 23 for
the season, most on the team. For six seasons on the Rangers,
Graves was Messier's linemate, Robin to his Batman in Gotham
hockey. Last season, his first in New York without Messier, Graves
scored 23 goals but was not as effective as he had been. This
season represents a revival for Graves, who _ like Brian Leetch and
Ulf Samuelsson _ can become an unrestricted free agent this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had to be one of the greatest displays I've seen in the
National Hockey League,'' Muckler said. ``Graves' first period was
phenomenal. He scored, he checked, he killed penalties. That was
very emotional, I think, to watch him play.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch, who succeeded Messier as Rangers captain, had not scored
a goal in 23 games. But he got one with a wrist shot from the slot
in the third period to give the Rangers a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Messier and Gretzky were in the starting lineups, and Messier's
name drew as many if not more cheers when it was announced. But for
most of the game, Messier's line was matched against Petr Nedved's.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour before the game started, the scene was similar to
Messier's return last season. As soon as the doors opened, dozens
of fans rushed through, wearing jerseys with Messier's name and
number on the back, the fronts showing team logos of the Rangers,
the Canucks or the Oilers. They gathered at the end of the building
where the Canucks were warming up, snapping pictures of their hero,
waving at him, calling his name.
</P>
<P>
   Although he no longer plays for the Rangers, Messier is still
willing to help their front office manage the team. He respects
Leetch immensely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never underestimate Brian's sheer will,'' Messier said
of Leetch's possibly becoming a free agent. ``He's a very
opinionated person, a very strong-willed person and I don't think
I'd push him too far. He's as loyal a person that I think could
play for you. But a loyal person just as quickly can turn
unloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Leetch was asked about Messier's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear a word he said,'' Leetch said, ``but I agree
with everything. I'll let Mark speak for me. It's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves scored twice in the first period, once at even strength
and once on the power play. MacLean and Gretzky made it 4-0 in the
second period until Naslund got one back on the power play 57
seconds before the second intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Graves scored at 8:43 of the first period after MacLean captured
a turnover and sent the puck to Gretzky. After taking Gretzky's
pass, Graves fired from the edge of the right-wing circle, beating
Garth Snow. On the power play, Graves scored at 14:50, again with a
one-time wrist shot, this time from the left side, after Gretzky's
sweet feed.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean scored his 18th of the season at 7:22 of the second
after Snow lost his stick and the Canucks had trouble clearing the
puck from their end. Gretzky got his eighth of the season at 16:21
by one-timing a wrist shot after a pass from Nedved just as a
Ranger power play ended. &QL;

LOOSE ENDS REMAIN IN OVITZ PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON, Calif. _ In terms of detail and content, the proposal by
Michael Ovitz to plant an NFL expansion franchise here has been a
light drizzle. But city officials now have enough information to
convene a Town Hall meeting Saturday to discuss the proposal with
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, the former Creative Artists Agency agent, made a
presentation to NFL owners last week in Miami that included the
parameters of Carson's involvement, most of which were discussed
during past city council meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation said Carson would invest $180 million toward
the construction of the stadium _ ``The Hacienda'' _ and the
adjacent retail mall. Of that, $30 million would be in cash
previously set aside for mall development and up to $150 million
raised through the sale of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Carson's financial investment would be capped at $180 million,
according to the presentation document obtained from City Manager
Jerry Groomes. The bonds would be guaranteed by tax-increment
revenue from the stadium and shops, surcharges on tickets and
parking, and a levy on mall retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will hold a special meeting in Atlanta on Feb. 16 to
discuss expansion and is expected to vote on the matter at the
owners' annual meeting in March. The latest speculation is that the
league will vote to put a 32nd team in L.A. but won't decide on an
ownership group or site until later in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz/NFL issue has become a literal political football in
Carson. Elections for mayor and two council seats will be held
March 2, and incumbents and candidates are taking sides about the
proposed investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of assumptions in the proposal, and several
issues outstanding,'' said Groomes, ``but it spells out where we
stand financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Ovitz document, the city will receive little if any
direct revenue from the stadium or football team. Its profit
participation would come from the mall and increased property
values.
</P>
<P>
   There are no lease terms spelled out in the proposal. That's not
necessarily pertinent, but the Rams and Raiders experiences make it
a question to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of all the points that need to be negotiated. This
is a moving target and there are always new questions to
consider,'' Groomes said. ``But we expect to bring home a tight
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight is not a word one would use regarding other parts of the
Ovitz proposal, those of greatest interest to the NFL. For example:
</P>
<P>
   __ The proposal says Ovitz ``or an affiliate'' will own 35
percent of the franchise. That's the first time anyone other than
Ovitz has been mentioned as a primary owner. At the same time, the
proposal states, in bold type, that Ovitz will be the ``owner'' of
the franchise for NFL voting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It also does not delineate the size of investment by any other
partners. The same names mentioned from day one _ businessmen Ron
Burkle, Gary Wilson and Gabe Brener, and actors Kevin Costner and
Tom Cruise _ are vaguely mentioned. One name now missing, though,
is investment broker Ted Forstmann.
</P>
<P>
   __ Regarding the funding a franchise fee of around $500 million,
Ovitz says he has $200 million in equity (his own cash and that of
his partners), will receive a $100 million loan from Bank of
America (the most the league will allow), and will deliver a
promissory note for $200 million or more for the balance once he is
awarded a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL expansion process has usually been a cash-and-carry
business in the past. For example, Al Lerner, the new owner of the
Cleveland Browns, will have to pay his entire $483 million
expansion nut to the league before the Browns kick off in
September.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the NFL agreeing to a promissory note based
on anyone's assurances. The decision by the New Coliseum group to
add billionaire Eli Broad to its ownership group was a direct
response to league concerns that Ed Roski, who owns the Kings and
is building the Staples Center, was overextended.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ovitz nor his representatives returned phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Town Hall meeting will be held Saturday at 2 p.m. at the
Carson Convention Center.

COMMISSION TO PROBE ATTACK ON PRINCIPAL AS POLICE INVESTIGATION
CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN, DAVID R. BAKER AND PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As police pressed their investigation into the
racially charged beating of Burton Street Elementary School's
principal, the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission began an
inquiry Thursday and city leaders sought to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Principal Norman G. Bernstein has provoked
finger-pointing in the school, neighborhood and school district, as
parents, school board members and administrators struggle with the
possibility that racial conflicts fueled the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home where he was recovering, Bernstein said parents
have criticized him, but he declined to be specific. He said he
does not believe these conflicts led to the attack Monday and
believes he has worked diligently to address concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that hopefully it is an isolated instance,'' he said of
the attack at the campus in the suburban Los Angeles community of
Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley area northwest of
downtown. ``What I want to emphasize is restoring normalcy at the
school. I respect all people, and even if someone is critical of me
-- I respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect all of our parents, even if they disagree with me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old Bernstein said he was beaten unconscious Monday
outside the school by two men who told him: ``We don't want you
here anymore, principal. Do you understand that, white principal?''
</P>
<P>
   For a second day, parents met with administrators and police
privately at the school amid concerns that Bernstein's management
style and his handling of the state-ordered elimination of
bilingual education might have played a role. The parents asked to
meet because they said the police had intimidated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they were getting grilled,'' said district
spokeswoman Socorro Serrano. ``So it was a clearing of the air
between the parents and the LAPD facilitated by the school
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Bernstein heard the attackers speaking
Spanish, but they have no description of them. Parents questioned
Bernstein's story because he called his office before 911, and they
said the men would have used the word ``gringo'' or ``gabacho,''
not ``white.'' Police said they believe Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to doubt Mr. Bernstein's story at all,'' said
Capt. Robert McNamara of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van
Nuys Division.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Victoria Castro drew criticism from the
Anti-Defamation League and Human Relations Commission for saying
parents acted reasonably by asking for a Latino principal ``based
on previous conflicts they have had with the current principal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Race and religion can never be a criteria for leadership, and
it's inexcusable for any public official to call for that,'' said
Joe Hicks, executive director of the county commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is reviewing the case. ``We'll do that by
identifying the problem and coming up with a course that will best
help the school and the community around it,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro stood by her comments and added that she believes it is
reasonable for parents to want a Spanish-speaking principal, but
that race should not disqualify someone for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a parent, and you're not able to communicate with
the principal, it's very frustrating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's office has fielded several complaints about her
comments, she said. Most came from anonymous callers, but the
principals union president also called to complain, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A former principal, Casto said she was shocked that anyone could
think she accepted violence toward school employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I condone attacking a principal or a teacher,''
she said. ``Someone who knows that I was a principal -- how could
they think that?''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Alarcon, whose district includes the school,
said that before the attack, he had offered to meet with Burton
parents and teachers to address problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for the two people who committed the act of
violence, but we don't get any sense from the parents that this is
a racial issue,'' said Alarcon, D-Van Nuys. ``They simply want
their children to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Principals must be sensitive to the needs of the ethnic and
racial communities they serve, but should not be placed on the
basis of the race, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be like saying a Latino can only be principal of a
school with Latino children. I would never espouse that,'' Alarcon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents voiced frustration that conflicts over school issues
could in any way be connected to the violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned how bilingual education would be an issue when
the school has 200 waivers for children to remain in bilingual
classes. Most schools in the San Fernando Valley only have a few
waivers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack does not have to do with Proposition 227. We really
hope and wish that he gets well,'' said Lorena Ayon, 26, speaking
on behalf of a half-dozen parents by her side. ``We're so angry for
what happened to our principal. We wish that he gets well and comes
back to the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial- or ethnic-tinged disputes between parents and principals
are rare, but arguments over educational issues and management are
inevitable in such a large, diverse district, said Dan Isaacs,
assistant superintendent for school operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an extended family. Not everyone in an extended
family is going to agree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Brent, president of Associated Administrators of Los
Angeles, said Bernstein told him he has faced problems at the
school for at least the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Brent said Bernstein told him he faced disciplinary action and a
possible demotion by the district because ``the school was not
settling down.'' Brent questioned how much support Bernstein
received from district officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gene McCallum, cluster administrator, said he spent months
working with Bernstein but parents wanted a ``switch in the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked with him every day on every issue,'' McCallum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brent said a recent survey conducted at the school shows
``overwhelming support'' of both the principal and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets away at Ranchito Avenue Elementary School, where
Bernstein was principal previously, parents and staffers said they
enjoyed working with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here adored him. He's a really sincere man. It's
just disgraceful,'' Alan O'Hara, a Title 1 coordinator at Ranchito,
said of Bernstein, who worked eight years at at the school.

DOUGLAS REUNITES WITH FORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Thursday, new Clippers coach Chris Ford held a
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers signed free-agent point guard Sherman Douglas to a
one-year contract worth $2.5 million. Douglas, who played for Ford
in Boston and Milwaukee, says the reunion is logical.
</P>
<P>
   `He (Ford) wanted somebody familiar with the system,'' said
Douglas, who has averaged 11.8 points and 6.5 assists per game in a
nine-year NBA career, ``somebody with experience. . . and that was
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have been Douglas about three weeks ago, but when the
former Syracuse All-American and his agent requested the balance of
the team's $3.7 million in salary-cap mad money, the Clippers
re-signed Darrick Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to wait and see if anything else came around,''
said Douglas, who actually was waiting for free-agent Wizard Rod
Strickland to either leave or stay in Washington. While he waited,
his old job in New Jersey, where Douglas averaged 8 points and 4
assists in a reserve role last season, was filled. When Strickland
re-signed with the Wizards on Wednesday, the Clippers _ and a
likely starting job _ sounded a bit more palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have him here,'' Ford said. ``I think he's going
to be a good addition.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, whose career has been built on his passing skills, is
being added to a point-guard mix that includes Martin (last year's
starter) and veteran Pooh Richardson. Ford doesn't seem too worried
about potential chemistry problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how that's going to go,'' he said, ``but I do
know Sherman will get the ball to guys where they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Down and out: Knee injuries have landed rookie forward Brian
Skinner and veteran free-agent point guard Scott Brooks on the
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, the first-round pick out of Baylor, is expected to be
out two-three weeks after an arthroscopic procedure on his right
knee. Brooks strained the medial collateral ligament in his right
knee in last Friday's loss to the Lakers, and is expected to be out
for four weeks.

SAVED BY THE BARON
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From embarrassment to ecstasy in 48 hours, it was
a week even Baron Davis found unique.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after he was slapped with a public reprimand by the
Pac-10 _ and forced to apologize to avoid a suspension _ Davis made
the game-winning basket as time expired Thursday to give UCLA a
79-77 victory over Oregon at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' heroics began with seven seconds left, when he grabbed an
inbound pass and dribbled upcourt. As he approached the lane, he
accelerated, then stopped abruptly and hit a 14-footer as the
buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (16-5, 7-3) survived because they forced Oregon into
turnovers in its final three possessions.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed 77-73 with a minute remaining after Jerome Moiso's
16-foot jumper. JaRon Rush's steal gave UCLA a chance for the lead,
but Ray Young missed a 3-pointer from the left wing. After a
timeout, Davis stole the ball from Oregon's A.D. Smith in the
backcourt and found Young for the tying dunk.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks called timeout with 16.7 seconds left, then set a play
for freshman Freddie Jones. As he penetrated into the lane and
prepared to pass, he charged into Earl Watson.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA played most of the second half without its big men, Dan
Gadzuric, who had his right knee wrapped, and Moiso, who seemed
uninterested when given the chance to perform. Rush and reserve
Travis Reed helped compensate, combining for 30 unexpected points
in the most productive game either has played in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup figured to be close. The Ducks have not won in
Pauley since 1984 (triple overtime), but they usually perform well,
with 16 points separating the teams from 1996-98.
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case when the teams collide, UCLA had
difficulty with Oregon's perimeter shooters and taut motion
offense. Stanford aside, the Ducks set the best screens in the
league and they constantly confound the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had two additional problems: their heads and legs.
They appeared to lack both enthusiasm and fuel, continuing a
pattern coach Steve Lavin noticed last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt on the Washington trip that we were a little tired,''
Lavin said. ``We probably hit a little wall. We had an incredible
stretch of high-level games in a three-week period.''
</P>
<P>
   For Oregon, February was a chance to forget January, a torturous
month in which the Ducks lost six games by four points or less (or
overtime).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for us to get a fresh start,'' Ducks coach
Ernie Kent said earlier in the week. ``The USC loss (when Adam
Spanich scored six points in 0.8 seconds) took so much out of us.
We never regrouped.''
</P>
<P>
   They were in control for most of the first half Thursday,
jumping to a 16-6 lead as the Bruins wallowed with an obvious lack
of interest. Reed, however, gave UCLA an unexpected spark. He
converted a short turnaround on his first possession and scored six
quick points.
</P>
<P>
   But Oregon stayed poised, and when Flo Hartenstein tipped in an
errant shot with eight minutes left, the Ducks had surged to a
25-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it was Reed to the rescue. He checked in with seven
minutes left and the Bruins immediately regained their rhythm.
Soon, they had their first lead since the opening minute, and
Young's 3-pointer extended the margin to 32-26.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA opened the second half without Davis, who needed extra
treatment on his bad knee, and without their heads, which remained
in the locker room for three turnover-filled possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes enabled Oregon to reclaim the lead, albeit briefly.
Rush hit a 3-pointer from the right wing _ the first of three in
the second half _ and Reed scored in the low post to give UCLA a
44-38 lead. But each time the Bruins seemed ready to pounce, the
Ducks rallied. They grabbed a 54-50 lead with 10 minutes left and
were in control as the final minutes approached.
</P>
<P>
   Hartenstein's baskets gave Oregon a 75-71 lead with 2:25 left.
</P>
<P>
   __ Note: UCLA senior Liron Artzi, a Woodland Hills resident and
Taft High graduate, won books and tuition for a year _ about $5,000
_ by making a halfcourt shot during a GTE-sponsored halftime
contest.

RAIN WASHES OUT QUALIFYING ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ It just wouldn't be the Winternationals without
a little rain.
</P>
<P>
   Rain washed out Thursday's first-round qualifying for the pro
divisions of the 39th annual event, which traditionally has had to
work its schedule around Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session, which was supposed to be the opening of the
National Hot Rod Association 22-race schedule, will not be made up,
giving teams just three rounds to qualify for the 16-car fields in
Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock and Pro Stock Truck at Pomona
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators can apply tickets for Thursday's session toward the
purchase of seats for today's pro session, which begins at 2 p.m.
with Pro Stock Truck qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for Federal Mogul Dragster and Funny Car was
completed prior to Thursday's rain.
</P>
<P>
   Defending national champion Frank Manzo held the top spot in
Funny Car with a 5.946-second pass at 239.82 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing for us racers as well as the fans,'' said
Randy Anderson, who is probably hurt more by the washout than some
of the major-sponsored teams. Anderson, who lost major funding when
sponsor Parts America was purchased by Advanced Auto, was counting
on all four sessions to qualify for Sunday's eliminations. Now he
and the other drivers will have one try today and two on Saturday
to qualify for the 16-car fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The rainout) is going to hurt some of us more than others,''
Anderson said. ``We didn't do a whole lot of testing in the
offseason for financial reasons, so we definitely feel that we
needed all four runs. But it happened to everybody (Thursday), so
it's the same for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be a disadvantage for some of the lesser-financed
drivers like Anderson, who signed a two-race deal with Oakwood
Interiors, an Ontario-based furniture manufacturer, prior to this
weekend's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these teams like the John Forces, the Cruz Pedregons,
they've made eight or 10 (testing) attempts already with their new
(equipment),'' Anderson said. ``Unfortunately, we don't have the
funding to do that type of testing. So obviously we need all the
runs we can get. But we're going to make the most of it. This
doesn't mean that we're in trouble. It just would have been nice to
have all four (qualifying sessions).''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payne qualified sixth in Funny Car with a run of 6.124.
Payne, who won the Top Alcohol Dragster championship in 1996, has
moved over to the FM Funny Car class this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bartoli is 15th with a 9.430 pass.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Rick Santos leads in FM Dragster with a time
of 5.496.

ISLANDERS SINK BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a heartbreaking loss to Colorado Tuesday night,
Bruins right wing Rob DiMaio said he didn't think things could get
more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   He was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's 5-4 loss to the New York Islanders at the
FleetCenter was much less forgivable, much less understandable,
much more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Bruins lost to a superior team that came to
Boston on a remarkable roll. Thursday night's defeat was an
unmitigated disaster as the Bruins squandered leads of 2-0 and 3-2
on the way to extending their winless streak to seven games
(0-6-1), tying their longest stretch of futility since Nov. 19-Dec.
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It prompted a 90-minute postgame meeting attended by coach Pat
Burns, general manager Harry Sinden, and assistant coaches Jacques
Laperriere and Bob Francis, after which Sinden indicated some
Bruins prospects at Providence will be called up for a long look,
probably at the expense of some current Boston regulars.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three games, the Bruins have played pretty well and
tied (Carolina), played really well and lost (Colorado), and played
really sloppily and lost (Thursday night).
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne Rosannadanna was right. If it's not one thing, it's
another.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the lapse du jour was poor defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't all play together as a team,'' said Burns. ``The
forwards played well tonight defensively, and our defense wasn't
very good. It puzzles me why. Our forwards gave it everything they
had on offense. Our defense just made too many mistakes. Their
lapses were puzzling, really puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   The team squandered a fine performance by center Jason Allison,
who tallied his third career hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started off well, taking a 2-0 lead through the first
20 minutes, with Allison scoring at 15:13 and Ken Belanger earning
his first goal with Boston at 17:11. But the wheels began to fall
off in the second as the Islanders tied it on goals by former Bruin
Ted Donato at the 33-second mark and Claude Lapointe at 4:15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show a little more respect to your opponent than
what we were doing in the second period,'' said defenseman Grant
Ledyard. ``We didn't respect them and they shoved it up our butt
pretty far and we didn't respond very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison rescued the Bruins at 5:33 with his second of the game,
good for a 3-2 lead. But that didn't last. The Islanders scored a
pair of goals less than 30 seconds apart to go up, 4-3. Former
Bruin Craig Janney pulled New York even at 10:26, and Zigmund
Palffy gave the Islanders their first lead at 10:52. Allison got
Boston even again at 18:05, but that was as close as they came to
salvaging a point. Mark Lawrence banged in a rebound of a Sergei
Nemchinov shot at 10:04 of the third, and the Bruins were losers
again.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has maintained a stiff upper lip, but the mood in the
dressing room is clearly one of distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Pat a lot of credit,'' said Don Sweeney. ``I certainly
hope nothing is written about his failure to execute, because he's
stayed as positive as he possibly can despite the rest of us not
living up to what we're supposed to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe, who left without comment after the Colorado
game because he just couldn't face discussing the frustration, said
he's at a loss to explain the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like each game is getting worse,'' said Dafoe, who
faced 38 shots and battled rebounds all night. ``We lose a game
with five minutes to go (against Colorado) last time. I thought
that was it. Then tonight we blow a game like that against the New
York Islanders. You have good nights and bad nights throughout the
course of a season, but to string so many bad nights together now
...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speechless. Last game I didn't want to talk to anyone.
It's hard for me to stay positive in this situation. I've done it
for so long. These last two games ... honestly, if it's not the
Sudafed keeping me up, it sure as hell is these games. They're on
replay; you can't help but watch. Then you roll over and it's 2:30
in the morning. Right now it's not a game, it's a job, and it's not
a fun job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored enough goals for us to win,'' said Burns. ``We
allowed just enough to lose.''

ALLISON'S HAT TRICK DOESN'T STOP POTVIN FROM GETTING FIRST WIN AS
ISLANDER  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly a month has passed since Felix Potvin arrived on
Long Island, anointed by management as the Islanders' No. 1
goaltender, the player who would carry then into the postseason.
But in his first five games, Potvin was anything but the solution.
Not only did he fail to register a victory, but he did not even
suffer a respectable loss.
</P>
<P>
   In desperate need of his first win in an Islander uniform,
Potvin finally got it Thursday night, wearing the team's colors of
orange, blue and white on his pads and gloves for the first time in
a game. During his first five starts, Potvin wore his royal blue
and white pads from his days with the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have switched a long time ago,'' he said, after a
spotty effort in goal still resulted in a 5-4 Islander win over the
slumping Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   New York's offensive explosion made up for Potvin's mistakes in
the second period as the Islanders battled back twice and survived
a hat trick by Jason Allison of Boston at the Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' said Potvin, who had entered the game with a
0-5-0 record and a bloated 3.47 goals-against average as an
Islander. In his previous start last Saturday, he yielded seven
goals to the Ottawa Senators in a 9-2 thrashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain, but it helps a lot,'' Potvin said of
Thursday night's offensive splurge by his teammates. ``Winning one
certainly helps. Hopefully, we can go forward from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lawrence scored the game-winner for the Islanders midway
into the third period, knocking a rebound past Byron Dafoe, who
faced 38 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin, who was acquired from Toronto for Bryan Berard on Jan.
9, faced 41 shots. The victory improved the Islanders' record to
3-2-1 under Bill Stewart, who replaced Mike Milbury as coach on
Jan. 21, and it snapped a two-game losing streak. The Bruins, who
lost to the Islanders for the third time in four games, dropped to
0-6-1 in their last seven games and are in danger of falling out of
the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled hard and that's the bottom line,'' Stewart said.
``Felix stuck with it. He's only going to get better from this. His
confidence level is going to go up because he has contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the Bruins beat Potvin twice for a 2-0
advantage on goals by Allison and Ken Belanger, the former enforcer
for the Islanders. But the Islanders evened the score early in the
second period, 2-2, on goals by Ted Donato, the former Bruin, and
Claude Lapointe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders could not maintain the momentum generated by
the back-to-back goals because Potvin was beaten by a weak wrist
shot from Allison at 5:33 of the second period, putting the Bruins
ahead by 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with that goal,'' Potvin said.
</P>
<P>
   As deflating as that goal was, the Islanders managed to come
back. They evened the score again, 3-3, on a goal by Craig Janney,
his first as an Islander, at 10:26. And Zigmund Palffy scored his
fourth goal in the last seven games 26 seconds later to give the
Islanders their first lead of the game at 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, the Islanders' lead did not hold. Allison
tallied his third goal of the game at 18:05 to knot the score at
4-4, bringing dozens of hats onto the Fleet Center ice. Lawrence,
who was called up from the minors in mid-December, brought the
Islanders back one more time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gratifying night for Belanger and Donato, who were
swapped for one another on Nov. 7. In the first period, Belanger
fought with the Islanders' Dean Malkoc, dropping him to the ice
with a stiff jab to the face. Malkoc was called up from the minors
earlier Thursday and was making his Islander debut.
</P>
<P>
   Donato was crushed when he was dealt by Boston, his hometown
team, the one he spent seven season with after graduating from
Harvard. He was pumped for Thursday night's homecoming, though, and
it paid off with his seventh goal of the season.

THE UNORTHODOX NETS: SHORT, BUT NOT SHORT OF TALENT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets start a point guard who prefers shooting to
passing, a small forward who is more comfortable in the backcourt,
and a center who is a shade shorter than his listed height of 6
feet 10 inches. Their top shooting guard, though graceful and
athletic, is reed-thin, and their rising star at power forward has
been labeled by many basketball analysts as a tweener.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets, one of the most peculiar and unorthodox units in
the National Basketball Association, make that collection of talent
work. Ignoring conventional wisdom regarding roles and contemporary
trends that favor beat 'em up, halfcourt basketball, the third-year
coach, John Calipari, has the Nets primed to challenge for their
first Eastern Conference championship since joining the league in
1976. They open the season Saturday night at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get caught up in point guard, wing guard, two
guard,'' Calipari said. ``We play guards and we play forwards and
forget about their sizes and all that stuff. We play three
perimeter people _ the bigger, the better _ and two post people.''
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, the Nets' starting five consists of Sam Cassell,
the erratic yet respected point guard who attempted more shots than
any of his teammates did last season and also led the league in
turnovers; the long and rangy shooting guard Kerry Kittles, who
added much-needed weight and strength during the lockout but who
will miss the first two weeks of the season with a bruised right
knee; the undersized small forward Kendall Gill, who at 6-5 battles
larger opponents nightly; the versatile power forward Keith Van
Horn, who seems headed toward becoming the franchise's biggest star
since Julius Erving, and the vivacious rebounding specialist,
Jayson Williams, who gives up two, three or four inches a night to
opposing centers.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the shortest starting lineups in the league, yet
it frightens Nets opponents because, while those players may not
fit conventional definitions, each plays at an elite level.
</P>
<P>
   ``In basketball, you don't necessarily have to worry about
heights and weights,'' said the 6-10 Van Horn, who bounced between
both forward spots last season. ``You just worry about whether the
person can play his position or not. And what's good about that is
that we're versatile and we can rotate. Every guy on the court can
play one, two and three positions for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari preaches about playing to the strengths of a team and
its individuals and carries out that philosophy by pushing up-tempo
basketball that rewards quickness and athleticism while nullifying
size. He wants a fast break after missed shots and made shots alike
and yells at his players for passing up open looks at the basket.
The halfcourt offense is more afterthought than strategy, an
uncomplicated motion set that allows for freedom and ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed game that we play is simple basketball,'' said
Calipari, whose club led the conference in scoring last season at
99.6 points a game, more than 2 points higher than the nearest
competitor. ``You don't have to be a brain surgeon to pick it up in
a few days. You have to sprint, set good screens, have good spacing
and be good at attacking on the dribble-drive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an excellent game plan for the Nets not only because they
lack size but also because they are one of the league's deepest
squads. That quality will be magnified in this compressed 50-game
season, which will very likely be laden with injuries and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari's second unit could beat some of the league's weaker
teams: Eric Murdock runs the point, with Lucious Harris and Scott
Burrell on the wings and Chris Gatling, an excellent scorer, and
Jim McIlvaine, an intimidating shot blocker, down low. When Rony
Seikaly, who has averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds a game over his
10-year career, returns in two weeks from a left ankle injury, he
will become the sixth man. Brian Evans, a great shooter, and Earl
Boykins, a darting fan favorite at 5-5, also are capable of giving
the starters a few minutes of rest without surrendering the
offensive mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``No human has ever been through a 50-game season in 12 weeks,''
Calipari said. ``No one knows what's going to happen. We may end up
with five guys at the end of the year. We may have guys that have
to take two days off just to recover from a back-to-back-to-back.
So the more starter-caliber players you can have, the better your
chances of surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' depth is worth more than insurance, though. It affords
Calipari the luxury of experimenting with various lineups. At
times, the Nets will go big, with Gill at guard, Van Horn and
Williams at the forwards and McIlvaine or Seikaly in the middle.
Other times, they will play small but fast, with Murdock and
Cassell in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   While the flexible, point-producing attack will generate
excitement, it will not spawn the expected number of victories or
the desired post-season success unless the Nets play better
defense. With opponents penetrating the lane fearlessly and
feasting on offensive rebounds, the Nets were the worst defensive
team to make the playoffs last season. Had their defense been
mediocre, they might have won 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari has focused on defense throughout training camp,
particularly stopping dribble penetration and blocking out
underneath the basket, and the players appeared to be committed to
giving maximum effort on both ends of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of McIlvaine was nothing less than a coup. In
their two exhibition games against the Knicks, the Nets averaged
six blocked shots, twice as many as last season, as McIlvaine
rejected five.
</P>
<P>
   Their speed, depth and newfound resolve to defend have the Nets
confident about doing something special this season, even without a
true point guard, small forward or center among their first five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of optimism on our team,'' Williams said. ``A
pessimist says, `I can't see out of one eye' and he complains all
day long. An optimist says, `I can see out of one eye. Thank God.'
That's how we are. We're the kind of guys that can see out of one
eye, and we're happy about it.'' &QL;

EX FACTOR THE DIFFERENCE FOR ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The easiest way to do this is to point out the Islander
goals that former Bruins were not involved in Thursday night. Those
would be two: the second and the final goals.
</P>
<P>
   Onetime Bruins played a part in the other three goals as the
Islanders kept battling back and at the end spoiled yet another
evening for Pat Burns's crew.
</P>
<P>
   There was Ted Donato's goal just 33 seconds into the second
period, a huge score that let the Islanders slice Boston's 2-0 lead
in half.
</P>
<P>
   Donato walked in from the boards, kept coming, and beat goalie
Byron Dafoe from in close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trevor Linden set a nice little pick for me along the
boards,'' Donato said. ``I just tried to take it to the net and
find an opening, and I was lucky enough to find a little seam to
get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lapointe _ no former Bruin he _ tied it at 2-2, then
Jason Allison scored to put Boston up again.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Janney helped take care of that. The former Boston center
sent Linden in on Dafoe, who made the save. But Janney kept coming
and put the rebound up and over Dafoe, making it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Islanders, with defense-man Dean Malkoc lending a hand,
took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Malkoc, who spent parts of the last two seasons with the Bruins
and was let go after last season, was making his Islander debut. He
was called up Wednesday night from Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I couldn't sleep,'' Malkoc said.
</P>
<P>
   He got the puck at the point and, with a Bruin charging him, let
it go. It went well wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
around the net to Robert Reichel. Dafoe stopped Reichel's shot, but
Zigmund Palffy pounced on the rebound for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get it by the guy coming at me,'' Malkoc
said. ``I wasn't worried about hitting the net. And it took a good
bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison's third goal of the night tied it, 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   And the ex-Bruins let others take care of the winning goal in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was quite a night for the guys who used to wear the
Black and Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, none of them were Islanders when the season
started. Donato joined New York in November in a trade for Ken
Belanger _ who also scored a goal and fought with Malkoc early in
the first period. Janney, who played in Boston from 1987-92, came
to the Islanders last month from Tampa Bay. And Malkoc didn't make
the team out of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing when I didn't make it,'' Malkoc said.
``But I knew I'd get a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he never really thought much about playing his first
Islander game against the team that let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great to be back in the NHL,'' Malkoc said.
``Obviously, you play the game to get to this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato, a Bruin from the time he became a pro late in the 1992
season until November, said it was nice to play well back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to say no, it was just another game and all
that,'' Donato said. ``But I'm from here. I'll be back here when
I'm done playing. I loved my time here and I have a lot of great
feelings for the city of Boston and always will. It was nice to
come back here and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato, who was not happy with the role he was asked to fill
with the Bruins, had five goals and eight assists in 35 games with
the Islanders before Thursday night. He's still looking to
establish himself with the team, and Thursday night was his first
on a line with Janney _ who had left the Bruins about a month
before Donato arrived in '92 _ and Linden.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I still haven't become the player I
want to be with the Islanders,'' Donato said. ``I want to up my
level and be counted on every night. Hopefully, this is a start in
that direction.''

JACOB REINGOLD, LEADER IN CARING FOR THE ELDERLY, IS DEAD AT 83  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jacob Reingold, a leader in caring for the aged who
laid groundwork for the nationwide observance of Grandparents Day,
died Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 83 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At his death Reingold was vice chairman of the Hebrew Home for
the Aged in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx. He was its
executive vice president from 1958 to 1995. The home now serves
more than 2,000 elderly people in residential and outpatient
programs.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. David H. Pryor of Arkansas put it in his opening
statement at the 1995 White House Conference on Aging: ``Jacob
Reingold attended the 1961 White House Conference on Aging, the
first of its kind. Because he was so moved by the conference's
focus on creating a new image of aging, he began his quest for a
national observance of the role grandparents play in our society.
The result of his work, nearly 35 years later, is national
Grandparents Day, which we celebrate each September.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said Thursday that Reingold ``was a giant
in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Reingold was one of the pioneers in creating what are called
staged options of living for older adults. This approach may allow
them to continue living at home or to take advantage of different
levels of institutional care as their needs change.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said that ``Jacob
Reingold ran an institution which did enormous good for older
people at a precarious stage of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger said his mother's last years ``were made better
because of his help to her as an outpatient.'' Kissinger's mother,
Paula Stern Kissinger, died on Nov. 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While Reingold was executive vice president, the Hebrew Home
greatly increased the number of elderly men and women it served. He
felt that the Hebrew Home should have a pleasing and stimulating
physical environment, and it acquired large collections of art and
of Judaica, both of which are on display in its Riverdale
buildings, which have a view of the Palisades on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   He also expanded the Hebrew Home's physical fitness activities,
added a workshop with special equipment for the elderly, and drew
up and put into effect what has been called the first sexual policy
and procedure in a long-term-care establishment in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The policy's preface says in part, ``The resident's rights
respect the importance of emotional and physical intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   One provision states, ``Residents have the right to seek out and
engage in sexual expression, including words, gestures, movements
or activities including reaching, pursuing, touching, which appear
motivated by the desire for sexual gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Another says, ``Expressions of intimacy should not infringe upon
the rights and reasonable sensibilities of others in the Home
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Reingold was born in Lodz, which was in Russia and is now in
Poland. He came to the United States in 1936 and settled in
Cincinnati. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of
Cincinnati in 1942 and a master's degree from Case Western Reserve
University, also in Cleveland, in 1943. He did further graduate
work at the Center for Human Relations and Community Studies of the
New York University School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career he headed a reception center in the Bronx
for orphans from camps for displaced people in Germany who came to
the United States after World War II. From 1952 to 1958 he was
executive director of Blythedale Orthopedic Hospital in Valhalla,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Estelle Gold;
four sons, David, of Delray Beach, Fla., Joel, of St. Louis,
Daniel, of Scarsdale, N.Y., who succeeded his father as the Hebrew
Home's executive vice president, and Michael, of Manhattan; eight
grandchildren; a brother, Chaim, of Chicago, and a sister, Devorah
Chajut, who lives near Tel Aviv.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Has the European public begun to turn
against the wave of megamergers coursing through the continent?
</P>
<P>
   That tantalizing question was posed last week by Rolf-Ernst
Breuer, the head of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest financial
institution. The media have taken to depicting corporate leaders
like him as megalomaniacs, Breuer complained at the World Economic
Forum, a privately financed annual gathering here of the world's
financial elite, and politicians say, `` `Look what these managers
do: They buy and sell companies like used cars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The pendulum of popular sentiment is swinging against the deal
makers, he concluded, saying, ``I think we have to be aware that
the climate will change rather soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In important ways, the climate for mergers in Europe has already
changed. A month after the creation of Europe's new single
currency, the euro, it is becoming clear that cross-border mergers
within the 11-nation euro zone will play out to different rules
than the deals that previously marked Europe's acquisition frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of mergers has accelerated, but so far not in the way
that had been expected: across the now supposedly invisible
financial frontiers between participants in the currency union.
Since Jan. 1, none of the big announced mergers has crossed a
border between euro nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement of plans for a $17 billion takeover of
Paribas by Societe Generale reflected a belated French move to
pursue the sort of consolidation of banking and financial services
already familiar in Switzerland and some other countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But, like a notable non-bank merger announced last month, the
acquisition of Marconi Electronics by British Aerospace, it is a
move within national borders.
</P>
<P>
   Recent international deals in Europe have also not been between
one euro nation and another. The announced takeover of Britain's
Guardian Royal Exchange by the giant French insurer AXA brings
together one company inside the euro zone (AXA) and one outside it
(Britain is not a member of the currency union).
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical merger that will create the giant AstraZeneca
combines companies in two non-euro nations, Sweden and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Some deals, like the planned acquisition of Volvo AB's car
division by the Ford Motor Co., the DaimlerChrysler merger and
Deutsche Bank's own deal to acquire Bankers Trust, have crossed the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Many people argue that the logic of a euro zone _ a huge single
market of 290 million people, underpinned by a common currency and
free of the risks of currency exchanges _ will inevitably press
companies to fuse across its internal frontiers for economies of
scale, market dominance and cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw the start of that process with the announcement in
December of a partial merger deal between two pharmaceutical
giants, Germany's Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc of France.
</P>
<P>
   But one view among corporate leaders who spoke and mingled here
is that cross-border mergers within the euro zone face an array of
obstacles, rooted not just in national sentiment but also in the
politics of unemployment, the slow pace of deregulation in some
industries, the hesitancy of some companies to move toward public
ownership and, not least, the tough competition rules of the
European Union itself.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the view of Gerard Mestrallet, head of the huge
Franco-Belgian corporation Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux, the fruit of a
merger of three companies to create a combine of energy, water
supply, waste services and communications businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equity nationalism,'' Mestrallet said, makes institutional
investors in continental Europe wary of the stock of companies in
each other's nations, impeding cross-border consolidation. ``We are
going to have to find greater acceptance by institutions of the
paper of other countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Paul Gibbs, a mergers and acquisitions analyst at
J.P. Morgan in London, cross-border mergers among the 11 euro
nations totaled $73 billion last year as the debut of the euro
approached, compared with $21 billion in 1996. But, significantly,
it was still less than 0.1 percent of the record $842 billion of
all merger activity involving European businesses last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many forces are at play. A large number of the small- to
medium-sized companies that power the German economy are only now
preparing themselves for the capital markets after decades of
private ownership and bank financing, said Wilhelm Haarmann, a
German acquisitions lawyer here.
</P>
<P>
   And longstanding efforts to create a pan-European military
industry are thwarted because of political sensitivities toward
industries like military equipment and aerospace that retain strong
government ties, particularly in France.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation is strict, too, within the euro zone. The European
Commission, said Fields Wicker-Miurin, an investment banker at A.
Kearney Ltd. in London, ``has a great deal to say about which deals
are acceptable and which are not.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a continent where unemployment runs at over 10 percent _
and much higher among young people _ any big cross-border merger
would immediately raise political hackles over the single issue of
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lay off people there is a lot of fear, and the
unemployment issue is a public issue, especially in Europe,'' said
Daniel Vasella, president of Novartis, the Swiss drug company.
</P>
<P>
   But without the efficiencies that are supposed to wring
profitability from the merged companies, jobs are likely to be
destroyed eventually anyway, a point that is sometimes lost on the
populist strain of merger opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a profitable company can be a social company and create
jobs,'' said Jurgen E. Schrempp, co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Whether all those concerns will blunt corporate appetites
indefinitely is another matter. ``We have a strategy, and the
strategy has not come to an end with Bankers Trust,'' said Breuer
at Deutsche Bank. ``We have to be ready to grab opportunities that
offer themselves.''

SINDEN INDICATES THERE WILL BE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After Thursday night's 5-4 loss to the New York
Islanders, which stretched the Bruins' winless streak to seven
games, club president-general manager Harry Sinden met with coach
Pat Burns and assistant coaches Jacques Laperriere and Bob Francis
for about 90 minutes. After the meeting, Sinden said it was time to
give some players from the Bruins' Providence farm club a look. A
good look.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to name names but also indicated that look could
come at the expense of forwards who are Boston regulars at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple or three or four players we should give a
real long look at and let them fail if they are not good enough,''
Sinden said. ``We haven't really done that yet. We've been shoving
them in the lineup here and there, but we've never given them a
chance to succeed or fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the discussion was more about changing the lineup
with an influx from Providence than about trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking at trades, but they're hard to come by,''
he said. ``We really didn't think we needed any, but the recent
turn of events made us think maybe we should think of doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, he said, something needs to be done and he is not
at all confident the team _ without trades or an upgrade of some
manner _ can make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say no,'' Sinden said. ``I'd have to say no, I'm
not confident at all. I haven't liked the last seven games. I
haven't liked really the last 15 games. We're missing (injured
defenseman) Kyle McLaren, who's a very important player, and
(injured forward Anson) Carter, who rounds out the team, and that
should help us. But I think we're going to have to become a better
team than we've shown the last month to make the playoffs. Much
better.''

AT DISNEY, THE VIDEO THAT ROARED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an unfortunate sign of the times. The Walt Disney Co.
discovered _ by way of the Internet, naturally _ that some
long-forgotten animator had managed to sneak a couple of frames of
a woman's bare breasts into its 1977 animated film, ``The
Rescuers,'' so it immediately recalled 3.4 million newly released
copies of the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for the recall is to keep our promise to families
that they can trust and rely on the Disney brand,'' a company
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that the offending images cannot be seen when the
videotape is played normally. One has to search frame by frame
through the 100,000-odd in the movie to find the two bosomy ones.
Does all this really justify a recall that, according to one video
executive at a competing studio, could cost something like $10
million?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for a moment, a saner world, in which Disney announces
that instead of a recall, it will spend $10 million to finance
breast-cancer screening for poor women. Based on data from Martin
Brown, an economist at the National Cancer Institute, that sum
would buy about 100,000 mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that they were administered to poor women in their
mid-50s who had never been screened, the free tests could find 600
to 1,000 potentially fatal cases of breast cancer in time for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't blame Disney. Even though it does business in a
culture that seems to have endless tolerance for daily accounts of
presidential philandering, to say nothing of Jerry Springer and
Howard Stern, Disney's reputation as a purveyor of family
entertainment obliges it to recal millions of videotapes because
someone bent on finding a pair of breasts in a Disney video could,
with obsessive effort, succeed.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count now is not propriety so much as the
appearance of propriety. An aide to the mayor of Washington
recently resigned under fire for using the innocuous adjective
``niggardly'' to describe a fund he was administering, because
people thought he had uttered a racial epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Disney knows, of course, that in this arena it is nothing more
than a victim of its own success. The company is emblematic of a
certain commodification (not to say homogenization) of culture that
many thinking people abhor, even as they eagerly consume what they
are served.
</P>
<P>
   We are uneasy about the way Hollywood and TV seem to be taking
over our very consciousness, worried about how Disney has extended
its reach into sports, books, Broadway, radio and God knows what
else. We loathe the way TV seems to have more influence on our
children than we do. And we detest the plastering of corporate
monikers on museums and colleges and stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, we are plenty fond of the prosperity that
this corporate economy delivers. Our obsession with Disney makes
sense when considered next to our obsession with Wal-Mart Stores,
and our worries about how each company affects the way we live. In
this sense, Disney has become something of a cultural scapemouse.
</P>
<P>
   Before shedding too many tears, however, consider how the recall
is progressing. Predictably, many people who bought the tape have
decided not to give it back. Retailers reacted to the publicity by
rushing to stock more copies. ``We were inundated by orders _ our
customers are retailers, and they wanted more,'' said Kirk
Kirkpatrick, executive vice president for marketing at Waxworks
Videoworks, a video distributor.
</P>
<P>
   He said fewer than a dozen of several thousand customers had
called to ask for a return authorization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a real win-win situation for Disney,'' Kirkpatrick
said. ``They were able to take the high ground without spending a
lot of money. We could have sold thousands more, if we had not
stopped shipping them at Disney's request.''
</P>
<P>
   The recall of ``The Rescuers'' will probably still cost Disney
millions of dollars. (Several million have probably been wasted on
advertising alone.) The company itself, however, isn't putting a
price tag on its decision. ``Cost is not an issue,'' the Disney
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The video divisions of Hollywood studios generate so much
revenue that she is almost certainly right. By industry standards,
even $20 million would look a pittance _ until you started thinking
about how much good it could do elsewhere. &QL;

AUDETTE LIFTS KINGS' SPIRITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Early Thursday, the subject of the day for
the Kings was urgency, the sense of which has been glaringly absent
all too often this season.
</P>
<P>
   Their words indicated they knew it was time to start playing
with desperation, because the schedule is winding down and playoff
hopes are beginning to wane.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a collective negative frame of mind had descended on
the Kings' dressing room, defenseman Rob Blake was blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be in a negative state,'' defenseman Rob Blake said.
``Look at our record. It's awful. What do you want to be positive
about? . . . You can be as negative or as positive as you want.
You've got to play. When you're out there, be accounted for.''
</P>
<P>
   The gloom lifted just a bit Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Audette accounted for two goals, including the
game-winner with 9:39 to play, as the Kings recorded an important
3-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks before an announced crowd
of 11,737 at the Forum. Defenseman Steve Duchesne, who has
struggled all year, had a goal and two assists, and goalie Stephane
Fiset made 35 saves.
</P>
<P>
   With 32 games remaining, the Kings (18-28-4) moved within four
points of San Jose in the race for the eighth and final playoff
berth in the Western Conference. The Kings can move closer to the
Sharks with a victory in Saturday night's game against San Jose at
the Forum. The Sharks began an NHL-record 10-game trip Thursday
night with a 3-1 loss at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Audette's goal was a gift from Chicago defenseman Chris Chelios.
Trying to clear the puck down the ice, Chelios instead put the puck
right on Duchesne's stick at the blue line. Duchesne passed the
puck to Audette, wide open in front of Chicago's net. Audette took
his time, drawing Jocelyn Thibault to the ice and backhanding the
puck over the Blackhawks' goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The game hadn't begun nearly as well for the Kings, who had lost
six of their previous seven games before Thursday. Chicago
(14-29-8), which suffered its fourth consecutive loss and is in
last place in the Western Conference, opened the scoring on a power
play 8:34 into the game, a goal that was the result of an atrocious
decision with the puck by Russ Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' winger, a penalty-killing specialist, had the puck in
the neutral zone, with plenty of time to clear the puck down the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he opted to do a Jaromir Jagr imitation, stick-handling
and trying to pass the puck to himself between the legs of
Chicago's Chad Kilger. The pass did go between Kilger's legs, but
it also went back into the Kings' zone. Before Courtnall could
reach the puck, the Blackhawks' Todd White beat him to it, and
passed it across the ice to Kilger in the right faceoff circle.
Kilger blasted a one-time shot past a defenseless Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the Kings didn't crumble, as they have so
many times this season after making costly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   A lucky break enabled them to tie the score seven minutes after
Courtnall's blunder, with Duchesne's shot from the right circle
deflecting off the stick of Blackhawks defenseman Bryan Muir and
past Thibault.
</P>
<P>
   A goal by Audette _ a blast from the circle that went over
Thibault's stick and just inside the left goal post _ gave the
Kings a 2-1 lead 5:12 into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But four minutes later, Fiset misplayed a centering pass by
Kilger, the puck deflecting off his stick and into the net for a
2-2 tie that stood until Audette scored the game-winner.

RAZOR'S EDGE SPURS TROJANS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC lost its hair Thursday night, but won a game.
</P>
<P>
   That's considered a more-than-fair trade-off for the Trojans,
who finally snapped their six-game losing streak with an 86-61
victory over Oregon State before 2,580 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nearly a month since the Trojans experienced a
victory, and while it might have just been a coincidence, they
ended their losing streak the same day they decided to shave their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a team thing, to show we have some cohesiveness,''
said junior forward Jarvis Turner, who came up with the idea.
``Something we decided to do as a team because people think we've
given up, because we've lost six in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   The first to take the plunge was red-headed forward Brian
Scalabrine, which made it a lot easier for the rest of the team to
also lose their locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are used to having hair on their head. Once they
saw (Brian) did it, everybody just followed the leader,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even USC coach Henry Bibby got into the act, although he had
little more than a 5-o'clock shadow to begin with on his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   But with a 25-point victory in hand, no one was disputing the
power of the razor.
</P>
<P>
   It helped end a demoralizing stretch for the Trojans, who were
beginning to wonder when they would ever win again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time,'' Scalabrine said. ``Like a weight off
my shoulders. It was our first step to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (11-8, 3-7) played perhaps their best game of the
season, jumping out to a 40-29 halftime lead, then putting the
Beavers away with a 17-1 run midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with a lot of intensity. We played defense. We cut
off the head of their offense in (Deaundra) Tanner,'' Bibby said.
``We finally got some easy baskets. We didn't have to play so much
halfcourt basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner, Oregon State's point guard, had 12 points, but made just
4 of 14 shots. It was a far less effective performance than he had
last month in Corvallis when the teams first met.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner scored a career-high 27 points then, including all 10 of
Oregon State's points in overtime as the Beavers (11-8, 5-5)
defeated the Trojans 69-66. That was the start of USC's six-game
slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want him to catch the ball. We wanted to trap him,''
Bibby said. ``We were very conscious of what he did for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also found their offensive touch. Guard Elias Ayuso
scored 21 points and Scalabrine had one of his strongest recent
efforts with 19 points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine has slumped in Pacific-10 Conference play, and said
Thursday that he has become fatigued during the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to admit my body's really broken down,'' Scalabrine
said. ``I don't get off my feet as much as I used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that in mind, Bibby canceled the pre-game
shoot-around at the Sports Arena, and let the players get some
extra rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great idea,'' Scalabrine said. ``I know it helped me
a lot. Tonight we were fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   So fresh that the Trojans held their first halftime advantage
since they played Arizona on Jan. 2, and weren't forced to spend
the second half playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been starting off slow,'' Bibby said. ``Tonight, we
finally had a run at the beginning.''

TIRELESS NORTH TEXAS GUARD IS TEAM'S COURT MARSHAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Calvin Williams doesn't get much rest.
</P>
<P>
   He goes to the bench, at times, and tries to get a drink of
water. In no time, North Texas men's basketball coach Vic Trilli is
ordering him back out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, he begs me to come out,'' Trilli said. ``He'll say,
`Coach, just give me two (minutes).' I bring him out and maybe he
gets one and I have to get him back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just gets up and runs straight to the table. The poor guy
has to play 38, 40 minutes every game _ nothing less than 30
minutes for us to have a chance. I don't know how he's so dang
durable.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a sophomore point guard, is in every sense UNT's
warrior. In his first year on campus, Trilli gives him assignments
usually reserved for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   He breaks the press. He runs the transition game. Sometimes, the
offense simply calls for Williams to make a play one-on-one, then
find the open man.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Williams handles it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our offense,'' Williams said. ``It's blow and go _
that's what we do. The point guard has to make all the decisions
and make the plays. Coach Trilli trusts me to make the right
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, that can be a huge responsibility _ especially for a
player in his first year of NCAA Division I basketball. Last
season, Williams was playing for Midland College in an offense much
different than Trilli's. The Chaparrals finished the season 26-4
with Williams directing the offense, but it wasn't the kind of
attack in which he thrives.
</P>
<P>
   So he headed for UNT, where he hoped Trilli would play at the
same tempo the University of Texas used when Trilli was an
assistant there. Pushing the ball would also mirror Williams days
at Dallas Kimball, where he helped the Knights win consecutive
Class 5A state championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the reason he wanted to come here,'' Trilli
said. ``I think this system is a good fit for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival, Williams became Trilli's horse. With Michael
Colter sitting out until December to earn his eligibility and an
early season injury to Chris Davis, Williams was UNT's only
point-guard option throughout the first two months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I like to have a break,'' Williams said. ``But if
I've got to be in there, I'll go in and I'm going to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Colter's eligibility allowed Trilli to give Williams some rest,
but not much. The connection between Trilli and Williams is deeper
than with most players. The coach believes Williams understands
him, more so than any other player on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Williams agrees, and said there is a definite bond between
player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like my dad,'' Williams said. ``He wants the best
for everybody, but he stays on me. Just the way my dad stays on me
about school, Coach Trilli stays on me about everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been tough all my life. I can handle it. It just makes me
a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   He is tough, and at times the Eagles can't live without his
presence. That's why Williams is rarely off the court. He's
averaging more than 36 minutes a game this season, and almost all
of those are effective minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams leads the Big West Conference in assists (5.6 a game)
and has 100 assists for the season. On his current pace, he would
finish with 145 assists _ the most for any UNT player since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of Williams' impact came last week, when he played
79 minutes over two road games. During the stretch, he dished out
23 assists (11 against Utah State, 12 against Nevada) and committed
just one turnover.
</P>
<P>
   He has also become more of a scoring threat. He's averaging 7.1
points a game, but has raised that to 10.6 a game during conference
play.
</P>
<P>
   If that keeps up, Trilli is convinced there are better days
ahead _ both for Williams and for the 1-17 Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know where we would be without him,'' Trilli
said.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Will it be the brute strength of Shaquille
O'Neal and the acrobatics of Kobe Bryant? Or the watchmaker's
precision of John Stockton-to-Karl Malone on the pick-and-roll?
</P>
<P>
   Will it be a warrior's aging knees that carry Patrick Ewing the
final step? Or the scowl and ferocity of Alonzo Mourning that go
the last mile?
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the odd couple of the stolid Larry Bird and the
flamboyant Reggie Miller that finds a way for the Indiana Pacers?
Or the Twin Towers combo of David Robinson and Tim Duncan that
brings a fiesta to San Antonio?
</P>
<P>
   Now that Michael Jordan has taken his crown and jeweled scepter
off to the world of leisure, the NBA finds itself in a unique and
unexpected position _ back in the basketball business.
</P>
<P>
   With the end to the angry and debilitating labor lockout and the
departure of Jordan to the greener pastures of fairways and greens,
the NBA season is no longer a six-month marathon of Nike TV
commercials leading up to another coronation of the Chicago
Unbeata-Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the doors have been flung wide-open, and there is a
championship up for grabs once more. When the mad scramble of a
50-games-in-90-days schedule begins tonight, there will be at least
a dozen teams that believe they have a chance, none with a firmer
belief than the Rockets. For the hype, ask Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win it this year, then the hell with y'all, I'm
goin' fishin' and y'all will never find me,'' he said. ``I worked
my butt off to get in shape, and I've only got one year of this in
me. It better do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   For the potential, ask Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real challenge after 11 years in Chicago to come to
Houston, try to blend in with a whole new set of teammates,'' he
said. ``I wouldn't have come here if I didn't believe we were a
championship-caliber team. What's left now is to go out there and
prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the straight talk, ask Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win championships in the first several weeks of the
season, even in a short season,'' he said. ``You don't win them by
talking about what you are going to do and what you might be able
to do. You win them by learning to come together as a team and
enjoying the process. What we need to do is make the game fun
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The joy ride begins tonight against Shaq, Kobe and the Lakers at
the Great Western Forum in a battle for the ages _ young and old.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, of course, are the NBA's future royalty, just as
soon as they discover the secrets to teamwork and poise in the
clutch and stop tripping over the regal purple carpet on their way
to the throne room. They could own the newly reconstituted league
well into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' future is more of the immediate variety, their
birth certificates and the mileage on the legs of their big three
preventing them from looking much further ahead than tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't today all that really counts?
</P>
<P>
   Once more, Rudy T and his staff have tried to cobble together a
roster that can make another championship run before Olajuwon
retires in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a gamble? Yes. Will it depend on the fortunes of good
health? Yes. Is it capable of going all the way? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to last May 3, following an injury-filled,
tumultuous, bickering regular season in which the Rockets finished
just 41-41 and were the eighth seed in the Western Conference
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series in
Salt Lake City, with an injured Barkley on the bench in street
clothes, with Clyde Drexler suffering through a miserable 1-for-13
shooting day, with the team beaten down and worn out, the Rockets
trailed the Jazz by just three points with a little more than five
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Utah won the game, we know. But we also know that until the Jazz
ran into the Bulls of Jordan and Pippen in the NBA Finals, nobody
could play with Utah. Nobody except the Rockets, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you plug Pippen into the hole left by Drexler's retirement,
and you have a bigger version of the versatile NBA Top 50
performer. From his point-forward position, he also gives them a
big man to make passes into the low post to Olajuwon and Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a season of adjustment on the run, a season of
grueling back-to-back games and sore muscles, a season when the
injury report will be as critical as the scouting report to the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an NBA season without Air Jordan. But it also will be
the start of an era when everybody has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   No cologne. No designer shoes of the month. No cartoon movies.
No pomp and circumstance of Michael and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Just basketball. It's worth a try.

HUSKIES HANG ON TO DROP ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Homecoming turned out to be a surprise party for Jason
Terry, who was razzed and harassed by the Huskies and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   The senior point guard from Seattle scored 28 points, but
Washington held off 10th-ranked Arizona 90-84 Thursday night at Hec
Edmundson Pavilion in front of 7,900 fans.
</P>
<P>
   With the Wildcats stifling Todd MacCulloch inside, the Huskies
turned to Donald Watts and found a response. Watts, who has been
hampered by foot and ankle injuries this season, suddenly became a
slashing force again, upstaging Terry in their final battle. Watts
scored 24 points, igniting the Huskies from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Deon Luton added 20 points and Senque Carey had 17 as Washington
summoned its backcourt to defeat Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their guard play killed us all night,'' said Terry, the former
Franklin High star. ``You've got to credit Donald. He wanted this
game more than anybody out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-game hype surrounded Terry, Pac-10 player of the year
candidate, and the Wildcats. Terry at one time committed to
Washington before changing his mind. Watts came here expecting to
be in the same backcourt with him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night they were on the same court, where Watts shot
down a Terry prediction. Two years ago, Terry told Watts that
Arizona would never lose to Washington during the rest of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I got the last word,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts made the biggest shot, enabling the Huskies to hang on.
Slicing in from the left wing, Watts pulled up and banked it in
while being knocked down by Traves Wilson. The 3-point play put
Washington in front 83-76 with 1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   A supposed money player, Terry turned counterfeit in the final
two minutes, hoisting back-to-back air balls and hearing about it
from the Dawg Pack. Then he retaliated, stealing a Luton inbounds
pass and also connecting on a turnaround jumper with 33 seconds
remaining, cutting the deficit to 85-82.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies barely closed out UCLA last Sunday because of a
shaky effort at the foul line, but Watts and Carey finished off the
Wildcats by making six of seven free throws in the last 41 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Terry, who was 12-for-31 from the field, the Wildcats
got 19 points and 10 rebounds from Michael Wright and 16 points and
12 rebounds from A.J. Bramlett.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett's defense prohibited MacCulloch from being a factor. He
kept the biggest Dawg from getting position inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to keep me from getting the ball,'' said
MacCulloch, who ended up with 11 points. ``The only times I got the
ball was when he tripped.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett was solid at one end of the floor, wobbly at the other,
frustrated by MacCulloch's long arms and the banging and bumping of
Thalo Green and Chris Walcott.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott's scrappy play helped the Huskies withstand Terry's most
wicked blow, a halfcourt shot that pulled Arizona within 45-39 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott grabbed two offensive rebounds and assisted MacCulloch
on a layin to start the second half. The junior forward then found
Luton for a backdoor jam and followed it up with a steal that led
to another Luton bucket, a three from the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' shots, the Wildcats heads ... they were all
dropping at that point as Washington went on to build a 60-43 lead.
But Arizona countered with Terry and its superior inside game to
close in.
</P>
<P>
   In his final collegiate appearance at Hec Ed, Terry forced the
action, taking ill-advised shots, making only a handful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do a little too much,'' Terry said. ``But we all
had to step up. They were the enforcer all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dawg Pack hounded him, chanting ``TER-RY, TER-RY'' as
expected and ``TRAI-TOR, TRAI-TOR'' as unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Whether distracted by the crowd, pressing or merely flustered by
the Husky defense, Terry was initially ineffective. The Pac-10's
leading free-throw shooter, he had made 17 straight entering the
game. He showed up at Hec Ed and blew his first two attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. After Luton drilled a deuce that would
seemingly give the Huskies a 45-36 halftime lead, Terry took the
inbounds pass and cavorted downcourt. Just before the horn, Terry
leaped and fired between two helpless Huskies, Green and Michael
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Terry released the ball just inside the halfcourt line and
rattled it in, pulling Arizona within 45-39, silencing his
taunters, stunning all others aside from Watts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the creators of momentum, especially in our house,''
Watts reminded everyone afterward. ``That's something we had to
forget about. Hey, that was luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies improved to 13-7 and 6-4 in the Pac-10. They are in
fourth place alone, just one game behind UCLA and Arizona, both
7-3.

HUSKIES CLOSE TO RECAPTURING FEEL OF '98 RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It started with a pretty finger roll from the
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening tipoff, University of Washington guard Senque
Carey found the ball in his hands and he knew exactly what to do.
The kid cut straight to the basket, pushing the ball strong before
elevating smooth and dropping a soft scoop through the net.
</P>
<P>
   Huskies 2, Wildcats 0.
</P>
<P>
   Four seconds into a Pac-10 showdown that seemed to mean
everything to the Huskies, the home team took a stylish lead and
left you with the impression that this was going to be a fun night.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what?
</P>
<P>
   For the next 39 minutes, 56 seconds that first impression was
confirmed over and over again, much to the delight of the Hec Ed
crowd _ one populated with a hoops-loving legion that seems to be
dying to revisit the Huskies' 1998 NCAA tournament campaign that
kept the Puget Sound region glued to its TV sets for one glorious,
heart-stopping week.
</P>
<P>
   We do believe that the college basketball season has finally
begun around here.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through Washington's schedule, the fellas are ready to
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, when the Huskies knocked off Arizona
90-84, Bob Bender and his Huskies have laid claim to the sporting
spotlight _ good news for Washington, where new football coach Rick
Neuheisel took all of three weeks to create his first little stink
on Montlake.
</P>
<P>
   The report this week, in the midst of basketball season, was
recruiting violations by the new Husky coach. Neuheisel
self-reported the mistakes, a story that did nothing more than
extend the football season too long into winter _ a season in which
some of us yearn to be waist deep in NCAA tournament fever.
</P>
<P>
   All across the country, tales of Duke and Stanford, Connecticut
and Cincinnati are dominating the airwaves. We know they'll be
traveling that road to the Final Four. But closer to home, we have
been waiting patiently to see if the Huskies were willing to take
another stab at hoops nirvana _ something we had come to surrender
some hope after the Huskies opened at No. 14 in the nation, then
slipped into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems the fellas are apt to give it a go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as a nine-game season now,'' Donald Watts said
after scoring a team-high 24 points for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about these last eight or nine games, starting
(Thursday night). I haven't been able to play the way I trained my
body to play. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of
the season, then I hurt my ankle. But this is my chance to show I
am one of the best players in the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   After what Bender's Huskies did against Arizona, beating the
No.10-ranked Wildcats in a wire-to-wire show of force and
determination, we can safely, happily, smilingly glide into the
home stretch of the NCAA basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies just might be making a repeat appearance in The Big
Show.
</P>
<P>
   That is nothing to shrug at. Not if you saw the way Bender's
head was hanging just three weeks ago. That was right after the
Huskies, out of sorts, out of sync, just getting used to freshman
point guard Carey, had lost three in a row _ the last one an 88-86
heartbreaker in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. The Huskies, Bender said, used those three losses
to rediscover who they are, what they are. And contrary to popular
opinion that they might be Todd MacCulloch and the MacCullochaires,
the Huskies proved they had enough versatility to swing the ball
around and find other ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, flung into the role of starter after Dan Dickau was
injured, hit for 17 points. He proved his cool and calm and skills
can be counted on.
</P>
<P>
   Deon ``Air'' Luton gunned down 20. Big man MacCulloch, who had
one field goal in the first half (not that it bothered his
teammates) finished with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Watts, the native son and son of Slick whom we have
waited four years to see have this kind of stellar season, took
over the game.
</P>
<P>
   Watts _ tenacious, decisive, strong-willed and creative _ played
Arizona star Jason Terry to a stalemate. It was Watts who inspired
new visions of Husky hoop life deep into March. How could he not
when the Huskies pushed their lead to 17 points and then refused to
collapse under Arizona's last gasp at a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going,'' Slick Watts said about the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, after a traveling fool death march to start the
season and a prolonged foot injury to Donald Watts, have apparently
discovered why it is fun to play like you can win. Because you will
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies finally look like they no longer care if their
Pac-10 opponents are the 11th-ranked Bruins, whom the Huskies beat
last Sunday, or the 10th-ranked Wildcats, who never once took the
lead Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies seem to have finally remembered they, too, are the
stuff the NCAA tournament is made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still to be determined whether we can get that special
feel (like the Huskies did last March),'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe for him it's too early. For us, we've been waiting for the
basketball season to begin, for real.

HUSKIES WON'T KNOW THEIR FATE UNTIL JUNE

<P>
   SEATTLE _ While NCAA reinstatement of four University of
Washington football signees could happen quickly, the Huskies won't
know until June the extent of any possible penalty for rules
infractions revealed this week, Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New UW coach Rick Neuheisel admitted sending five assistant
coaches on the road Sunday during an NCAA ``quiet period,'' when
only on-campus contact was allowed. They visited the homes of four
recruits who signed UW letters of intent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 will investigate that issue, as well as Colorado's
allegation that Neuheisel telephoned CU players and attempted to
get them to transfer to the UW. Neuheisel conceded making calls to
his ex-players to ``wish them well,'' but emphatically denied
trying to entice them to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, UW athletic director Barbara Hedges defended
Neuheisel, saying of the illegal-visit violation, ``It was
inadvertent. You have to understand the time the coaches had (to
recruit) was very short. I understand how it could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Neuheisel's calls to CU players, Hedges said, ``The
reason he didn't go through the athletic office was because he had
no ulterior motive.'' Hedges said she didn't need to meet further
with Neuheisel ``because he feels terrible already.''
</P>
<P>
   The matters will be treated as one investigation by the Pac-10,
Hansen said. A new compliance director, Dan Coonan, will head the
investigation, report to the league's four-person compliance
committee in the spring, and the committee will make its
recommendation to the Pac-10 council at its June meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Pac-10 decides a course of action, it is reviewed by
the NCAA, which usually approves it.
</P>
<P>
   Range of penalties probably hinges on whether the tampering
allegations hold up. The Huskies could get no penalty or a loss of
a small number of scholarships or something in between _ slight
restrictions on recruiting time, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado letter containing the tampering allegations was
sent to the UW by CU assistant athletic director for compliance
Karen Morrison. She said it originated from a player talking to a
staff member, and mushroomed from there. Through several
conversations, Morrison determined a number of players had been
called.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA rules prohibit contacting athletes from another school
without written permission from an athletic director, so it appears
Neuheisel broke the narrow definition of the rule. Much more
serious would be any proof of recruiting players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel the University of Colorado would not have sent a
request asking them (the Huskies) to investigate if all that
occurred was saying goodbye to players,'' Morrison said. ``I think
we probably would have turned our heads the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The other issue, the illegal home visits, has drawn the ire of
both Oregon and Washington State and caused the UW to declare the
four recruits ineligible, a routine action. Coaches Mike Bellotti
of Oregon and Mike Price at WSU are co-signing a letter to the NCAA
with Colorado's Gary Barnett and Colorado State's Sonny Lubick
expressing consternation and seeking significant penalty for the
UW.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty shocked the coaches would do that,'' Hedges said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett was quoted that each of the four lost a player as a
result of the illegal visits, but that is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's simply not the case,'' Hedges said.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, WSU and Oregon all were recruiting defensive back
Chris Massey of Moreno Valley, Calif., who returned from a trip to
Nebraska Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But, Massey's father Walt said Thursday, ``When he first got
back, Chris pretty much at that point said, `I still like
Washington.' He pretty much stuck with Washington all day Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Massey told the Post-Intelligencer Jan. 26 that his decision was
down to UW, Colorado ``and Oregon, too,'' and Walt Massey said
Sunday, ``It's down to Washington and Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Massey said the family hosted UW defensive
coordinator Tim Hundley in their home for ``an hour, if that long''
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Massey said his son was informed of the controversy by
Neuheisel before signing, but was unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, and I was a little bit surprised,'' Massey said. ``I
thought that would affect his decision-making. (But) Coach
Neuheisel was very upfront about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris feels it's something that's going to be ironed out. He
just wants to go play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicker John Anderson of Boca Raton, Fla., also was visited by a
UW staffer, Bobby Hauck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the Super Bowl together,'' said Anderson, who
committed early to the Huskies and said he didn't waver despite
getting calls last week from Virginia, Ohio State, Boston College
and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   In Boulder, backup quarterback Adam Bledsoe, acknowledging he
and Neuheisel have had differences in the past, said, ``Everybody's
just kind of in disbelief he broke the (visitation) rules so
blatantly. I mean, the players even know that rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he had been called by Neuheisel and said CU's
starting quarterback, Mike Moschetti, had as well. Victor Rogers,
an offensive lineman from Federal Way, and three roommates also
said they were called by Neuheisel. Another player, Zack Colvin,
said Neuheisel had left him a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just apologized for having to leave on the note he left
on,'' said Bledsoe, brother of former WSU quarterback Drew Bledsoe,
``and said he hoped he could maintain friendly relationships with
the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies host Colorado Sept. 25, just one of several games
where the pitch is likely to be heated.

SAVED BY THE BARON

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From embarrassment to ecstasy in 48 hours, it was
a week even Baron Davis found unique.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after he was publicly reprimanded by the Pac-10 for
criticizing an official _ and forced to apologize to avoid
suspension _ Davis made the game-winning basket as time expired to
give UCLA a 79-77 victory over Oregon on Thursday in front of
10,270 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' heroics began with seven seconds remaining, when he
grabbed an inbound pass and dribbled upcourt. As he approached the
lane, Davis accelerated, then gained his balance, stopped abruptly,
and drained a 15-footer as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was luck,'' said Davis, who also made the game-winner
against Oregon last year at Pauley. ``I tried to push the ball up
and take the first available shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken shots like that in practice, but I remembered the
Arizona State game and how I got in too deep and they blocked my
shot. When we broke the huddle, (assistant) coach (Steve) Spencer
said the midrange jumper would be open.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, beaming in front of his locker, Davis dismissed
the redemption theme. He admitted to being depressed early in the
week, after his post-Washington criticism of official Terry
Christman drew the Pac-10's wrath. But he had recovered by tipoff
and played one of his best floor games, with 12 points, a
career-high 11 assists and the basket that broke Oregon's heart.
</P>
<P>
   While the transition from sorrow to joy has never been so swift,
Davis' agonizing public experiences _ from Blazergate in 1996 to a
severe knee injury last March _ helped keep his psyche straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Washington game, I was down, real down, but I've had
experiences like this,'' he said. ``What happened my senior year
(Blazergate) helped prepare me for this. It helped me bounce back.
I used that to handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Davis handled his reprimand better than the Bruins
handled Oregon. UCLA played stifling defense in the final minutes,
but for most of the game it seemed distracted _ as if this were a
pre-Christmas snoozer against American University. Perhaps the
Bruins were thinking about the revenge game Sunday against Oregon
State. Perhaps, as coach Steve Lavin believes, they are fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Bruins were sluggish, uninterested and
sloppy. Since the spirited victory at Louisville two weeks ago,
they have regressed _ and done so at the worst possible time: The
NCAA Tournament Selection Committee puts a premium on a team's
performance in its final 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (16-5, 7-3), which moved into a second-place tie with
Arizona, has nine left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oregon beat us to the punch in transition and on the boards,
similar to what Washington did,'' Lavin said. ``It wasn't the
prettiest game, but it was hard-fought and we found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who have lost eight Pac-10 games at the
buzzer/overtime, shot 69 percent in the second half and
outrebounded UCLA 37-25. For 38 minutes, the best team wore green.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA has an NBA player in Baron and a No. 1 recruiting
class,'' Oregon coach Ernie Kent said. ``I've got to believe we did
something right.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the final minutes, when they did nothing right.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed 77-73 with a minute remaining when forward
Jerome Moiso hit a 16-foot jumper. Thirty seconds later, Davis
stole the ball from Oregon's A.D. Smith and found guard Ray Young
for the tying dunk.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks set a play for freshman Freddie Jones, but he charged
into UCLA's Earl Watson, giving the Bruins the ball and Davis the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well on defense down the stretch, that's what I'm
proud of,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA played most of the second half without its big men, Dan
Gadzuric, whose right knee ached from tendinitis, and Moiso, who
was ineffective against Oregon's small, quick lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But JaRon Rush and reserve Travis Reed helped compensate,
combining for 30 points in the most productive game they have
played in weeks. Rush was especially effective, with a team-high 17
points on 6-of-9 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really comfortable tonight,'' he said. ``I wasn't
nervous at all. It was just like a high school game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Note: UCLA senior Liron Artzi, a Woodland Hills resident and
Taft High graduate, won books and tuition for a year _ about $5,000
_ by making a halfcourt shot during a GTE-sponsored halftime
contest.

 WINE LABELS CAN TELL BUYERS BENEFITS OF DRINK  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Ten years after slapping health warnings on all
alcoholic beverage containers, federal regulators have decided to
allow vintners to attach new labels promoting the health benefits
of wine, sources told The Chronicle.
<P>
   The decision by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms _ to
be made public Friday morning _ is a big victory for California
winemakers, who have long sought a way to counterbalance the
warning labels and distance themselves from products such as
cigarettes, which are coming under increased regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to counter those efforts to mischaracterize us as a
sin or a gateway drug,'' said John De Luca, president of the San
Francisco-based Wine Institute, which represents 475 wineries.
</P>
<P>
   The existing labels on all wine, beer and liquor bottles warn of
potential health problems associated with drinking as well as the
risks to pregnant women and drivers. Under the new regulations,
winemakers will now be able to add one of the following labels:
</P>
<P>
   ``To learn the health effects of wine consumption, send for the
federal government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans,'' or ``The
proud people who made this wine encourage you to consult your
family doctor about the health effects of wine consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   De Luca described the development as a ``defining new chapter in
the evolution'' of federal policy toward wine, which has gone from
being banned during Prohibition in the 1920s to being described in
the government's 1995 ``Dietary Guidelines'' as potentially
reducing the risk of heart disease in some individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the decision said Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, whose department oversees the ATF, took the unusual
step of reviewing the proposal himself. Despite objections from two
powerful senators _ Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. and Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
_ Rubin concluded that the agency had no legal cause to deny the
label requests submitted by the California vintners, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, whose crusade against destructive drinking preceded a
1993 accident in which his 22-year-old daughter was killed by a
drunken driver, is determined to fight any effort to dilute the
health warnings he championed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only change that should be made to labels on alcoholic
beverage containers should be changes that state even more
emphatically the health dangers associated with drinking alcohol _
even in moderate amounts,'' said Thurmond's press secretary John
DeCrosta, who had not yet seen the ATF's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said the ATF will also announce new regulations to
crack down on the packaging of alcoholic drinks designed for
underage drinkers _ such as spiked Popsicles, gelatin and sweet
drinks sold in juice boxes _ and work to develop legislation to
further discourage underage drinkers. Officials at the Treasury
Department would not comment on today's expected announcement.
</P>
<P>
   There is great debate among scientists about as to  &LR; the
therapeutic effects of wine, though several studies have shown that
moderate consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry insists that the voluntary labels will have a
negligible effect on people's drinking habits and says it is a
victory for public policy, not marketing reasons. At a time when
tobacco companies are facing hostile lawsuits and new regulations,
vintners say their long-term strategy is to build a ``firewall''
between their product and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   And after persuading the Department of Agriculture in 1995 to
mention the benefits of moderate drinking in its guidelines, the
vintners argue that they now have a First Amendment right to
educate their customers about the full range of health effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think most doctors know enough of the health benefits of
wine that they will give objective advice to their patients,'' said
Patrick Campbell, owner of Laurel Glen winery in Glen Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who first proposed new labels in 1995, said he will
attach the new label to his 1993 Cabernet Sauvignon reserve as soon
as he gets the official notification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients clearly shouldn't be drinking wine,'' he said.
``But that is not a matter for government to decide. It's for a
patient in consultation with his physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Health professionals who work with substance abusers are
concerned that such labels will confuse consumers and provide some
a green light for excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the illusion that wine is health food. And wine is
not health food,'' said Diana Conti, executive director of the
Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug
Problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People end up thinking, `Wine is good for me _ and I should
have a lot of it,''' she said. ``These health benefits are tied to
moderate use.''
</P>
<P>
   The dietary guidelines, approved in 1995 by the USDA and the
Department of Health and Human Services, note that alcoholic
beverages supply no nutrients and that heavy drinking can lead to
strokes, heart disease, cancer, violence and cirrhosis of the
liver. But the guidelines also note that alcoholic beverages have
been used ``to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies
throughout human history,'' and that current evidence suggests that
``moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk for coronary
heart disease in some individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   It characterizes moderate drinking as no more than one drink per
day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men, with a
drink defined as either 12 ounces of beer, 11/2 ounces of liquor or
five ounces of wine.

vintners say their long-term strategy is to build a ``firewall''
between their product and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   And after persuading the Department of Agriculture in 1995 to
mention the benefits of moderate drinking in its guidelines, the
vintners argue that they now have a First Amendment right to
educate their customers about the full range of health effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think most doctors know enough of the health benefits of
wine that they will give objective advice to their patients,'' said
Patrick Campbell, owner of Laurel Glen winery in Glen Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who first proposed new labels in 1995, said he will
attach the new label to his 1993 Cabernet Sauvignon reserve as soon
as he gets the official notification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients clearly shouldn't be drinking wine,'' he said.
``But that is not a matter for government to decide. It's for a
patient in consultation with his physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Health professionals who work with substance abusers are
concerned that such labels will confuse consumers and provide some
a green light for excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the illusion that wine is health food. And wine is
not health food,'' said Diana Conti, executive director of the
Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug
Problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People end up thinking, `Wine is good for me _ and I should
have a lot of it,' '' she said. ``These health benefits are tied to
moderate use.''
</P>
<P>
   The dietary guidelines, approved in 1995 by the USDA and the
Department of Health and Human Services, note that alcoholic
beverages supply no nutrients and that heavy drinking can lead to
strokes, heart disease, cancer, violence and cirrhosis of the
liver. But the guidelines also note that alcoholic beverages have
been used ``to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies
throughout human history,'' and that current evidence suggests that
``moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk for coronary
heart disease in some individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   It characterizes moderate drinking as no more than one drink per
day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men, with a
drink defined as either 12 ounces of beer, 11/2 ounces of liquor or
five ounces of wine.

 QUAKE FAULT DISCOVERED AT MUSSEL ROCK IN SAN MATEO COUNTY  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A geologist examining landslides that have
threatened some homes in Daly City, San Mateo County, has
discovered evidence of an unknown earthquake fault that ruptured
long ago in the city's sheer seaside cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   The newfound seismic trace, linked to the San Andreas, has been
named the Mussel Rock Fault and it poses a major question: Is it
still active, and thus a possible future earthquake hazard for the
northern San Francisco Peninsula region, or is it so ancient that
it can now be considered safely inactive?
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kieffer, a geologist and engineer with the San Francisco
consulting firm of Jacobs Associates, found the rupture as he was
examining layers of uplifted sedimentary rock high on the face of a
cliff 150 feet above the ocean on the south side of Mussel Rock.
</P>
<P>
   That promontory has long been known as the spot where the San
Andreas Fault runs out into the seabed before hitting land again on
the Marin County coast.
</P>
<P>
   And  &LR; By examining maps and terrain that reveals small valleys
and displaced stream channels along the Mussel Rock Fault's inland
trace, Kieffer has determined that the fault is actually a
``splay'' of the San Andreas. It joins the San Andreas near
Pacifica, nearly two miles south, but there is no way of knowing
how far the fault extends into the seabed beyond Mussel Rock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kieffer's engineering firm has been hired by Daly City to assess
the stability of its major landslide areas, which can move downward
from high bluffs near the coast. The motion of the slides may be
set off by quakes, or when heavy rains saturate the ground, as was
the case during last year's El Nino storms.
</P>
<P>
   It was while Kieffer was mapping the Mussel Rock area last fall,
he said, that he roped himself onto the face of a steep cliff-side
and swung down to examine layers of sedimentary rock towering above
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, he found clear evidence of a past earthquake
rupture that had struck across a fault no one had ever mapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most spectacular fault exposure I'd ever seen,''
Kieffer said, ``and although it wasn't exactly comfortable where I
was hanging on the rope, when I looked at the rupture, I said to
myself, `Wow, this thing's young!' ''
</P>
<P>
   It may be young in geological terms, that is, because the
bedrock Franciscan Formation beneath it is some 60 million years
old. Kieffer and his colleagues from the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park have estimated that the sedimentary layer where
Kieffer's quake evidence is exposed is only about 120,000 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   If the quake struck that long ago, then by the standards of the
California Division of Mines and Geology, the fault would be
classified as inactive and further investigation would not be
needed. But if the fault has generated a quake as recently as
11,000 years ago, it would be considered active, requiring urgent
work to determine its potential for renewed seismic danger.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Sitar, professor of geological engineering at the
University of California at Berkeley, has examined the evidence
Kieffer has uncovered. ``This is a major fault trace, no question
about it,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial issue in assessing seismic dangers along the San
Andreas Fault zone, Sitar explained, is the true width of the
entire zone, and this new fault discovery at Mussel Rock extends
the known width of the zone significantly in that area.
</P>
<P>
   With support from colleagues at the U.S. Geological Survey,
Kieffer is now seeking financing under the Survey's National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program to determine whether the
Mussel Rock Fault is young enough to be still active. The study
would involve trenching across the fault to observe other layers
ruptured by past quakes, and dating long-buried plant materials
using radioactive carbon.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake evidence Kieffer uncovered on his cliff shows
that when the ancient rupture occurred, it shoved the opposite
sides of the fault past each other in a motion seismologists call
right lateral strike-slip. That motion also dominates movements of
the San Andreas itself when it creeps or ruptures violently in a
quake.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some vertical movement too, known as ``normal''
faulting, and the entire northern Peninsula often feels small
earthquakes that show combinations of strike-slip and vertical
motions, according to the Geological Survey's Mary Lou Zoback. It's
the same kind of movement, Kieffer said, that marked the the
long-ago earthquake whose evidence he found on the Daly City
cliff-side.
</P>
<P>
   The entire San Andreas Fault zone, with its many linked fault
traces both large and small, marks the boundary between two great
slabs of the earth's crust: the Pacific Plate, which for millions
of years has been grinding northwestward in fits and starts past
the North American Plate, which stands relatively still.
</P>
<P>
   So anyone who stands today atop Mussel Rock, where the San
Andreas moves out to sea, is actually standing on the boundary
where two of the greatest great crustal plates on Earth are
grinding past each other even now _ at a speed that averages one
inch a year. &LR;

 &HT;    DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL RACE _ OVER BEFORE IT STARTED?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a growing sense among Democrats that the
contest for their 2000 presidential nomination may be over even
before their front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, announces his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strongest potential challenger, House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, decided this week to forgo a
presidential run, and other contenders are no more than rumors so
far.
</P>
<P>
   But many key Democratic activists had long ago grown comfortable
with the idea of Gore leading the party into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that since last fall maybe 65 percent of my
colleagues have felt that, for better or worse, the vice president
was likely to be our nominee,'' said Lawrence Longley of Appleton,
Wis., a political scientist who also is one of 445 members of the
Democratic National Committee, the party's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutionally, Gore's strength, in terms of organization and
fund raising, is unprecedented for a sitting vice president,'' said
Celinda Lake, a leading pollster and strategist in the Democratic
Party who is not affiliated with Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, seem to have accepted the inevitability of
Gore as their opponent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, in announcing his candidacy for the GOP nomination
last week, set his sights squarely on Gore. ``I will win the
nomination, and I will beat Al Gore,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   And at the GOP's national headquarters, the party has hoisted a
``Gore Spend-o-Meter'' to tally government spending in the final
two years of the Clinton presidency _ spending that RNC Chairman
Jim Nicholson said is ``most intended to benefit Clinton's ...
chief defender and heir apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the states with early presidential contests that matter the
most _ Iowa, New Hampshire, California and New York _ it is
difficult to find an influential Democrat who is not committed to
Gore or leaning his way. And on each of his trips to those states,
going back nearly two years, Gore has come bearing gifts of federal
largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire last week, for example, Gore punctuated his two
favorite themes, education and the environment, by announcing
federal grants to help combat unchecked urban sprawl and promoting
the Clinton administration's ``hope scholarships'' program.
</P>
<P>
   In that state, which traditionally holds the first primary of
the season, Gore has inherited much of the Clinton campaign
apparatus and has won over activists such as Joe Keefe, who worked
for Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in the 1992 primary.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Gore has the backing of Sen. Tom Harkin and Attorney
General Tom Miller. The new Democratic governor, Tom Vilsack, is
leaning toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which has moved up its primary from June to March
7 in order to have a greater role in selecting nominees, the Gore
camp includes the new lieutenant governor, Cruz Bustamante, and the
state assembly speaker, Antonio Villaraigosa. Loretta Sanchez, the
Hispanic congresswoman who co-chaired Gore's political action
committee, is soon to become deputy chair of the DNC. And the new
governor, Gray Davis, is expected to support Gore. Davis's wife,
Sharon, supported Gore in his 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, which also will have its primary March 7, Gore is
supported by Sheldon Silver, speaker of the state assembly, and
Arthur Eve, the deputy speaker. Eve was co-chair of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's campaign in New York in 1984 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has commitments from top Wall Street players to help
him raise $35 million, the maximum allowed for the primaries, by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the vice president has enormous advantages,'' said
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would expect an incumbent vice president to have those
kinds of advantages,'' said Eric Hauser, spokesman for Bill
Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who is Gore's only rival for
the party nomination so far. ``But that doesn't mean this thing is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``there is not going to be a gut-wrenching battle for the
heart and soul of the Democratic Party'' that some activists once
envisioned, said Keefe.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Democrats expected to see at least seven candidates
in the presidential race. Now only Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts
and Jackson are reportedly still weighing whether to run for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser said Bradley, a former National Basketball Association
star, ``wouldn't mind one bit playing a little one-on-one'' with
Gore. ``Off the record,'' he quipped, ``I think the vice president
still has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's only hope, though, seems to hinge on using his
celebrity to draw new voters into the presidential primaries, much
the way Jesse Ventura did in winning the Minnesota governor's race
last fall. But Bradley, a Rhodes scholar before his professional
basketball and political careers, lacks the showmanship of Ventura,
a former professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are plenty of pitfalls for Gore in his quest for
the party's nomination. He rarely generates excitement in his
public appearances. He is a hostage to the economy, Clinton's trump
card and political salvation. And while Gore's personal life is
exemplary, especially when compared to the president's, he cannot
totally escape fallout from the public's dismay over the
fund-raising excesses of the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and
Clinton's scandalous personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is absolutely safe in American politics,'' said Steve
Jarding, a longtime political adviser to Kerrey.

over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``there is not going to be a gut-wrenching battle for the
heart and soul of the Democratic Party'' that some activists once
envisioned, said Keefe.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Democrats expected to see at least seven candidates
in the presidential race. Now only Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts
and Jackson are reportedly still weighing whether to run for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser said Bradley, a former National Basketball Association
star, ``wouldn't mind one bit playing a little one-on-one'' with
Gore. ``Off the record,'' he quipped, ``I think the vice president
still has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's only hope, though, seems to hinge on using his
celebrity to draw new voters into the presidential primaries, much
the way Jesse Ventura did in winning the Minnesota governor's race
last fall. But Bradley, a Rhodes scholar before his professional
basketball and political careers, lacks the showmanship of Ventura,
a former professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are plenty of pitfalls for Gore in his quest for
the party's nomination. He rarely generates excitement in his
public appearances. He is a hostage to the economy, Clinton's trump
card and political salvation. And while Gore's personal life is
exemplary, especially when compared to the president's, he cannot
totally escape fallout from the public's dismay over the
fund-raising excesses of the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and
Clinton's scandalous personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is absolutely safe in American politics,'' said Steve
Jarding, a longtime political adviser to Kerrey.

 &HT;    Alabama researchers take scientific journey together
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fifteen years ago, two young scientists met in a lab,
fell in love with their work and then fell in love with each other.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Drs. Beatrice Hahn and George Shaw caught the world's
attention after she presented a paper at a conference in Chicago
showing their findings that a virus in chimpanzees was the starting
point for the AIDS epidemic in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between Hahn and Shaw, both physicians at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for AIDS Research, is
both a marriage and a scientific journey. It began in the 1980s in
the crucible of research that was the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   There, as young doctors working under Dr. Robert M. Gallo, the
couple helped search for the cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory bench work _ the slow, precise research that forms
the unsung backbone of so-called ``scientific breakthroughs'' _ is
not the stuff of novels, Hahn admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it was a romantic ideal, but we were so
excited with the work and with being in that lab. It was later that
we fell in love,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The native of a small town in Germany, Hahn was fresh from the
University of Munich when she joined the Gallo team in 1982, just
as AIDS was beginning to be recognized. Ohio-born Shaw arrived a
year later, having just finished his clinical training at Ohio
State University. The collaboration continued over the years,
incorporating a move to the South in 1985, university
professorships, marriage in 1988, scientific inquiries, the birth
of two daughters and the same daily concerns that other couples
have.
</P>
<P>
   With one addition.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn maintained a constant curiosity about, and focus on, a
group of chimpanzees and the lentivirus (from the Latin word for
slow) that infected them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been working on the origin and evolution of primate
lentiviruses for their own sake, but also because we have always
known it was one of the most likely responsible sources for two
human viruses,'' Hahn says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along the way I've had different projects in the lab,
including some that are related to HIV vaccines, but this has been
a special hobby. I wanted to know where these primate viruses came
from, how they spread from infected animals, and who infected whom,
and when.''
</P>
<P>
   Together with longtime associates Dr. Feng Gao, also of UAB, and
Dr. Paul Sharp at the University of Nottingham, among others, Hahn
and Shaw worked on the study that made headlines this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn is unsure whether she and Shaw should be called the Will
and Ariel Durant of microbiology, referring to the husband and wife
historians writing team, but she says they work extremely well
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, when you are young and starting a career, you want
to branch off and do your own work and be recognized as your own
person, so that's what George and I did,'' she recalls. ``If you
constantly work together, it's assumed that one is profiting from
the other or one is smarter than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hahn, 43, and Shaw, 45, don't feel like they have to prove
anything on their own. They have become finely tuned equals, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my group of people that do bench work, and he has his.
I come from a basic science angle, and he comes from a clinical
angle, and we mesh in the middle,'' Hahn says. ``We divide the home
life, as well. Our daughters are ages 7 and 1, and we split up the
child care and cooking and household responsibilities. That is the
only way to have a full work life and home life at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Juggling home and a demanding ``life of the mind'' simply
requires discipline, Hahn says. ``I work 8 to 6 and never at night
or on weekends. And I use the time after work productively with the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as the chimpanzee study was being written and
rewritten, Hahn and Shaw drew even closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would go home, spend time with the children until their
bedtime at 8:30, then sit down at 8:31 at the kitchen table every
night until it was done to everyone's satisfaction,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The pair give constant credit to the international research team
that helped them over the years. ``The study could never have been
done without veterinarian Larry B. Cummins, who took care of the
key research chimpanzee, Marilyn, and deciphered her past to prove
she had been a wild-caught chimp; or Martine Peters, in France, who
provided us with viral material from the chimps she had studied for
10 years; or Paul Sharp at the University of Nottingham, whose
molecular analysis helped drive the research forward; or Dr. Feng
Gao, at UAB, one of my longtime collaborators in viral studies,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for scientists, says Hahn, is ``urgently to find
out what the prevalence of infection is today in wild-living
chimps.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because humans butcher chimps in parts of Africa for
food. It is widely suspected that the practice led to the spread of
AIDS from primates into humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know whether there is still risk of infection from
butchering animals, but also we need to stop the killing because we
may need the diversity of the chimps and their viruses for medical
research,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's research could also provide new insights into how
HIV progresses in the body, possible vaccine development and
comparative genetic studies, since chimps and humans share 98
percent of their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, as Hahn and Shaw have been in the spotlight, one
who is smiling from a distance is their old mentor, Gallo, now
director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two of my favorite people in biomedical science, and
it gives you goose pimples to see them doing so well, people you
feel so close to,'' Gallo said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tremendous number of students at the NIH in the '80s,
hundreds, and I would have to list Beatrice and George among the
top few,'' said Gallo.

</P>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK-ANNIVERSARY (Rome, N.Y.) _ A former Air Force base
once bristling with B-52 bombers will host three days of peace,
love and money-making this summer for Woodstock's 30th anniversary
festival in central New York. ``I see it as sort of beating swords
into plowshares,'' the sponsor said in announcing the July 23-25
event at the former Griffiss Air Force Base. By EDWARD FITZPATRICK.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-VOICE (Undated) _ Big Mouths have a lot to say in
``Little Voice,'' but it's the pipsqueak wallflowers who get center
stage. In a film full of noisy sorts, the biggest revelations come
from the quietest people. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-PAYBACK (Undated) _ The ads for ``Payback'' make a
bold claim: ``Get ready to root for the bad guy.'' And Mel Gibson
makes a most excellent bad guy? But what the ads don't tell you is
that this time, the bad guy takes it just a nudge too far. By AMY
BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-JOE (Undated) _ In a bare-knuckles corner of
Glasgow, recovering alcoholic Joe Kavanaugh runs a scruffy amateur
soccer team and takes a paternal interest in one of its members, a
nice-guy ex-doper who's deeply in debt to hoodlums and trying to
raise a son with his companion, a junkie and sometime hooker. It's
a thoroughly gritty bunch that inhabits the no-illusions world of
Ken Loach's potent slice-of-life drama, ``My Name Is Joe.'' By
WALTER ADDIEGO.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-IRRESISTIBLE (Undated) _ ``Simply Irresistible'' is
a gooey-sweet, beautifully photographed romantic fantasy, with two
beguiling young stars in Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'') and Sean Patrick Flanery (``Powder''). The
combination thereof will be enough to pack the theaters come
Valentine's Day. By JANE GANAHL.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-RUSHMORE (Undated) _ Maybe Wes Anderson's Max
Fischer is a smart-aleck boy genius, the latest in a line
stretching back to Tom Sawyer, but in ``Rushmore'' he could stand
as a symbol for this era. Max is a genius, all right, but he's a
childish, self-absorbed one who doesn't quite know how to use his
seemingly endless energy and inventive mind. By G. ALLEN JOHNSON.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GOLF (Pebble Beach, Calif.) _ This is probably the biggest
week for non-fans to watch golf, as the Pebble Beach hootenanny
captivates those wanting a glimpse of this Tiger kid and a lot of
Bill Murray and celebrity friends. Don't ask me why people want to
watch Clint Eastwood or Kevin Costner hack away when they could get
visual tips from somebody who really knows how to play. By TIM
GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN-CANISTERS (Albany, N.Y.) _ One steadfast kitchen
accessory, which has been on counters since the 19th century, is
the canister set. Originally, just about any airtight container
served as a canister. They are intended to prevent the invasion of
weevils, mice, rats and roaches, as well as dust and humidity. By
FRANCES INGRAHAM. (For release Sunday, Feb. 7).
</P>
<P>
   HARDWARE-STORES (Albany, N.Y.) _ It's easy to develop a case of
the gotta-haves when traversing through a hardware store. There are
so many handy items on display, and so many jobs to do at home. And
all good tools may come to those who acquire them over time. But if
you're just starting out as a handyperson, you have to begin at the
beginning. By FRANCES INGRAHAM. (For release Sunday, Feb. 7.)
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SFO-EXPANSION (San Francisco) _ Even as the cost of
controversial new runways has soared to more than $2.2 billion, San
Francisco International Airport officials are exploring a plan to
ease the airport's worsening delays by cutting the number of
commuter flights and forcing airlines to use bigger planes on
short-haul flights. The idea is getting a cool reception from
United Airlines, which handles half of the 1,260 flights a day at
SFO. By LARRY D. HATFIELD.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   NBA-TALK (Undated) _ There's a reason talk is cheap. Any
resemblance between what people say and what they mean is purely
coincidental. Take the National Basketball Association _ please.
Some of the talk is so cheap, linguists have classified it as pure
trash. When all is said and done, much more is said than done. By
STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-PEBBLE (Pebble Beach, Calif.) _ The AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am is known for getting the back-hand from Mother
Nature and last year's El Nino sloshfest is still imprinted on many
people's minds. But there is something about the spectacle _ spread
over three courses _ that is worth enduring howling winds, bitter
cold (well, for California) and a phalanx of cellphone-carrying
people yelling ``Get legs!'' and other golf cliches. By TIM
GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ One fulminates. The other
obfuscates. One splits eardrums. The other splits hairs. But both
are articulate and powerful speakers, and they both love to travel.
It's just that President Clinton has Air Force One, while San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown is stuck with Air Pantywaist. By ROB
MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Chelsea Clinton is now fair game.
She's been Peopled. Staring supermarket shoppers in the face this
week is a People magazine cover of Hillary and Chelsea Clinton,
headlined ``Grace Under Fire.'' People magazine had turned the
president's daughter into an official celebrity, right up there
with Courteney Cox and Gwyneth Paltrow. By ROB MORSE. (For release
Sunday, Feb. 7.)
</P>
<P>
   WONG-COLUMN (Oakland, Calif.) _ Vice President Al Gore came to
San Francisco last week, dispensing goodies in a classic exercise
in political promises. He said the Clinton administration is
proposing to restore social service benefits taken away from legal
immigrants by the Welfare Reform Act of three years ago. It would
be good if Congress approves the $1.3 billion benefits package _
assuming, of course, it can see beyond Monica Lewinsky. By WILLIAM
WONG.
</P>
<P>
   LUDDITES (Lafayette, Calif.) _ This Luddite rejects the Internet
and the cell phone. As a retired but active person, my life (and my
wife's) is centered on, but not confined to, the welfare of our
three sons and their families. We don't want to read stuff on the
screen; we want to hear those blessed voices. Our families are so
busy scrambling for a living they haven't time to sit in front of
their screens; they barely have time to sit, period. By KEN
ALEXANDER.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The GOP is lost in its own confusions
 &HT;    (Eds: The Teepen column that moved Thursday dealt with the
two-tier impeachment proposal that has since lost many of its
sponsors. The following column is sent for papers wanting a
substitute.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point, like watching an awkward child knock over another
lamp, exasperation has to turn to pity for the fumbling Republican
Party. It has become politically all thumbs, and its nemesis, the
wily Bill Clinton, has got it spilling its milk again in the matter
of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has seen its traditional issues stripped away like
leaves in an autumn gale. The Cold War is kaput. Welfare has been
reformed. Business booms. Crime is way down and Clinton is as much
against what's left of it as the noisiest Republican crimestopper.
</P>
<P>
   Even the morality issue _ to the limited degree voters thought
it was any of Washington's business in the first place _ is fading.
Teen pregnancies, divorce, unwed births and abortions are all down,
despite the president's sometimes bad example. Maybe our presidents
are just presidents after all, and not stewards, like the mandarins
of old China, of the mantle of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   And did the GOP want balanced budgets? Clinton has got surpluses
and offers a budget that would 1) substantially repair if not
definitively fix Social Security and Medicare, 2) promote private
savings to sustain long-term economic growth, 3) put major bucks
into education, environmental protection and a military upgrade,
and 4) lower the national debt ratio over the next 15 years to its
pre-World War I level, if the good times hold.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments over specifics aside, the political cunning of the
president's tender is awesome. For a comeback, Republicans have
been left with naught but carping and their constant call for an
across-the-board tax cut _ an offer that on most voters' wish lists
ranks somewhere down there with free tickets to the roller derby.
</P>
<P>
   And rates poorly for good reason. The 10-percent cut Republicans
are gathering around for warmth like hobos around a campfire would
be small boon for most of us. Citizens for Tax Justice figures more
than 60 percent of the boodle would go to folks in the top 10
percent of incomes. The average cut for those making less than
$38,000: $1.90 a week. For those making over $300,000: $20,000-plus
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is doing well and poorly. It has talent in
the statehouses, for instance, but its congressional muster too
often looks spilled from a clown car.
</P>
<P>
   Its national committee banked $69.9 million last year to the
Democratic National Committee's $53.4 million, but the GOP's
approval ratings have been driven into the pits by its obsession
with Clinton. Rich is not the same as well off.

<P>
   The party has a potentially appealing presidential candidate in
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, but the usual GOP gunners _ Quayle,
Forbes, Alexander et al. _ are ridiculing his ``compassionate
conservatism.'' To answer Clinton's squishy capacity to feel
everybody's pain, the GOP's domineering right offers a party that
will feel no one's. These people couldn't sell warm to an Eskimo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Republicans have kept beating their heads against the
brick wall of impeachment because, on balance, that seemed slightly
easier than dealing with their own confusions.

 &HT;    WOODWORKING: Another look at resawing issue
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question of resawing stock as opposed to simply wasting a
lot of it has arisen once again, with some interesting variations.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, a gentleman says ``I need 1/2'' or 3/8'' stock
for drawer sides and so forth. The options seem to be 1. paying a
large amount for stock that someone else has resawn, 2. doing it
myself or 3. turning half a board into sawdust in the planer. The
latter gets expensive, and bothers me to waste that much stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of resawing looks simple enough, although since I
don't own a bandsaw I'm sure there are some problems I don't know
about yet. A guy at the lumber store said I can resaw on my table
saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``My questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there another option to get the thinner stock?
</P>
<P>
   ``Resawing with the table saw seems pretty dangerous; is it
safe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been delaying this decision, since the cost of a bandsaw
that can resaw a 6'' board will buy a couple-hundred board feet of
lumber to work with ...''
</P>
<P>
   As far as I'm concerned, the idea of wasting half of a board is
not an option. It would be cheaper and less of an atrocity to buy
pre-cut drawer sides in plywood. Leaving that much wood on the
floor is an ecological affront as well as uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an other way to get thinner stock? For what we're
talking about, no. There are lots of ways to make stock a little
thinner, but resawing is the only feasible way to turn one large
board into several small ones.
</P>
<P>
   Resawing can be done on a table saw, and indeed, I have done it.
I cannot report, however, that I enjoyed it. If you're going to do
it, however, here's how:
</P>
<P>
   Raise your blade as high as it will go and measure its height.
Double that, take off an eighth or so, and that is the maximum
width of a board you can resaw on your equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Run an alignment check. Be certain that your blade is exactly
square to the table and so is your fence. Make an auxiliary fence
to hold the workpiece absolutely flat against the main fence during
the operation. This can be a simple or a complicated jig, depending
on how often you plan to do this. The only requirements are that it
must have a face that is square to the table and perfectly flat
along its length, it must be absolutely square to the main fence,
and it must be absolutely secure. You do not want this thing coming
loose during the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Joint and plane your workpiece perfectly square on all four
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Set the main fence to produce a board of the thickness you
require. Bear in mind that this should be a little fatter than the
final thickness; some planing will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Set the auxiliary fence to keep the workpiece tight to the
fence. By tight, I mean there can be no play at all. Do not, on the
other hand, mash it in so that the pressure binds the blade as you
cut.
</P>
<P>
   How deep you can cut in a single pass will be up to the quality
and sharpness of your ripping blade and the power of your saw. But
I would recommend against trying to hog it. Nice and easy is best,
so I'd probably not cut more than half an inch at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Mark the face side of your workpiece, raise the blade half an
inch and begin the cut. Some downward pressure will be required. BE
CAREFUL. Do not apply the downward pressure over the blade or
behind it. If you cannot keep the workpiece down on the table with
pressure ahead of the blade, then you're taking too big a bite.
Lower the blade.
</P>
<P>
   As the cut nears completion, use a push stick and not your hand
to clear the stock behind the blade. Pick it up, turn it end for
end, keeping the marked side toward the fence, and make the same
cut on the opposite edge.
</P>
<P>
   Keep this swapping routine up until only an eighth of an inch of
stock or so needs to be cut through to separate the two pieces. At
this point, put some eighth-inch shims (that's generally the size
of a table saw kerf) in the upper kerf before the final cut and
hold them in place with small clamps. You do not want to have to
deal with two separate and unsecured pieces rattling around as you
complete the cut. Remember, however, to put the clamps against the
shims; under no circumstances apply clamps so that pressure is
applied to the blade.
</P>
<P>
   I would say that with a lot of care, this is a perfectly safe
operation. However, it is tedious work, the amount of wood wasted
is far greater than that lost in resawing on the bandsaw, and the
tedium of it might well move the operator to get careless.
</P>
<P>
   Buy the bandsaw, my friend. Get the standard Delta or equivalent
with the 12-inch riser; that's the cheapest I know of that will do
reliable resaw work. Heck, you can even make your own veneer.
You'll never regret it.

 &HT;    From firelogs to Mickey Mouse faucets, Builders Show has it all
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Three days at the International Builders Show is an
exercise in endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a long weekend in mid-January, I joined the
more than 70,000 people who poured into the Dallas Convention
Center to see the latest home products _ from the mundane to the
over-the-top.
</P>
<P>
   There was little elbow room in the narrow aisles as I perused
more than a million square feet of exhibition space spread over two
floors (the equivalent of nearly 20 football fields), my arms
weighed down by brochures and my senses assaulted by the flash and
abundance of it all. An entire 3,175-square-foot house was built on
one showroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the General Electric booth, Martin Yan of PBS's ``Yan
Can Cook'' fame gave cooking demonstrations to show off the
company's kitchen appliances. The Lennox man (or at least the actor
who plays the congenial handyman in the ads) was decked out in his
overalls at the Lennox stand. In a booth that seemed to always
attract a crowd, lean, scantily clad women showed off the latest
exercise equipment (because nobody can figure out how a treadmill
works on their own).
</P>
<P>
   Windows and doors, siding and floors. Faucets in every size and
shape. Showers designed to douse you from every possible angle.
High-tech vacuum cleaners. It was all there, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few products that stood out from the rest because of
their whimsy or their innovation. They may, or may not, make their
way into the homes of the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ M-I-C-K-E-Y
</P>
<P>
   (Why? Because we love it.)
</P>
<P>
   The Disneyfication of the world has hit the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler Co., a leader in kitchen and bath design, recently
introduced its Disney Collection _ a collection of bathroom faucets
and sinks that showcase Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This line allows consumers to distinctively bring one of the
world's most famous icons into their bathrooms,'' said Elisabeth
Sutton, Kohler's senior product manager.
</P>
<P>
   The sinks range from $400 to $772 , while the faucets run from
$250 to $708. The Mickey ``Shadow'' sink, complete with bands of
24-karat gold, and the matching chrome faucet sell for $1,152.
</P>
<P>
   They are available at any Kohler-registered showroom in the
Austin area, including Ferguson Bath, Kitchen and Lighting Gallery,
Morrison Supply Showroom and Brittain Plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Super stove!!!
</P>
<P>
   It can broil a sirloin steak in seven minutes, roast a whole
chicken in 20 minutes or bake a potato in 10 minutes flat.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric unveiled a new speed-cooking oven, which will
be available in October.
</P>
<P>
   Using lightwave technology, this new oven cooks four to five
times faster than conventional ovens. Lightwaves cook the outside
of food much like conventional heat, but also penetrate the surface
so the inside is cooked at the same time. The oven requires no
preheating and can convert to a microwave oven with a touch of a
button.
</P>
<P>
   The oven will sell for between $1,000 and $1,200. For additional
information, call the GE Answer Center at (800) 626-2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ You can see clearly now
</P>
<P>
   So you're sick of stepping out of your shower to a foggy mirror.
Electric Mirror Co. of Lynnwood, Wash., has introduced an electric
defogger.
</P>
<P>
   The defogger prevents steam from forming by warming the mirror.
It uses 110 watts and a 120-volt power supply and adheres to the
back of the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The product sells for $130 and can be found at De-Ro Products in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   _ You're not in Kansas anymore
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where twisters are plentiful but basements are
virtually nonexistent, Storm Chaser Shelters Inc. has created an
option.
</P>
<P>
   These pod-like steel shelters can hold four to 20 people,
depending on the model. They are designed to be placed under the
foundation of a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way you never have to leave the home,'' said Trey
Thompson, sales manager for Storm Chaser.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based company can customize the shelters with gun
racks, shelving, lighting, cable, telephone _ ``anything and
everything.'' You can even create individual rooms within the
shelter. With a constant temperature in the mid-60s, it also can
double as a wine cellar or a security vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It acts as much like a walk-in safe as it does a
severe-weather shelter,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has sold a lot of shelters to people concerned
about the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The shelters, available in seven sizes, range from $3,600 to
$5,800. For additional information, call (817) 847-9000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put another log on the fire
</P>
<P>
   Grab those marshmallows and graham crackers. Heatilator's Night
Fire provides the look and feel of a real campfire, without the
mess.
</P>
<P>
   The gas Night Fire's ceramic fiber logs can be sparked up in a
matter of seconds. The natural-looking logs can be set up on a deck
or patio, or can be lugged along for your next camping or fishing
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Night Fire, which sells for $245, is available at Cool
Insulation in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stone face
</P>
<P>
   They can culture a pearl. So why not cultured stone?
</P>
<P>
   Cultured stone, which has been around for nearly 40 years, was
one of the hot products at the Builders Show. Cultured Stone
Corp.'s products come in 20 stone and brick textures and 90
collars, ranging from rough-hewn ledge stone to round river-rock
textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufactured stone is cast in molds made from the natural
stone,'' said Lisa Heathman, spokeswoman for Cultured Stone.
``That's why it looks so real.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is made with concrete, iron-oxide pigments and other
aggregates, it is lighter than natural stone. Because it is a
veneer product, it is easier to install than either full-thickness
natural stone or brick.
</P>
<P>
   With rising prices and shortages of construction labor and some
natural stone products, the cultured stone products have become
increasingly popular. You don't need a stonemason to install it, so
it tends to be half the price of real stone. Installed, it costs $7
to $12 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Cultured Stone is available at Aaron Thomison Masonry Co. and
Featherlite in Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget the Evian
</P>
<P>
   Faucet giant Moen Inc. recently introduced a new model of its
year-old PureTouch filtering faucet system for the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   The new loop-handle PureTouch, with a pull-out spout, reduces
water impurities and odors, while keeping fluoride intact. For
normal unfiltered water, you turn on the faucet as usual. To switch
to filtered water, you can touch a button on the faucet wand.
</P>
<P>
   An electric filter-life indicator provides visual and audible
information on the life of the filter. The faucets range from $400
to $415, depending on the finish. For Austin locations, call (877)
DRINK-H20.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a charge out of it
</P>
<P>
   What do you get when you cross a radio with a battery charger?
The DW911 by DeWalt High Performance Industrial Power Tools.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like it could have come from the mind of Tim ``the
Tool Man'' Taylor on ``Home Improvement.'' This heavy-duty product,
designed for professional tradesmen, functions as both a radio and
a charger, which can recharge the entire line of DeWalt battery
packs. The radio can operate on a single charge for up to a full
eight-hour work day, so you'll never have to hammer away in
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The DW911, which will retail for about $150, will be available
in June at home improvement stores, including Home Depot and Lowe's
Home Improvement Center.

   SINGLEMOM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In a notebook Gail Huston carries a
large sheet of green paper with the words haircut, hobby lobby and
library written in large block letters. In this respect she
probably is no different than other parents who carry to-do lists
around. But unless they are single parents, like she is, the
relentless/breathless/can't stop for a minute pace of her life
today, yesterday and the days to come, can't be duplicated.

The news is often filled with pastors who are stealing from their
congregation, are involved in extra-marital affairs, or are
suffering with some form of addiction. Just last week, Henry Lyons,
head of the National Baptist Convention, USA, began answering
charges in a federal courtroom in Tampa that he bilked millions of
dollars from his organization to finance a lavish personal
lifestyle. The truth of Lyons guilt or innocence remains in the
hands of a jury. But the truth of many clerics losing their moral
center has already been answered in such high profile failures as
Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. Why does this happen? We explore the

entire structure that worked well for years no longer works, and no
one is sure how to fix it. The fall season and sweeps are part of

of stations aimed at small, specific niches. (Kloer, Atlanta

   SINGLEMOM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In a notebook Gail Huston carries a
large sheet of green paper with the words haircut, hobby lobby and
library written in large block letters. In this respect she
probably is no different than other parents who carry to-do lists
around. But unless they are single parents, like she is, the
relentless/breathless/can't stop for a minute pace of her life
today, yesterday and the days to come, can't be duplicated.

   CORRUPT-CLERICS _ Clerics, in general, are held to a higher
moral standard in our society. Yet so often they stumble _ badly.
The news is often filled with pastors who are stealing from their
congregation, are involved in extra-marital affairs, or are
suffering with some form of addiction. Just last week, Henry Lyons,
head of the National Baptist Convention, USA, began answering
charges in a federal courtroom in Tampa that he bilked millions of
dollars from his organization to finance a lavish personal
lifestyle. The truth of Lyons guilt or innocence remains in the
hands of a jury. But the truth of many clerics losing their moral
center has already been answered in such high profile failures as
Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. Why does this happen? We explore the
issue and the challenges faced by pastors in the pulpit. (Blake,

more than 100 angelic works of art at the Norton Museum of Art in

   TV-WHATAILS _ What ails television? Ratings for the major

underlying reasons go to the heart of our most popular medium. An
entire structure that worked well for years no longer works, and no
one is sure how to fix it. The fall season and sweeps are part of
the problem, as some experts and insiders think the days of mass
audience TV are numbered, and that TV will become like radio, lots
of stations aimed at small, specific niches. (Kloer, Atlanta

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gail Huston leaves her job in a glass office
tower near Lost Creek Boulevard, drives north on MoPac, turns onto
U.S. 183 and finally pulls into the driveway of her mother's house,
where Huston and her 11-year-old son Robert have lived since he was
born.
</P>
<P>
   It's a few minutes before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   She was supposed to pick up Robert at school in Leander but had
to work late, and now she walks briskly past her mother Ginger
Huston (Robert's emergency chauffeur) in the living room en route
to her son's bedroom, where she begins quizzing him about his day
while he toys with a Star Wars model.
</P>
<P>
   The Scout meeting starts in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Are they going? Robert says no. He doesn't want to wear his
uniform; it doesn't fit. Not even over his shoulders? How about
just his hat? Then they run through today's spelling test,
tomorrow's history quiz, an assigned Bible verse, what he ate for
supper.
</P>
<P>
   They're going to the Scout meeting now, a compromise having been
worked out. Huston is wandering room to room looking for Robert's
homework folder and quizzing her mother about when some kids can
come to the house and grabbing a calendar from the kitchen and a
couple of Cokes from the refrigerator and guessing who's on the
other end of the ringing phone.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the big notebook she carries everywhere is a sheet of
green paper with the words Haircut, Hobby Lobby and Library written
in large letters. In this respect she probably is no different than
other parents, who no doubt carry to-do lists around.
</P>
<P>
   But unless they are single parents, there is something
fundamentally different about Huston's life.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life in which precise increments of time matter more than
most. It is parenting without a net, and it reflects the way 20
million children are raised, 84 percent of them with their mothers,
according to new U.S. census data.
</P>
<P>
   As a society, we study and judge single-parent families. Widows
or widowers with children are tragic; anybody else is said to come
from a place nobody would want to claim: the so-called broken home.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, in fact, has been building hers brick by brick since
Robert (she calls him Robbie) was born.
</P>
<P>
   She once thought she'd marry the man who is Robert's father.
</P>
<P>
   They were in college together in Austin when she became
pregnant. Their relationship continued for a while after he left to
finish school elsewhere, but then it became clear the three would
never be a family.
</P>
<P>
   So from the start, she was working and going to school full time
and mothering Robert _ solo. She and Robert have always lived with
her mom, a huge help that didn't diminish the awesome
responsibility of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, quiet and studious by nature, became expert at managing
her time, at dreaming up ways to integrate a baby, and then a
toddler, into a demanding daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   The early years were the hardest. She went to school during the
day and worked at night, which meant Robert was with someone else
most of every day and evenings, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took his toll on him,'' she says, a mother's guilt
lying behind the measured words. There were diapers and formula to
buy, and hospital bills related to his birth to pay. She relied on
Medicaid and food stamps for a time; had to file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Huston resolved to apply for grants and scholarships, staying
away from school loans as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The money worries have never really stopped. To a single parent
on a budget, car problems, a blown furnace, or a nonfunctioning
clothes dryer present more than mere inconvenience or unexpected
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Robert getting sick presented another kind of emergency. Huston
still remembers the loss of a grade level in a class where she had
to turn in a paper a day late because her son was sick. And she's
lucky, really. None of her employers ever fired her for missing
work, though her absences at her last job were always noted in her
personnel file.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the two of them got through, and it hasn't all been
strife and struggle.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert was 3 and 4, mother and son were study buddies. Each
would pack a backpack filled with supplies and carry it to the
library, where Robert would stop in the children's section for two
books before they settled down at a table.
</P>
<P>
   He'd pull out all his supplies just like his mom's and stay
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   At home, they'd do the same thing. She'd be at one end of the
table with a pitcher of iced tea and he'd be at his with his apple
juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was determined to study with me,'' Huston says. When Huston
walked across the stage to be inducted in an international honor
society at Austin Community College, Robert, holding her hand, went
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Huston seized on inexpensive ways to keep a young child
entertained. For years, that meant feeding squirrels and ducks. Now
Robert's outgrown that and become more aware of the income gap
between he and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   A friend got a $20 yo-yo. Huston's compromise was to buy Robert
a yo-yo kit for $9.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got one pair of jeans; his friends have five,'' she says.
``It's hard on him. It's not easy for kids to understand there's a
budget and a reason for the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a good year for Huston, who began a new job with a
law firm a few months ago. She's making more money than she was,
but finances are still a concern. Years ago, Huston _ who says she
receives no child support _ made the decision to have Robert attend
a private school. The attention he's gotten there has been well
worth the sacrifice, she says. But this year, she couldn't figure
out a way to scrape up the money for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he was to start public school, an anonymous donor
pledged the money, $270 a month.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time someone saw a need and helped fill it.
Huston's brother has been there as a male role model. His friends'
dads have also stepped up, says Huston, who is her son's Cub Scout
den leader.
</P>
<P>
   The school, the male bonding, are gifts given to Huston and her
son.
</P>
<P>
   Huston is careful not to give the impression she thinks she's
done everything right.
</P>
<P>
   She tells Robert, ```Think of me raising you as writing a book
together. You and I fill the pages together.'''
</P>
<P>
   She says, ``He knows I'm not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   All the challenges, Huston says, don't outweigh the bond between
mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert's been worth everything and more.''
</P>
<P>
   SALT AWAY PRECIOUS TIME
</P>
<P>
   Patti Ricker, a clinical social worker who works with single
parents, offers these tips for making things easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to manage time. One key is ``learning how to be
efficient and letting go of things that were important before you
were a single parent. You have to really prioritize.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for help. Find someone to watch your children in an
emergency. And someone to care for your kids so you can do
something really indulgent, like get a haircut. Single parents in
Austin have formed babysitting co-ops. One group took turns
cleaning each others' houses while their kids played together.
Another alternated making group suppers.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be tempting to let your children become your peers.
It's also difficult to set limits when you don't have another adult
to back you up. ``Use friends of the family. Get on the phone and
talk out some of the (big) issues before you set boundaries with
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Stash away: an extra key to your home; $100 for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember the positives of single parenting: Time for yourself
if the kids spend time with your ex-spouse; a close relationship
with your children; being in charge.
</P>
<P>
   SINGULAR SENSATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Like a couple of young siblings fighting for mom's attention,
studies on how children in single-parent families fare compete for
our acceptance. Are these kids successful, social flops or just as
haphazardly prosperous as the rest of us? The evidence is far from
conclusive. But you don't have to search long for examples of
children from single-parent homes who have done well:
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams
</P>
<P>
   Georgette Mosbacher
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster

or widowers with children are tragic; anybody else is said to come
from a place nobody would want to claim: the so-called broken home.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, in fact, has been building hers brick by brick since
Robert (she calls him Robbie) was born.
</P>
<P>
   She once thought she'd marry the man who is Robert's father.
</P>
<P>
   They were in college together in Austin when she became
pregnant. Their relationship continued for a while after he left to
finish school elsewhere, but then it became clear the three would
never be a family.
</P>
<P>
   So from the start, she was working and going to school full time
and mothering Robert _ solo. She and Robert have always lived with
her mom, a huge help that didn't diminish the awesome
responsibility of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, quiet and studious by nature, became expert at managing
her time, at dreaming up ways to integrate a baby, and then a
toddler, into a demanding daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   The early years were the hardest. She went to school during the
day and worked at night, which meant Robert was with someone else
most of every day and evenings, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took his toll on him,'' she says, a mother's guilt
lying behind the measured words. There were diapers and formula to
buy, and hospital bills related to his birth to pay. She relied on
Medicaid and food stamps for a time; had to file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Huston resolved to apply for grants and scholarships, staying
away from school loans as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The money worries have never really stopped. To a single parent
on a budget, car problems, a blown furnace, or a nonfunctioning
clothes dryer present more than mere inconvenience or unexpected
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Robert getting sick presented another kind of emergency. Huston
still remembers the loss of a grade level in a class where she had
to turn in a paper a day late because her son was sick. And she's
lucky, really. None of her employers ever fired her for missing
work, though her absences at her last job were always noted in her
personnel file.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the two of them got through, and it hasn't all been
strife and struggle.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert was 3 and 4, mother and son were study buddies. Each
would pack a backpack filled with supplies and carry it to the
library, where Robert would stop in the children's section for two
books before they settled down at a table.
</P>
<P>
   He'd pull out all his supplies just like his mom's and stay
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   At home, they'd do the same thing. She'd be at one end of the
table with a pitcher of iced tea and he'd be at his with his apple
juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was determined to study with me,'' Huston says. When Huston
walked across the stage to be inducted in an international honor
society at Austin Community College, Robert, holding her hand, went
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Huston seized on inexpensive ways to keep a young child
entertained. For years, that meant feeding squirrels and ducks. Now
Robert's outgrown that and become more aware of the income gap
between he and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   A friend got a $20 yo-yo. Huston's compromise was to buy Robert
a yo-yo kit for $9.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got one pair of jeans; his friends have five,'' she says.
``It's hard on him. It's not easy for kids to understand there's a
budget and a reason for the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a good year for Huston, who began a new job with a
law firm a few months ago. She's making more money than she was,
but finances are still a concern. Years ago, Huston _ who says she
receives no child support _ made the decision to have Robert attend
a private school. The attention he's gotten there has been well
worth the sacrifice, she says. But this year, she couldn't figure
out a way to scrape up the money for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he was to start public school, an anonymous donor
pledged the money, $270 a month.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time someone saw a need and helped fill it.
Huston's brother has been there as a male role model. His friends'
dads have also stepped up, says Huston, who is her son's Cub Scout
den leader.
</P>
<P>
   The school, the male bonding, are gifts given to Huston and her
son.
</P>
<P>
   Huston is careful not to give the impression she thinks she's
done everything right.
</P>
<P>
   She tells Robert, ```Think of me raising you as writing a book
together. You and I fill the pages together.'''
</P>
<P>
   She says, ``He knows I'm not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   All the challenges, Huston says, don't outweigh the bond between
mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert's been worth everything and more.''
</P>
<P>
   SALT AWAY PRECIOUS TIME
</P>
<P>
   Patti Ricker, a clinical social worker who works with single
parents, offers these tips for making things easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to manage time. One key is ``learning how to be
efficient and letting go of things that were important before you
were a single parent. You have to really prioritize.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for help. Find someone to watch your children in an
emergency. And someone to care for your kids so you can do
something really indulgent, like get a haircut. Single parents in
Austin have formed babysitting co-ops. One group took turns
cleaning each others' houses while their kids played together.
Another alternated making group suppers.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be tempting to let your children become your peers.
It's also difficult to set limits when you don't have another adult
to back you up. ``Use friends of the family. Get on the phone and
talk out some of the (big) issues before you set boundaries with
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Stash away: an extra key to your home; $100 for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember the positives of single parenting: Time for yourself
if the kids spend time with your ex-spouse; a close relationship
with your children; being in charge.
</P>
<P>
   SINGULAR SENSATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Like a couple of young siblings fighting for mom's attention,
studies on how children in single-parent families fare compete for
our acceptance. Are these kids successful, social flops or just as
haphazardly prosperous as the rest of us? The evidence is far from
conclusive. But you don't have to search long for examples of
children from single-parent homes who have done well:
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams
</P>
<P>
   Georgette Mosbacher
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster
</P>
<P>
   John and Caroline Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   The children of Martin Luther King, Jr.: Martin III, Yolanda,
Dexter, and Bernice
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Shields
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte and Emily Bronte
</P>
<P>
   Coco Chanel
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Loren
</P>
<P>
   LEARN TO CONNECT
</P>
<P>
   Finding the time or energy for a group can be challenging,
especially for time-strapped single parents. Here are some groups
that help make that happen.

HERE'S HOW ZIPPERGATE WILL BE REPORTED IN 2099 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is simply inevitable that 100 years from now, as another
century heaves into view, some editor, thinking _ as editors are
wont to do _ that he or she is being original, will order a
fledgling reporter to do a story on what the Bill Clinton-Monica
Lewinsky scandal was all about. Lordy, lordy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Already I have deep and painful sympathy for that young
journalist. How to explain what even those of us who are living
through it all find difficult to parse? Still, I suspect we now
have a better chance of making sense of it than anyone in 2099
will. Therefore, I will try to deconstruct this impeachment
business here in a way that may help out that late 21st century
reporter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My hope is that somehow in doing the research for the assigned
piece, that reporter will stumble across this column, and it will
all be clear. In fact, I'll save that journalist time by writing
the very story he or she almost certainly will tell 100 years from
now. It will go like this: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton, the last male president of the United
States, was impeached but not convicted 100 years ago in a scandal
about sex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sex _ before the now-universal use of genetically controlled
cloning _ was what people did then to reproduce the species or, if
that wasn't their goal, to feel good. Feeling good in that way was
legal 100 years ago and, some historians argue, a good way to
relieve stress. Stress was a set of negative feelings people used
to experience before the government mandated universal consumption
of sedatives, beginning with Valium-chip cookies in preschool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a popular president, was under great pressure from a
puritanical prosecutor named Ken Starr, who saw ``inchoate
criminality'' emerging in all aspects of American life. What Starr
meant by inchoate criminality was anything Bill Clinton did for
which he did not keep receipts or good records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under this pressure, Clinton made an incomprehensively stupid
mistake. He engaged in feel-good sex with a young woman working in
the White House, which is where presidents lived before it became
Microsoft's Bill Gates Museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the young woman, Monica Lewinsky (yes, the matriach of
the family that has produced three of our last seven presidents)
made the immature mistake of confiding in a treacherous woman in
search of a book deal. This woman, Linda Tripp, secretly tape
recorded hours and hours of her conversations with Lewinsky. (Tape
recording was an ancient technology for preserving voice imprints
that now, of course, are digitally saved permanently on Global
Connection Receiver-Transmitters implanted in us near our voice
boxes at birth.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who later gained fame when scientists cited her as proof
of the falsity of the theory of evolution, took her recordings to
Starr, who, when he heard them, reacted with feelings of political
arousal similar in scale to the sexual arousal Clinton felt while
alone with Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Starr sent a fat report about all this to Congress.
At the time the constitution gave the House power to impeach
presidents and the Senate power to convict or acquit. Now, of
course, we do all that by our ICVDs, Interactive Citizen Voting
Devices, attached to our PCDs, Personal Communications Devices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After many idiotic and repetitious speeches, House Republicans,
on a straight party-line vote, impeached Clinton, a Democrat. The
Senate, making up its game plan on the fly (also a good
description, ironically, of Clinton's sin), wasted prodigious
amounts of time before failing to convict. After leaving office,
Clinton divorced Hillary Rodham Clinton, who then served as Senate
majority leader in their daughter Chelsea's first term as
president. &QL;

FLIGHTS OF FANCY PANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If Mayor Willie Brown had paid attention to gay
supervisors' request to boycott United Airlines, he wouldn't have
had to use the word ``pantywaist'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``pantywaist,'' which means ``sissy,'' an anti-gay slur? Is
it plain language, or plane language?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? But it's one of Brown's favorite words. He once
called supervisors ``pantywaists,'' and a recent news conference he
went off on a rant against the ``itty-bitty pantywaist planes''
United uses to shuttle between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we all prefer wide-bodies to pantywaists when it comes to
airliners.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that ticked Brown off is the 10-by-15-inch hole
that United makes passengers put their carry-on luggage through.
The mayor, of course, doesn't pack light or inexpensively.
</P>
<P>
   Brown doesn't even carry grudges smaller than 10 by 15 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no politician's grudges would pass United's carry-on
test. When President Clinton flies on non-pantywaist Air Force One,
he loads his grudges with Forklift One.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's unique way with the English language got me thinking
about all the differences between the San Francisco mayor and the
president, who are alike in so many ways.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious difference between Willie Brown and Bill
Clinton, who are probably the two most skillful politicians of our
time, is the way they use the language.
</P>
<P>
   One fulminates. The other obfuscates. One splits eardrums. The
other splits hairs. But both are articulate and powerful speakers,
with mastery of different registers for different audiences.
</P>
<P>
   You won't hear Clinton use the word ``pantywaist,'' though,
unless it's in the privacy of his own bongo sessions and he's
talking about Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Clinton uses words the way a chameleon uses skin
cells _ to camouflage and to hide, and to pretend to be something
he isn't, namely a great moral leader.
</P>
<P>
   Brown uses words to astound, entertain and distract, the way a
Las Vegas magician uses fire and smoke. There is no rabbit in his
hat, but he'll escape from any box he gets into.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders gladly will tell us they've sinned, although we're
supposed to forgive Bill and celebrate Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a spiritual agonizer. There's no agonizing with
Brown. He makes others feel their own agony.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between these big talkers is not how they
talk, but what they talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is good at painting the big picture. Brown is good at
talking about himself, and has five big pictures of himself on his
office wall.
</P>
<P>
   All of Clinton's jokes are self-effacing, even though he's one
of the two biggest egotists in politics. The other is Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ego is so big he thinks he can steal Anne away from
Ellen. Brown thinks he's cuter than Jonny Moseley and funnier than
Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, Brown's jokes are never self-effacing. No,
Brown's jokes are always self-promoting and in the faces of others.
</P>
<P>
   But we have to face the fact that Bill Clinton and Willie Brown
have many more similarities than differences.
</P>
<P>
   They're both politically indestructible. Even their worst
enemies concede they can never be beaten or driven from office.
They both survive and flourish because of flush times.
</P>
<P>
   Their only real opponents have been themselves, and that's two
hellacious match-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Both can have affairs outside of marriage and watch their
approval ratings go up. Both have no ex-girlfriends, although it
all depends how you define ``ex'' in the case of Willie, and
``girlfriend'' in the case of Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both have closet Republican tendencies, and that especially
applies to Brown's clothes closet.
</P>
<P>
   Both love the rich and famous. The rich and famous love them.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Republicans think they have Clinton on the ropes,
he knocks them down for the count with a roundhouse State of the
Union address. Two bouts in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Brown's 49ers' football stadium seems down and out,
Brown says he can bring in a stadium for a mere $250 million, half
the previous estimate.
</P>
<P>
   How can we forget? Both love to travel, and you know Brown would
love to have Air Force One instead of Air Pantywaist.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would tell you he'd rather go Greyhound, but he'd be
lying _ I mean misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is perhaps our most traveled president, finding Indiana
and Israel equally interesting destinations. Brown prefers
destinations with better restaurants, but he's easily the most
traveled mayor in the history of the world.
</P>
<P>
   No other mayor uses a news conference to complain about
restrictions on airliners' carry-on luggage when most of his
constituents can't find a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Brown should worry more about the baggage he's carrying
into the next election.
</P>

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three years ago Monday, President Clinton signed
into law a huge bill to overhaul the nation's telecommunications
industry and usher in an era of competition and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The act was aimed at reforming industries ranging from
long-distance phone service to cable television, but it mentioned
the Internet only twice.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a few years make.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the visions of local phone competition and shrinking
cable TV and local phone bills are still a dream. Instead, telecom
giants are in a mad dash to grab the Holy Grail of the 21st
century: high-speed Internet delivery of data services to millions
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and regulators, caught completely off guard, are
frantically trying to level the playing field in a marketplace that
resembles shifting sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's broad consensus that the act isn't working,'' said
Scott Cleland, an analyst with the Research Technology Team of the
Legg Mason investment bank. ``But there's no consensus about what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous. The exploding U.S. market for voice and
data services is expected to increase 8 percent in 1999 to $270
billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and that
doesn't include high-speed Internet access or cable television.
Globally, the market will soar to $825 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking its share of the bonanza, corporate America is engaged
in a dizzying round of musical chairs. Giants such as AT&AMP;T Corp.
are joining forces with cable companies such as Time Warner Inc.
Regional Bell phone companies are buying each other to fend off
long-distance competitors. And Internet newcomers are in a panic
that cable companies will gain a monopoly on high-speed pipelines
to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of change is overwhelming,'' says Legg Mason's Bill
Whyman(cq), an Internet specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But the telecom world is expected to change even more
dramatically in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict mega-companies will provide integrated services
_ voice, data and video as well as Web hosting and private networks
_ to business and high-end individual customers. Smaller companies
will fill niche markets.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean changes will benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An average American family now spends at least $1,000 a year on
phone and cable services. Since the 1996 act, local phone rates
have risen about 10 percent. And cable rates have soared 21
percent. And while government rules have saved long-distance
carriers as much as $1 billion in local connection costs, not a
penny has been passed on to consumers, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of broken promises,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, technology leapfrogged the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The battle today is between technologies, not industry segments:
On one side, cable operators are betting on high-speed cable
modems. On the other, phone companies are investing in Digital
Subscriber Lines (DSL). Both provide super-fast connections to the
Internet with the capacity to transmit voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's causing the hoopla: Telephone lines remain
regulated, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not
indicated yet how it will regulate DSL services. That means that
phone companies may be required by the government to let their
competitors lease lines and equipment. But cable lines are
virtually unregulated, with a retail pricing structure set to
expire in March. There are no rules requiring cable companies to
share their lines with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides are rushing to lock up the emerging
Internet market. ``Today, data is everything,'' insisted Bob
Bishop, GTE Corp.'s chief Washington spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned analysts have difficulty projecting the market for
these high-volume ``broadband'' services. But this much is known:
Every three months, Internet traffic doubles. And by 2001, U.S.
data traffic is expected to surpass voice transmission in volume.
In 1997 alone, the nation's top Internet service providers,
including America Online Inc., reported $6.9 billion in revenue, up
from nearly nothing before the telecom act passed.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this seismic shift in the industry has sent
telecom players scrambling. That's why AT&AMP;T's $48 billion bid for
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is raising eyebrows among
competitors. If approved by regulators, AT&AMP;T would gain direct
access to millions of U.S. customers through TCI's extensive cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   TCI owns a large share of the high-speed At Home data network,
which recently purchased Web portal Excite, putting AT&AMP;T in a good
position to compete with any Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, users of broadband access such as DSL or cable
modems don't need Internet service providers. This has led online
firms such as AOL to put together a lobbying group to persuade
regulators that cable has an unfair advantage because it is
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, five consumer groups took the same message to the
FCC. With access to 96 percent of American homes, they argued, the
cable industry could quickly gain a monopoly on Internet access and
require users to view their content as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable companies want to use their bottleneck over
high-speed to get you to use their content,'' charges Jamie Love,
director of the Consumer Project on Technology. ``Any time, we've
had a monopoly in the past, it hasn't turned out good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies see it differently. Steve Effros, president of
the Cable Telecommunications Association in Fairfax, Va., says
cable companies today have two-way Internet capabilities in 56
percent of American homes. But only 500,000 of their customers have
signed up for high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a monopoly here,'' scoffed Effros. ``We're in
the middle of vigorous competition. We happen to think we have a
pretty good mousetrap, but that doesn't mean we should have to give
it to our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, William E. Kennard, is stuck in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has the dual job of protecting consumers as well as
regulating the industry. As telephone, wireless, Internet and cable
technologies meld, though, regulators admit it's tricky to balance
conflicting missions.
</P>
<P>
   At a January discussion with reporters, Kennard stressed:
``We're not here to pick winners or losers. The agency is keeping
its eye on the prize, which is alternative networks that provide
consumers with choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But in coming months, the agency will be faced with key
decisions, including whether phone giants must lease part of their
systems to data delivery companies.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bell companies grumble that they should be unencumbered
in order to compete fairly with cable companies. ``We would just as
soon regulators keep their hands off all of it,'' says BellSouth
Corp.'s chief lobbyist, David J. Markey. ``But if they are going to
regulate us, they should regulate them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also was expected to make recommendations about
whether cable companies need to open their lines to competitors, as
requested by AOL and consumer groups. But they are still studying
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, however, on Thursday signaled that he would not require
the AT&AMP;T-TCI conglomerate to share its lines with competitors. And
the merger is expected to be approved by the agency in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also was expected to make recommendations about
whether cable companies need to open their lines to competitors, as

</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers aren't likely to support measures
that meddle with the fast-growing Internet industry. In fact, some
are fed up with the FCC's progress deregulating other segments of
the industry, and there likely will be efforts to restructure the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Rep. Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio, chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee, both plan legislation that will
downsize the FCC and reduce its regulatory muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, nobody would like better than I to take another
shot at spelling out in clearer terms the intent of the '96 Telecom
Act,'' Oxley said in a statement. ``But we need to stay focused on
the structure and mission of the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration _ most notably Vice President Al Gore
_ has been mum about the act's failings. The administration would
prefer to stress its priority that all Americans have access to the
``information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not as easy as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on upcoming regulatory decisions, the government could
either encourage or discourage investments in poorer, more remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, for example, knows he must revamp the subsidy system
that keeps rural phone rates affordable. And some consumer
advocates fear the nation is on the verge of ``telecom
red-lining,'' where unregulated corporate giants will build private
networks to service only wealthy business or residential customers
in high-density, affluent areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tricky and it's never going to be perfect,'' admitted Tom
Power, a top aide to FCC Chairman Kennard. ``But that's one of our
main concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand today's chaos, you have to revisit the lobbying
frenzy surrounding the passage of the 1996 act. The bloodiest
battles were fought between long-distance giants and regional Bells
over access to each others' voice markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were doing the act, the world was defined by voice,''
said BellSouth lobbyist Markey. ``And the question was: Who has the
biggest share?''
</P>
<P>
   While local telephone service accounted for the largest domestic
market, at $109.3 billion in 1996, the $86.9 billion long-distance
market was poised to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, regional Bells are allowed into long distance
only after they open local markets to competition. A Merrill Lynch
analysis, written days after the act's passage, predicted that
regional Bells would offer long-distance service in 18 months. But
three years later, not a single Bell company has met a 14-point
checklist to prove they have legitimate competition locally.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, regional Bells still received 97 percent of the local
phone service revenue in 1997, according to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problems we see every time are hardware and
software problems,'' said Power. Regional Bells ``haven't shown
that competitors are really able to win over and switch
customers,'' Power said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is coming, though.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for example, leads the nation with 35 local competitors
assigned numbers to deliver local service. The state is followed by
California, with 28 competitors, including Cox Communications Inc.,
a corporate relative of Cox Newspapers; New York, 27 competitors;
Florida, 25 competitors; and Georgia, 22 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bells have challenged the rules for local competition
in court, but without much success. In mid-January, the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to consider a case challenging the FCC's
constitutional authority to regulate the Bells. And on Jan. 26, the
high court restored rules that forced the Bells to lease their
networks to rivals at discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, Kennard said, he expects to allow at least one Bell
_ probably Bell Atlantic _ into long-distance service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Bells acknowledge that the telecom game has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the world is defined by data bits, `` said Markey. ``It
could be voice, data or video. But we know that we have a much
smaller share of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world today includes a lot of things beyond what they were
looking at in the act,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three years ago Monday, President Clinton signed
into law a huge bill to overhaul the nation's telecommunications
industry and usher in an era of competition and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The act was aimed at reforming industries ranging from
long-distance phone service to cable television, but it mentioned
the Internet only twice.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a few years make.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the visions of local phone competition and shrinking
cable TV and local phone bills are still a dream. Instead, telecom
giants are in a mad dash to grab the Holy Grail of the 21st
century: high-speed Internet delivery of data services to millions
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and regulators, caught completely off guard, are
frantically trying to level the playing field in a marketplace that
resembles shifting sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's broad consensus that the act isn't working,'' said
Scott Cleland, an analyst with the Research Technology Team of the
Legg Mason investment bank. ``But there's no consensus about what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous. The exploding U.S. market for voice and
data services is expected to increase 8 percent in 1999 to $270
billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and that
doesn't include high-speed Internet access or cable television.
Globally, the market will soar to $825 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking its share of the bonanza, corporate America is engaged
in a dizzying round of musical chairs. Giants such as AT&AMP;T Corp.
are joining forces with cable companies such as Time Warner Inc.
Regional Bell phone companies are buying each other to fend off
long-distance competitors. And Internet newcomers are in a panic
that cable companies will gain a monopoly on high-speed pipelines
to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of change is overwhelming,'' says Legg Mason's Bill
Whyman(cq), an Internet specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But the telecom world is expected to change even more
dramatically in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict mega-companies will provide integrated services
_ voice, data and video as well as Web hosting and private networks
_ to business and high-end individual customers. Smaller companies
will fill niche markets.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean changes will benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An average American family now spends at least $1,000 a year on
phone and cable services. Since the 1996 act, local phone rates
have risen about 10 percent. And cable rates have soared 21
percent. And while government rules have saved long-distance
carriers as much as $1 billion in local connection costs, not a
penny has been passed on to consumers, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of broken promises,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, technology leapfrogged the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The battle today is between technologies, not industry segments:
On one side, cable operators are betting on high-speed cable
modems. On the other, phone companies are investing in Digital
Subscriber Lines (DSL). Both provide super-fast connections to the
Internet with the capacity to transmit voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's causing the hoopla: Telephone lines remain
regulated, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not
indicated yet how it will regulate DSL services. That means that
phone companies may be required by the government to let their
competitors lease lines and equipment. But cable lines are
virtually unregulated, with a retail pricing structure set to
expire in March. There are no rules requiring cable companies to
share their lines with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides are rushing to lock up the emerging
Internet market. ``Today, data is everything,'' insisted Bob
Bishop, GTE Corp.'s chief Washington spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned analysts have difficulty projecting the market for
these high-volume ``broadband'' services. But this much is known:
Every three months, Internet traffic doubles. And by 2001, U.S.
data traffic is expected to surpass voice transmission in volume.
In 1997 alone, the nation's top Internet service providers,
including America Online Inc., reported $6.9 billion in revenue, up
from nearly nothing before the telecom act passed.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this seismic shift in the industry has sent
telecom players scrambling. That's why AT&AMP;T's $48 billion bid for
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is raising eyebrows among
competitors. If approved by regulators, AT&AMP;T would gain direct
access to millions of U.S. customers through TCI's extensive cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   TCI owns a large share of the high-speed At Home data network,
which recently purchased Web portal Excite, putting AT&AMP;T in a good
position to compete with any Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, users of broadband access such as DSL or cable
modems don't need Internet service providers. This has led online
firms such as AOL to put together a lobbying group to persuade
regulators that cable has an unfair advantage because it is
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, five consumer groups took the same message to the
FCC. With access to 96 percent of American homes, they argued, the
cable industry could quickly gain a monopoly on Internet access and
require users to view their content as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable companies want to use their bottleneck over
high-speed to get you to use their content,'' charges Jamie Love,
director of the Consumer Project on Technology. ``Any time, we've
had a monopoly in the past, it hasn't turned out good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies see it differently. Steve Effros, president of
the Cable Telecommunications Association in Fairfax, Va., says
cable companies today have two-way Internet capabilities in 56
percent of American homes. But only 500,000 of their customers have
signed up for high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a monopoly here,'' scoffed Effros. ``We're in
the middle of vigorous competition. We happen to think we have a
pretty good mousetrap, but that doesn't mean we should have to give
it to our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, William E. Kennard, is stuck in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has the dual job of protecting consumers as well as
regulating the industry. As telephone, wireless, Internet and cable
technologies meld, though, regulators admit it's tricky to balance
conflicting missions.
</P>
<P>
   At a January discussion with reporters, Kennard stressed:
``We're not here to pick winners or losers. The agency is keeping
its eye on the prize, which is alternative networks that provide
consumers with choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But in coming months, the agency will be faced with key
decisions, including whether phone giants must lease part of their
systems to data delivery companies.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bell companies grumble that they should be unencumbered
in order to compete fairly with cable companies. ``We would just as
soon regulators keep their hands off all of it,'' says BellSouth

<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan, who successfully straddled two worlds
during 45 tumultuous years on the throne, returned home to die
after losing a long battle with cancer. He was said by an official
in Amman to be ``clinically dead and is being kept alive on a
life-support machine.'' The official said, ``The king is near
death. He is being kept alive by artificial means. There is no more
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautious by instinct and habit, Hussein took pride in his
Western impulses and his Arab roots, though he acknowledged that
the combination sometimes produced policies that even admirers
criticized as erratic and conflicting.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Middle East's longest-reigning ruler, but took little
comfort from mere survival. Though he once said he yearned for a
``hero's death'' like that of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli enemy he ultimately embraced as his ``brother'' and
``partner in peace,'' Hussein succumbed not to the fanatic's bullet
but to cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had suffered from
for years.
</P>
<P>
   His twin legacies _ peace with his neighbors, including Israel,
and a fairly tolerant, stable society at home _ would be impressive
in any context. But they are particularly so given the often
violent politics of the Mideast and the unpromising country whose
stewardship he inherited while still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein spent the final months of his life working relentlessly
for peace and a succession that he hoped would ensure both his
immediate family's control of the throne and political stability in
Jordan. Just days before his death, he stunned the world by
bypassing his younger brother, Prince Hassan, 51, and naming his
eldest son, 37-year-old Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy, bitter letter to his brother explaining his
decision and publicizing a deep family rift, Hussein assailed
Hassan's performance as regent, saying that his brother's palace
supporters _ ``climbers,'' he denounced them _ had tried to
``destroy Jordan'' by spreading vicious gossip about his wife and
children and ``meddling'' in the military to ``settle scores'' and
divide and politicize the army. Hussein also revealed that Hassan,
his designated heir for 34 years, had opposed his wish that his own
sons succeed his brother as king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said that the discord had given him ``many sleepless
nights'' and prompted him to intervene ``from my sickbed'' at the
Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to end the intrigues and political
jockeying for power in Jordan. But he complimented Hassan for his
``sincere efforts'' and his loyal acceptance of his demotion.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning decision not only took Amman and Washington by
surprise, it demonstrated that Hussein, though ailing and in pain,
remained the undisputed ruler of his kingdom til' the last days of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from settling succession, Hussein's last efforts were
aimed at advancing peace between the Arabs and Israel, a goal that
had eluded two generations of Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn and pale, and made bald by four rounds of chemotherapy, he
left the Mayo Clinic in October 1998 to attend the Wye summit talks
in Maryland and help President Clinton coax Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators into concluding the next phase of their peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had an ounce of strength, I would have done my utmost to
be there and to help in any way I can,'' he said in an emotional,
impromptu speech at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there had been ``enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste'' during the five decades of Arab-Israeli conflict, he
pleaded for accommodation. ``We have no right to dictate through
irresponsible action or narrow-mindedness the future of our
children or their children's children,'' the king said.
</P>
<P>
   A short man who used his deep, mesmerizing voice to maximum
political effect, Hussein was to a large extent a reflection and
prisoner of his geography. The leader of a slip of land the size of
South Carolina, seven-eighths of it desert, without oil or other
valuable resources, he was surrounded by far more powerful nations,
many of them intermittently hostile. And more than half of Jordan's
five million people are Palestinian, many of whom feel little
allegiance to him, his family or their adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Hussein's lack of options, former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger wrote in 1979, in his book ``White House
Years,'' that the king ``had the capacity neither for independent
action nor for blackmail, which are the stuff of Middle Eastern
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, by charting a mostly centrist, pragmatic course
and avoiding the radical passions and fashionable political trends
that destabilized or toppled several other hereditary leaders in
the Mideast, Hussein created a relatively peaceful, conservative,
modern country whose citizens enjoy decent government and more
political freedom than those of most other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   His rule was marked by both bold diplomatic strokes and
strategic blunders. Notable among the latter was his decision not
to join the American-led coalition that forced President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq to end his brief occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1967 he ignored Israel's private assurances and calls for
restraint in favor of joining Egypt and Syria in their war against
Israel. This cost him half of Jerusalem and all the territory on
the western side of the Jordan River, the West Bank, which his
grandfather Abdullah had won in the 1948-1949 war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But after each setback, Hussein recovered his political
equilibrium and turned adversity to his advantage. Reputed among
Jordanians to enjoy baraka, or God's blessing, for dodging at least
12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him, the king
ultimately accomplished what his grandfather had been unable to do:
in 1994 he secured a stunning peace with Israel, which he has
called his reign's ``crowning achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, standing on the White House lawn beside Rabin,
Hussein initialed an accord that technically ended the state of war
between the neighboring countries. And three months later, in an
emotional ceremony in his own land, he became the third Arab leader
to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have at last carried out the will of King Abdullah,'' his
grandfather, he declared on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the legacy of political pragmatism as well as the fate
of Abdullah, Jordan's founder and first king, strongly shaped his
rule. In the summer of 1951, when he was 15, Hussein saw his
grandfather gunned down at the entrance of the silver-domed Al Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said another bullet had ricocheted off a medal on the
uniform he had been told to wear by his grandfather, who had become
a scapegoat for the fury of the Arabs over their humiliating defeat
by Israel in 1948-49 and for Palestinian rage over Abdullah's
secret meetings with Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In a memoir, Hussein said he had learned painful, important
lessons from witnessing the killing of his grandfather, a
``wonderful old man'' and a ``man of desert ways to whom I owe more
than I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview more than 30 years later, the king said he would
never forget how Abdullah's aides, his ``so-called friends,'' had
scattered in all directions ``like frightened women in the night''
minutes after the killing, or how they had opened political
intrigues within hours.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule he learned, the king said in his memoirs, was
``the unimportance of death: that when you have to die, you die,''
a fatalism he manifested at critical moments throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also saw that rulers cannot depend on their advisers to save
or guide them, that they must make their own decisions and go their
own way,'' he said in an interview in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This determination to keep his own counsel, and to be prepared
to suffer the consequences of rash actions, allowed him to brush
aside the savage criticism periodically directed at him by
Westerners and Arabs alike.
</P>
<P>
   Though he shared Abdullah's commitment to the Arab cause, the
assassination reinforced his skepticism of fellow Arab rulers. And
from that day onward, he carried a gun or kept one within easy
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the assassination taught him that if he was to pursue
Jordan's strategic interest by maintaining his grandfather's
dialogue with Israel, such contacts had to remain secret. Even
toward the end of his life, Hussein refused to discuss details of
what Israelis estimate were more than 500 hours of talks with every
Israeli leader except Menachem Begin, a series of contacts that the
king initiated in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from a powerful Arabian family that traced its lineage
to Mohammed, Hussein ibn Talal ibn Hussein was born in Amman,
Jordan, on Nov. 14, 1935, to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein.
His family, like his country, were desperately poor. His baby
sister died of pneumonia ``in the bitter cold of an Amman winter,''
he later wrote. The family house had no heat.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had been born and raised among the tribes of the
Arabian Desert, but Hussein, in contrast, was educated at Victoria
College in Alexandria, Egypt, and at Harrow and the Royal Military
Academy at Sandhurst, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his Hashemite family owed much to Britain. To protect
against French encroachment on British interests in Palestine, and
to reward the family for leading the Great Arab Revolt against the
Ottomans, who were allied to Germany, in 1916, Winston Churchill,
then the colonial secretary, had carved Transjordan out of Syria in
1921, agreed to finance the emirate with a modest subsidy and gave
it to Abdullah to rule under British mandate. In 1946 Transjordan
became independent. Abdullah, who never abandoned the dream of
recreating and ruling a modern Arab empire, became king and renamed
his country the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Arab leaders, Abdullah _ like his grandson Hussein
_ quickly grasped that he would have to deal with the Zionists.
Contacts between them began as early as 1926, and in 1946 Abdullah
and Jewish leaders agreed informally that Jordan would not oppose
establishment of a Jewish state if the Zionists supported his rule
over the Arab parts of Palestine. But after war erupted in 1948,
Abdullah invaded the newborn state of Israel, winning control of
half of Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   After Abdullah's assassination, Prince Talal, who had been
treated at a Swiss clinic for schizophrenia, took the throne. When
his attacks worsened, the parliament removed him, on Aug. 11, 1952,
less than a month after Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt helped topple
King Farouk in a military coup. Hussein, then 16, was proclaimed
Jordan's king just as intense Arab nationalism was taking hold
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein always relished physical if not political danger. As if
the extraordinary challenge of sheer survival were not sufficient,
he parachuted, flew stunts in his jets and raced high-performance
cars and motorcycles across the desert (insisting in his later
years on being photographed with a helmet as an example of safety
to his people). Risk became second nature, he told a journalist,
``what water is to fish.'' Compounding the risk, he chain-smoked
cigarettes, a habit he tried innumerable times to break.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein himself conceded that at first he made many mistakes as
ruler. ``Those early years were hard for me,'' he said once in an
interview. ``I learned late.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, when Arab nationalist passions were running high and
conservative monarchies like his were a constant target of coups
and assault, Hussein tried to damp growing popular unrest by
dismissing Sir John Bagot Glubb, Glubb Pasha, the British general
who had trained Jordan's Arab Legion. He also abandoned liberal
measures that he and his father had adopted, declared martial law
and called out the army against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   As the immediate threat to his rule receded, Hussein gradually
replaced British protectors with Americans, whose influence was
growing in the Middle East as Britain's faded. According to senior
Jordanian and American officials, ties between the Central
Intelligence Agency and Hussein were cemented in 1957 and 1958,
when American intelligence officials learned of a coup plot
involving Jordanian diplomats and warned the king.
</P>
<P>
   Ties like these, an American airlift of oil in 1957 when Jordan
was boycotted by Egypt, Syria and Iraq, and monthly checks from the
CIA helped persuade the king that Washington was a reliable ally.
(The CIA payments reportedly ended in 1977, when their disclosure
embarrassed the king.)
</P>
<P>
   Hussein fared less well in his second crisis: the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Although Israel had urged restraint, he flew to
Cairo shortly before the war to sign a defense treaty with
President Nasser, despite Nasser's earlier plotting against him.
Although the king later admitted that he had known he was taking a
risk by siding with Syria and Egypt, he said he had feared the fury
of his people, many of them Palestinians, more than Israel. A
senior Jordanian official said most Jordanians so strongly favored
the war that the king's choice, in fact, was between ``war and
civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a costly decision. As a result of the 1967 war, Israel
occupied all of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thousands of
Palestinian refugees fled into arid Jordan, increasing the
population by about half. Three-quarters of the population of Amman
was now of Palestinian origin, making it the largest Palestinian
city. Unlike other Arab rulers, Hussein offered the refugees
citizenship and a passport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which increasingly viewed Hussein as vulnerable and
an obstacle to its struggle, challenged the Hashemites' control of
Jordan. In despair over the prospect of a civil war, the king later
acknowledged, he briefly pondered abdication, as he would again
during other crises. Instead, he decided to confront Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arafat subsequently maintained that the Jordanian army
killed as many as 20,000 in putting down the unrest, conservative
estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. While Hussein had not
sought this test of wills, his legitimacy was never challenged
again.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn once into an Arab war with Israel, Hussein would not be
seduced a second time. Before the 1973 war, according to Israeli
diplomats, he cautioned Israel that Egypt and Syria were planning
to fight, but his warning was discounted. And while the king sent
Jordanian armored units to fight alongside Syrian forces, he
avoided fighting Israel along their common border, a decision that
precluded the loss of still more land to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his quiet contacts with Israel continued even during
the war. According to a recent book by an Israeli journalist,
Samuel Segev, the king secretly persuaded Israel's chief of staff
to divert artillery from a hill on the Golan Heights where he was
scheduled to address the armored brigade he had sent to help the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   The king never commented publicly on accounts like these, but
friends and diplomats said such disclosures by Israeli officials
infuriated him.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein paid a high political price for his 1970 assault on the
PLO and his de facto abstention from the 1973 war.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Rabat, Morocco, in 1974, the Arab League
annointed the PLO as the ``sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.'' Since Jordan was more than half Palestinian
and had ruled the West Bank between 1948 and 1967, the Arabs had
decided, in effect, that he could no longer protect what amounted
to his own national interests, he said in an interview a decade
later.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth major crisis, the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Hussein
effectively sided with radical Arab passions in his tilt toward
Iraq's President Hussein. He insisted at the time _ and even later
_ that he had been seeking a peaceful solution and had been
neutral, saying, ``I took the side of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But his stance infuriated Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations,
not to mention Washington, whose gifts and foreign aid had helped
him to survive and Jordan to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   American officials understood the king's need to placate
President Hussein, given Jordan's economic dependence on Iraqi
trade and the passionate pro-Iraqi stance of most Jordanians,
especially Palestinians, who saw an Iraqi victory as the first step
toward regaining a homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But American patience snapped in February 1991 when Hussein gave
an emotional speech condemning the air strikes against Iraq as ``a
war against all Arabs and Muslims'' aimed at ``destroying all the
achievements of Iraq'' and placing the entire region ``under
foreign domination.''
</P>
<P>
   The king once again paid a high price. The gulf states suspended
aid, costing Amman almost a billion dollars a year, and the influx
of some 300,000 more Palestinian refugees from Kuwait and elsewhere
in the gulf severely strained Jordan's economy. In Washington the
king, who owned a home in Potomac, Md., that he shared with his
American-born wife, became persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1992 and even more dramatically in May 1993, the
king tried to repair his relations with Washington by distancing
himself from President Hussein, with whom he had once enjoyed the
warmest of ties _ frequent visits, nighttime barbecues and deep
conversations while fishing for carp.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Iraqis were suffering gravely under the American-led
boycott, he concluded that it was time for them to embrace
democratic government and end President Hussein's dictatorial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually a combination of fading American memories of the gulf
war, intense lobbying in Washington on the king's behalf by Israeli
leaders and Jordan's strategic role as a buffer between Iraq, Syria
and Israel produced a rapprochement with the new Democratic
administration. On June 18, 1993, Clinton met Hussein at the White
House for the first time.

 &HT;    Drink up: Cures may be in your tea leaves
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ Sometimes there's hardly a better tonic for what ails
you _ whether it's a stuffy head or achy joints _ than a nice cup
of hot tea. Maybe a touch of honey. Or a splash of brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, tea really does have a soothing effect,''
said Kathleen Zelman, Marietta (Ga.) nutritionist and spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association. ``It feels so good to wrap
your hands around a warm cup and inhale the steam.''
</P>
<P>
   That effect, though comforting, is not a cure. But emerging
research is suggesting while tea may not cure, it might help
prevent many serious diseases, such as cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   As with many health studies, evidence suggests potential
benefits, with a great deal more research needed to provide
conclusive evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what we are hearing about the health benefits of tea is
coming from the general buzz about antioxidants. Antioxidants,
found in many fruits and vegetables and red wine, are believed to
protect the body against agents of disease known as free radicals,
molecules that cause chemical reactions and damage tissues.
Antioxidants are thought to be particularly effective in fighting
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Teas made from tea leaves, Camellia sinensis, are rich in
antioxidants, specifically flavonoids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a little more strength in green tea than
with black, but all kinds are effective,'' Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cancer-fighting potential, some studies suggest tea _
especially green tea _ may inhibit oxidation of LDL, the so-called
bad cholesterol, thus helping to prevent heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tea also is rich in fluoride, essential for healthy teeth and
bones. And tea is a good source of zinc, an essential mineral that
boosts immune systems and also fights cancers.
</P>
<P>
   It probably would take four to five cups a day to get the full
preventive effects of tea. Those who are keeping an eye on caffeine
may need to beware. The caffeine content of tea is one of the most
common questions _ and the answer is complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Dry tea leaves are 3 percent to 5 percent caffeine in dry
weight, according to ``Tea Basics'' (John Wiley and Sons, $16.95),
a book on tea by Wendy Rasmussen and Ric Rhinehart. But no one eats
dry tea leaves. How much is in a cup depends on the tea and how it
is prepared _ how much tea, how long it steeps, how hot the water.
</P>
<P>
   So for one cup of black tea, the caffeine count ranges from 25
milligrams to 110 milligrams. A cup of green tea ranges from 8 to
36 milligrams. That compares with 60 to 80 milligrams for one cup
of drip coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the traditional teas made from tea leaves, there are a
number of herbal blends made from plant substances other than tea
leaves. Many claim to have health benefits, and some have been used
for hundreds of years. For instance, peppermint tea has long been
relied on to settle an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks in other countries used herbal teas a great deal. In
this country, herbal blends are not regulated, so buyer beware,''
Zelman said. ``But with something like peppermint tea, there really
isn't much snake oil to sell there.''
</P>
<P>
   3,000 TEAS FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
   The more than 3,000 varieties of tea in the world all come from
the same type of plant _ the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen bush
with dark green leaves _ and its hybrids. Processing methods
determine whether a tea is black, oolong or green.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Black tea: Black teas are fully fermented. Fresh green tea
leaves are plucked and then set out to wither. Next, they are
twisted so natural enzymes are released and the leaves oxidize.
Then they are dried until they look black. These offer rich,
full-bodied brews. Darjeeling is the champagne of black teas, with
lots of flavor subtleties. It comes from the Darjeeling region in
India. Other black teas include Ceylon, China blacks, Assam and
English breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  White tea: Tea leaves are unfermented. They are simply picked,
steamed and dried. Shou Mei is one of China's most popular white
teas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Green tea: Green tea leaves are unfermented and are plucked
and steamed like white tea, but rolled before drying. Some say they
have a grassy flavor, especially those from Japan. The best known
are Dragon Well and Gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oolong tea: These are semi-fermented to offer a flavor
compromise between the black and green teas. The best oolongs come
from Taiwan and the Fukien province of China. The most popular are
Formosa and Ti Kuan Yin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blended tea: These teas are made from a combination teas to
ensure a quality product under changing growing conditions.
Flowers, fruits, herbs or spices may be included.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Herbal tea: These are not truly teas because they are made
from plants other than Camellia sinensis. Technically, such
caffeine-free drinks are called infusions or tisanes. Many blends
are considered to have medicinal properties.

 UNDATED: first time.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While proud of his family's and his country's Arab heritage,
Hussein always understood the need to maintain contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the king and a succession of Israeli
leaders took place in mid-1963 at the London home of his doctor
when the king was only 29 and had yet to consolidate power.
Subsequent sessions were held in Paris, in tents, in desert
trailers, aboard boats, on a Red Sea island, even in a Mossad safe
house north of Tel Aviv. Though widely rumored among politically
well connected Israelis, the meetings were almost never discussed
in public.
</P>
<P>
   For Hussein, who had few illusions about the dangerous
neighborhood in which he lived or the perfidy of many of his
neighbors, Israel was an insurance policy against Egyptian, Syrian,
Palestinian and even Iraqi ambitions. He always promised that one
day he would forge a formal peace and normal relations with the
Jewish state, a goal he doggedly and often dangerously pursued
throughout his rule.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he insisted that a peace must be
comprehensive, rejecting the notion that Arab nations could make a
separate accommodation with Israel. For this reason, he later
asserted in interviews, he opposed the Camp David peace accord
between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and their peace treaty the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his intense misgivings about Arafat's prior history and
future intentions, he was among the first Arab leaders to endorse
the Madrid peace talks sponsored by the Bush administration in
October 1991. He and Osama el-Baz, an adviser to President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, were influential in persuading the Palestinians
to take part in the ground-breaking talks.
</P>
<P>
   And to encourage the process and keep the PLO under some check,
he agreed to include Palestinian representatives as nominal members
of the Jordanian delegation, thus defusing Israel's objections to
direct negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks between Israel and its Arab enemies, which
continued in Washington after the Madrid conference, dragged on
inconclusively month after month. Unbeknown to most of the
officials negotiating in Washington, Rabin had blessed a secret
effort by his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to seek a
breakthrough directly with the PLO in Oslo. Hussein was not
informed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make peace between Jordan and Israel received an
unexpected impetus from a traumatic development in the summer of
1992: Hussein was found to have cancer. At the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, he underwent surgery on his urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In September he returned to Jordan to a tumultuous welcome.
Unable to imagine their country without him, over a million
Jordanians _ then almost a third of his kingdom _ lined the roads
between the airport and the capital to welcome him home, waving
banners, pictures and placards, cheering, chanting and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   His illness and the fervor of his welcome intensified his
determination to make peace, Hussein said shortly before the treaty
with Israel was signed in 1994. While he had been ``overwhelmed by
the warmth, by the feelings of the people'' upon his return, he
said, ``I felt an element of fear _ of insecurity _ about what
might happen if I was not there, so I knew that I had to do
everything I could, in whatever time I had left, to achieve peace
and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Jordan and Israel agreed in writing for the
first time that their common goal was a formal peace treaty within
the framework of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in the summer of 1993, the PLO and Israel stunned the world
_ and Hussein _ by announcing that the Oslo talks had produced a
peace agreement between them. The king felt shunted aside and
feared that his poor country would be frozen out economically while
billions of dollars poured into the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the king ignored those concerns and welcomed the accord.
On Sept. 14, a day after the Oslo agreement was made official at
the White House, Jordan and Israel signed their own agenda
outlining the treaty they hoped to reach. In November Hussein and
Peres signed understandings on economic ties and other forms of
cooperation at a secret meeting in Amman. And in July 1994, Israel
and Jordan ended the state of war that had existed between them for
nearly half a century, signing a declaration on the White House
lawn that paved the way for a formal peace.
</P>
<P>
   This peace came on Oct. 26, 1994, in another stirring ceremony
witnessed by Clinton at Wadi Arava, a barren strip of desert
between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment: leaving my
people a legacy of peace,'' the king said in an interview in Nadwa
Palace in Amman shortly before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   No Arab leader was more openly upset by the assassination of
Rabin in November 1995 than Hussein. Traveling openly to Jerusalem
for the first time since its loss to Israel in the 1967 war, he
wept openly at the funeral of his former enemy, his ``brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is peace that has been assassinated,'' Hussein said in his
tribute as Rabin's body was laid to rest under the pines and
cypresses of Mount Herzl, the cemetery of Israel's military and
spiritual heroes.
</P>
<P>
   When Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's prime minister in 1996,
Hussein said Arab alarm over the change of government was
overwrought, and expressed confidence that the election would not
undermine the quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   But he grew disillusioned with Netanyahu's leadership, which in
the king's view seriously eroded support for peace within Jordan.
While the king was noting that he had risked domestic discontent by
overtly pursuing peace, Netanyahu was authorizing expansion of
Jewish settlements on the West Bank and housing projects in East
Jerusalem, and taking other measures that offered a contrary,
hawkish vision.
</P>
<P>
   In a severe blow to relations in September 1997, Mossad agents
sought to kill a militant Islamic leader from Hamas on the streets
of Amman, but failed. The bungled assassination attempt threatened
Hussein's need to balance his inclinations toward peace with Israel
against his need to keep faith with his Palestinian constituents
and avoid offending Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1998, many Jordanians were openly deriding the
treaty with Israel as ``the king's peace,'' arguing that the
agreement had brought them no tangible gain. Instead of getting
better, the economy turned worse. The government became less
tolerant of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of crisis in Iraq also made many Jordanians fear that
once again they would somehow end up paying the price. But Hussein
refused to break with Netanyahu, fearing such a step would cause
greater instability, which would drive away the foreign investment
that his country so desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   The king's political troubles were overshadowed by illness once
again in mid-1998. In July, he told his brother, Crown Prince
Hassan, in a letter made public in Jordan that a new round of tests
at Mayo showed that he probably had cancer of the lymph glands,
which is usually fatal.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio broadcast from the Mayo Clinic in late July, Hussein
said he had undergone chemotherapy for the first time. ``My general
condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is high,''
he said, departing from the traditional secrecy that prevails in
most Arab capitals when rulers fall ill. ``This is a new battle
among the many battles and, with God's help, we will fully overcome
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In his years on the throne, Hussein had 4 wives, fathered 11
children and adopted a 12th. Even in his early years as king, many
women were drawn to him, and vice versa. A superb dancer who loved
parties, the young king quickly established a reputation as a
playboy that he never fully overcame.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Sherifa Dina Abdul Hamid, a Cambridge
intellectual and an older, distant cousin, ended after only 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamid, a lively, independent woman who found sleepy Amman
dull, had one child, a daughter. But she and Hussein had little
else in common. Though they parted amicably, she later married a
Palestinian commando who had taken part in the 1970 uprising
against the king.
</P>
<P>
   The king's second wife was Toni Avril Gardiner, whom the king
named Muna, Arabic for My Wish. The shy daughter of an English
colonel at the British Embassy, Muna had little interest in
politics and refused to be named queen. She and Hussein had four
children. The marriage ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The king then married Alia Baha ud-Din Toukan, the daughter of a
prominent Palestinian diplomat from Nablus, on the West Bank, who
had settled near Amman. He and the popular queen had two children
and adopted a daughter. Alia was killed in a helicopter accident in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Hussein took a fourth wife, an American, Lisa Halaby,
the daughter of Najeeb E. Halaby, a Texan who was head of Pan
American World Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration and
whose family came from Aleppo, Syria. She is known as Queen Noor,
or Light, in Arabic. They have four children, Hamza, Hashem, and
two daughters, Iman and Rayah.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor and the king had grown particularly close and
influential during his long fight with cancer. According to family
friends, she had urged the king to designate her son, Hamzah, as
heir in favor of Prince Hassan. While concluding that Hamzah was
still too young for the job, Hussein did pass over his loyal, long
serving brother in favor of Abdullah, his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Life Magazine shortly before his death,
Hussein said that his illness had been a ``bonding'' experience for
both of them.

<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan, who successfully straddled two worlds
during 45 tumultuous years on the throne, returned home to die
after losing a long battle with cancer. He was said by an official
in Amman to be ``clinically dead and is being kept alive on a
life-support machine.'' The official said, ``The king is near
death. He is being kept alive by artificial means. There is no more
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the Middle East's longest-reigning ruler, but took little
comfort from mere survival. Though he once said he yearned for a
``hero's death'' like that of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli enemy he ultimately embraced as his ``brother'' and
``partner in peace,'' Hussein succumbed not to the fanatic's bullet
but to cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had suffered from
for years.
</P>
<P>
   His twin legacies _ peace with his neighbors, including Israel,
and a fairly tolerant, stable society at home _ would be impressive
in any context. But they are particularly so given the often
violent politics of the Mideast and the unpromising country whose
stewardship he inherited while still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein spent the final months of his life working relentlessly
for peace and a succession that he hoped would ensure both his
immediate family's control of the throne and political stability in
Jordan. Just  &UR; days &LR;  before his death, he stunned the world by
bypassing his younger brother, Prince Hassan, 51, and naming his
eldest son, 37-year-old Abdullah as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from settling succession, Hussein's last efforts were
aimed at advancing peace between the Arabs and Israel, a goal that
had eluded two generations of Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn and pale, and made bald by four rounds of chemotherapy, he
left the Mayo Clinic in October 1998 to attend the Wye summit talks
in Maryland and help President Clinton coax Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators into concluding the next phase of their peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's rule was marked by both bold diplomatic strokes and
strategic blunders. Notable among the latter was his decision not
to join the American-led coalition that forced President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq to end his brief occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1967 he ignored Israel's private assurances and calls for
restraint in favor of joining Egypt and Syria in their war against
Israel. This cost him half of Jerusalem and all the territory on
the western side of the Jordan River, the West Bank, which his
grandfather had won in the 1948-1949 war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But after each setback, Hussein recovered his political
equilibrium and turned adversity to his advantage. Reputed among
Jordanians to enjoy baraka, or God's blessing, for dodging at least
12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him, the king
ultimately accomplished what his grandfather had been unable to do:
in 1994 he secured a stunning peace with Israel, which he has
called his reign's ``crowning achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, standing on the White House lawn beside Rabin,
Hussein initialed an accord that technically ended the state of war
between the neighboring countries. And three months later, in an
emotional ceremony in his own land, he became the third Arab leader
to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from a powerful Arabian family that traced its lineage
to Mohammed, Hussein ibn Talal ibn Hussein was born in Amman,
Jordan, on Nov. 14, 1935, to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein.
His family, like his country, were desperately poor. His baby
sister died of pneumonia ``in the bitter cold of an Amman winter,''
he later wrote. The family house had no heat.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, King Abdullah, had been born and raised among
the tribes of the Arabian Desert, but Hussein, in contrast, was
educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and at Harrow
and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his Hashemite family owed much to Britain. To protect
against French encroachment on British interests in Palestine, and
to reward the family for leading the Great Arab Revolt against the
Ottomans, who were allied to Germany, in 1916, Winston Churchill,
then the colonial secretary, had carved Transjordan out of Syria in
1921, agreed to finance the emirate with a modest subsidy and gave
it to Abdullah to rule under British mandate. In 1946 Transjordan
became independent. Abdullah, who never abandoned the dream of
recreating and ruling a modern Arab empire, became king and renamed
his country the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   After Abdullah's assassination outside the Al Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem in 1951, which Hussein witnessed, Prince Talal, who had
been treated at a Swiss clinic for schizophrenia, took the throne.
When his attacks worsened, the parliament removed him, on Aug. 11,
1952, less than a month after Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt helped
topple King Farouk in a military coup. Hussein, then 16, was
proclaimed Jordan's king just as intense Arab nationalism was
taking hold throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, when Arab nationalist passions were running high and
conservative monarchies like his were a constant target of coups
and assault, Hussein tried to damp growing popular unrest by
dismissing Sir John Bagot Glubb, Glubb Pasha, the British general
who had trained Jordan's Arab Legion. He also abandoned liberal
measures that he and his father had adopted, declared martial law
and called out the army against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein fared less well in his second crisis: the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Although Israel had urged restraint, he flew to
Cairo shortly before the war to sign a defense treaty with Nasser,
despite Nasser's earlier plotting against him. Although the king
later admitted that he had known he was taking a risk by siding
with Syria and Egypt, he said he had feared the fury of his people,
many of them Palestinians, more than Israel. A senior Jordanian
official said most Jordanians so strongly favored the war that the
king's choice, in fact, was between ``war and civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was a costly decision. As a result of the 1967 war, Israel
occupied all of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thousands of
Palestinian refugees fled into arid Jordan, increasing the
population by about half. Three-quarters of the population of Amman
was now of Palestinian origin, making it the largest Palestinian
city. Unlike other Arab rulers, Hussein offered the refugees
citizenship and a passport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which increasingly viewed Hussein as vulnerable and
an obstacle to its struggle, challenged the Hashemites' control of
Jordan. In despair over the prospect of a civil war, the king later
acknowledged, he briefly pondered abdication, as he would again
during other crises. Instead, he decided to confront Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arafat subsequently maintained that the Jordanian army
killed as many as 20,000 in putting down the unrest, conservative
estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. While Hussein had not
sought this test of wills, his legitimacy was never challenged
again.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn once into an Arab war with Israel, Hussein would not be
seduced a second time. Before the 1973 war, according to Israeli
diplomats, he cautioned Israel that Egypt and Syria were planning
to fight, but his warning was discounted. And while the king sent
Jordanian armored units to fight alongside Syrian forces, he
avoided fighting Israel along their common border, a decision that
precluded the loss of still more land to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth major crisis, the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Hussein
effectively sided with radical Arab passions in his tilt toward
Iraqi President Hussein. He insisted at the time _ and even later _
that he had been seeking a peaceful solution and had been neutral,
saying, ``I took the side of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But his stance infuriated Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations,
not to mention Washington, whose gifts and foreign aid had helped
him to survive and Jordan to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   While proud of his family's and his country's Arab heritage,
Hussein always understood the need to maintain contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the king and a succession of Israeli
leaders took place in mid-1963 at the London home of his doctor
when the king was only 29 and had yet to consolidate power.
Subsequent sessions were held in Paris, in tents, in desert
trailers, aboard boats, on a Red Sea island, even in a Mossad safe
house north of Tel Aviv. Though widely rumored among politically
well connected Israelis, the meetings were almost never discussed
in public.
</P>
<P>
   For Hussein, who had few illusions about the dangerous
neighborhood in which he lived or the perfidy of many of his
neighbors, Israel was an insurance policy against Egyptian, Syrian,
Palestinian and even Iraqi ambitions. He always promised that one
day he would forge a formal peace and normal relations with the
Jewish state, a goal he doggedly and often dangerously pursued
throughout his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make peace between Jordan and Israel received an
unexpected impetus from a traumatic development in the summer of
1992: Hussein was found to have cancer. At the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, he underwent surgery on his urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In September he returned to Jordan to a tumultuous welcome.
Unable to imagine their country without him, over a million
Jordanians _ then almost a third of his kingdom _ lined the roads
between the airport and the capital to welcome him home, waving
banners, pictures and placards, cheering, chanting and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   His illness and the fervor of his welcome intensified his
determination to make peace, Hussein said shortly before the treaty
with Israel was signed in 1994. While he had been ``overwhelmed by
the warmth, by the feelings of the people'' upon his return, he
said, ``I felt an element of fear _ of insecurity _ about what
might happen if I was not there, so I knew that I had to do
everything I could, in whatever time I had left, to achieve peace
and make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Jordan and Israel agreed in writing for the
first time that their common goal was a formal peace treaty within
the framework of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This formal peace came on Oct. 26, 1994, in another stirring
ceremony witnessed by President Clinton at Wadi Arava, a barren
strip of desert between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment: leaving my
people a legacy of peace,'' the king said in an interview in Nadwa
Palace in Amman shortly before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In his years on the throne, Hussein had 4 wives, fathered 11
children and adopted a 12th. Even in his early years as king, many
women were drawn to him, and vice versa. A superb dancer who loved
parties, the young king quickly established a reputation as a
playboy that he never fully overcame.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Sherifa Dina Abdul Hamid, a Cambridge
intellectual and an older, distant cousin, ended after only 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamid, a lively, independent woman who found sleepy Amman
dull, had one child, a daughter. But she and Hussein had little
else in common. Though they parted amicably, she later married a
Palestinian commando who had taken part in the 1970 uprising
against the king.
</P>
<P>
   The king's second wife was Toni Avril Gardiner, whom the king
named Muna, Arabic for My Wish. The shy daughter of an English
colonel at the British Embassy, Muna had little interest in
politics and refused to be named queen. She and Hussein had four
children. The marriage ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The king then married Alia Baha ud-Din Toukan, the daughter of a
prominent Palestinian diplomat from Nablus, on the West Bank, who
had settled near Amman. He and the popular queen had two children
and adopted a daughter. Alia was killed in a helicopter accident in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Hussein took a fourth wife, an American, Lisa Halaby,
the daughter of Najeeb E. Halaby, a Texan who was head of Pan
American World Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration and
whose family came from Aleppo, Syria. She is known as Queen Noor,
or Light, in Arabic. They have four children, Hamza, Hashem, and
two daughters, Iman and Rayah.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I heard that Microsoft is planning to make the
new Pentium with a special transmitter that will let them track you
whenever you log on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heightened Awareness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HEIGHTENED: You have a mighty high opinion of yourself. Why
in the world would Microsoft care what you do? You're really not
that interesting. I know. I've been tracking you myself.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I know everybody thinks Microsoft is pure evil,
but this really isn't its doing. It makes software. Intel makes the
chips, and even though most Intel machines run on Microsoft
operating systems, they don't absolutely have to.
</P>
<P>
   Intel built what amounts to a unique serial number inside the
new Pentium III chips, ostensibly as an added level of security.
Let's say your rat-faced neighbor swipes your user ID and password
for your online travel service. Since your credit card number is on
file there, he can easily sit next door and book himself and his
frumpy wife and ugly kid on the next slow boat to China, all at
your expense. If, however, that site also required that any
transaction be done from a PC with a known serial number, they
could reject the sale and notify you. You'd be well within your
rights at that point to walk next door and knock over his stupid
birdbath and ceramic chickens.
</P>
<P>
   When the self-appointed guardians of Internet privacy got wind
of this serial-number plan, they went ballistic and started
threatening boycotts. Intel reacted by turning the security feature
off, but that doesn't mean some Poindexter with an itch to see how
many times you visit the Nervous Sheep in Bondage home page can't
figure a way to switch it back on.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are already so many ways to keep track of things
like that, one more isn't going usher in the New World Order. Waste
your paranoia on better stuff.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The majority of the people believe that the
21st century starts on Jan. 1, 2000. It should commence on Jan. 1,
2001. Please help correct this general fallacy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stickler
</P>
<P>
   DEAR STICK: Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Who cares when
it begins? Our calendar is just an arbitrary numbering system that
not everyone uses anyway. In fact, I declare that the 21st century
begins ... wait a second ... almost ... hold it ... now! Happy New
Year!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I want to buy a program so that all a seller
has to do is type in the product code and it will print the
invoice, deduct the item from inventory, add in the tax, etc. It
must be so simple that my rather slow wife can use it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchant Of Venom
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MERCHANT: You know, I'm so happy my appeal extends even to
folks like you. Here, I'll speak so you can understand:
</P>

   Wife not slow. Wife no like magic box. Mama Bombay no like magic
box either. You call Mama slow too? Me get club and spear. Unn

`LITTLE VOICE' MAKES A LOUD IMPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Mouths have a lot to say in ``Little Voice,'' but it's the
pipsqueak wallflowers who get center stage. In a film full of noisy
sorts, the biggest revelations come from the quietest people.
</P>
<P>
   Take L.V. (Jane Horrocks), the mousy waif of the title. L.V.
says not a word of dialogue in the movie's first reel and utters
very few spoken lines thereafter. Horrocks communicates volumes
with body language alone: She lurks around her seaside-England
home, blasts old Judy Garland and Shirley Bassey records and
generally bends like a reed under the force of Mari (Brenda
Blethyn), her brutish, windbag mother _ a Big Mouth of cavernous
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Mari has foul words for everybody, but she saves her biggest
gusts for the quivering L.V. ``ARE YOU RECEIVING ME?'' she howls at
her quiet daughter, and the audience cringes in sympathy. L.V. is
caged and crushed: by her shyness, by her grief for her dead
father, by her reluctance to leave the house. Music is her one
escape. And if ``Little Voice'' has anything to say, it's that
freedom from bullies is only possible if we break out of our own
traps first.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, L.V. opens her mouth. Not to speak; to sing. When we
first hear her, she's doing a bull's-eye Garland schtick on
``That's Entertainment!'' and her thrumming voice box snags the
attention of the film's other cavernous Big Mouth, a bolo-tied
talent manager named Ray Say, who's having a fling with Mari.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine plays Ray as a kind of venomous hack Elvis _
sweating with ambition, lusting for a break. He sees one in L.V.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, of course, tries to get L.V. to perform, and L.V., of
course, declines. She's too terrified of anything but her father
(who appears before her as a ghostly muse) and her beloved vinyl
gods. When she finally manages to perform when she finally dolls up
in a gown and heads for a nightclub her singing is both revelatory
and bizarre, like the bearded woman in a freak show. Horrocks shows
off her pipes in ``Little Voice,'' and the worst one can say about
it is she doesn't sing enough; the movie ends just as we're
slavering for more.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Mark Herman (who made ``Brassed Off,'' another
North Atlantic comedy) has based his script on a play, Jim
Cartwright's ``The Rise and Fall of Little Voice,'' but the film
never feels stagy _ it's too crazy-quilt cinematic, and its
performances blare with the in-your-face chutzpah we've come to
expect from British comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn, who made poetry out of maternal pain in ``Secrets and
Lies,'' does a fine job, here, of the mother from hell: She's
desperate and harpy, barely smart enough to spot opportunity once
it's smacked her in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just once, that (bleeper) fate's smilin' down on us,'' she
says, her eyes hard marbles of desire. Her scenes with Caine are
brutish and sharp, entertaining in the way of barroom brawls or
bickering couples. You feel guilty, but you watch. By contrast,
Blethyn's screen time with Horrocks is almost unbearable _ not
because it isn't well acted (it is), but because Mari and L.V. are
about as fairly matched as Evander Holyfield and a chipmunk.
</P>
<P>
   Mari's a nasty piece of work from the outset, but as the plot
moves ahead and the mean folks get meaner, the slash-and-burn
humiliations are almost too much to bear. OK, we get it: L.V.'s a
shrinking violet, and Ray and her mother are scum. Now can we hear
her belt out another tune?
</P>
<P>
   Among the movie's gentle pleasures are Horrocks' scenes with
Ewan McGregor, who plays a young, pigeon-obsessed telephone
repairman with a soft spot for L.V. For an actor so skilled at
spewing bile (as in the notably bilious ``A Life Less Ordinary''),
McGregor is equally good at conveying a misty, half-lost sweetness,
somewhere in that nether zone between clueless and cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected from a movie about flight (literal and
figurative), there's much talk of bluebirds and homing pigeons and
breaking free of limits. L.V. makes her splashy stage debut from a
gilded cage, and Horrocks herself is weirdly bird-like; her crooked
shuffle seems proof of a broken wing. When she sings, she soars.
And when she soars, the film soars with her _ leaving the Big
Mouths behind.

PEOPLE TAKES THE LOW ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 7)   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chelsea Clinton is now fair game. She's been
Peopled.
</P>
<P>
   Staring supermarket shoppers in the face this week is a People
magazine cover of Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, headlined ``Grace
Under Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   When I saw the cover from the far end of the 10-items-or-less
line, I thought it was about Princess Grace of Monaco. I forgot she
was dead and thus somewhat less of a celebrity than she used to be.
</P>
<P>
   My heart sank when I saw the story was about Chelsea and ``the
deep bond of love that sustains the Clinton women through their
painful family ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   People magazine had turned the president's daughter into an
official celebrity, right up there with Courteney Cox and Gwyneth
Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Poof, just like that, this Stanford University sophomore went on
permanent display in dentists' offices all across America, and
became an official media stalkee.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford should get ready for an invasion by the National
Enquirer, Geraldo Rivera, ``Entertainment Tonight,'' the Wall
Street Journal editorial board, New York Times celebrity op-ed
columnists, and all the rest of us who make a buck in the mucky
media marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The people at People did it to Chelsea by pulling the oldest
trick in the book, taking the high road to get to the low road.
</P>
<P>
   People's managing editor, Carol Wallace, seems to be an expert
at taking the high road to get to the low road afore ye, or afore
Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chelsea is nearly 19 years old and a poised young adult,'' she
said, responding to criticism from the Clintons for invading their
daughter's privacy. ``We feel that because she is an eyewitness to
the family drama and historical events unfolding around her, she is
a valid journalistic subject.''
</P>
<P>
   All this was to defend, or promote, a seven-page story that had
no new information about Chelsea, unless you count a quote from a
waitress in Palo Alto who said that Hillary hugged and kissed her
daughter during brunch.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. It took nine reporters and one writer in six cities
on two continents to tell us that Chelsea is a good, smart, strong
kid who loves her parents and is the mainstay of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The real message of the story, though, is that she's now an
official celebrity to be watched, stalked and psychoanalyzed the
way Madonna was before she got that cheesy Oxford accent.
</P>
<P>
   The map of American politics and journalism is a maze of high
roads leading to low roads, all of them rutted and muddy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the House impeachment prosecutors talk
high-mindedly and long-windedly about the Constitution, just to get
President Clinton by any means, constitutional or not, but
salaciously if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of the president protesting People's
cover story on Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   No one who has kids, or is human, can blame a father, even a
celebrity father, for feeling violated by the involuntary
celebritization of his teen-age daughter. But there's more than a
little hypocrisy here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton put Monica Lewinsky, a young woman barely older than his
daughter, on the cover of every magazine in America and probably
the world. He didn't think about what he was doing, but it was
among the many foreseeable consequences of his acts.
</P>
<P>
   All politicians, presidents and journalists use the rhetorical
trick of taking the high road to get to the low road. That's right,
even journalists. We all have occasion to talk high principles to
excuse low-to-middling motives.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether we're honest about it or not, and if we
care about the facts or not.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be the first to admit I sometimes take the high road to get
to the low road (or vice versa). But in the case of Chelsea
Clinton, I tried to serve the greater good while I served myself.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Chelsea arrived at Stanford as a freshman, and two
days after Princess Diana died being chased by paparazzi, I pledged
that I would never follow Chelsea around campus.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge sounded disgustingly high-minded, but I wrote it to
get out of the dreaded assignment of, well, following Chelsea
around campus.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic worked, and I've stuck by the policy of never
following Chelsea around, or even writing about her very much. That
is, unless she does something newsworthy, or she gets on the cover
of People and becomes fair game.
</P>
<P>
   You see how the Mobius strip of hypocrisy and high-mindedness
works.
</P>
<P>
   But I stick by my pledge. I won't stalk Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   I don't stalk people. And where I usually shop for magazines,
they don't stock People.
</P>
<P>
   That's high-road for you.
</P>

`SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE' ISN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Simply Irresistible'' is a gooey-sweet, beautifully
photographed romantic fantasy, with two beguiling young stars in
Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'') and Sean
Patrick Flanery (``Powder''). The combination thereof will be
enough to pack the theaters come Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   It's also _ at the risk of sounding like a Grinch _ a mess. The
filmmakers must have figured that with the adorable Gellar and the
dreamy Flanery on board, there was no real need for a screenplay
that made sense.
</P>
<P>
   And granted, the premise of the film is that magic happens. That
hocus-pocus can be real, if you fall in love. Or something like
that. But the action lurches along like a frog leaping from
conceptual lily pad to lily pad, from suppositions of angels, to
magic, to witchcraft, to ... true love? And at the end of the
movie, you still have no idea what supposedly happened.
</P>
<P>
   In short: Amanda Shelton (Gellar) is the owner/chef of a Tribeca
family restaurant, and Tom Bartlett (Flanery) is about to open a
spiffy new place uptown. But before you can say
the-plot-from-``You've Got Mail,'' an angel who appears in two
scenes but is never seen again is bringing the two together with a
magical crab he sells to Amanda, which scampers over and pinches
Tom's leg. There are, of course, sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than throw the crab in boiling water as she had planned,
Amanda takes it back to her restaurant, which is apparently closing
for lack of business. The magic crab, and the very thought of Tom,
suddenly cause Amanda to become an amazing cook and within a week,
the place is not only open, it's getting raves in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Tom comes to the restaurant, eats some of Amanda's pastries and
suddenly he, too, finds his life changed. The normally Type-A
executive is missing meetings, daydreaming _ even levitating up to
the ceiling of Amanda's kitchen. He freaks that he is under the
spell of ... Amanda's witchcraft!
</P>
<P>
   This creates tension between the young lovers, mainly because
it's time in the plot for something to nearly ruin it. And because
very little has made sense up until now, the famous chef Tom has
hired to cook for the new bistro quits _ because his knives were
lost by Air France.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a good way to have Amanda come and pinch-hit for the
famous chef, thus cementing their love, saving Tom's chestnuts and
20th Century Fox's investment in this film.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the film, you have no idea why everything came
together as nicely as it did. Maybe it was just Amanda believing in
herself. Maybe it was Tom falling in love for the first time. But
until they untangle it, I'll be in the kitchen talking to the crab.

KURDISH REBEL VAINLY SEEKS EUROPEAN SANCTUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan has been
shuttling in vain across Europe in search of a nation that will
grant him shelter. The one country that will, Turkey, is likely to
torture and execute him for atrocities in a guerrilla war against
Ankara that has claimed the lives of 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi militant whose very
presence in a country can provoke a US cruise missile attack, has
there been a fugitive so unwelcome. Indeed, while European capitals
are pursuing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for crimes
against humanity, they are washing their hands of one of the
world's most notorious war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Many European governments have privately expressed fears that
prosecuting the Kurdish rebel leader would make them vulnerable to
terrorist attacks from his confederates. But extraditing him to a
country that may torture or murder him offends humanitarian
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Italy released Ocalan from jail on Jan. 16 to avoid trying him
or turning him over to Turkey. Germany, which has a standing arrest
order for Ocalan in connection with terrorist attacks there,
doesn't want him either. And on Monday, the Netherlands refused to
allow a private plane carrying Ocalan into its airspace.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington has remained largely silent on the Pinochet
case, the State Department has described Ocalan's capture and
prosecution as a key test of the international community's
commitment to fighting international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   And it has placed increasing public and private pressure on the
Europeans. ``We think he needs to be brought to justice,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said on Wednesday. ``Every
country should take the necessary steps, if possible, to assist
Turkey in its effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the flight of the nomadic militant has led to wild
speculation on his whereabouts. Turkey alleges that he has touched
down in Greece and landed at an airfield in Belarus. Moscow has
denied speculation that he has landed on Russian soil. There have
been other reported sightings, all unconfirmed, from South Africa
to Switzerland. US officials tracking Ocalan's travels say they
have no idea of his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's supporters will not say where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest version is that Ocalan is in the Russian capital,''
said Nadezhda Spiridonova, the Moscow-based representative of the
Kurdish National Liberation Front. ``But there are also reports of
his arrival in Armenia, Belarus, Libya, Africa, Estonia, Greece,
China, Cyprus and Scandinavia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a European representative of Ocalan's party,
the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, said there are rumors that the
Turkish secret police are tracking him down to bring him back to
Turkey for trial or execution.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distant journey of Turkey's most wanted rebel began in
October in Syria, where he commanded the PKK's rebel army. Faced
with a threat by Turkey to invade Syria to capture Ocalan, Damascus
asked him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to Moscow, was forced to depart, then on to Italy.
His arrival has proven highly embarrassing to Rome, which recently
hosted international negotiations on an international criminal
court for war crimes. And Italy declined to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   Italian authorities rejected an extradition request from Turkey
on the grounds that Italy's law prohibits the extradition of a
criminal who faces the death penalty. Italy's high court has
previously ruled against extraditing a murder suspect to Miami
because of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Italy hoped that Germany would ask for his extradition. It
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   US officials and human rights organizations say that Ocalan's
forces are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of
people during its 15-year-old war for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Roth, the executive director of the New York-based Human
Rights Watch, said that there is ample evidence for European courts
to prosecute Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been PKK official . . . policy to kill non-combatants,
including civilian teachers, who are perceived as allied with
Turkish government,'' said Roth. ``That is a straightforward war
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that on the other hand, many in Turkey's military
deserved to be tried for atrocities against the country's Kurdish
minority.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no trace of Ocalan since Monday, when he was
denied entry into Dutch airspace. But Washington suspects that he
may be hopscotching around the world in a private plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great sorrow for the pilot of that small plane who
can't find a place to land,'' said Rubin.

MEDIA HOUND A BLACK MAYOR, BUT LET LOTT OFF THE HOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A white aide of the black mayor in Washington, D.C., says
``niggardly.'' A black co-worker gets mad even though the word,
which means stingy, is not related to the similar sounding slur.
</P>
<P>
   The white aide resigns. The black mayor accepts the resignation.
The press fries the mayor for accepting the resignation. This week,
the tarred and feathered mayor asks the aide to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody done now? Everybody have fun proving that black people
can be racists, too? They must have, for on Wednesday National
Public Radio had two separate reports, in the morning and at night.
There were no less than five syndicated columns on the subject on
the wires on Wednesday and 12 in the last two weeks, a huge amount
for anything other than Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   The speed and the fury of the press has now given us a
century-by-century dissection of ``niggardly.'' Yes, the mayor
deserved his tar and feathers. But that was child's play, stomping
on a politician who runs a beleaguered city with little control
over its finances and no votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The press has had the same chance in recent weeks to humiliate
another politician who has played fast and loose with racism. This
politician is far more powerful than the mayor of D.C. and the
creators of the racism he plays with are never misunderstood when
they use the word that sounds like niggardly.
</P>
<P>
   But the tar remains in the bucket. Except for isolated corners,
there is no fury. Thus, this politician preens rightously in the
podium of the Senate. His hands are deep in the impeachment trial
of President Clinton. His scissors snip away at social spending. He
does so with no fear that anyone will hound him about his skeletons
like the black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   This is Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. The Mississippi
Republican was momentarily exposed for by The Washington Post and
The New York Times for his past, warm connections to the Council of
Conservative Citizens. The council, which claims 15,000 national
members, grew out of the citizen's councils of the South, the
white-collar Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has given speeches before the group three times in 1991,
1992, and 1995. The council publishes Lott's newsletter. Less than
two years ago, top officials of the council visited Lott's office
on Capitol Hill. Also less than two years ago, a smiling Lott posed
for a photograph with the council's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when Lott was asked about the council, he said he had ``no
firsthand knowledge'' of it. The publicity forced him to condemn
the group. But given a parsing of his memory that is no less
ridiculous than Clinton's about Monicagate, we need to know far
more fully what is in Lott's mind and how such a mind _ given that
he runs the Senate _ affects our nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   While we wait for the press to force Lott to speak, it is
critical to note that the CCC is not merely some conservatives who
happen to dislike affirmative action, which is hardly news. Through
its links on its Internet Web site, the Council of Conservative
Citizens is linked to some of the most racist, homophobic, and
sexist Web sites in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For example, You can go from the CCC to the Screed (``A Bastion
of the Angry White Male), which then links up with the Web page for
Stormfront (``White Pride, World-Wide'').
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who gives $35 to Stormfront's legal defense fund receives
a free copy of the autobiography of David Duke, the former leader
of the Ku Klux Klan who has become a right-wing politician.
Stormfront also has direct links to the real KKK.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the KKK for a minute. Stormfront has a category of
links titled ``White Rights/Racially Conscious Conservatism.'' It
says, ``These are Web sites promoting traditional, racially
conscious conservatism.'' Here, with one click, you can link from
Stormfront directly back to the Council of Conservative Citizens.
Stormfront says of the CCC:
</P>
<P>
   ``Successor to the Citizens Councils, which actively led the
resistance to forced racial integration in the '50s and '60s. This
is the only openly racialist group to attain any degree of
political influence in recent years, and, because of this, it is
currently the target of attack by the anti-White political and
media establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the press needs to hound Lott until we know all that
we can of his ties. The press needs to hound him until his
reputation is at risk of a stain as permanent as the one that has
forever lowered history's opinion of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The press found it easy to pursue a case of black racism. Now it
has a chance to deal with one of the most powerful men in America.
As of now, Lott preens at the impeachment proceedings. There is no
buzz about his ties to believers in segregation. Few ask whether a
man with such ties should be majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Few ask if, when he pushes for cuts in social spending, if he is
doing it out of genuine fiscal conservatism or whether he is being
_ dare I say it? _ niggardly with black people. Few will ask unless
the press throws the tar and the feathers.

TOUGH LOVE IN WORKING-CLASS GLASGOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bare-knuckles corner of Glasgow, recovering alcoholic Joe
Kavanaugh runs a scruffy amateur soccer team and takes a paternal
interest in one of its members, a nice-guy ex-doper who's deeply in
debt to hoodlums and trying to raise a son with his companion, a
junkie and sometime hooker.
</P>
<P>
   Excepting Joe's unlikely love interest, a middle-class social
worker, it's a thoroughly gritty bunch who inhabit the no-illusions
world of Ken Loach's potent slice-of-life drama, ``My Name Is
Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   We're a long way from bonnie Scotland, which Loach mocks with a
brief shot of a traditional bagpiper performing for gawking
tourists. By this time, we're so deep in the slum world of chronic
unemployment, crime and getting high that this kilted laddie is a
very bizarre apparition.
</P>
<P>
   Loach, who studied law at Oxford, first made his name in Britain
by directing a series of controversial TV docudramas that reflected
his socialist beliefs, and his film work (including ``Hidden
Agenda'' and ``Raining Stones'') continues to reflect a deep
commitment to the left. His mode is crisp realism, and his subject
the underclass and marginal types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe'' follows ``Carla's Song'' as the second of his films set
in working-class Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   But his concerns aren't only political; the director wants us to
feel his characters' struggles with themselves as well as with an
indifferent-to-hostile society. Joe (Peter Mullan), living on the
dole and odd jobs, has been on the wagon since committing a brutal
act while drunk (the film's title refers to the traditional opening
line used by speakers at AA meetings).
</P>
<P>
   He meets Sarah (Louise Goodall), a health counselor who's
remarkably uncynical considering the problems she has to deal with,
and who isn't priggish despite having grown up in more comfortable
circles. She's impressed with Joe's decency and determination to
walk the straight and narrow, and the two begin an affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe's friendship with Liam (David McKay), the young soccer
player in hock to thugs, threatens to pull him back into a life
that would destroy his new love relationship. As Joe is bonded to
Liam, so Liam is tied to Sabine (Anne-Marie Kennedy), the mother of
his son and a heroin addict.
</P>
<P>
   To save Liam from having his legs broken, Joe agrees to act as a
courier for the neighborhood drug lord _ and of course, once
involved, he won't be allowed simply to walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Loach and writer Paul Laverty have a fine ear for the rough and
often witty street language of the characters (delivered in such
brick-thick accents that the film is subtitled). The first half
heavily underlines the camaraderie that compensates for the
deprivation in these tough districts, and the story is quite
affecting as it shows Joe and Sarah slowly overcoming their
differences and hesitations before pairing. Equally touching is the
plight of Liam and Sabine; the more we get to know them, the more
hapless they seem.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is torn by his desire to stay sober, his love for Sarah and
his loyalty to Liam _ and he is only human. As the crisis
approaches, the film moves out of the personal vein and becomes
more conventionally plot-based, losing a bit in the change and in
an overly melodramatic turn at the climax. Also, Sarah's character
could have been more fully developed.
</P>
<P>
   But these are quibbles. The performances are quite fine,
especially Mullan's; he won the best actor award at Cannes for this
role. You don't see very many mature, complex working-class
characters like Joe in the movies nowadays. By force of will he's
tried to pull himself up from a very dark place, but he asks no
favors and stands by his friends.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine how Mullan could have been better. And
despite her slightly under-drawn role, Goodall also does a
commendable job as the social worker who is compassionate but
nobody's fool.
</P>
<P>
   There's power, humor and tenderness in this portrait of
blue-collar life, along with glimmers of hope. This particular
quarter of Glasgow may be tough and squalid, but it's far from
loveless.

WES ANDERSON EXCELS WITH `RUSHMORE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe Wes Anderson's Max Fischer is a smart-aleck boy genius,
the latest in a line stretching back to Tom Sawyer, but in
``Rushmore'' he could stand as a symbol for this era. Max is a
genius, all right, but he's a childish, self-absorbed one who
doesn't quite know how to use his seemingly endless energy and
inventive mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' might be ``Tom Sawyer'' as done by the Coen
brothers _ a weird, wonderful and funny work that stands as a true
original. As if that weren't enough, director and co-writer
Anderson has given Bill Murray his best role in years.
</P>
<P>
   Max (Jason Schwartzman, son of Talia Shire) is an underachieving
student at Rushmore Academy, a posh private school. Underachieving
in the classroom, that is. In extracurricular activities, he does
it all: president of the French, German and Chess clubs, captain of
the fencing team and director of the Max Fischer Players acting
troupe, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of being kicked out of Rushmore for his academic
shortcomings, Max meets a kindred spirit in Mr. Blume, a
multimillionaire, middle-aged Rushmore grad who, during a student
body address, tells the rich kids ``you've always had money and
probably always will,'' then tells the poor students on scholarship
to grow up and ``kick their asses'' in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   In Max, Blume sees a younger version of himself, before he got
into a loveless marriage and began to drink. In Blume, Max
experiences his first form of validation by an adult other than his
father.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this pumps Max's ego up to horrific proportions, so
much so that when he meets the pretty elementary school teacher at
Rushmore, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), he tries to go out with
her. After all, he's Max Fischer, and she's British, beautiful and
an older woman (in her 20s).
</P>
<P>
   Max convinces Blume to donate millions earmarked for an aquarium
on the Rushmore campus to help achieve Miss Cross' dream of
expanding the school's marine biology curriculum. But Blume falls
in love with the teacher himself, and he and Max become bitter
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   What is oddly alluring about ``Rushmore,'' despite its sexual
overtones and a couple of creepy plot turns, is its sense of
naivete. Anderson and cinematographer Robert Yeoman have created a
flat, elegiacal look that makes the film seem like it's set in the
1950s or early '60s; when a 1990s car whizzes by in a street scene,
it's almost startling.
</P>
<P>
   Max's arrogance would almost be overbearing except for his
secret: While he tells everyone his father (Seymour Cassel) is a
rich neurosurgeon, he's really a simple barber, and Max got into
the academy because the headmaster liked a play he wrote _ when he
was in second grade.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological motives behind his trying to impress everyone
make him human and likable, and allow us to laugh at his
overambitious Rushmore stage adaptation of ``Serpico,'' or the
simple act of having another red marker standing by when the one
Miss Cross is using runs dry.
</P>
<P>
   While Schwartzman, in his first film, does a credible job of
bringing Max to life in his horned-rimmed glasses and
almost-connecting bushy eyebrows, it's Murray's enigmatic Blume who
nearly steals the show. With his tuft of thinning hair sticking up
and almost zombie-esque walk, Blume seems detached from his
surroundings, treating Rushmore and his family like a big whoopie
cushion _ and the joke's on him.
</P>
<P>
   He's a captain of industry, but he's not above taking Max's
bicycle, placing it carefully behind his Bentley, then backing up
over it. That's kind of what Murray does for this film: He twists
it, warps it into high, unsettling comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pulls off this outlandish production, and Max would be
proud.

FRENCH ISLANDS LAY CLAIM TO MILLENNIUM FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PIERRE ET MIQUELON, France _ This tiny outpost of the Old
World boasts it will be the first place in the New World to
officially ring in the next millennium _ a claim that rankles its
only neighbor, the Canadian province of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   Newfoundland has already staked exclusive claim to the
millennial honor and is hoping to attract celebrants from across
North America for a waterfront bash in the historic port city of
St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   But denizens of St. Pierre, 12 miles off Newfoundland's Burin
Peninsula, insist the continent's new age will start on their
wind-scoured remnant of the once-vast empire known as New France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 arrives first in St. Pierre,'' said Jean-Pierre
Andrieux, hotelier and historian of France's last North American
colony, population barely 6,000. ``You only have to look at your
wristwatch to see the fact of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The millennium dispute boils down to geography versus the
clock's tick-tock.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Spear, Newfoundland, just outside St. John's, is
indisputably the most easterly point of land on North America. And
that, according to Newfoundlanders, settles the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the earth turns, Newfoundland is the first place on North
America to greet the dawn and will be the first place on North
America to greet the new millennium,'' said Robert Thompson, deputy
minister of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Not so simple, say the French, insisting time is on their side _
and that Newfoundland has only its own peculiar time zone to blame.
</P>
<P>
   For the Canadian province marks time 30 minutes off-kilter from
the rest of the continent. When it is is 11 a.m. Eastern Standard
Time and noon Atlantic Standard Time, for example, it is 12:30 p.m.
in Newfoundland, a chronological oddity that has forced generations
of Canadian Broadcasting Company announcers to advise listeners:
``News on the hour; on the half-hour in Newfoundland.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre, meanwhile, occupies a time zone that is an hour
ahead of Atlantic time, or a half hour in front of Newfoundland. So
inevitably as, well, clockwork, midnight on St. Pierre falls 30
minutes before midnight on Newfoundland. And that, say islanders,
means that the next day, the next year, the next century and _
``certainement!'' _ the next thousand years arrives in the French
islands precisely one half-hour before it comes to Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time difference is a simple fact,'' said Andrieux. ``We'll
be celebrating the arrival of the millennium first. This is not a
trick or gimmick _ it's an official time zone. It's been this way
for years.''
</P>
<P>
   There is irony in St. Pierre's sudden claim to being the
continent's millennial front-runner. After all, inhabitants of the
French ``territorial collectivity'' _ the euphemism preferred over
``colony'' _ have for most of their history adamantly insisted on a
European identity.
</P>
<P>
   The pungent blue haze of Gauloise cigarettes fills the cafes,
and the French tricolor snaps over the Place du General de Gaulle,
waterfront square of the island cluster's main settlement. Pay
phones accept only francs; all calls to and from the enclave are
routed through Paris; Citroens and Renaults rattle along the narrow
streets. People watch French TV, beamed in by satellite, and speak
French with a Parisian accent, not the Quebecois or Acadian
dialects of French Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Newfoundlanders are appalled by what they see as an audacious
affront from an unbeloved neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spiteful, that nonsense from the French,'' said Jack
Noseworthy, a mariner from Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula. ``They
are troublemakers and always have been. They just want to pirate
the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   More is riding on the controversy than mere bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   Newfoundland, a starkly beautiful but impoverished province, is
seeking to market itself as the place to be on North America when
the year 2000 rolls in. Officials and businesspeople are hoping
television crews and free-spending millennium-trippers will make
cash registers jingle down on Duckworth Street, St. John's main
thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Pierre, picturesque but unvisited in mid-winter, would
like a cut of the action _ and sees the 30-minute time difference
as a credible lure.
</P>
<P>
   ``So tell CNN the real party will be here,'' said Andrieux.
</P>
<P>
   The island cluster, which includes the island of Miquelon, has
long been a thorn in Canada's side.
</P>
<P>
   Feuds over fishing rights, maritime borders, and smuggling
operations carried on beneath the indifferent eyes of French
gendarmes have vexed both Canadian and British officials for
centuries. Newfoundland, which became England's first New World
possession in 1583, joined Canada only 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The proudly Gallic inhabitants of St. Pierre survive on economic
subsidies from Paris, fishing, rumrunning, and summer tourism, in
roughly that order.
</P>
<P>
   During Prohibition, St. Pierre was a major conduit of bootleg
alcohol to the United States, and the occasional hangout of Al
Capone. Today, Newfoundland's hefty taxes on liquor and cigarettes
ensure that adventuresome souls with fast motorboats will never
lack for economic opportunity. Officers of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police have grown hoarse complaining that France refuses to
take smuggling seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The racket works this way: St. Pierre entrepreneurs legally
import huge quantities of tobacco and alcohol from the United
States, far more than the petite French settlement could possibly
consume. ``Enough booze and cigarettes to keep every man, woman and
poodle in Paris drunk and coughing for a year,'' sardonically
observed a Mountie assigned to antismuggling activities a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it, of course, is spirited across the channel to
Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old traditions live on,'' said Andrieux.

PIERCE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE COMIC RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Joker was recently in a gym, sitting on the top row
of aluminum bleachers, trying to recall one of his favorite funny
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awww,'' the funnyman said after a few smiles and pauses, ``I
can't think of any good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   More smiles. More pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really,'' he said, smile broadening, ``I can't think of any.''
</P>
<P>
   You're not going to fall for that, are you? No way you should
believe this guy. He's a prankster. In fact, you should be watching
your back right now, just in case he is planning some humorous
chaos at your expense. That's what The Joker, Paul Pierce, does
when he isn't playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at small forward for the Celtics, he will show his
serious side. He stands 6 feet 7 inches and can shoot, rebound, and
pass. You will not be surprised when someone tells you he's been
doing that since he was a chubby seventh grader in Los Angeles,
playing ball in the Police Athletic League, at Rogers Park, or
anywhere else there was a basketball wearing out a neighborhood's
outdoor courts.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear how his current coach, Rick Pitino, went to see
him shoot in LA. After seeing The Joker make 20 of 24 shots, Pitino
pulled an observer aside and said, ``Wow, he was really hot
today.'' The observer replied, ``He's been hot every day. He's been
the best player here all summer, and that includes the big names.''
Pitino: ``Are you serious?'' Observer: ``Yep.'' Pitino would leave
and later say, ``When I realized what I was watching wasn't a
fluke, I knew we had ourselves a find.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be obvious that double-teaming Antoine Walker and Ron
Mercer will be impossible, as long as Pierce keeps shooting the way
he has all his life. You will imagine that he is a quiet kid who
went to the University of Kansas, way out in the fields of
Lawrence. You will mutter something like, ``What a nice young man.
He would never . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Too late. He's got you. Next thing you know, you'll be walking
by a window and someone will be dumping a bucket of water on your
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohhh,'' The Joker laughed. ``I did that to one of my teammates
at Kansas. I shut the window real fast so he wouldn't know who it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   So we imagine Terry Nooner was a little upset about that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
   More smiles. The Joker smiles a lot when he is away from
basketball courts. Anything to do with basketball courts? You won't
find many smiles there. Pitino tells him he will need to read the
scouting reports, learn the plays, and understand illegal defenses.
That's why Pierce has gone home a few times after practice with the
team's plays in his hands. He did some at-home study for a while.
But then something changed. He picked up the plays quickly, so
quickly that ``you couldn't help but know them. We went over them
in practice a few times, so I just picked them up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason the Celtics like him. He's quick mentally. And
that's the same reason you should watch out for him. Next thing you
know, you'll be walking into your office and he'll be there,
waiting to throw you into a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy knows about that. Roy is the boys' basketball coach
at Inglewood High, Pierce's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, this kid loves to have fun,'' Roy said. ``He
is one of the happiest, most pleasant people I've ever been
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy likes to have fun, too. Before Inglewood practices, the
coach would sneak behind some of his players and put them in a
playful headlock. The players rarely turned around in time to catch
the swift coach before he wrestled with them. So one day they did
the next best thing. They conspired with the school's janitorial
staff. They got the keys to Roy's offices and waited for the coach
to arrive. He walked in the door, and seconds later, he was off his
feet. A few players, Pierce included, carried him to the pool and
dropped him in.
</P>
<P>
   Hold it right there. You may have just said to yourself, ``That
wasn't very smart. What if that poor man couldn't swim?'' Well, all
we can tell you is that you have to think faster to keep up with
this Joker. He already thought of that. Throwing his coach in the
water was probably one of the most responsible pranks he could have
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' Roy explained, ``I've been a swimming instructor
for nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Pierce has a good sense of humor. Otherwise,
he might not know how to handle some of the jokes a joker named
Fate has tried to play on him.
</P>
<P>
   It started early in Pierce's high school career. He was the 14th
man on a 15-man team. Roy used to call him into his office and tell
him he should play junior varsity. ``We were going to cut him,''
Roy said, ``because, quite honestly, we didn't think he was good
enough for varsity ball.'' Pierce told him he was good enough. He
proved it at a Christmas tournament in Las Vegas when several
members of the Inglewood High team didn't show up. Pierce was
forced to play. ``He never came out of the lineup after that,'' Roy
said.
</P>
<P>
   End of joke? Nope. Senior year of high school. Time to name the
five best players in the country. Paul Pierce finishes . . . No. 6.
Then: Junior year at Kansas. Time to name the Big 12 Player of the
Year. The winner, from the University of Kansas, is . . . Raef
LaFrentz. And the worst: NBA draft night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night before, I'm going to sleep thinking, `I'm in the top
three, or at least nothing lower than five,' '' Pierce recalled.
``Once No. 4 (Golden State) comes around, I say, ``All right, I'm
going here. Once No. 5 (Toronto) passes, I'm like, `What's going
on?' A lot of things went through my mind. I started to get real
nervous. I wondered who would pick me; I wondered if there were
rumors going around about something I've supposedly done.''
</P>
<P>
   When No. 5 turned into No. 6 and No. 6 turned into No. 7,
Pierce's friend Scott Collins got his attention and said, ``That's
where we want to be.'' He was talking about the Celtics, who were
picking 10th. The Celtics took him and haven't stopped smiling
since. Which makes these two perfect for each other. They are
smiling about him, and as you know, this guy likes to smile. He can
take a joke, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids used to tease him about certain things,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us, Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not putting this in the paper, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Paper? What's that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they used to tease him about his foot odor,'' Collins
said. He laughed and said, ``He has since corrected that problem. I
guess Scot Pollard used to tease him about it at Kansas.''
Collins's children told Pierce that if he ever got his own brand of
sneakers, he should name them after the way his feet smelled.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the children were able to get a whiff of Pierce's
sneakers because he spent a lot of time at their house. Collins, a
police officer, has been a friend to Pierce for 10 years. He has
even made a habit of cutting Pierce's hair, at which point all
jokes are off. Collins has never shaved ``Kick Me'' or any other
message into the back of Pierce's noggin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul likes to keep it basic,'' the occassional barber
explained. ``He doesn't change it up too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who see the serious side of Pierce _ Walker, Mercer,
Pitino, Kenny Anderson _ are expecting great things from Pierce
this season.
</P>
<P>
   And the people who have seen all sides of Pierce _ his mother,
Lorraine Hosey; Roy; Collins and his wife, Regina; and a few of his
friends _ will be watching him. There have already been whispers
among them that Pierce will be Rookie of the Year. If that happens,
you know what will come next, right? The nine teams that passed on
Pierce may become fodder for yet another joke. Watch out for this
guy. Next thing you know, you might be watching him carry off a
trophy for first-year excellence.

WOODSTOCK ORGANIZERS PLAN PEACEFEST AT FORMER BOMBER BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ A former Air Force base once bristling with B-52
bombers will host three days of peace, love and money-making this
summer for Woodstock's 30th anniversary festival in central New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as sort of beating swords into plowshares,'' Michael
Lang of Woodstock Ventures said Thursday in announcing the July
23-25 event at the former Griffiss Air Force Base. ``It's great to
see these sites being turned to peacetime uses, and there's nothing
more peaceful than Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers decided against a return to Saugerties, where the
25th anniversary festival was held, because they want to begin
selling tickets in April, before college students go on summer
vacation. There was opposition in Saugerties and the permitting
process was taking too long, said Woodstock '99 attorney Philip H.
Gitlen. The performers will be announced in March. Lang said
tickets would cost around $135.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also considered a Pennsylvania racetrack and some
other New York sites. The Rome site, about 40 miles east of
Syracuse, is ``ideal,'' he said, because the one-time military base
has the power, water and sewer infrastructure to host a crowd
expected to reach 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically build a city,'' Lang said. ``And much of the city
is here already.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it be the same moving so far from Yasgur's Farm near
Bethel, the site of the legendary 1969 concert?
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that as long as it was upstate New York, we
would be home,'' Lang said.``Woodstock was always an idea more than
a piece of real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Concert organizers are guaranteeing the community at least $1
million as a ``use fee,'' which could reach $1.5 million depending
on ticket sales. Of that amount, 75 percent will go toward
development of the former air base, which is now the Griffiss
Business and Technology Park that employs 3,119 people, including a
large number of federal workers. Another 15 percent of the money
will go to the city of Rome and 10 percent to Oneida County. Local
officials said the three-day festival could generate at least
$400,000 in sales taxes for local governments, plus an equal amount
for the state, and 10,000 temporary jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All that is good news for a city that lost 5,000 jobs when the
Pentagon shut down the base five years ago, Rome Mayor Joseph A.
Griffo said. He said he expects the city's population to dip from
44,000 to 40,000 in next year's census.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they can take the census on July 23,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   County Executive Ralph J. Eannace Jr. said the concert is a
one-shot deal, and negotiations are under way with an aircraft
refurbishing business that could bring hundreds of jobs. The
Griffiss Local Development Corp. voted 12-2 on Wednesday to sign an
agreement with the Woodstock organizers. The two dissenters were
prominent Republican politicians _ U.S. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert
and state Sen. Raymond Meier.
</P>
<P>
   A Boehlert spokesman said the congressman voted no because of
concerns that the crowds might pose safety and security problems
for the business park's tenants, which include the Air Force
Research Laboratory at Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Swinney, the owner of Norm's Garage, said he, too, was
concerned about traffic and garbage. He recalled photos of litter
at the Saugerties concert site, and he wondered who will pay for
the cleanup in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the money that will come in will be worth the
aggravation,'' Swinney, 71, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Sachs, 21 and unemployed, said the concert is bound to
bring vitality to the area. ``Maybe it'll put Rome back on the
map,'' he said. ``It's a dead town.''

GORE'S GAME OF POLITICAL CATCH-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore was in San Francisco last
month, dispensing goodies in a classic exercise in political
promises.
</P>
<P>
   He visited a Chinatown senior center and said the Clinton
administration was proposing to restore social service benefits
taken away from legal immigrants by the Welfare Reform Act of three
years ago. It would be good if the Republican-controlled Congress
approves the $1.3 billion benefits package _ assuming, of course,
it can see beyond Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, poor, elderly and disabled immigrants legally in
this country won't feel quite as stigmatized as they did when
President Clinton signed the Republican-driven act into law in
1996. But you can bet they will continue to view politicians of
both major parties warily, if not cynically. After all, at the
time, they were treated like pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic change in the welfare system illustrates what is so
frustrating about our current political culture. I am not defending
the old welfare system, which was widely criticized as being
wasteful and inefficient. But in trying to fix what was broken,
conservative Republicans and some complicit Democrats, especially
Clinton, targeted the most vulnerable segment of our population to
bear the greatest burden _ poor, elderly immigrants who have no
political clout and who can't easily get the attention of
politicians like corporate interests can.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this decade, the national political atmosphere has
been poisoned by animus toward immigrants who don't have legal
documentation. When that animus spilled over to legal immigrants,
few politicians stood up to defend them. Anti-immigration fever has
been fueled by a revival of historic nativist sentiments and the
perception that newcomers are a drain on our accumulated national
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress passed the Welfare Reform Act and the president
signed it, social service benefits to legal immigrants were either
sharply reduced or eliminated. Clinton said he signed reluctantly
and promised to try to get benefits restored.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for re-election, he succumbed to political expediency
because he feared Republican anger if he vetoed the legislation,
and, as has been his pattern, he wanted to control the political
middle ground at the expense of his party's traditional allegiance
to the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Fear, panic and distress were rampant in immigrant communities.
Those feelings were alleviated somewhat when Congress restored some
benefits to legal immigrants in 1997. The Clinton plan, if enacted
by Congress, will further the restoration process.
</P>
<P>
   One has to wonder why it had to take place at all. Legal
immigrants became pawns in crass political wars between Republicans
and Democrats. It mattered little that welfare services to legal
immigrants are a teeny portion of government services. The Clinton
promises as delivered by Gore are a transparent play for the newly
emerging Latino and Asian-American vote in a state that is crucial
to the vice president's run for the presidency in 2000. Which
explains why Gore and other presidential hopefuls of both parties
are suddenly paying more attention to communities they once treated
as radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting byproduct of the Welfare Reform Act was a
dramatic rise in legal immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship.
For these new citizens who remember the anguish politicians have
put them through, future elections could be payback time.

VIEWERS WILL BE SEEKING NEW STARS, CHAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA is back, but the question lingers: Will people watch?
</P>
<P>
   With as many as 10 teams capable of winning the championship
after the retirement of Michael Jordan and the apparent demise of
the Chicago Bulls, the field is wide open for a dominant team or
teams and star(s) to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles? Or
Scottie Pippen, Hakeem Olajuon, and Charles Barkley in Houston? Or
Latrell Sprewell in New York? And where will Dennis Rodman play?
</P>
<P>
   The excitement is real, and television executives and NBA
analysts are predicting an unpredictable season and praying that
fans and viewers forget about the 204-day lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wide open,'' said TNT analyst Hubie Brown. ``If the teams
come out and give the effort, they have a great opportunity to win
back the fans. Attendance might be down a little in the beginning,
and viewership might be a little off. But no one can answer the
question of whether the fans will forgive the NBA. It's all going
to come down to the individual franchises. If the team comes out of
the box and plays with intensity, has terrific chemistry, and wins
games, then people will be quick to forget about the lockout. But
if the team has zero chemistry, a lackadaisical effort, and loses
games, then the fans won't participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the analysts at NBC and Turner Sports agree that the
50-game season favors the teams that have an established chemistry,
such as Indiana and the Lakers, or made offseason additions to
bolster their lineups, such as Houston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Bill Walton makes a tremendous point about all the free
agent signings: ``Never mistake activity for achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner has a total of 45 games (local blackouts
notwithstanding): 31 on TNT on Tuesday and Friday nights and 14 on
TBS on Monday nights. NBC has dropped the Bulls from its national
showcase games and replaced them with the Lakers, who will make 11
appearances on the network. The Knicks will be on NBC nine times.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are not considered a contender and have only two NBC
appearances, both against Larry Bird and the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nantz is best
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 1,000-member National Sportscasters and Sportswriters
Association named CBS's Jim Nantz its 1998 Sportscaster of the
Year. Nantz breaks the stranglehold of NBC's Bob Costas and ESPN's
Chris Berman, who have alternated winning the award since 1987 . .
. Nantz hosts CBS's coverage of this weekend's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am Saturday (3-6 p.m.) and Sunday (3-6:30 p.m.). He'll
be joined by Ken Venturi, Gary McCord, David Feherty, Peter Kostis,
Peter Oosterhuis, and Bobby Clampett . . . CBS starts its coverage
of the events leading up to the Feb. 14 Daytona 500 with pole
qualifying Saturday from 12:30-3 p.m. . . . NBC airs the World
Alpine Ski Championships from Vail, Colo., Sataurday from 4-6 p.m.
. . . Sunday night at 6:30, ESPN airs a 23-minute special on Al
Davis. NFL Films produced ``Al Davis: Legend, Maverick _ The
Courage of His Conviction.'' . . . ESPN2 provides live coverage of
the NFL expansion draft Tuesday from 4-6:30 p.m. Mike Tirico hosts
the telecast from the Canton (Ohio) Civic Center, where the
Cleveland Browns will select players. Marty Schottenheimer joins
Tirico, and there will be reports from John Clayton, Sal
Paolantonio, and Solomon Wilcots . . . Ratings for college
basketball games on ESPN and ESPN2 have improved this season but
still aren't overwhelming. ESPN has televised 93 games, and ratings
are up 25 percent _ to 1.2. ESPN2 has aired 43 games, and its
ratings are up 27 percent _ to .38 . . . ESPN2 celebrates Black
History Month with a feature Friday night on Jack Johnson, the
first black heavyweight champion. The feature is part of ``Friday
Night Fights'' at 9.

`PAYBACK' FALLS SHORT OF HITTING PAY DIRT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Early print ads for ``Payback'' make a bold claim: ``Get ready
to root for the bad guy.'' Hey, why not? Moviegoers have been doing
that since Bogart's time. And Mel Gibson makes a most excellent bad
guy, yes?
</P>
<P>
   But what the ads don't tell you is that this time, the bad guy
takes it just a nudge too far. Sometime after the umpteenth head
punch, stomach punch, kidney punch, head kick, stomach kick, groin
kick, nose slit, murder by close-range gunshot, murder by car
crash, murder by flaming gasoline, and murder by wild sprays of
bullets, audience sympathy has strayed an inch or two from Gibson's
homicidal, sado-masochistic antihero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' was directed by Brian Helgeland, who helmed the
entertaining but vastly overrated ``L.A. Confidential.'' ``L.A.
Confidential'' featured competent direction and smart acting in a
tale of crooked cops, dirtball gangsters and a hooker with a heart
of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback,'' by comparison, features competent direction and
smart acting in a tale of crooked cops, dirtball gangsters and a
hooker with a heart of gold. In case you're at a loss for a
difference, the distinction boils down to three things: 1) Plot. 2)
Gibson. 3) Ericson Core's muted, blue-gray photography.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is easy: Guy gets mad. Guy gets even. Guy gets whupped
into a mound of hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is Porter, a career criminal with a bee in his bonnet the
size of Utah. It seems an old colleague of his, a mob-connected
lowlife named Val (Gregg Henry, doing a surly James Caanish thing),
stole both Porter's wife (Deborah Kara Unger) and Porter's share of
a heist ($70,000). Now Porter wants his money back. (The wife, a
hopeless junkie, dies at the end of her first scene. Oops.)
</P>
<P>
   This is easier said than done, as Val's syndicate cohorts are
rather gnarly by nature and require much beating up.
</P>
<P>
   So Porter beats them up. And kills them. And tells everyone he
beats up or kills that, dammit, he wants his $70,000. ``Nice guys
are fine _ you gotta have someone to take advantage of, but they
always finish last,'' he growls, in breathtakingly cliched
narration.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is supposed to be funny, which it occasionally sort
of is, although the scenes in which Lucy Liu (as an S&AMP;M queen)
crushes male identities _ among other things _ might have been
trimmed. William Devane has a neatly oily bit as a mid-rank mob
boss, and both Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn show up later as
higher-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, as it happens, has the best line in the movie. Having
watched as the murderous Porter plugged holes into his luggage, he
bleats: ``He's just killing my alligator bags and putting holes in
my suits! Man, that's just mean!''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Bello (best known from the previous season of ``E.R.'')
has the unenviable job of playing Porter's love interest _ the
hooker with a heart of etc. This means she gets to appear in the
two or three scenes in which someone isn't clobbered.
</P>
<P>
   Helgeland co-wrote the screenplay (with Terry Hayes, who wrote
``The Road Warrior'' and ``Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome'') from a
novel by Richard Stark (``The Hunter''), and the script has the
relentless, bang-you-over-the-head violence of a tired action
franchise. Gibson's ``Lethal Weapon'' series fits the bill, as do
the less-witty ``Die Hards.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Payback'' is something else, something harder and nastier
and less honest. It's well-made sadism.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, always underrated as an actor, plays Porter with a cool
despair that's miles from the violent-kook routine that's run its
course in ``Lethal Weapon.'' Yet the role is in some ways a logical
climax to a decades-long career arc. As John McCarty elegantly
explains in ``The Films of Mel Gibson,'' the actor has built his
stardom on testing audience sympathy _ he likes to play bad guys,
he likes to jerk us around.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Payback,'' he jerks us harder than he ever has before. And
news for you, Mel: It hurts.

 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was such an unnecessary lie, the line about his
mother's funeral. Of all the falsehoods Arthur Good may have
uttered that day nearly two years ago, it was the one authorities
say tipped them off and led to charges last month that he operated
one of the largest investment scams in Massachusetts history.
</P>
<P>
   But they had no inkling of that scheme in June 1997, when they
summoned Good to the downtown offices of the Massachusetts
Securities Division. Before renewing his broker's license, the
regulators wanted him to respond to complaints from three clients
who claimed he mishandled their accounts. The charges were serious
but not unusual; it wasn't the first time a broker may have been
wrongly accused by customers who had lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Finely dressed and disarmingly friendly, the man they would come
to think of as a consummate con artist began reminiscing with one
of the investigators, who, like Good, had grown up in the
working-class Boston neighborhood of Roslindale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I kind of hit it off right away,'' the investigator
recalled. ``By the time we were through, he pretty much had us
convinced everything was on the level.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Good oversold himself, investigators said, claiming
that the clients who had complained were such close friends that
just the day before they had attended his mother's funeral. Not one
of them had been there, the investigators discovered when they
decided to check out his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Why would he lie about such a simple thing?' Then
we really started digging,'' the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing investigation, which also involved the FBI, resulted
in a criminal information against the former investment broker
alleging 43 counts of fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering in
connection with a scheme that allegedly took in more than $20
million from investors nationwide. Good, 51, was to to be arraigned
Friday in US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they uncovered a web of deceptions upon which
Good built an extravagant and respectable life. He established high
school scholarships and sat on a hospital board. But for years,
they say, he preyed on friends and business associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to say to me, `Don't worry about a thing. I will
always take care of you,' '' said Vince Poley, a 79-year-old Natick
widow. She said that under Good's management, a retirement account
that once contained $100,000 is now nearly depleted. ``He made a
nightmare of my life. I thought of him as a son, and he ruined
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Good, nor his attorney, Ed McLaughlin Jr., responded to
requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the investment scheme they uncovered was a
basic Ponzi operation. The object was to obtain money from people
by leading them to believe they were investing in a risk-free
trading program that promised very high rates of return. But rather
than investing the money as promised, Good used the new cash to pay
fake profits to existing investors. The result was that many
investors, once they received some returns, continued to give Good
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Before the scheme collapsed last year, Good and his partners
divided at least $7 million for personal use, investigators allege.
Some 100 victims _ entrepreneurs, retirees, dentists, and attorneys
_ lost sums ranging from $10,000 to more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from the Ponzi scheme, which apparently began in 1996,
several Good clients have complained their accounts steadily
declined with Good's handling.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Poley, who was among the three Good clients
whose complaints to the Securities Division in 1997 led to the
investigation that uncovered the broader Ponzi scheme. Good had
known her husband, she said, and following his death, she handed
over their retirement funds for him to manage. She said he treated
her like family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew I was all alone, so he said, `Why don't you spend the
weekend with us?' '' she said, referring to one July 4th gathering
several years ago. ``We had a barbecue by the pool with Delmonico
steaks on the grill for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Good played basketball at Catholic Memorial High School in
Boston's West Roxbury section and graduated from Fairfield
University in Connecticut with a degree in economics. He had an
easy demeanor that made him a natural in the investment business,
acquaintances said. ``He's an extremely tall man and very
impressive,'' said Virginia McKeon, who said Good agreed to manage
her retirement account after her husband died 15 years ago. With a
referral from McKeon's brother-in-law, she said, she met him for
lunch at a fancy downtown restaurant to discuss managing her
retirement portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only went to the best places,'' she said. ``He was so
charming and sincere. He liked to say he sent his daughter to the
best private schools. Of course I trusted him.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she, too, began to spot trouble in her account, she
said he refused to see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't take my calls. I went down to his office and
waited for two hours, but he wouldn't see me.'' She said she
eventually lost most of her retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   Both Poley and McKeon took Good to arbitration and settled their
cases for undisclosed sums.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Good owned at least a dozen companies
involved in investment advising, real estate, and mortgage lending,
according to records of his business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   According to former clients, he drove expensive cars and
entertained lavishly. But, apparently, he was also seriously in
debt. He filed for personal bankruptcy in 1993, claiming his income
had sunk from $90,000 in 1991 to $20,000 that year. And a deal he
helped organize to redevelop a hotel in downtown New Bedford
failed. He said he had liabilities of $3.4 million, including
$70,000 in credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   His only unencumbered assets, according to the filing, were a
meager retirement account, some back pay owed by one of his
companies, $3,000 in furniture, $1,000 in clothes, a bond in the
Wollaston Golf Club, and $100 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   His checking account was empty, he claimed, and he had no car.
The bankruptcy case was resolved in 1996, the same year prosecutors
allege he embarked on the Ponzi scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say that Good began to enjoy the good life
again as the Ponzi scheme thrived. They say that Good and his wife,
Mary, who also served as his business partner, spent lavishly to
show to ``an unsuspecting world that they were enjoying the
proceeds of a successful investment business.''
</P>
<P>
   They bought jewelry, cars, and renovated Good's office and and
their home on a wooded hilltop in the Hospital Hill section of
Quincy. Public records show that in 1997, the Goods put a new roof
and siding on the home and gutted the second floor, improvements
that cost more than $100,000, prosecutors say. That year, Good also
paid for office additions, including a spiral staircase and $18,000
for gold leafing for signs at the building.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Good served on the Quincy Hospital board of
managers. Using proceeds from the Ponzi scheme, he also gave money
to several private high schools for scholarship funds, prosecutors
say. They declined to identify the schools.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, investigators say, Good and his partners were
raking in millions. So far, none of the co-conspirators have been
identified, and prosecutors hold out little hope that those bilked
will get all their money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the size of this (scheme) was so substantial, to make
people whole again is going to be very difficult,'' said Secretary
of State William F. Galvin, whose office oversees the state's
Securities Division. ``Somehow when it comes time to get the money
back, it can be very hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to return as much of the investors' money as
possible, federal authorities say they will seize Good's home,
nearly $3 million in cash, and a half dozen cars, including a
Mercedes and three identical 1998 BMW sedans retailing for more
than $65,000 each _ one black, one blue, and one silver.
</P>
<P>
   Poley said she has taken some comfort that federal authorities
are moving against Good.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, he's just a con artist,'' she said.

`RUSHMORE' SEEMS SET TO BECOME A BUDDY CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RUSHMORE 
Directed by: Wes Anderson 
Screenplay by: Anderson, Owen Wilson 
Starring: Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, Brian
Cox, Seymour Cassel, Mason Gamble, Sara Tanaka, Stephen McCole 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: R (language and brief nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of filmmakers make promising debuts, but it's the second
film that tells the story and ``Rushmore'' is even more
invigoratingly original and flat-out delightful than Wes Anderson's
impressively idiosyncratic debut movie, ``Bottle Rocket.'' It
unfolds with a deft mix of grave clarity and unflagging affection
for Jason Schwartzman's obsessive prep-schooler and Bill Murray's
unhappy tycoon. They're buddies in a buddy film like none you've
ever seen before. Although it hardly ever cracks a smile,
``Rushmore'' gently and beguilingly celebrates the exaltation that
can come only of aiming yourself at a passion and never looking
back.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman's tunnel-visioned and hopelessly overextended Max
Fischer captains the fencing and debate teams, edits the school
newspaper and yearbook, presides over the chess, astronomy, German,
and French clubs, and, in his spare time, masterminds the Max
Fischer Players _ a group devoted to performing Max's angry plays
about violence, corruption, pollution, and the legacy of Vietnam.
He has applications in the mail to every cachet-bedecked college
from the Sorbonne to Harvard. He loves his prep school. He proudly
wears its tie and blazer. The only cloud on his horizon is the fact
that he's on sudden-death academic probation and is about to flunk
out.
</P>
<P>
   He's the most endearing loose cannon since Dustin Hoffman's
Benjamin Braddock in ``The Graduate,'' whom he suggests in his
fearless sawed-off pushiness. Even though the odds are very much
against Max being graduated, his manic zeal has attracted admirers.
These range from the shrimpy kid who hero-worships him to the
imploded father of twin lunkhead schoolmates. Murray's Herman Blume
is, to borrow a phrase from Cole Porter, a big tycoon in steel.
Having come to the school campus to be asked to become a benefactor
as his alienation from his family deepens, Blume notices Max and
finds he likes the kid's style. His esteem only deepens when he
discovers that he's more impressed with the think-big schoolboy
than the schoolboy is with him.
</P>
<P>
   They become friends, but then things become complicated when
they both fall for the same schoolteacher, Olivia Williams, who's
still grieving over the premature death of her young husband and
wants no part of either would-be suitor. The ante is upped when the
newfound friends become romantic rivals. Murray deliberately backs
his Bentley over Max's bike and crunches it. Max loses no time
retaliating inventively. But it's precisely when you expect the
film to escalate into farce that it simultaneously embraces both of
its unhappy, lovelorn characters and takes an unexpected turn into
territory that reminds us how a really inventive writer and
director can turn human comedy into humane comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman, the son of Talia Shire and the nephew of Francis
Ford Coppola, is the discovery of the year so far as the short,
serious, tightly-wound kid with a fire in his pants. And Murray's
depressed millionaire and Vietnam vet, Blume, trying to reconnect
with his own youthful vitality, is his best work in years. So
flawlessly does he identify with and internalize Blume's pain that
he scarcely needs dialogue. He says more with his eyes than with
his lines. He's a master of deadpan stares and weighty silences.
And yet you believe there's a spark in him and as much
unpredictability as in Max. Going deep but never making it seem
like work, Murray makes Blume's underplayed lugubriousness sublime.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's laid-back fabulist style also leaves plenty of
breathing room for some lovely turns from Seymour Cassel as Max's
easygoing barber father, Sara Tanaka as a charmer of a classmate
with a crush on Max and enough self-esteem to overlook his
insensitivity, Williams as a woman of heart and spirit in what
could have been a passive love object role but isn't, and Stephen
McCole as Max's chief tormentor, a Scottish bruiser. Thanks to
Anderson and coscreenwriter Owen Wilson, and their ability to
combine generosity of spirit with vivid, individualized detail,
``Rushmore'' seems both freshly unconventional and a classic, a
movie we'll keep going back to with pleasure for years and years.

FLYS CREATE A BUZZ WITH MODERN-ROCK HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How to summarize the music of the Flys? ``It's music we hear in
our heads when we're surfing or when our drummer is skydiving,''
says singer Adam Paskowitz, whose group is currently soaring with
the modern-rock hit, ``Got You (Where I Want You).'' It's a tasty
introduction to a hard-rock band with origins that are anything but
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Calif.-based Flys are fronted by the Paskowitz
brothers, singer Adam and rapper Joshua, who grew up touring the
world in a camper with seven other siblings belonging to their
father (a missionary doctor) and mother, an opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dorian Paskowitz had been on a fast track (one of his
patients was the Shah of Iran) before dropping out and taking his
practice and family to such places as Central America and Portugal
during his search for the ``perfect wave. '' (He is a diehard
surfer who also founded a surfing camp in San Onofre, Calif., in
1972.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot,'' says Adam, now 29, noting that the family
also went to Israel (where his dad started a surfing fad) and to
various Native American reservations, where his dad practiced
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the travels were rough. Josh has been bitten by a
rattlesnake and by rabid dogs. He's had rabies twice,'' says Adam.
</P>
<P>
   It was only natural, then, that the Flys would be similarly
nomadic: ``We started out by jumping in a van with nine guys,''
says Paskowitz.
</P>
<P>
   As for the meaning of the band name he adds, ``(Flys) really
means pimps or hustlers. We had to be such hustlers. It's a funny
experience to now be in the corporate world of commercial rock 'n'
roll after coming from such a strange background.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flys met on the streets of Hollywood and have been together
for five years. Their debut album, ``Holiday Man,'' is a refreshing
jolt of eclectic rock 'n' roll, typified by the hit single, ``Got
You (Where I Want You),'' which blends snapping guitar riffs around
clever traces of Beach Boys-like harmonies and rap/reggae toasts.
</P>
<P>
   The song was also the first single and video (``Dawson Creek''
actress Katie Holmes appears in it) from last year's soundtrack to
the teen movie, ``Disturbing Behavior.'' Detailing a true story,
the song is about a friend who tried to pick up a woman at a bar
and was completely shot down, but still managed to joke to his
buddies, ``I've got her where I want her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She never even looked at him,'' says Paskowitz, adding that it
was ``like a Seinfeld episode.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, it's been good to the Flys. The song has been a
radio hit for several months and has helped the group sell out many
clubs on its tour, which will soon shift to opening arena dates for
the Rolling Stones (but not the FleetCenter shows March 22 and 23).
</P>
<P>
   Other songs on the album show influences from punky pop to
spacey vocals that would fit on a Pink Floyd or Queen album. Queen
singer Freddie Mercury is even thanked in the disc's credits.
``People used to say that I sounded like him,'' says Paskowitz.
</P>
<P>
   The Flys are grooving to rock right now, but harbor no
illusions. ``Rock 'n' roll doesn't blow my mind,'' says Paskowitz.
``There's not a great deal of money in it, and success is so
fragile.'' To supplement the music, he's also writing a novel based
on meeting some of the band's teenage fans. It tells the story of a
young girl from a divorced family who makes money from her poems to
help ease the family's stress, and is called ``How Margaret Helped
Save Her Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Paskowitz forgotten his family. From the money he's made
with the Flys, he just sent his dad on a vacation to Hawaii. ``He's
80 years old and still surfs,'' says Paskowitz. ``It's time he
enjoyed the fruits of raising nine kids successfully.''

   J. Geils Band reunion? Rumors are rife again about a possible J.
Geils Band reunion this summer. Don't count on anything yet,
though. ``There have been so many attempts to put this band
together _ and it's fallen apart every time,'' Geils keyboardist
Seth Justman says. ``For the past 15 years there have been meetings
and meetings.'' But, he adds, ``if it were to happen, it would be
great.''

URBAN CASINOS ARE A BAD BET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Idea: Turn the USS Constitution into an extravagant floating
casino _ a uniquely Boston version of the riverboats that dot the
tired cities of the Midwest. Equip the leggy cocktail waitresses
with faux muskets, and have the croupiers call out such
historically grounded witticisms as ``The sevens are coming. The
sevens are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   While we're at it, drape bright lights over the Bunker Hill
Monument in the shape of a giant martini glass, blinking such that
it is tilting toward a set of pouty lips in a (wink, wink)
subliminal appeal to baser instincts.
</P>
<P>
   You know what the whales say, the high rollers: In for a dime,
in for a dollar. And if our so-called political leaders ever
consummate their long, lunatic flirtation with the idea of casino
gambling in Boston, there is absolutely no telling the havoc they
may wreak on our great city.
</P>
<P>
   These leaders _ Mayor Tom Menino, House Speaker Tom Finneran,
Senate President Tom Birmingham and Governor Paul Cellucci _ are
too cute by half on the issue. Finneran ruminates on the idea of a
Boston casino this week, then pulls back. All four say they're
waiting for word from each other, as casino executives lurk on the
fringes. None of the four _ not one of them _ will actively rule
out his support.
</P>
<P>
   So the people of greater Boston now find themselves in a
precarious position. With New Hampshire on the cusp of approving
slot machines at racetracks, Massachusetts officials are foolish
enough to follow our farmhand neighbors straight off the cliff.
City and state officials hallucinate about what they term a
``high-end'' casino, the type of place that would draw upscale
tourists to the region and assure that Massachusetts gamblers lose
their money right here in Massachusetts, generating an estimated
$100 million for the city and state.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the moralistic arguments in opposition to gambling. I
love the turn of the cards as much as anyone else, the raw
excitement as a pretty queen slides across the green felt of the
blackjack table. Forget, too, the more hysterical arguments about
casinos breeding organized crime and rampant prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The history, sociology and economics prove that urban casinos
are an awful idea, mythical in terms of being a tourist draw or
economic salvation. They are the last bastion of the desperate, an
answer only to politicians who lack the intelligence to ask the
right questions.
</P>
<P>
   First off, forget the tourists. ``You won't get a single tourist
in there,'' says Bill Thompson, a gambling expert at the University
of Nevada at Las Vegas. ``It will be too crowded with locals.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it would be nice to think that those locals will be
the same people who would otherwise be trekking to Foxwoods, in
reality, the casino will encourage an entirely new population of
urban gamblers, some of whom will eventually become compulsive. At
that point, studies show that suicide rates spike up, as do cases
of child neglect and domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And with a casino filled with Bostonians losing money, other
facets of the entertainment industry suffer, including restaurants
and lounges, cinemas, museums, even sports teams. There is only so
much discretionary cash to be spent, and a casino works like a
vacuum, sucking it in as fast as gamblers can place bets. In turn,
all that money is sent out of state, back to headquarters in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   To those who blithely argue that in America, people are entitled
to gamble, that may be true, which is why a place like Foxwoods,
out in the wilderness, is not a bad bet. But in Boston, the state
and city governments would become dependent on the casino's
success, addicted to their cut, complicit in the encouragement of
gambling. There is nothing passive about the billboards that
imagine and accentuate the remotely possible.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The elderly from Hyde Park draining Social Security
checks into slot machines, the family restaurant forced to shutter,
a police department again strained at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   And the reputation of our city in tatters because of a lack of
leadership, an absurd vision of something that can never be.
Detroit is turning to casinos because that is all it has. Perhaps
Massachusetts, like Connecticut, can find a rural setting you
cannot get to on the Blue Line.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, we have a booming economy, a history unlike any
other, a set of bedrock values that has evolved over 370 years. And
our leaders contemplate gambling all this away? One of them, any of
them, needs to stand in opposition. They're trying to play a losing
hand.

SUDDENLY, SUSAN COLLINS IS IN THE LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARIBOU, Maine _ She has been called the ``accidental senator,''
a little-known political aide who got lucky in a strange 1996 race.
But even devoted hometown supporters of Senator Susan M. Collins
never imagined she would capture attention such as this.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day now, Collins makes headlines talking about
impeachment. She has plans. She has opinions. And when the supper
crowd gathers to watch television in the smoke-filled diners here,
just miles from the Canadian border and Collins' childhood home,
there is a sense of amazement that a daughter of this rural logging
town is up there on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you step back and think about it,'' says her brother, Sam,
who runs the family's 155-year-old lumber business, ``the pace at
which she has become highly visible is actually very awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 46, seized her share of the spotlight by trumpeting an
idea, alluring in its simplicity, of how to punish the president
for his deceptions without removing him from office. Her ``finding
of fact'' proposal, loosely based on the work of a University of
Chicago professor, effectively died Thursday morning after an
aggressive, weeks-long fight. Still, the fact Collins, a freshman
Republican, garnered so much credit for the proposal is surprising
in itself. Others, notably her senior colleague from Maine, Senator
Olympia Snowe,, had suggested a similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden celebrity seems even more astounding to some in that
Collins is otherwise a virtual unknown. This is her first elected
post, not counting a stint on the homeowners' association or
student council at Caribou High. This is only her third year in the
Senate. And Clinton's impeachment and trial is viewed with great
skepticism by people in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for her,'' said Arnold Thompson, 54, a truck driver,
over supper at Carroll's Roadside Cafe in Caribou earlier this
week. ``But I think Clinton's doing a good job running the country.
She _ all of them _ should leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the fifth generation of her family to go into politics,
has taken some moderate stands. She broke from the GOP in voting
for open deliberations. She also joined forces with Senator Russell
Feingold, the iconoclastic Democrat, on another procedural motion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those moves have been eclipsed by the publicity surrounding
her bid to hold Clinton to account with a finding of fact. Collins
has been profiled and interviewed, lauded by colleagues and
criticized by opponents. She has been coached by Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott. And she has been personally attacked by the
White House, giving Collins a speedy education in partisan
politics, and prompting her to describe the process as ``just so
vicious, so unlike Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House really tightened the screws on this, and
unfortunately, it's had an impact,'' Collins said Thursday, after
defeat was clear. ``I feel I put forth my best effort and I am
disappointed. But I still think like it was a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden rise is partly due to the circumstances: Impeachment
has democratized the Senate as never before, reducing the power of
committee chairmanships and the normal chains of command. Newcomers
such as Senator Charles Schumer of New York have freely berated
senior members. Elders such as Senator Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia have watched their institutional authority erode. In that
free-for-all environment _ and in a world of 24-hour cable TV news
_ Collins ``becomes a player,'' said Colby College professor Sandy
Maisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, she becomes a media personality,'' said Maisel.
</P>
<P>
   Even among freshmen, Collins' rise stands apart. She has been a
relatively demure member of the Senate for two years, with a
reputation for consensus-building and friendliness, a polite manner
and, often, a nervous smile. In Maine, she has kept a lower profile
than Snowe, a career politician married to former Governor John
McKernan.
</P>
<P>
   Reared in one of the most northeastern towns in the United
States, eight miles from New Brunswick and hundreds of miles from
Augusta, Collins grew up on the two family staples: lumber and
politics. Her father, heir to the family business, S.W. Collins
Co., served in the state legislature, as had three generations
before him. Her mother, after raising six children, served as mayor
of Caribou _ a place her ancestors helped settle some 150 years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Her brothers inherited the lumber business, and Collins
inherited politics. She says her first taste was during a 1971 trip
to Washington, where she met Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith and
heard about the battle against McCarthyism. Collins, then 18, came
away feeling ``that's what you need to do, stand tall for what you
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, she returned as an intern to Senator Willam S. Cohen of
Maine, a jumpstart that determined the course of her career. While
working in relative obscurity for 12 years as a legislative aide
and a subcommittee staff director, Collins became close friends
with Cohen and conceived her own political ambitions. She mounted a
ill-starred run for governor in 1994, losing with only 23 percent
of the vote. Then when Cohen decided to resign in 1996, he called
Collins, prompting her to run for his seat.
</P>
<P>
   She narrowly defeated Joseph Brennan, a Democrat, but many
believe the scandalous primary helped her win. When one candidate
unearthed details of a third opponent's affair with his baby
sitter, both candidates lost voter respect. Collins won with 56
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Collins now laughs about her early defeat, saying she ``got
clobbered.'' Her self-effacement is joined by a wholesome quality,
the part of her that breaks into a smile when she talks about
baking muffins or ice-skating. Collins, who is single, talks fondly
about her family and ``homemade desserts every night growing up.''
She describes her 1994 loss in similar apple-pie terms, saying
``it's important to pursue your dreams and not give up.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics have a different interpretation of Collins' rise.
Gwethalyn Phillips, director of Maine's Democratic Party, says,
``She's probably trying to make a name for herself, out from under
the shadow of Olympia Snowe.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins does appear to have an uneasy relationship with Snowe,
whose husband had a long rivalry with Collins' mentor, Cohen. While
they work closely _ and Thursday held a joint news conference to
discuss the fact-finding plan _ there are tense moments, colleagues
say. In an interview, Snowe described Collins as talented and
hard-working, and says she fought to get Collins elected. At the
same time, Snowe was one of the first to call Collins' fact-finding
proposal unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Snowe legitimately considers herself the star and does
not want Collins to intrude on that status,'' said Maisel. ``It
would be as if, in his second year, John Kerry started challenging
Teddy Kennedy. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yet Collins, who worked for years without recognition, makes a
convincing case that she is not out for publicity. She says her
role is as a ``finder of fact'' _ judge and juror in the Clinton
case, and not as a skilled politician. This is about ``doing the
right thing.'' Perhaps her equanimity grows out of being the third
child, the dinner table peacemaker, as her brother says. Or maybe
it's just more proof of this Mainer's independent streak.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend trip to Maine was Collins' first in weeks, designed
in part to gauge public reaction. She went to a basketball game at
the University of Maine and was treated ``like a rock star,'' says
her chief of staff, Steve Abbott. On her way into a restaurant, a
patron stopped her to ask how she was. Over dinner, she said,
``They are just very supportive. It's been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins sounded relieved. It had been a long month, during which
she had taken some of the most brutal verbal blows of her career _
particularly from White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the apparent defeat of her proposal and the
barbs that came with it, Collins showed few signs Thursday of
retreat. Immediately after the Republican caucus, in which doubts
about the fact-finding proposal were raised, Collins was back in
the spotlight, defending the plan in interviews and on TV. She was,
she said, ``still convinced this is clearly constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she admitted, ``I think I've learned the importance of
seizing the moment. I think we missed the moment. Last week, we
were too slow to put down words on paper to have to show Democrats.
We should have just moved.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I'm still proud of having advocated it and brought
it up.''

   CHICAGO _ Four days after a Janauary blizzard dumped 22 inches
of snow, mayoral candidate Bobby Rush trooped to a clogged South
Side intersection to stage some street theater.
</P>
<P>
   With reporters in tow, Rush planned to accuse Mayor Richard M.
Daley of failing to keep city streets clear, a mortal mayoral sin
in these parts. It is political lore here that botched snow-removal
cost former Mayor Michael Bilandic his job in 1979, and Rush was
hoping to make history repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows Chicago mayoral history better than Daley, who
wears the mantle of the city's past like a family heirloom. Fifteen
minutes before Rush's press conference, the intersection suddenly
hummed with men and machines. Crews from the city's Streets and
Sanitation Department, a front-end loader, a snow plow and a dump
truck worked with the precision of a Russian ice-dancing team to
clear the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a former Black Panther-turned-congressman, could only fume
about grandstanding by the mayor. He tried to salvage the day by
noting that the dump truck was owned by a Daley friend who has
grown rich on no-bid city contracts. But with the street clear,
Rush's charge melted like snow on a manhole cover.
</P>
<P>
   As for Daley, Chicago's mayor for the past decade and some say
presumptive Mayor for Life, he pleaded innocent to the charge of
political snowplowing. Then he went merrily back to the City Hall
office that many here consider his birthright and few doubt he will
lose when he faces Rush in a Feb. 23 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conventional wisdom that if you have a snowstorm in an
election year, the mayor loses. Well, Daley looked into the eye of
the storm, blew it over the lake, and has survived quite well,''
said independent political consultant Thom Serafin. ``It shows how
secure Daley is these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the strategic deployment of plowing crews, Daley, 56, is
working to extend his lease on City Hall by using all the skills he
learned at the knee of his father, legendary political boss Richard
J. Daley, who held this restive city in his grip for 21 years until
his death in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Daley is trumpeting his takeover and reworking of
the city's schools, once labeled the worst in the nation. Test
scores are rising, if glacially, and Daley has made the schools the
cornerstone of his reelection campaign and his plans for the next
four years. ``All our resources are going to rebuilding the public
education system so that it will be the finest school system in the
nation,'' Daley said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He also boasts of a number of neighborhood housing initiatives
and economic development projects.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has even scored points for public safety and an overall
drop in crime rates _ despite the national embarrassment of a
failed investigation into the murder last year of 11-year-old Ryan
Harris and the fact Chicago had more homicides than any other city
in the nation last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on it, on it every day. Those numbers are too high, but
they're going down. Even one life is too many,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, Daley even has a vaunted pothole crew that
responds like a SWAT team to calls from the driving public.
</P>
<P>
   Some here say the younger Daley _ less bombastic than his
father, a bit less imposing, but no less driven _ is inspired by a
desire to remain mayor longer than the ``Old Man'' and escape that
huge, jowly shadow. But he bristles at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at legacy. I don't think about legacy. I model
myself on my own approach,'' Daley said. But then, unable to
completely avoid the issue of his father, he added: ``His legacy
was made by making decisions, not by worrying about his legacy. Now
I'm making my own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley won the job in 1989 by defeating Eugene Sawyer, who became
mayor upon the death of local icon Harold Washington. Sawyer is now
a fan of Daley's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is as great as Harold Washington,'' Sawyer said. ``But
(Daley) has done all the things that need to be done economically
for this city to make it number one in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer's support reflects Daley's success in reaching the black
community, something his father never accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   While the elder Daley had a divide-and-conquer approach, his son
tries to unite and conquer, a necessity in these days when
all-powerful ward bosses have disappeared and thousands of onetime
patronage jobs have come under civil service. It also makes sense
in a city that is 38 percent black, 37 percent white and the rest
Asian and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Daley is much more a multicultural candidate and a
mayor of the entire city,'' said Melvin Holli, history professor at
the University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of the upcoming
book, ``The American Mayor: The Best and Worst Big City Leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, 52, has tried to dislodge some of the affection for Daley
with near-daily attacks, accusing the mayor of cronyism,
favoritism, corruption, and neglect of the city's minority
neighborhoods in favor of downtown and the wealthiest wards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two Chicagos,'' said Rush, a congressman since 1992
and a city alderman for nine years before that. ``One Chicago is
symbolized by . . . flowerpots in the street, suburbanites coming
in on weekends for fun and frolic. The other is a Chicago
symbolized by a 2 1/2-year-old baby whose funeral I just left, who
died in a cold, unheated apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Leavy, executive director of the Neighborhood Capital
Budget Group, a nonpartisan coalition of 200 community
organizations, said Daley has made genuine improvements to the
city's infrastructure, though some of Rush's criticism is valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has put revitalizing our school system at the
forefront of the political agenda and has done a remarkable job of
it,'' she said. ``But at the same time, where are the economic
strategies that are going to make the lives of the children in
those schools more stable?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his years in elected office, Rush is often characterized
by his years as a founder and leader of the Illinois Black
Panthers. One of his chief recruits, Fred Hampton, was killed in a
1969 police raid. Rush later served six months in prison for
illegal possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Rush does not shy away from his Black Panther past, but neither
does he dwell on it, calling it one phase of a life that also has
included stints as a Boy Scout and Army soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned Chicago from the alleyways to the gangways, to the
streets, to City hall, to the halls of Congress. I didn't learn
Chicago from the back seat of a limousine,'' Rush said in a
not-so-veiled shot at Daley's political inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he would not respond to Rush's criticisms or personal
attacks, saying, ``They do that in Washington, and people are sick
and tired of it.'' At the same time, he has refused to debate Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultant Don Rose, who is unaligned in this
campaign, said he has concluded that Rush has taken on a
near-impossible task in the hope of being first in line in the
future if Daley bows out or runs into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably vote for Bobby,'' Rose said. ``I'm just not
quite sure why he's running.''

ROMNEY IS THE CHOICE TO TAKE OVER SLOC

<P>
   BOSTON _ Mitt Romney, the wealthy venture capitalist who ran for
the US Senate five years ago, will be proposed next week to head
the scandal-ridden Salt Lake City Olympic organizing committee, a
source close to Romney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Romney, who amassed millions running Bain
Capital and tried unsuccessfully to unseat Edward M. Kennedy in
1994, has been the front-runner to replace Frank Joklik, who
resigned as committee president last month amid charges that Salt
Lake Organizing Committee officials paid nearly $800,000 in cash
and gifts to International Olympic Committee members before and
after the Utah capital was chosen to host the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, who would be the third SLOC president in less than 18
months, would take over an organization that has been in turmoil
since December, has lost its top two officials, and still needs to
raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to meet its $1.45 billion
budget.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC officials have said all along that their new president
would have to be a well-known businessman with strong Utah ties and
a squeaky-clean reputation. The two names at the top of the list
reportedly were Romney and Madison Square Garden chief executive
David Checketts, a University of Utah graduate and former president
of the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidate I'm looking for is a white knight who is
universally loved,'' committee chairman Robert Garff, who
recommended Romney to the board, told the Deseret News.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, a Mormon and former Brigham Young University
valedictorian whose father, George, was a native of Utah, Michigan
governor, and 1968 presidential candidate, runs one of the
country's most successful buyout firms, which raised $2 billion
last year. Two years ago, Bain joined with fellow venture
capitalist Thomas Lee to turn a quick profit of $400 million by
buying and selling Experian International Solutions, a provider of
consumer credit reports.
</P>
<P>
   If Romney was looking for a fresh challenge, the Salt Lake
committee looms as a near-Herculean labor. Though the IOC has
completed its investigation into SLOC's role in the worst scandal
in modern Olympic history, four other inquiries are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC's ethics panel will turn over its findings to the board
Tuesday, when Romney is expected to be presented as Joklik's
successor. The US Olympic Committee will finish its probe by the
end of the month, and the US Department of Justice and the state's
attorney general are also investigating the committee. Salt Lake
City Mayor Deedee Corradini has already announced that she will not
seek reelection this year, and Utah Governor Mike Leavitt is
fending off charges that he knew about the payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Both SLOC's board and executive committee are likely to be
radically reformed next week to allow for broader representation
and more oversight. The board is expected to be increased from 33
to 50 members, with the newcomers appointed from various community
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member executive committee will become a 20-member
management committee which would include two IOC representatives,
three USOC officials, four athletes, Romney, Garff, the mayor, and
the governor. ``We want to move into the next era, the next
phase,'' said Garff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tom Welch, who as Joklik's predecessor has been
blamed for much of the payoff scandal, has apologized but insisted
he didn't act alone. ``I am saddened and dismayed that so many feel
the need to isolate responsibility for what _ at the time _ were
cooperative decisions,'' Welch said Wednesday in a ``Dear Friends''
fax.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who resigned under pressure in 1997 amid charges of
spousal abuse and was deprived of a lucrative SLOC consulting
contract last month, has said Joklik, Corradini, Leavitt, and
former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young all knew about SLOC's plan to use
cash, college tuition, jobs, medical care, and expensive gifts to
influence IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ironic that those who were so supportive of our efforts
to secure the Games now feel the need to distance themselves,''
Welch said.

DOUSE THE MOUSE AND BURY THE CELL PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEN ALEXANDER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, Calif. _ Today it is an axiom that the Internet is
the greatest thing since the discovery of fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, along with its hunchback half sister, the cell
phone, is the acknowledged life breath of civilization, the fount
of all wisdom, the provider of all things good and necessary.
Without it, life as we know it would cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be all bad. Any information source, be it
television, a newspaper, radio, magazines or simple conversation,
will tell us that life as we know it has become more stressful,
more uncertain and less peaceful when compared to simpler,
generally happier times, albeit without so many tangible goodies.
</P>
<P>
   I confess to being a Luddite. I made that statement to my
grandson while rejecting his contention that the Internet would do
fine things to my life. He asked, ``What's a Luddite?'' I explained
to him it was a movement in England from 1811 to 1816 by people
thrown out of work by the introduction of labor-saving textile
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the mythic example of Ned Ludd, who had smashed an
employer's knitting frames a generation earlier in Leicestershire,
the Luddites stormed factories, wrecked labor-saving machinery and
created general havoc, hoping to restore the old system of
manufacturing. Their failed attempt gave the name ``Luddite'' to
anyone, like me, who rejects change or ``progress.''
</P>
<P>
   This Luddite rejects the Internet and the cell phone. As a
retired but active person, my life (and my wife's) is centered on,
but not confined to, the welfare of our three sons and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   We are told, ``Gee, on the Internet you can bounce messages back
and forth all day, not just write letters or telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to read stuff on the screen; we want to hear those
blessed voices. Our families are so busy scrambling for a living
they haven't time to sit in front of their screens; they barely
have time to sit, period.
</P>
<P>
   We are told we can get so much information simply by pushing a
mouse around, things like reservations and listings and bargains
and addresses and endless other stuff. We get all that, perhaps a
bit more slowly, by phone, the media, the mail and, best of all, by
actual conversation with other humans.
</P>
<P>
   This is being typed on a primitive computer and will be printed
on a equally primitive daisy-wheel printer. I get no pictures on my
screen. I can play no games, zap no aliens and spread no
spreadsheets, whatever those are.
</P>
<P>
   My one concession to high-velocity communication is a fax
machine (my sister gave it to me). Even this is not essential; I've
sent stuff through the mail with equal, if not unfailing, success.
</P>
<P>
   The time we spend not seated in front of a screen has to be
rationed. There is so much else to be done _ music to be listened
to, things to be built or repaired, meals to be planned or cooked,
trips to be taken, calls to the kids to be enjoyed, books and
papers and magazines to be read, gardens to be planted and tended
and live people to be talked to.
</P>
<P>
   If we learn about our grandson's soccer team's victory three
days after it happened rather than three hours, it's just as
satisfying. Instant communication isn't all it's cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the cell phone. Somehow, business was
conducted, appointments were made and met, reservations canceled
and fortunes made or lost before the advent of the cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer auto accidents occurred when attention was given to the
task of driving; fewer disruptive conversations were overheard in
restaurants or airline terminals, and fewer autos were broken into
so an expensive gadget could be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, less revenue accrued to phone companies and hardware
providers and advertisers, but is that all bad? I acknowledge a
cell phone in certain emergencies can be a life-saving implement,
yet its overuse has become the symbol of today's rush to overdo
everything someone had declared indispensable to the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Luddites of the world, unite. Get off line. Sweep out that Web
site with a broom. Throw off those shackles binding you to that
unblinking screen. Douse that mouse with DeCon. Find a warm body
and actually speak to it. Give your gluteus maximus a break and
stand up for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Let that square screen be in the living room or the bedroom or
the den, not the home office. Let the picture thereon be of Steve
Young or Judy Woodruff or Itzak Perlman or Yasser Arafat rather
than some corporate logo or some gobbledygook ending in dot.com.

OZAWA OVERDUE FOR HARVARD SHEEPSKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear President Rudenstine,
</P>
<P>
   I know these are trying times for Harvard, and that you have a
lot on your mind. Like you, I still can't figure out how that
Northeastern kid snuck behind the defense Monday night. Did the
line change throw your guys off? I am assuming that you and coach
Tomassoni will take steps to prevent such lapses in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress. It has not gone unnoticed that Seiji Ozawa (or
C.J. O'Zawa, as we call him here in Dorchester) is long overdue for
an honorary degree from your august institution. It's not that
Ozawa lacks for awards, but Harvard's niggardliness with the
sheepskin has become the talk of Symphony World.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, comparisons are otiose, but consider: The two
longest-serving Boston Symphony conductors of this century, Serge
Koussevitzky and Charles Munch, bagged their Harvard degrees after
only five and seven years, respectively, of baton-wagging. Arthur
Fiedler of the Pops got an honorary at the pinnacle of his career,
and flutist Doriot Anthony Dwyer _ the first female principal
player in a major American symphony orchestra _ won her degree
while still active with the BSO. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma, whom we revere
for his ``Sesame Street'' appearances if for nothing else, got his
honorary degree 20 minutes (well, 15 years) after graduating from
Harvard in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   I know you tried to do the right thing a couple of years ago,
but C. J. had to honor his previous commitment to the Vienna
Philharmonic. Now that you know his schedule books two to three
years into the future, why don't you try again? I'm sure the
gesture would be much appreciated by all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
P.S.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neil, I'm sure you can appreciate how important factual accuracy
is to us here at New England's Largest Newspaper. So imagine my
chagrin when several readers phoned to point out errors in my Sept.
6 report on Project Adapt, Harvard's ill-fated attempt to
standardize its computerized financial systems across its nine
faculties.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I erred in describing Adapt as a ``disaster'' and
a ``shambles.'' Apparently ``catastrophe of millennial
proportions'' or ``extinction-level event'' might have been more
apt. And of course pegging the out-of-control-budget at $60 million
was a howler. It seems $100 million _ double the original estimate
_ is a more precise figure. Furthermore, casual readers might have
thought Adapt was more or less on schedule, when it is already one
year overdue.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had known at the time that the Oracle consultants had
been tossed off the job. ``We didn't feel we were getting their
attention,'' is how your vice president for finance, Elizabeth
``Beppie'' Huidekoper, explained their departure to me. Why they
were hired in the first place after that mediocre job they did at _
ugh _ Yale is anyone's guess. I'm sure you're much better off with
Sapient. Who knows? Maybe they'll assign their employee Leslie
Boorse to your account. Remember her? Ally McGlobe? She's the young
lady whose quest for true love we serialized a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was very gracious of me to imply that Adapt's personnel
problems, e.g., the revolving door among top executives, stemmed
from a job shortage during the current ``high-tech boom.'' As you
know, that was complete rubbish. Adapt has been brutally mismanaged
virtually from day one. Longtime, qualified Harvard employees are
being badly treated and in some cases shown the door. ``A lot of
people are being hurt,'' Beppie admitted to me. ``This is the
biggest administrative change Harvard has ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Neil, this whole thing could have been solved two years
ago by bringing in a few head-bashers from the Business School.
They've got people over there who can implement projects like this
in their sleep. Too late now, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Good news
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TGIF culture hero Richard Lourie has a contract with Brandeis
University Press to write what I hope will be a terrific biography
of Andrei Sakharov. Lourie, a gifted translator (Sakharov's
memoirs, lots of Czeslaw Milosz) and novelist (``First Loyalty,''
``Zero Gravity''), knows all of the Nobel Prize winner's kin from
both his marriages, most of whom live in Boston. The book has been
funded by jillionnaire Ronald Lauder and will make extensive use of
the Sakharov Archive at Brandeis.

WHITE HOUSE TAPS MASS. NATIVE WHO BLAZED TRAILS FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON _ She's a Massachusetts-grown strategist and one of
the nation's best-known female political operatives. As executive
director of EMILY's List, Mary Beth Cahill spent five years leading
the national effort to elect women to office _ and now she's been
tapped for a top-level White House post.
</P>
<P>
   Her new position, which will be announced next week, is
assistant to the president for public liaison, putting Cahill, 44,
in charge of building support for presidential initiatives with key
constituency groups.
</P>
<P>
   That will vault the Framingham native into the upper echelons at
the White House, where she'll be one of about a dozen top staff
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Just how important is the post? Consider this: Alexis Herman,
who held it during Clinton's first term, is now secretary of labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really is a recognition of her tremendous
capabilities and effectiveness,'' one White House source said.
</P>
<P>
   That evaluation seems universal among those who have worked with
Cahill through EMILY's List, the Washington-based organization
dedicated to electing Democratic women to office, or who know her
from campaigns she has run around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the superstars of the Democratic party and the
Clinton-Gore administration would be lucky to have her,'' said
Michael Whouley, a top adviser to Vice President Al Gore. ``She is
one of the most talented people in politics and public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how talented? Former US Representative Esteban Torres found
out the hard way in 1998 when he tried to pass on his East Los
Angeles congressional seat to his son-in-law, James Casso. Torres
announced his retirement just two days before the filing deadline,
hoping the late exit would grease the skids for Casso, his chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Cahill swung EMILY's List into action on behalf
of state assembly member Grace Napolitano, helping the underdog put
together a campaign team, plotting strategy, and helping to raise
money. When the Democratic primary results were in, Napolitano,
Cahill, and EMILY's List had thwarted the attempt to keep the seat
in the family, 30,134 votes to 29,516.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a great part of my victory,'' Napolitano said. ``I owe
her and EMILY's List a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill calls that race one of her most satisfying victories, but
it's just one of many campaigns in which she has played an
important role.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that of Blanche L. Lincoln, who in 1998 became the
first Arkansas women elected to the US Senate without first
succeeding her husband. In 1996, there was Mary Landrieu, whose
victory in Louisiana made her that state's first female US senator.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill, in an interview before the Globe learned of her White
House appointment, said that in her experience, the West is the
most receptive region for female candidates, while the northeast is
_ gulp _ the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill knows this region well. She honed her skills working for
such Massachusetts figures as Representatives Barney Frank and Ed
Markey, former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, and former governor Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   With its two female senators, open-minded Maine helps the
region's reputation, she said, but as a whole, the cold country
lags behind much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, whenever you have an open seat, there is a
mad scramble and 15 people jump in, each of whom thinks it's their
turn,'' Cahill said. ``It's hard for women to get into that fray.''
</P>
<P>
   So what advice does Cahill have for female candidates? They must
be cash competitive and have a convincing explanation of why they
want the office.
</P>
<P>
   But women shouldn't wait their turn, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever says this is my daughter-in-law, she should be a
member of Congress,'' Cahill said dryly, referring to the
California congressional race. ``Women are too often too polite and
don't grab an opportunity when it comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although women are doing better at winning seats in Congress,
Cahill thinks a residual skepticism against women in top executive
jobs has made governorships less accessible.
</P>
<P>
   But if that bias lingers, women also have some distinct
strengths in the public's mind. Most important, she said, is that
voters often see them as more in touch with day-to-day problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When polls ask, `Who cares about people like me, who
understands what my life is like, who is more honest,' women get
extremely high ratings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And in that reputation, she said, electoral promise lies.

BRADLEY ACCENTUATES THE POSITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. _ Come, let us chart the path of Pat
Bradley's Excellent Basketball Adventure:
</P>
<P>
   St. Anthony's School
</P>
<P>
   Parlin Junior High
</P>
<P>
   Everett High School
</P>
<P>
   Swan Street Playground
</P>
<P>
   Buddies AAU
</P>
<P>
   University of (itals)Arkansas?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone had told me five or 10 years ago I'd wind up here,
I'd have said they were crazy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bradley is in the autumn of his senior year, and it is safe
to say he is beloved in these parts. ``He's been the toast of
Arkansas since he's landed on this campus,'' declares coach Nolan
Richardson. ``Pat Bradley is as respected and loved as any player
we've ever had here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fairly amazing, given his, well, you know, language
barrier. He arrived here explaining that he was a shooting god
(translation: backcourt player), and since February of his freshman
year, he's been a stottah (translation: first-string player). Once
upon a time, Joe Namath left western Pennsylvania for Alabama and
came back with a drawl. Pat Bradley left Hancock Street in Everett,
Mass., for Fayetteville nearly four years ago, and he remains only
partially decipherable to the natives. ``The accent?'' shrugs
Bradley. ``You've gotta milk it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not his accent they love as much as his jump
shot. He is averaging a solid 15 points a game and he is closing in
on the Southeastern Conference record for career 3-pointers held by
Allan Houston (would that he'd score a fraction of the latter's $8
million annual salary). He remains an indispensable man for the
Razorbacks, who, at 16-6 overall and 5-4 in the rugged SEC, are
floating right to the top of the well-known Dick Vitale ``bubble''
vis a vis the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the kids become better players when he's
scoring,'' observed Richardson following Tuesday night's 69-52
conquest of Tennessee. Bradley led the team with 18 points, and it
was his quick run of 8 points (three, three, off-balance two) early
in the second half that gave the Razorbacks a cushion they lived
off for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know that when he's not scoring, we're not very good,''
added Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Pat Bradley doing here, anyway? It happens to be a
great banquet recruiting story, and it goes something like this.
</P>
<P>
   'Twas the summer of 1994 and Nolan Richardson, fresh off a
national championship, was attending an AAU tournament in
Winston-Salem, N.C. He was there to see _ you'll love this _ Ron
Mercer. ``I went to the early game, and this kid from Boston hits
seven 3-pointers,'' Richardson recalls. ``He just had a phenomenal
game. The next day, he and Mercer were playing at the same time,
and I told my assistant, Mike Anderson, to go see Mercer because I
had to cheack out this Bradley kid again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is Pat Bradley, at this point being recruited by the
likes of Boston University, Northeastern, St. Bonaventure, and
Hartford. ``I was kind of ignorant of the whole recruiting
process,'' he explains. ``And then we all see Nolan sitting up in
the stands at this side gym. He was hard to miss. `Who's he looking
at?' everybody was saying.'' Then Bradley found out, and he
couldn't believe it. It was him.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson offered him a scholarship before his senior year.
When Bradley messed up his knee on the first day of practice before
his senior year, Nolan didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   A whole lot of people in New England thought Nolan Richardson
had lost it. Sure, Bradley could shoot, but was he athletic enough
to survive in what is generally regarded as the most athletic
conference of all? ``I wasn't worried,'' says Richardson. ``I saw
him against all those little black athletes that were quick as
hell, and he was able to get his shot off.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about defensive problems never materialized, either.
``He may not have the greatest foot speed,'' acknowledges
Richardson, ``but he has the best hands on the team and great
defensive instincts. He has more deflections than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bradley inhabits an athletic world that is almost
unimaginable in New England. He has played every home game in front
of 20,000-plus fans in spectacular Walton Arena, which has _ listen
up, Cameron Crazies _ as good an atmosphere as there is in college
basketball. What bandleader Tim Guntner does to get the most out of
his band as a crowd inspiration and true support system ought to
constitute the manual on the subject. A game at Bud Walton Arena is
an intoxicating experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every seat is filled every game,'' reports Bradley. ``People
love this program so much. Their whole week depends on how the
Razorbacks do. You feel so bad when you lose that you've let them
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, he misses the home front. There's no Alamo Roast Beef
in Fayetteville, and he's traded in Papa Gino's for Papa John's,
which is not a good exchange. But now he's conversant in bobacue
(translation: ``a hog, steer or other large animal roasted or
broiled, whole or split, over an open fire'' _ Webster's Third
International Dictionary), and he was kind enough to tout me on a
dimly lit local institution called Herman's, where, in the middle
of a superb dinner, I was entertained by a group of pregame
Razorback worshippers breaking into a hearty chant of ``Whoo, Pig
Sooey!''
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't happen at the Hilltop.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is a TV movie, wherein the lightly recruited
white kid from Boston heads to Arkansas to play for the bombastic
black coach who four years later is ready to take out the adoption
papers. ``What a pleasure he is to coach,'' says Richardson. ``I
haven't had one second's worth of problems from him in four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the life Pat Bradley envisioned for himself when he
and his friends used to play a beat-the-shot-clock game they called
``3-2-1-LB'' (after Guess Who), if only because he had no clear
vision of a college life to begin with. He never thought he'd have
tales to tell about playing in Rupp Arena or at Auburn, where ``the
fans are right on the court and you can hear everything they say
and they say just about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But life does have its funny little twists and turns, and if
Nolan Richardson hadn't just happened to see him nail all those
threes in that Winston-Salem gym, it would have been BU or the
Bonnies for Pat Bradley, not this ultra-big-time experience in this
strange culture so far from home.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bradley never planned any of it, but he sure is loving it.
``Who knew?'' he says. ``It was all a stab in the dock
(translation: when the lights are out).''

TORRES IN A HURRY TO REGAIN FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ So much was expected of Johnny Torres last
season with the New England Revolution. He was a first-round Major
League Soccer draft pick, the fourth overall, and he won the
Hermann Trophy as the best player at the collegiate level for his
efforts at Creighton.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-6-inch, 140-pound forward's major asset was speed.
But in May, Torres sprained his left ankle against D.C. United, and
that neutralized his efforts for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Torres wasted his time. ``I learned different
things you need to do, different aspects of the game, from much
more experienced players,'' said Torres, who had two goals and
three assists in 19 games (16 starts) as the Revolution went 8-20.
``Hopefully, I can apply that this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, being able to pace yourself for an entire match
instead of burning yourself out in the first 10 or 20 minutes.
Also, playing as a unit. It doesn't matter if you have all the
fighting will in the world _ if you go out and run yourself into
the ground and not play as a team, you're obviously not doing what
you're supposed to and help your team be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done a better job at possessing the ball better,
to make sure our team kept the ball, as well as slowing the game
down when we needed to slow it down, especially when we had an
advantage. Most importantly, I felt I could have put the ball in
the net a lot more than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The ankle injury was the first major health problem Torres
experienced. ``Unfortunately, it set me back a bit,'' he said. ``I
got off to an OK start. I know I could have done a lot better. For
different reasons, it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The ankle is now back to 100 percent, Torres having spent
October and November rehabilitating it before going to England in
December to play with the US Project-40 team. ``I exercised it to
strengthen it, and there were times that I ran without taping it to
make it stronger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get frustrated if your ankle doesn't respond the
way it's supposed to. All you can do is take it one day at a time.
If you get frustrated, you're only in line to fail. You may even
injure yourself further.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to take full advantage of his speed. ``I try to
stay on top of it,'' said Torres, who was born in Colombia and
adopted at age 9 by a family in Dickinson, Texas. ``Any smart human
being in whatever their field may be is going to try to use what
they do best to their advantage. Our physical training under Walter
Norton, our strength person, helps in taking off those first couple
of steps, and that's vital in the sport of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment from Division 1 college soccer to the pro game
was huge. ``It's better, although a lot of kids coming out of
college can play in the MLS,'' Torres said. ``It's definitely
another level. But it makes me very happy to come in and learn from
the players I'm playing with. They have years of experience, some
of it at the international level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a year of adjustment for me. I'm very happy and honored
that I'm able to play professional soccer in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a further adjustment this season. The Revolution
have brought in some new faces, including forwards Giovanni
Savarese and Damian Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will always be like that, no matter where you go,'' said
Torres. ``You hope to have competition for whatever position you
want to play. You prove it on the practice field. You go out and
give it 100 percent and help the team any way you can. When called
upon, you give it a good showing.''

WILL NEW-LOOK NBA BE A MUST SEE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, the NBA announced that its 204-day lockout, which
nearly had led to the cancellation of the season, was over. It
announced later that day that it would be the first sports league
to release its master schedule on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When the schedule was posted, the league recorded 449,000 visits
to its website, nba.com, breaking its single-day usage record other
than for the NBA Finals. According to league technowizards, there
also were more than 2.7 million page views that day. (In other
words, once people saw the schedule, they went to other areas on
the site. Or vice versa.)
</P>
<P>
   The only time there were more visits to the site, the league
said, was after Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, when Michael Jordan,
of the team formerly known as the world champion Bulls, hit the
winning shot against Utah, which ended the series, the season, his
career, and Chicago's run of titles.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure if the massive number of visits to the
website means there will be a concurrent number of visits to NBA
arenas after the league officially opens its truncated 1998-99
season in 12 locales. But you couldn't blame commissioner David
Stern if he decided to change the league's marketing strategy from
Madonna's ``You Must Love Me'' to Bob Seger's ``Still the Same.''
</P>
<P>
   This season will be unlike any other. Fifty games have been
compressed into 89 days. For the first time in almost two decades,
teams will have to play three games in three nights. Houston, for
instance, which has a Hall of Fame front line of 30-somethings
Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, and Hakeem Olajuwon, has a stretch
in which it plays at home, in Minnesota, and in New Jersey in three
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, what the hell were they thinking?'' Barkley said
recently. ``I know for damned sure they weren't thinking of me. I
can't play three games in three nights.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is immune from the vagaries of the schedule. The Celtics
play a Friday night game in Portland and a game in Washington on
Sunday afternoon. Yet they also have an entire week off (starting
next Wednesday) and play only one Saturday in March and April.
Denver has a stretch of eight games in 10 days, and Minnesota makes
three West Coast visits in a space of 16 days. Miami will host the
Celtics Tuesday after having played Sunday afternoon in New York
and Monday night in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule wasn't the only item of interest released Jan. 21.
Trades became allowable on that day, and that kicked off a wild
two-week flurry of player movement, resulting in the following:
</P>
<P>
   --Pippen: He re-signed with the Bulls with the knowledge that
he'd be traded to Houston, where he hopes to add a seventh ring.
</P>
<P>
   --Jordan: He called it quits again. You may see him at a golf
course near you, and surely he'll stop by Brookline this fall for
the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   --Latrell Sprewell: The man whose singular act of assault and
insubordination horrified even non-hoopsters has repented and is
with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   --Dennis Rodman: The man whose many acts of stupidity have
insulted everyone from players to Mormons is unemployed. While that
seems fitting, someone will probably call him soon.
</P>
<P>
   --Antonio McDyess took less money to go to Denver and Tom
Gugliotta took less money to go to Phoenix. While the moves are
radical in concept, neither lad is expected to suffer financially
for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   --The NBA ordered its teams to have two exhibition games and one
practice free and open to the public. Fans crashed through doors
and broke turnstiles to attend a Celtics-Raptors exhibition in
Toronto, and thousands of season ticket seats were empty when Miami
hosted Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: How soon will the league win back its
fans, assuming it has such a chore, and what will the league look
like now that Jordan, who propped it up this decade, is gone?
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seems to be that the league will prosper as
always, although perhaps not immediately. NBC, the official network
of the Bulls during the Jordan reign, has dropped Chicago like a
hot plate and now is zeroing in on the Lakers. Coaches talk of
wanting to rebuild rivalries, and one benefit of the new schedule
is that teams will play nearly all their games against conference
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that that may be a way the NBA wants to go now just
to sort of create that kind of scenario and allow the personalities
to grow out of it,'' said Miami coach Pat Riley. ``It has been a
player-driven sort of enterprise when it came to marketing over the
last four or five years, and rightfully so. I mean, how can you
argue that? The sport went to its height of popularity with that
particular approach.''
</P>
<P>
   It went to the height of its popularity largely _ some might
cyncially suggest solely _ because of Jordan. He brought the casual
viewer to the game. He seamlessly moved from Madison Street in
Chicago to Madison Avenue in New York. Television ratings were much
lower when Jordan was not featured.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one to take his place, either from a basketball
excellence standpoint or from a marketing/advertising/ratings
standpoint. No one disputes that. The league is now moving into
uncertain territory, having had one icon or another (Larry Bird,
Magic Johnson, Jordan) to highlight since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about one person,'' Stern said. ``When Larry and
Magic retired, everyone said the league was over. The person who
will follow Michael is the person whose team wins. It's an
unforgiving league.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkens, ``I think the focus has to be
on teams, just like in the NFL. It's more the team, and certainly
the stars will rise to the top. But we need to sell basketball. And
in selling basketball, I think there will be a lot of teams that
all of a sudden are going to emerge. Michael was great for our
league, but the league will survive, and it will survive when all
of us are gone. I think, let the stars emerge. Whomever emerges as
the torchbearers, let them emerge on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that rivalries might help revive fan interest is
intriguing but probably unrealistic. Rivalries, to the extent they
can exist now, are in place in many areas already. And next season,
when the schedule goes back to 82 games, we'll see less conference
play, not more.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and New York already have a built-in rivalry based on the
mutual antipathy generated by Riley's controversial departure from
the Knicks. Indiana and the Knicks also have a rivlary of sorts,
punctuated by Reggie Miller's periodic outbursts in Madison Square
Garden. The Knicks and Nets may even develop something this season,
especially if New Jersey plays to preseason expectations. Out West,
there is Jazz-Lakers, something that has surfaced in the last
couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing to compare to the Celtics-Lakers of the
1960s or the '80s. Maybe a Celtics resurgence will come in time to
foster a third showing in the next century. The Boston-Philadelphia
rivalry in the '60s and '80s was almost malevolent. All they have
in common now is two coaches who were courted by Paul Gaston.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months, fans will have more than a passing
opportunity to get reacquainted with the NBA. There will be games
every night, plenty of television, and as Seattle coach Paul
Westphal noted, ``What are the fans going to do when they're
flipping around the dial, stop at `Three's Company' instead of
Sonics-Lakers? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still the best basketball on the planet, even if the
conditions aren't the greatest. It's still the best players on the
planet, even if the best of all no longer is interested and many
are in midsummer shape. It's still the best globally marketed sport
in the world, and to paraphrase John McKay, there are millions of
Chinese who do care if there is an NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball didn't leave,'' Milwaukee coach George Karl said.
``What I think is that while we didn't have the NBA, we found that
the foundation of basketball is the NBA. The great players, the
great coaching, the great competition . . . I still think the
competitive nature of the professional athlete is the foundation of
where everybody wants to be, where everybody is going towards, and
what the league has to do is just go play and show some positive
enthusiasm for the game.''

CAPITOL OF SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If truth is the first casualty in war, then dignity was the
first principle to keel over in the dirty little war that has
neutered our national government, degraded political debate, and
cheapened journalism.
</P>
<P>
   No one has escaped degradation in this dreary affair that turned
desperate. Spawned as a tawdry if unconsummated sexual tryst, it
spiraled out of control into a dreadful partisan wrangle that
demeans everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Our sonorous solons, drawn to kleig lights as moths to the
flame, have lost every bit as much dignity as our president, who
has not so much been defrocked as de-pantsed. His political
enemies, in courts of law and courts of public opinion, have used
brute political force to open his mail, scrutinize his phone logs,
sniff out who and where he was with at all hours of day and night.
They have browbeat his bodyguards, harassed his friends, isolated
his family, done everything but eviscerate First Dog Buddy. And
still they can't nail Buddy's master.
</P>
<P>
   The House disgraced itself the more it tried to further disgrace
Clinton after he disgraced himself. That daisy chain of disgrace is
now brazed onto the Senate's swiftly sinking reputation. For all
the prating and posing, our 100 self-satisfied senators now suffer
the same unmasking the House brought upon itself. As they used to
say on TV: ``You asked for it!''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, both branches, is an archaic collection of political
hacks and partisan ambushers, collectively revealed to be smaller
men and smaller women than have trod the marbled halls of yore.
Petty, prurient, partisan, and past it, as far as providing much in
the way of principled leadership in the Capitol cesspool.
</P>
<P>
   How can any of us take them seriously after this year-long
symphony of bathos? The polls track unrelenting disgust. Click on
C-SPAN at any hour, and there are our elected officials,
self-importance oozing from pancake makeup, dribbling their drivel
into bottomless microphones. They blather about Social Security,
medical insurance, the defense budget, this or that _ yet they act
not.
</P>
<P>
   They read cue-carded questions prepared by $90,000-a-year
staffers and badger sullen bureaucrats sent before their silly
committees before preordained votes dictated by party leaders
render the whole business pointless.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, as well as the network jesters who play straight
man in this dumb show, make themselves much less relevant to the
daily life of America. No doubt most of these clucks and claghorns
will be reelected; that is the way of politics, when incumbency
generates a 98 percent reelection rate thanks to the corrupt
campaign contribution scam. We have to put up with them in office.
We have to put up with them on TV. But we don't have to take them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator Robert Byrd, the dyspeptic West Virginia
octogenarian regarded as the Senate's reigning keeper of the
constitutional flame, concludes that Clinton lied under oath, but
that is insufficient cause to expel him. So Byrd offered his
dismissal motion, only to see it rebuffed by a united Republican
front.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, tossing in
the crying towel in a New York Times op-ed. In a rare burst of
candor from the majority lynch mob, Hatch confesses: ``The Senate
does not have the votes to convict the president . . . '' Way to
go, Orrin. The obvious finally intrudes. Hatch and his seatmate,
the dour Robert Bennett, another Republican with glare most baleful
when it comes to Clinton, have enjoyed unprecedented face time on
TV. The wholesale bribery practiced by the Salt Lake City
establishment upon eager Olympic bribees does not trigger their
selective wrath. But Clinton's Olympian efforts to disguise his
gymnastic contortions with Monica render said senators apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick du jour is now the ``finding of fact'' ploy, a
weasel-way-out fashioned by the two Maine Republicans, Senators
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins. These ladies, apparently convinced
that a majority of their constituents will not countenance a vote
to convict, came up with a hybrid scheme, a half-a-loaf. Though it
is nowhere in the Constitution, the Finders Sisters propose that
the Senate find Clinton guilty ``on the facts,'' then let him stay
in office because they know they can't muster 67 votes to banish
him.
</P>
<P>
   This is the jury winking that the accused is guilty, but we
can't convict him because of the inconvenient way in which the
Founders wrote the rules. It is a cheesy way for senators to
retreat with cover. They seek to flee a disgraceful mess they
blundered into with the same fatal mixture of arrogance and
self-interest that plunged Clinton into the morass first.
</P>
<P>
   The senators waddled into this swamp knowing what malodorous
gases they would be breathing. Now they seek to slink out using any
shabby face-saving gimmick they can concoct. In the way they got
into it, conducted it, and now seek to flee from it, they lose our
respect and esteem.

ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, IT'S AN OFF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anything is clear this season, it's that there is a paucity
of great teams and maybe not even an overwhelming number of good
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people have been praising the Big Ten. Why? The league
is competitive top to bottom, as much as it has been in many years.
But that does not make it a great league. Where are the great
teams? Or even the very good ones?
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State? Maybe. The Spartans appear a better fit in the
``very good'' department. After that, it's Parity Central, with
home court accounting for the edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Coast Conference is not much better. Right now only
Duke, North Carolina, and Maryland are locks for the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that? Who knows? Everyone else is a bubble team at best.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic 10? Even worse. No one seems to be any good. Only
four teams are even above .500.
</P>
<P>
   You can go throughout the major conferences and pick and choose.
The bottom line is that filling the tournament with 64 quality
teams might be a chore, especially when you get down to the 60-64
slots.
</P>
<P>
   All this is good news for the teams from the mid-major
conferences, who for years would land only the league tournament
champion in the NCAA field.
</P>
<P>
   This year there might be some wiggle room for the leaders, even
if upsets occur during league championship week.
</P>
<P>
   Teams like the College of Charleston, Siena, Gonzaga, Murray
State, Miami (Ohio), and Toledo can probably start to make NCAA
plans now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Huskies hurting
</P>
<P>
   Memo to all you University of Connecticut fans fretting over the
Huskies' first loss of the season Monday night:
</P>
<P>
   Chill out.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the end of the world. Realistically, the Huskies didn't
figure to run the table, and now some of the pressure has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the defeat, however, was another matter. Suddenly,
the Huskies were limping around. Center Jake Voskuhl was in Houston
earlier this week checking out what was thought to be a stress
fracture of his left foot. Thankfully for the Huskies, it's only a
bruise, and Voskuhl might play against Stanford Saturday afternoon
in Palo Alto, Calif. Forward Richard Hamilton's status is also
questionable because of a contusion on his right thigh. And guard
Khalid El-Amin is still trying to regain full speed following a
pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Beating Stanford will be an upset now. And retaining the No. 1
seed in the East is also a question mark, given Duke's status as
virtually unbeatable, its pounding of Maryland Wednesday night the
latest example.
</P>
<P>
   As Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski pointed out, the designated
natural NCAA region for the Big East and the ACC is the East, which
means Duke (barring a collapse) would be the No. 1 seed and play
its first- and second-round games in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   UConn will have to really fall apart to tumble from a No. 1
seed. The best bet right now would seem to be that the Huskies will
be the No. 1 seed in the South, with first- and second-round games
in either Orlando or Indianapolis, which wouldn't be the worst
thing to happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, beating Stanford has now become crucial, for
several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries are one thing. The Huskies must adjust to them. And
they can do that. More important is the nature of the game the
Huskies play against the Cardinal. UConn came out flat in the loss
to Syracuse, much to the disgust of coach Jim Calhoun, who can
handle losing (barely) but will not tolerate a lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Right now UConn (South), Duke (East), Stanford (West), and
Cincinnati (Midwest) look like solid No. 1 seeds. Maryland's losses
to Wake Forest and Duke this week hurt the Terps' chances for a No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery team remains Auburn, which has lost only once (at
Kentucky) and no one has been able to figure out yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Replacement games
</P>
<P>
   Word out of Duke is that Krzyzewski, who is scheduled for hip
replacement surgery after the season, is in so much pain that some
folks think he should have it done sooner rather than later. Don't
count on Coach K heeding that advice without a fight, however. The
Blue Devils look like the best bet for a Final Four berth in St.
Petersburg. And just in case you think they can't get much better,
check out the USA Select Junior National Team. Three of the 11
players have committed to Duke . . . Hot rumor is that former St.
John's coach Fran Fraschilla is on the short list to replace Ralph
Willard at Pittsburgh. The two men are buddies . . . It's been a
tough year for coaches and point guards. In New England, we've had
the Dennis Wolff-LeVar Folk and Bruiser Flint-Charlton Clarke
problems at Boston University and the University of Massachusetts,
respectively. Now it seems that Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker and
point guard Shaheen Holloway are barely in the same book, much less
on the same page . . . BU and UMass are talking about scheduling a
game against each other . . . Look for Delaware coach Mike Brey to
become the hot candidate when vacancies start popping up later this
winter. Right now Pittsburgh and Iowa are the prime openings . . .
Monday night marked the first time Syracuse ever beat a No. 1 team
. . . Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim continues to work wonders without
much fanfare. The Orangemen are on pace to win their usual 20
games. Can someone tell me what's wrong with that and why Boeheim
doesn't get the credit he deserves? No, they aren't going to the
Final Four every year or even every three or four years, but they
are a competitive team every season . . . If you want a sleeper
team, look out for Texas. Rick Barnes has the Longhorns on a roll
and has a nice combination of size and speed. In 7-foot center
Chris Mihm, Texas has a player who can score from the low post and
outside. As Flint said after Mihm posted a double-double and helped
the Longhorns beat the Minutemen Sunday in Austin, ``He's going to
make a lot of money (playing basketball).'' . . . One NBA scout who
has spent the past three months on the college circuit says the
team he would least want to play on any given night is Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Utah on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Utah, given up for dead after a slow December, has won 12
straight, including a 57-39 rout at New Mexico Monday night . . .
Much has been written and said about how Boston College went from
an NCAA tournament team to a Big East cellar dweller (although the
way the Eagles have played recently, one wonders for how long), but
what about a team like Monmouth? Two years ago, Monmouth was a
reasonable mid-major school. Now it's 1-19 and battling Sacramento
State to see who's the worst of the worst in Division 1 . . . St.
John's had better figure out a way to win some close games.
Wednesday night's 73-70 loss to Miami at Madison Square Garden was
the latest example. Saying that they gave a nice effort against
quality teams, as the Red Storm have proclaimed after narrow losses
to Purdue, UConn, Duke, and Miami (twice), no longer has any
meaning. If St. John's is to be a force in March, it needs to close
out some tight games instead of letting them get away . . .
Temple's Rasheed Brokenborough, who was unable to play as a
freshman because he didn't qualify under the NCAA's initial
eligibility rules but is on track to graduate this year on time,
was denied a fourth year of eligibility by the NCAA . . . Now that
South Carolina has fallen off the map in NCAA tournament terms,
wonder if Gamecocks coach Eddie Fogler has second thoughts about
turning down Rutgers a few years ago, especially since the Knights
under Kevin Bannon have become a respectable team and should
continue to improve.

PUTNAM A SUCCESS FOR PARENT, LASSER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Lasser is chief executive of Putnam Investments, the
second-largest investment firm in Boston with $303 billion under
management. Lasser talked about Putnam and the mutual fund industry
with Globe financial columnist Steven Syre Thursday. The following
is an edited version of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think your parent firm, insurance brokerage Marsh &AMP;
McLennan Cos., would sell Putnam or spin it out to take advantage
of the high valuations for investment firms?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're asking me to predict, I think the prediction is
that Putnam will be just the way it is. Putnam has been quite a
success for Marsh &AMP; McLennan _ you might want to say despite Marsh
&AMP; McLennan. I suppose somebody could say because of Marsh &AMP;
McLennan. Contrast us to some of these other acquired companies,
including some that haven't worked out so well right here in Boston
like The Boston Co. and the departures from that firm. People in
Putnam are pleased with the arrangements they have and obviously
our shareholder is pleased.
</P>
<P>
   It's right to say Putnam is a division of Marsh &AMP; McLennan, but
another way to say it is that some of Marsh &AMP; McLennan's other
businesses are mathematically divisions of Putnam. If we're half
the company's earnings, we're probably more than half the company's
valuation, maybe significantly more. I think it's right to say it
ain't broken and therefore there's not a lot of initiative out
there to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about a partial spinout of Putnam, which might create a
higher value and allow Marsh McLennan to retain control?
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree with that as applied to most outside models. One
problem with that is there is a big tax issue. Marsh &AMP; McLennan's
cost of Putnam was quite small. They paid $30 million. I think the
valuation has been written up in some ways but it's still (only)
$100 million. So if Putnam was spun off and valued at $6 billion,
or $7 billion or $8 billion, that would be a taxable event under
some circumstances. That would be a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Putnam's was known for its outstanding bond department, but
performance has declined badly. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A. The way you buy stocks is just about the way you did it 30
years ago. But the fixed income business has been literally
transformed. In the last 10 years, at Harvard, MIT, Chicago,
Dartmouth, and other places, whole new theories of risk and
valuation have been developed. In a sad nutshell, we were doing our
thing the way we did it 10 years ago and we have not kept up with
the very best firms. We made a senior management change in the form
of Tim Ferguson taking over that part of our business from its
longtime head. We hired a new number two person from Swissbank.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you believe that solved the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. We had an outstanding fourth quarter and January. Does that
make a change? Of course not. All I can tell you is the experience
we have. We got a new guy in middle of the year, he put a game plan
together and we've had a lot of change in personnel. We have a new
approach to doing this which is not entirely original. We borrowed
a lot from Wall Street, where the best fixed-income work is being
done. We've taken people, techniques, and systems from there. We
want to be a premier fixed-income manager and it's just not a
compromisable objective, period. The early indications are
gratifying, but they are only indications.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the last year or two, Vanguard Group has come to dominate
the stock portion of the mutual fund industry. What does that say?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't use ``dominate the business'' as the phrase, but I
certainly admire, even envy, all the new business Vanguard has
done. I think it's a direct reflection of the character of the
market in the last two years _ emphasize big-cap stocks, and if you
owned the big-cap stocks for most of the time, you had outstanding
performance. That's what you've got with the index fund. Vanguard's
business did not only come from their index fund, but it certainly
was the dominant category within their overall mix.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At least one firm that rates aggregate stock fund performance
at the 10 largest investment companies places Putnam in roughly the
third quarter of the field over the last two years. Do you think
that's accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I don't. It's very hard to measure performance across a
complex. They do it on a weighted (by asset size) basis. We measure
how each of our funds performed within their peer groups. What were
the proportions in the first quartile, second, third, which is not
weighted. We had concerns going into the fourth quarter (of 1998),
because the third quarter hurt the business. But we had dramatic
outperformance in the fourth quarter and we ended the year with
virtually all our equity funds comfortably in the top half, many in
the top quartile. We think we had a better year than we had in
1997, not as good a year as we had in 1996. So on an internal
basis, we were very happy with our equity performance.
</P>
<P>
   In another trend, stock fund investors no longer seem to be as
optimstic in declining markets. People didn't buy on the dip last
year, they went to money markets.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably good, I think, because markets don't recover
on every dip. In retrospect, it's OK to call August, September, and
October a dip. But it didn't look like a dip when we were in it, it
looked like the end. I think people were genuinely frightened and
some were frightened back into reality, that it is difficult at all
times to do well and that investment success is not measured in how
much you make, but how much you make in relation to how much risk
you take. Sadly there seems to be a category of the market that has
forgotten the experience, as it applies to these Internet stocks.
How can anything be more fun than to buy a stock and watch it go up
25 percent in a day? People actually think that's what investing
is.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think about the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A. We think it is absolutely revolutionary and will probably
have, over time, the impact forecast of it. That's not the same as
saying the handful of names known today, EBay, Amazon.com, ETrade,
are going to be the Sears Roebucks or Merrill Lynchs five years
from now or even 10. There are many ways to take advantage of the
changes in the Internet, including equipment makers and
conventional companies that have their businesses enhanced as a
consequence of this.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is envious of the money being made in these stocks.
Everybody is also very clear that it is a catastrophe, company by
company, waiting to happen. It's not unlike biotechnology. You knew
biotechnology was real and that companies were going to succeed.
You just didnt know which ones. For every 10 biotechnology
companies, probably one was a survivor.

FORESIGHT HELPS GROW AN INVESTMENT TO $1 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 7, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I read somewhere that $1,000 invested at compound interest at
birth would result in close to $1 million at some point in the
foreseeable future. I am interested in investing for each of my
grandchildren, ages three, six, seven and seven and a half, in some
vehicle to assist in their college or later life. What do you
suggest I might buy and forget about for 15 or 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   L.C., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, whether a $1,000 investment will grow to $1 million
within the foreseeable future depends on the degree of your
foresight. If your investment earned average 10 percent returns,
you d have to look ahead 72.3 years; if the returns were only 8
percent, it would require 89.7 years, which takes a lot of
foresight. (Worse, those figures don t take taxes into effect, and
unless the money is in some kind of tax-deferred account, Uncle Sam
would likely take a bite big enough to slow the progress beyond a
predictable human viewpoint.)
</P>
<P>
   If you re really looking for an invest-and-forget investment,
there s only one sensible answer -- index funds. These are designed
to simply track some particular predefined segment of the markets,
most typically the Standard and Poor s 500 Index (of common stocks)
or the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. The popularity of
index funds has spawned dozens of variants that track various
segments of the markets, but in the end the idea is the same -- the
results will depend on the overall strength of the markets rather
than the talents of a manager or a management team, which, of
course, may change over time.
</P>
<P>
   They're also popular because it s not expensive to run an index
fund -- the management is less art than science, so the indexers
start with a built-in advantage over the expensive management
teams. Because of such inherent low costs and its own penchant for
penny- pinching, Vanguard Group has become pretty much the
undisputed leader of the indexers, with more than a dozen funds
tracking various indexes or combinations of indexes.
</P>
<P>
   So the question becomes which index? There is an element of
conflict in your question -- beginning with that seventy- or
eighty-year program of accumulation, and then shortening your view
to a 15-to-20 year time horizon. And if the funds were to be used
for education, in the case of the elder children you re even
looking at 10 years or maybe even less. The appropriate fund
depends on the time horizon. If you're chasing that $1 million
star, there's no question that the granddaddy of the index funds --
Vanguard Index 500 -- is the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   This fund simply tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index. (You
can also buy substantially the same thing on the American Stock
Exchange with a security called Spiders, for Standard &AMP; Poor's
Depository Receipts; I have pored over the prospectus for Spiders,
and cannot glean their advantage over a fund; on the other hand, I
can't see any substantial disadvantage for the long-term owner.)
</P>
<P>
   If you re looking shorter, but still toward the long-end of that
15-to-20-year time frame, Index 500 is probably still your best
bet. (A $1,000 investment would grow to $6,727 over 20 years if you
achieved average 10 percent returns, and that might be a nice
leg-up on the down payment for a first-time residential purchase.)
</P>
<P>
   But if you think the money would most likely be used for
educational expenses, I d go with a more conservative index -- the
Vanguard Balanced Index, which puts 60 percent of its assets to
work tracking a broad stock index and the rest is designed to track
the general bond market. If you were to take this track, you might
consider funding an Education IRA account for each of the children.
This would limit your investment to $500 per year per child, but it
would shelter the account from taxation while it accumulates, and
there would be no taxes due at all if the funds were used for
post-secondary educational costs. (It s true that savings for
college in the student s name tends to reduce eligibility for
student aid, but if you re going to give this money to the children
anyway, the disadvantage would exist whether you chose en Education
IRA or another vehicle.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband is 42 years old with $283,000 in his retirement
plan which is invested in a diverse array of mutual funds,
including a 6 percent position in a money market fund. It s
designed as a portfolio for an aggressive investor who hopes to
retire in 20 years, with $30,000 a year added to the account. Will
we have enough to retire at age 62? By the way, I used to like the
Kaufmann fund (as you did) and have a $25,000 college fund invested
there. What happened to it?
</P>
<P>
   M.C., Rockport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although I m still a holder of Kaufmann fund shares, at this
point I m about as unenthusiastic as you sound. I think its major
problems are elephantiasis, and perhaps a loss of focus. The former
is tied to its massive asset base -- $4.6 billion, which is pretty
heavy baggage to tote around in the small-cap arena. The modest
asset base which allowed its management team to make their decisive
and profitable strikes during the fun s salad years is now a
burden, and the portfolio is swelled with 300 to 400 stocks.
Moreover, it seems to me that a disproportionate amount of energy
may be spent on marketing the fund and, if press accounts are
accurate, shopping the management company around. You have to look
back to five years to find the fund looking good. Morningstar
Mutual Funds reports five-year average annual returns of 15.38
percent, comparing to a 12.34 percent average for the small cap
growth category. But over three years, the average annual return of
11.08 percent trails the peer average of 11.66 percent, and from
there the numbers get worse, such as the one-year return of 0.72
percent, training a peer average of 5.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I do expect the small-cap arena to recover from its years of
doldrums, but it seems to me unlikely that Kaufmann will be a
leader unless or until it sheds a lot of its excess poundage.
(Closing the fund to new investors would be a good start.) If the
child or children for whose college expense you ve been saving this
money are eight years old or older, I suggest you make a switch --
not only out of Kaufmann, but out of the small-term growth category
as well. A good blended fund, such as Fidelity Puritan or Vanguard
Balanced Index, both of which your husband holds, would strike me
as solid alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   But I do agree with the idea that I m reading between the lines
of your letter -- that the 6 percent of your husband s retirement
account that s now loafing in the money markets might well go into
a small-cap fund. Since Vanguard is one of the fund families he s
already using, why not divert it to Vanguard Small-Cap Index?
</P>
<P>
   Will you have enough to retire when your husband s 62. Probably,
but I'm not sure. If your husband can afford to save $30,000 a year
for retirement, my guess is that you're used to a pretty
comfortable income level. So you'll have to determine whether a
retirement pool of $3,701,496 is likely to do the trick; that's the
projected accumulation based on continuing contributions of $2,500
a month and average 10 percent investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   (Incidentally, with such a large projected accumulation, why not
divert some of the ongoing savings into Roth IRAs, so you can
balance some of the tax-deferred retirement money with tax-free
savings which will give you more flexibility in managing your tax
liabilities during retirement?)

BOORMAN'S FILM A FOUR-STAR `GENERAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GENERAL 
Directed and written by: John Boorman 
Starring: Brendan Gleeson, Adrian Dunbar, Sean McGinley, Maria
Doyle Kennedy, Angeline Ball, Jon Voight 
Rated: R (violence and pervasive language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like all really original films, John Boorman's ``The General''
is simultaneously entertaining and startlingly audacious. From its
shimmery wide-screen black-and-white iconography to the robust bull
at its center, it dips into archetypal antecedents and morphs them
into new combinations. The film had its genesis when Boorman got a
gold record for the score of his film ``Deliverance,'' and it was
stolen shortly afterward from his Dublin home by a career criminal
and local legend named Martin Cahill. What Cahill didn't know was
that the record, like so much from Hollywood, was only gold-plated.
What Boorman knew was that as a dramatic subject Cahill was solid
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' leaves no doubt that Boorman got much the better
of the exchange. Although Cahill cut a wide swath through Dublin,
becoming a folk hero for making monkeys of the police for years,
his life ended abruptly when he ran afoul of the IRA and was
assassinated in 1994 after refusing to cut them in on the proceeds
of a big jewel heist. But until then, he had a long and sometimes
dazzling run. Riding the anti-authoritarian sentiments of his
Dublin neighborhood, Cahill brings enough cocky style and roguish
charm to his larcenous pursuits to be regarded as a folk hero. It's
an image he fosters by his stubborn squatting on the site of his
demolished council block until the authorities cave in and give him
the new apartment he wants.
</P>
<P>
   The film will make a star of Brendan Gleeson, and should. His
beefy vivacity and nimble-witted way of making the police _
especially the career cop played by Jon Voight _ look foolish,
never altogether conceal Cahill's fundamental viciousness. He plays
to the gallery, but rules by fear, much like a latter-day
incarnation of an ancient tribal chieftain. In a fit of paranoia,
he nails the hand of an underling to a pool table. He's a solid
family man by his own definition, which stretches to include a
menage a trois with his wife's sister as his mistress. The reason
these domestic scenes work, or at least don't work against him, is
that Maria Doyle Kennedy and Angeline Bell are strong women who
never seem to be doormats.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson comes up with the season's most indelible bit of
business, too, repeatedly shielding his face with his hand. Whether
it's a subconscious concealing of guilt or conscious deflection of
scrutiny is never made clear, contributing to a sense of mystery
that makes ``The General'' so much more than just another gangster
movie. Either way, he convinces us that Cahill knew the importance
of showing the public a good time. Unless, of course, this or that
member of it happened to be one of his victims. His way of lording
it over his manor with calculated panache peaks when he banks the
money he needs to buy a house, then has his gang rob the bank after
the draft has cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill's sly pyrotechnics are an analogue for the film itself.
It's a stylish throwback to the heady cartwheeling energies of
Boorman's early films. (Check out Boorman's 1967 ``Point Blank,''
alongside which the new Mel Gibson remake, ``Payback,'' seems so
mechanical.) The rightness in all of the performances allows for
numerous grace notes from the perfectly tuned ensemble, which
includes Eamonn Owens of ``The Butcher Boy'' as young Cahill.
Gleeson and Boorman have enough integrity to never allow Cahill's
disarming prankishness to obscure his psychopathic side. But the
success of the film, the reason it's one of the year's best and
most exhilarating to watch, is Boorman's ability to bring to the
filmmaking process the same confident savvy and verve that Gleeson
brings to Cahill's life of ruthless crime he presented as a branch
of showmanship.

<TEXT>
<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan lies clinically dead in an Amman
hospital, having succumbed to his toughest enemy, cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families.
</P>
<P>
   True, we were happy to see King Farouk booted out of Egypt and
King Idris out of Libya (we liked Qaddafi then) and to depose the
Sultan of Oman in favor of his public-school son. But we want
strong leaders who will be loyal to us. Let them have human rights,
we say. But we do not want democracy in their countries (which
means, of course, that there will be no human rights).
</P>
<P>
   And no choice for their people. At least King Hussein had the
wisdom and humility to discuss death with his people when he first
learned he had cancer. But the king _ whose kingdom falls into the
category of liberal amid the other xenophobic states of the region
_ never bothered to consult his citizens about their future leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians were given no chance to decide whom they wished to
rule them. His Majesty ordained that it would be his son Abdullah,
that power would be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone expect anything else? It takes a brave Jordanian to
call for a real constitutional monarchy. Indeed, the only man who
consistently does just that, Leith Shubeilat, finds himself
frequently inside Amman's state security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the titans of the Middle East have planned
their succession.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad _ whose energy still stuns the diplomats who sit
through his six-hour conversations _ has groomed his son Bashar, an
ophthalmologist by profession but an increasingly public
personality with an enthusiasm for computer technology, to follow
in his steps.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Taken at face value, Syria's constitution provides for a
democratic system of succession, but Assad controls military,
political, and legislative power; he can dissolve governments and
assemblies; he is secretary-general of the Baath party, commander
in chief of the armed forces. Presumably, Bashar Assad will one day
do the same.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   What about Arafat? He has no obvious successor and no real
constitutional framework to create one. He has turned his back on
the democracy of the Palestinian assembly and survives by cronyism,
bribes and 13 different security services _ the latter in
cooperation with the CIA and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians cannot choose their successor. But be sure
that the Israelis already have someone in mind to take over
``Palestine'' when Arafat leaves us.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, direct succession suggests a struggle to come
among the defense minister, Prince Sultan, Prince Naif and Crown
Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, aware of Abdullah's growing criticism and dislike of
the American presence in the Gulf _ he is said to have told U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen that not only could the United
States not use Saudi air bases to bomb Iraq, but that America might
have to leave those air bases altogether _ might favor Prince
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   His son, it should be noted, is the influential Saudi ambassador
to the U.S., Prince Bandar, who in 1990 was reported in Washington
to be almost as powerful in President George Bush's office as the
secretary of state, James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The result of our support for all these potentates is regularly
distorted by their Western supporters in Washington, London and,
less obviously, Paris. If we demand full democracy for these
nations, we are told, the Islamists will try to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Cannot we understand, our diplomats point out, that ``whatever
their failings'' (another of my favorite expressions in the Middle
East), these ``friends of the West'' are fighting Islamic
fundamentalism?
</P>
<P>
   So ``Islamic fundamentalism'' becomes the only real opposition
to the Arab governments. We support those undemocratic countries in
their battle against ``fundamentalist terror'' _ and shore up their
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that why we backed Saddam Hussein so generously during
his eight-year aggression against Iran? Because he was preventing
``fundamentalism?''
</P>
<P>
   So who will we put in Saddam's place? My guess is that the
Americans are still looking for a good old-fashioned Iraqi
brigadier-general, a military man who knows how to keep his tribes
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it would have to be a powerful man, someone who
did not allow dissent to rock the regime, someone with a powerful
security service and a family that might provide a successor.
Someone, in fact, just like Saddam.  &LR;  &QL;

 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jacques Zoon has been walking to work lately, because
his reclining bike was stolen during the few minutes it took the
Boston Symphony Orchestra's principal flutist to run into a store
and buy a bagel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was locked,'' the Dutch flutist says, ``but they carried
away the whole thing. Now I've ordered a new bike; you row it like
a boat _ it's a fitness machine on wheels. I'm very excited because
I will have it in three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The bike won't be here in time for this weekend's Boston
Symphony concerts, but Zoon may not walk. After all, he's the
soloist, in Mozart's Flute Concerto In G, his first solo gig with
the orchestra. Anticipation runs high, because Zoon has won many
admirers since he accepted the job as principal flute two years
ago, bringing to a close a search process for a successor to Doriot
Anthony Dwyer that lasted the better part of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Zoon's father was an engineer who designed tools for the steel
industry and who played instruments for fun. ``Back before
television came, he would play for gatherings in the
neighborhood.'' Zoon's mother had her hands full with a large
family _ Zoon (pronounced zone) was one of 10 children. ``Now that
all the kids have left, my mother is living a second life, learning
French and English, and working in her garden. She got her first
driver's license when she was 60 and she's coming to the concerts.
Now she has 25 grandchildren _ I'm the only one in the family not
to have children yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 37, Zoon was 9 when he started taking flute lessons. ``It
was my own idea. I had heard the flute and I liked the sound. There
was an instrument parade in the school, and I chose the flute. A
neighbor who is a year older began along with me, but he didn't
have the same talent. But at the beginning, we used to play
together. He stopped after a few months; his mother got angry
because she thought our teacher was preferring me. But we became
friends again after he took up percussion!''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 Zoon started playing second flute in an amateur orchestra
of adult musicians. ``We played all the symphonic repertory and the
choral pieces, the Bach oratorios. It was a great opportunity to
learn the music, and we worked with wonderful soloists. My first
teacher, and the most important, was Louise van ter Tholen, who had
studied with the principal flutist of the Concertgebouw.'' At the
Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam, Zoon studied with Koos
Verheul, the principal flute of the Residentie Orchestra of The
Hague, and with Harrie Starreveld of the Concertgebouw. Zoon's
career began in the Amsterdam Philharmonic, where he played for one
year; for four years he played in the Residentie Orchestra under
Hans Vonk before joining the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under
Riccardo Chailly; he served as principal flute from 1988 to 1994.
For nine years, beginning in 1989, Zoon also played with the
Chamber Orchestra of Europe; with that ensemble he made his first
trip to America in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Zoon left the Concertgebouw because he found it ``very difficult
to play full time in an orchestra _ there was never enough time to
do other things. So I decided to go to Indiana University, where my
wife was also teaching.'' Zoon is married to the French cellist
Iseut Chuat. ``We played together in the European Youth Orchestra,
and I met her when we were on a tour to China,'' Zoon says.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go to Indiana coincided with Zoon's initial
decision to turn down the BSO's offer; there were dark faces in
Symphony Hall when the fax arrived announcing that Zoon had
declined the job. ``My wife and I found, however, that we were both
traveling so much that we hardly ever saw each other. Under such
circumstances, trying to start a fmaily was not possible. We liked
the idea of living in a big city, and in America, Boston is the
best city to live in. The orchestra offered me a very good
situation, which allows me time for solo work and teaching, and
other things I need to do in order to maintain a healthy musical
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuat is now teaching at the Longy School of Music, Boston
University, and the New England Conservatory; she will make her
local recital debut at Longy on Feb. 21. ``She will play with (BSO
concertmaster) Malcolm Lowe and pianist Victor Rosenbaum. It is a
very interesting program and I can recommend it absolutely. . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   Zoon said that before he came to audition, he had never heard
the BSO, except on recordings. ``What I found when I came to play
was that this orchestra plays with the refinement characteristic of
European orchestras; it is a very flexible orchestra.'' Zoon met
his illustrious predecessor not in Boston but in Chicago, where
they were both serving on the jury of a competition. ``We had a
good time. She has such a spirit, and always she has the great
stories about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoon's most visible ``signature'' is his wooden flute, which
contributes a distinctive timbre to the orchestra. Zoon talks
animatedly and at length about his instrument, but maintains that
``less than 5%'' of the sound of his playing is the result of the
wooden flute. ``The way you blow,'' he says, ``is more important
than the material the flute is made of. If I were to play a silver
flute or a good platinum flute, you would still be able to
recognize my sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my first wooden flute when I was still playing in The
Hague,'' Zoon says. ``I never used it because it didn't work very
well. When I was in Amsterdam I began experimenting with different
head joints and grew more and more attached to the color of the
wooden flute. That was in 1988; with a few years I had grown
entirely convinced. It makes for a nice blend with the other
instruments _ the top register sounds more like a clarinet _ and it
was very well received by my colleagues. It is a very interesting
sound that creates attention _ the ear comes to the sound as well
as the sound going to the ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoon discounts the difficulty of playing a wooden flute in tune.
``Faulty intonation has more to do with your ears than with your
instruments. It does take a lot of energy to play in tune. The more
accurate your instrument, the less energy you have to use on
playing in tune, and you can use it for other things. My hobby is
to make flutes, and I am always working to improve the flute. Right
now I am working with Haynes Flutes and we have developed a
prototype for my flute, and they are starting to make more of them
_ I have not the time to make flutes for other people myself. My
present flute is an old French instrument from about 1900, with a
new head joint that I made myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoon and Seiji Ozawa arrived at the choice of the Mozart
concerto because they wanted something ``famous and beautiful.''
``At first I wanted to play a contemporary concerto, the one by
Sofia Gubaidulina, but then we felt it might be better to begin
with the Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Zoon says he is very happy in Boston and in the orchestra. ``So
far it has been wonderful; people have been so welcoming. I love
Tanglewood, although at first I was a little bothered by people out
on the lawn eating and coming in and out. This is a very different
ambience from anything I had been used to. But why not? Next year
the people who were eating on the lawn may be coming inside. The
acoustics are amazingly good in the Shed, and the amplification on
the lawn is very well done. I haven't played in Ozawa Hall yet, but
it is beautiful, and I can't wait to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other musicians in the orchestra, Zoon was astonished
at the attack on the level of its playing that appeared in The Wall
Street Journal late last year. ``I was really surprised at this; it
seemed so unfair. No orchestra sounds every week the same _ it
depends on so many factors and on so many different individuals. I
find it particularly terrible that Seiji Ozawa has been so
misjudged. He is always listening and reacting to what he hears; he
is always really communicating with the orchestra. Other conductors
have such strong ideas about the pieces they are leading that they
never listen to what is actually coming out of the musicians. I
find that the Concertgebouw and the BSO are very similar in
culture. Of course there are differences because different people
are there, but the orchestras are somehow the same _ there is
something prestigious in the sound that gives it its special
character, something golden.''

<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan lies clinically dead in an Amman
hospital, having succumbed to his toughest enemy, cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families.
</P>
<P>
   True, we were happy to see King Farouk booted out of Egypt and
King Idris out of Libya (we liked Qaddafi then) and to depose the
Sultan of Oman in favor of his public-school son. But we want
strong leaders who will be loyal to us. Let them have human rights,
we say. But we do not want democracy in their countries (which
means, of course, that there will be no human rights).
</P>
<P>
   And no choice for their people. At least King Hussein had the
wisdom and humility to discuss death with his people when he first
learned he had cancer. But the king _ whose kingdom falls into the
category of liberal amid the other xenophobic states of the region
_ never bothered to consult his citizens about their future leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians were given no chance to decide whom they wished to
rule them. His Majesty ordained that it would be his son Abdullah,
that power would be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone expect anything else? It takes a brave Jordanian to
call for a real constitutional monarchy. Indeed, the only man who
consistently does just that, Leith Shubeilat, finds himself
frequently inside Amman's state security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the titans of the Middle East have planned
their succession.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad _ whose energy still stuns the diplomats who sit
through his six-hour conversations _ has groomed his son Bashar, an

BEAUTY IN THE GENES OF THE BEHOLDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SURVIVAL OF THE PRETTIEST 
The Science of Beauty 
By Nancy Etcoff 
Doubleday, 325 pp, illustrated, $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is society so obsessed with beauty? We spend billions of
dollars on cosmetics, plastic surgery, and diet foods and still
we're never satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Madison Avenue if you want. But psychologist Nancy Etcoff
contends our tireless pursuit of beauty refects something more
primal _ the workings of a basic instinct.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of
Beauty,'' Etcoff challenges the notion that the media has created
our cultural fascination for good looks. Instead she argues that
there are evolutionary reasons why cultures _ not just in the
United States _ place so much value on appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, she says, throughout human history both sexes have
been attracted to people they are most likely to reproduce with.
And physical characteristics (like bulging muscles or fatty tissue)
indicate to potential mates the status of one's health and
fertility. Thus we have a culture focused on the superficial.
Etcoff writes that ``If our ancestors did not have radar for
healthy, fertile bodies we'd have become biological dead ends long
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems a simplistic explanation for why the Stair Master is so
popular. But through a series of global scientific studies, Etcoff
_ a practicing psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a
faculty member at Harvard Medical School _ presents a compelling
argument for why so many cultures are influenced by beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The studies are fascinating because they touch on controversial
cultural taboo topics that most of us have at least thought about:
Are parents more affectionate toward cute newborns? Are handsome
men promoted faster in the workplace? Do husbands and wives tend to
resemble each other? Etcoff touches the cultural nerve that has so
many of us exasperated with the shallow beauty business. And she
forgives our vanity by demonstrating that beauty isn't just in the
eye of the beholder, it's part of the beholder's biology.
</P>
<P>
   Etcoff begins her book by debunking the perception that young
children are immune to society's definition of beauty or that they
learn their preferences from their parents. In a study by
psychologist Judith Langlois, Etcoff writes, it was concluded that
people are born with preferences and even a baby knows human beauty
when he or she sees it. Langlois presented hundreds of slides of
unfamiliar people's faces (male and female Asians, blacks, and
whites) to 3- to 6-month-old babies. The infants stared
significantly longer at the faces that surveyed adults had found
attractive. ``This suggests not only that babies have beauty
detectors,'' Etcoff writes, ``but that human faces may share
universal festures of beauty across their varied features.''
</P>
<P>
   Etcoff attacks another popular concept _ that Western cultures
place more value on looks than other cultures. In a 1990 study of
the mating preferences of more than 10,000 people, by psychologist
David Buss, another theory emerged. Buss interviewed people from 37
cultures between ages 14 and 70. People in more than one-third of
the non-Western and non-North American countries placed more
importance on the looks of their mates than did college students in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Is beauty simply a women's issue? Etcoff argues that males often
use looks in establishing rank. ``In boys' camps,'' she writes,
``rank order develops in cabins within an hour. The top-ranked boy
is not necessarily the biggest, but often the best-looking, most
athletic boy who shows the most mature physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later in life, handsome men are still the leaders of the
pack,'' she writes. ``In a study of cadets at West Point,
sociologist Allan Mazur found that facial dominance had a big
effect on military rank in the junior and senior years. Men who
looked dominant were handsome and had prominent as opposed to weak
chins, heavy brow ridges, deep-set eyes and ears close to their
heads. Their faces were wide or rectangular.''
</P>
<P>
   Can beauty be defined narrowly like that? Obviously, there's no
formula. But in another study by anthropologists Douglas Jones and
Kim Hill of people in Brazil, Russia, Venezuela, Paraguay, and the
United States, ``people in all five cultures were attracted to
similar geometric proportions in the face. They liked females with
small lower faces (delicate jaws and relatively small chins) and
eyes that were large in relation to the length of the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The book includes other studies as well _ such as whether
beautiful people are happier (no) and whether good lookers have
advantages in the workplace (sometimes). All of the studies are a
great counterpoint to the likes of ``Vogue,'' especially for anyone
who has ever pondered why blondes have more fun.

<TEXT>
<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan lies clinically dead in an Amman
hospital, having succumbed to his toughest enemy, cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families.
</P>
<P>
   True, we were happy to see King Farouk booted out of Egypt and
King Idris out of Libya (we liked Qaddafi then) and to depose the
Sultan of Oman in favor of his public-school son. But we want
strong leaders who will be loyal to us. Let them have human rights,
we say. But we do not want democracy in their countries (which
means, of course, that there will be no human rights).
</P>
<P>
   And no choice for their people. At least King Hussein had the
wisdom and humility to discuss death with his people when he first
learned he had cancer. But the king _ whose kingdom falls into the
category of liberal amid the other xenophobic states of the region
_ never bothered to consult his citizens about their future leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians were given no chance to decide whom they wished to
rule them. His Majesty ordained that it would be his son Abdullah,
that power would be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone expect anything else? It takes a brave Jordanian to
call for a real constitutional monarchy. Indeed, the only man who
consistently does just that, Leith Shubeilat, finds himself
frequently inside Amman's state security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the titans of the Middle East have planned
their succession.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad _ whose energy still stuns the diplomats who sit
through his six-hour conversations _ has groomed his son Bashar, an
ophthalmologist by profession but an increasingly public
personality with an enthusiasm for computer technology, to follow
in his steps.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taken at face value, Syria's constitution provides for a
democratic system of succession, but Assad controls military,
political, and legislative power; he can dissolve governments and
assemblies; he is secretary-general of the Baath party, commander
in chief of the armed forces. Presumably, Bashar Assad will one day
do the same.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about Arafat? He has no obvious successor and no real
constitutional framework to create one. He has turned his back on
the democracy of the Palestinian assembly and survives by cronyism,
bribes and 13 different security services _ the latter in
cooperation with the CIA and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians cannot choose their successor. But be sure
that the Israelis already have someone in mind to take over
``Palestine'' when Arafat leaves us.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, direct succession suggests a struggle to come
among the defense minister, Prince Sultan, Prince Naif and Crown
Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, aware of Abdullah's growing criticism and dislike of
the American presence in the Gulf _ he is said to have told U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen that not only could the United
States not use Saudi air bases to bomb Iraq, but that America might
have to leave those air bases altogether _ might favor Prince
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   His son, it should be noted, is the influential Saudi ambassador
to the U.S., Prince Bandar, who in 1990 was reported in Washington
to be almost as powerful in President George Bush's office as the
secretary of state, James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The result of our support for all these potentates is regularly
distorted by their Western supporters in Washington, London and,
less obviously, Paris. If we demand full democracy for these
nations, we are told, the Islamists will try to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Cannot we understand, our diplomats point out, that ``whatever
their failings'' (another of my favorite expressions in the Middle
East), these ``friends of the West'' are fighting Islamic
fundamentalism?
</P>
<P>
   So ``Islamic fundamentalism'' becomes the only real opposition
to the Arab governments. We support those undemocratic countries in
their battle against ``fundamentalist terror'' _ and shore up their
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that why we backed Saddam Hussein so generously during
his eight-year aggression against Iran? Because he was preventing
``fundamentalism?''
</P>
<P>
   So who will we put in Saddam's place? My guess is that the
Americans are still looking for a good old-fashioned Iraqi
brigadier-general, a military man who knows how to keep his tribes
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it would have to be a powerful man, someone who
did not allow dissent to rock the regime, someone with a powerful
security service and a family that might provide a successor.
Someone, in fact, just like Saddam.  &LR;  &QL;

GIBSON DELIVERS MORE MAYHEM IN SOULLESS `PAYBACK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
PAYBACK 
Directed by: Brian Helgeland 
Screenplay by: Helgeland, Terry Hayes (novel: Richard Stark) 
Starring: Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry, Maria Bello, David Paymer,
Deborah Kara Unger, William Devane, Bill Duke, Kris Kristofferson,
Lucy Liu, James Coburn 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence, language and drug and sexual content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As anybody who ever sat through a ``Lethal Weapon'' caper knows,
Mel Gibson never met an explosion he didn't like. ``Payback,'' his
new film, has a lot of them. Bullets explode out of guns, fists
explode into faces, and the film literally ends with a bang after
getting off on spasm after spasm of brutal violence. Nominally, it
differs from Gibson's other films in that this time he plays a
crook. Not that he's all that different from the cop he played in
the ``Lethal Weapon'' quartet. But his natural flippancy is subdued
in this role of a crook with a grievance. After he and a partner
hijack an attache case full of gang money, he's double-crossed by
his wife, gunned down by his then partner in a garage, and left for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, he's lying face down and bloodied on the
grubby operating table of a backstreet doc, having the bullets
removed. During his recovery he mutters in a voiceover that he'd
better get his share of the loot _ $70,000 _ back, or else. As you
can imagine, there's a lot of or else. He works his way up the
criminal food chain as if he has nothing to lose since he considers
himself pretty much dead already. His junkie wife barely lasts long
enough to register stunned surprise at his reappearance. His
treacherous sadistic partner, played by Gregg Henry in a way that
suggests a fleshy Richard Widmark, takes a little longer before
Gibson's super-durable guy named Porter catches up with him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Payback,'' Gibson takes more physical punishment than in
all his other films combined, including ``Braveheart.'' Unkillable
as Rasputin, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking _ and
shooting. Once he penetrates to syndicate middle-management types
and beyond, they can't believe he's courting all this grief for
just $70,000 _ chump change to them. Part of the reason he gets as
far as he does is that his opponents can't believe he's crazy
enough to take them on. But he does, driven by his view of
recovering the money as a point of honor. He has only one helper _
Maria Bello's hooker, whom he cared enough about to want more than
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Because he betrayed his wife, he can't be altogether vengeful
about her double-cross. But with the others it's different. And the
others arrayed against him also include the Chinese gang he robbed
in the first place with his unworthy partner and a pair of corrupt
cops fronted for by Bill Duke. Rightly, ``Payback'' isn't as jokey
as the ``Lethal Weapon'' films, although Gibson dispatches his
share of bad guys to the regular beat of clever one-liners.
``Payback'' exists in a decolorized retro big city world (actually
Chicago, but the city is unspecified in the film), at times seeming
as much etched as filmed. And Gibson remembers to act damaged and
sometimes genuinely nasty as he pursues his
let's-bury-them-before-they-bury-us agenda.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing larky about ``Payback.'' Gibson's Porter spends
nearly two hours figuratively being hammered before being literally
hammered by one of overboss Kris Kristofferson's minions. Still,
energetic and hard-breathing as ``Payback'' is, it's too baldly a
series of set pieces, with more effort being put into kinkiness
than characterization. Accordingly, Henry's sadist and Lucy Liu's
deadly sadomasochistic call girl project more gusto than any of the
others can muster in this otherwise pretty soulless and mechanical
construct.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Helgeland, who wrote ``L.A. Confidential'' and is making
his directing debut here, has done another good job of conjuring up
a dark retro world. But his direction is choppy, the interplay
between the characters is perfunctory, although not as perfunctory
as the unearned ending. For his first time behind the camera, he's
done OK, but he's got a long way to go before he can bear
comparison to John Boorman, of whose exhilaratingly propulsive
``Point Blank'' ``Payback'' is a remake. Still, it can at least be
said that ``Payback'' is the best Lee Marvin movie Gibson ever
made.

MOM AND POP BUSINESSES CAN GET HELP FROM NEW ADVICE NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Schell is no dummy when it comes to business, but he writes
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Schell, who is co-author with Eric Tyson of ``Small Business for
Dummies'' (IDG Books, 1998, $19.99), has street smarts when it
comes to running small businesses. He's started six of his own, and
all of them have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   He sold his last business, a sportswear company with $25 million
in sales and 200 employees, in 1990 because it got too big for his
taste. He likes the small part of small business, the upstart part
of running a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's trying to make sure others succeed in
small-business enterprises as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's latest venture is an operation he calls Opportunity
Knocks. Headquartered in Bend, Ore., it's a problem-solving
organization for small-business owners. He's hoping to export the
concept to other cities if he can find people to champion it the
way he has in Bend.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after the successful TEC executive committees pioneered
by San Diego-based TEC Worldwide, Opportunity Knocks provides a way
for small businesses to come together and brainstorm solutions to
common problems.
</P>
<P>
   TEC runs groups for chief executive officers and presidents of
companies with more than $3 million in sales and 25 or more
employees. It also has an emerging entrepreneurs group for people
running businesses with $750,000 to $3 million in sales and five to
25 employees. The groups gather to give each other feedback and
help with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity Knocks is going after much smaller organizations,
Schell said. ``This is for mom-and-pops.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups serve as ad-hoc advisory teams for small-business
owners, he said. Each circle has about a dozen small-business
owners and one professional facilitator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trial and error is the No. 1 management tool for most
small-business owners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be. ``Someone is bound to have had the
problem before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bend, a relatively small community with 40,000 people, already
has 200 businesses organized into 16 different teams, he said. The
teams meet once a month. Participation costs $99 a year. Home
business owners are linked together, since their problems are
somewhat different than those operating outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the 200 businesses employ about 4,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Although they represent a wide variety of types of businesses,
the problems they face aren't that different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding problem in small business is that nobody knows
how to get a product to market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing, which includes strategic product development,
pricing, advertising and distribution, is always a problem, whether
a company is making widgets or selling services.
</P>
<P>
   The second major problem facing almost all small businesses is
how to deal with employees.
</P>
<P>
   Making the transition from a lone eagle to a manager is
particularly troublesome for many entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people employees are from Mars and owners are from
Venus,'' he said. What motivates owners isn't the same as what
motivates employees.
</P>
<P>
   Employees typically need appreciation, recognition, the ability
to feel part of a team and some degree of security, he said.
``Those are not the same things that motivate owners.''
</P>
<P>
   But when entrepreneurs get together, they can help each other
troubleshoot and identify their blind spots.
</P>
<P>
   That's critical because four out of five businesses don't see
their fifth birthday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one mistake small-business owners make,'' he
said. ``They will say, `I've got a cash-flow problem,' or, `I
didn't get enough money,' or `I've got the wrong location,''' he
said. ``But those are all symptoms. The reason they have them is
they rely on trial and error as a management tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-business owners are by definition independent, he said.
They're usually loathe to get someone else's advice.
</P>
<P>
   But the first thing they should do is put together a group of
advisers they trust, he said. In Opportunity Knocks, the owners
serve as each other's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not networking,'' he said. ``It's problem-solving.''
</P>
<P>
   A board of advisers serves as a kind of collective mentor, he
said. Advisers can help steer a company away from a potential
disaster by sharing their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take advantage of someone else's mistakes,'' he said. ``The
biggest mistake is going it alone.''

SHE'S FOXY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Supreme queen. Hoochie mama dream. Foxy Brown doesn't deal
with subtleties. It's in your face. Boobs bouncing under a peekaboo
Fendi body shirt, and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   At the FleetCenter in Boston last December, she strutted around
in that Fendi shirt, feet cemented in thick-soled Chanel sneakers,
rapping about Prada this and Gucci that. When she wasn't talking
about living the life, she fed the audience the kind of X-rated
lines that make kids feel like it's liberation, yo.
</P>
<P>
   Foxy Brown is the first to tell you she's selling sex, straight
up. Marilyn did it. And Tina Turner, with those micro(scopic)
minis. And let's not even talk about Madonna. So it's only fitting
that this young woman _ born Inga Marchand _ decided to take on the
role actress Pam Grier made famous in the 1974 blaxploitation film
``Foxy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brown, the 19-year-old rapper from Brooklyn oozes sexuality,
even if it tends toward the slutty side. Take a listen: ``I don't
love 'em. No dough. . . . What am I going to fake it for?'' she
raps on ``Ride (Down South),'' a track on her new album, ``Chyna
Doll.'' According to sales figures released this week, ``Chyna Doll
is the nation's top-selling CD.
</P>
<P>
   But she's more than the sum of her overexposed body parts, her
nasty-girl lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write my own lyrics,'' she says, too polite to mention the
names of female rappers known for letting others pen their verses _
like her best-friend-turned nemesis Li'l Kim, another hoochie who
dared call her solo album ``Hard Core.''
</P>
<P>
   The wildly creative Christopher Wallace, a.k.a. Biggie Smalls,
a.k.a. Big Poppa, a.k.a. Notorious B.I.G., wrote most of Kim's
rhymes. Some say without him, she never would have made it big.
</P>
<P>
   Though Foxy Brown acknowledges the help she gets from rapper
Jay-Z _ who gets credit for cowriting several songs on ``Chyna
Doll'' _ she says she's evolved into an independent-minded
musician, a long way from when she started out in the business at
15 and people were telling her what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, she sang cameos on other people's albums _ including
LL Cool J's and Jay-Z's _ before her debut ``Ill Na Na'' was
released in 1996, selling 1.5 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, ``The Firm'' came out, a collaborative
effort with Nas (Nasir Jones) and AZ (Antonio Cruz) that proved she
can hang with the fellas.
</P>
<P>
   Her record label wasn't kidding when it slapped the ``explicit
content'' label on that album. The lines are laced with foul
language and the subject matter glorifies violence, like this intro
line on ``Firm Fiasco'': ``You know, most hos would've left these
cats a long time ago, I mean if your man gave you a gun to hide,
what would y'all hos do? But you know the (expletive) kind of
turned me on.''
</P>
<P>
   People said she'd fade away, that she was a gimmick listeners
would tire of, but her sophomore solo album has already spawned a
hit single, ``Hot Spot,'' a catchy song about partying at clubs and
_ what else? _ sex.
</P>
<P>
   But behind her public image is a sweet, sensitive woman few see.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, she's comfortable hobnobbing with the press, the
stage crew, even a few fans who sneak past security. Two teenage
girls ambush her in the hallway. ``Can we get a picture with you?''
one of the girls squeals. ``Sure, honey,'' Brown says, flashing her
chunky white teeth.
</P>
<P>
   People expect an ice princess, but if anything Brown's warmth
melts the cynics checking her out from afar. It's no act, either.
Still strutting in her Fendi top, her hair weave cascading down her
back, she turns to me, saying, ``Let's sit somewhere quiet,'' and
offers a spot on a couch in her dressing room, away from the rest
of her crew.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight she doesn't cake on the makeup. No shimmering blue
powder on her eyelid. None of that purple jelly posing as lipstick.
Her face gleams with innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really naturally pretty, nothing like the pictures in
magazines,'' I say, before adding, ``I mean you're even prettier
without the makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiles and gazes away, bashfully. ``Really? Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown sits, knees touching, just like they used to teach in
charm school. She's attentive, even though a dozen people are
milling around her large dressing room, laughing loudly.
</P>
<P>
   A young man runs over to her. ``Foxy! Foxy! Check this out,'' he
screams. ``Would you excuse me for a moment?'' she says, then
hurries back. ``I'm sorry about that interruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we get a chance to talk about what everyone asks her:
Why slink around in her ``do me'' outfits, rapping about gettin' it
on, when she could sell just as many albums by relying on her vocal
talent'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is entertainment,'' Brown says. ``I'm not trying to be a
role model. People need to separate entertainment from real life.
I'm not here to teach people morals. They should learn that at
home.''

   For all their history and tumult, and for all the passionate
nostalgia of the keepers of their fire, the 1960s aren't much more
than a few druggy jokes and car commercials on 1999 TV. The heady
decade of the Kennedy assassinations and Jefferson Airplane
generally rates little more than a prime-time appearance as the
punchline on ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' with Dharma's memory-impaired dad
burning pot to lift his spirits and her ``veggier than thou''
mother burning sage to scare the bad ones away. And lovey-dovey
'60s songs like ``Everyday People'' now find their higher purpose
hawking sports utility vehicles to the folks who once thumbed to
Dead shows. Aside from VH1, the channel that presents classic rock
with dignity and a dash of pathos, and ``The X-Files,'' whose
premise is steeped in drug-tinged radical paranoia, the TV version
of the 1960s looks about as real as Maynard G. Krebs with a buzz
on.
</P>
<P>
   The cartooning of the '60s makes sense when you flash on the
fact that the decade of peace and love is 30-plus years gone.
Indeed, some of the young stars of NBC's cartoonish ``The '60s''
were in Snugglies more than 10 years after those famous tent-born
Woodstock babies. Television is a relentlessly Now medium, and it
is openly dismissive of older generations as it panders to the
tastes of today's youth market. The best TV portrait of the '60s
may have aired in the '60s, when it was the first era to explode in
the American living room during newscasts of Vietnam, the student
protests, and space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   And so we get ``The '60s,'' a silly amusement-park ride that
makes the decade seem about as fiery as a pint of Cherry Garcia,
and as rough a ride as those slick new VW bugs. ``The '60s'' is the
kind of movie that turns Vietnam Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome
into an Exedrin headache and portrays LSD users as those ``Reefer
Madness''-type kids busted on ``Dragnet.'' Oh, like, wow, man, I
can fly. To give it a veneer of realism, the movie peppers its
fictional story with documentary footage of all the usual suspects,
from the Zapruder film to the Beatles on ``The Ed Sullivan Show.''
But there's no escaping the superficiality and fraudulence of the
four-hour venture, which was motivated by a demographic attempt to
hook viewers during Sweeps month and not by the creative need to
tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically, the idea of cramming a decade of events into the
life of one family, the Herlihys, is fairly doomed from the start.
Each of the three Herlihy children follows a different,
stereotypically '60s path, and the forced story lines manage to
land them at a ridiculous number of milestone events, such as the
Newport Folk Festival, the Democratic Convention in Chicago, and
the Watts riot. Oh _ and, of course, Woodstock. ``The '60s'' is the
kind of insanely convenient movie in which one character must go to
Woodstock and actually ingest a hit of the legendary bad brown acid
that was circulated there (don't worry: he recovers before you can
say ``we are stardust'').
</P>
<P>
   The middle Herlihy son, Michael, gets the most screen time. He
worships Bob Dylan, becomes a peace activist who studies with
Father Daniel Berrigan, falls for a student who looks like Ali
McGraw, and learns that love means never having to say you're
sorry. Brian, Dad's favorite, goes to Vietnam and returns with
empty eyes and ``Born on the Fourth of July''-styled alienation.
And Katie gets pregnant by a rock singer, puts flowers in her hair,
and runs away to San Francisco, where she suffers communal living.
``Did you ever think about maybe getting a real job,'' she yells at
the father of her child. ``Oh come on, are you gonna bum me out
about jobs again?'' he says, stoned. ``Oh man,'' says a bystander,
``my shaman told me to avoid all bad vibes.'' The only surprise
about the resolution of the Herlihy plot strands is their wholesome
twist, which recalls ``Ozzie and Harriet'' more than the decade
that found its end in murder at Altamont.
</P>
<P>
   There is a subplot about a black father and son who try on
different styles of empowerment, beginning with lunch-counter
sit-ins in Greenwood, Miss. Emmet Taylor, the son, briefly crosses
paths with Katie Herlihy in San Francisco, where he is recruited by
the Black Panthers. But, in a movie where even the major characters
are stunted, the Taylors' story is given incredibly short shrift
and ends up passing in the blink of an eye. ``The '60s'' may suffer
from its epic aspirations, which allow it one scene for every major
plot turn and historical event, but it never drags, even if you're
a viewer accustomed to MTV's breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   The music, of course, also keeps the movie from bogging down,
and it adds an illusion of depth to the flat script. The hits are
deployed in familiar ways _ ``Sunshine of Your Love'' during the
Summer of Love, for instance _ and the moviemakers don't seem
overly concerned about musical accuracy, as the 1973 song ``Let's
Get It On'' plays over scenes set in 1962. But the soundtrack is
compelling, and the cameos also conspire to keep you watching. Wavy
Gravy is an acid-trip captain; Carnie Wilson, Beach Boy Brian
Wilson's daughter, is a hippie named Mama Earth; and Donovan
Leitch, son of Donovan, plays the father of Katie's child. And
Rosanna Arquette puts in an absurd bit as a drugged-out Haight
denizen that's almost worth waiting for it's so funny-bad.
</P>
<P>
   The leading actors, mostly unknown, are appealing, and make the
best of their limited characters. As Michael, Josh Hamilton manages
to project the right balance of intelligence and political outrage,
Jerry O'Connell keeps Brian the war veteran from seeming too
one-dimensional, and Julia Stiles makes her Katie stronger than the
script would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it may not matter whether ``The '60s'' is hokey. NBC
knows the movie is irresistible to an audience that's always raring
for a flashback to a more dynamic time, their time. With a
Jefferson Airplane-fueled ad and a title that leaves no room for
ambiguity, the target marketing of ``The '60s'' is bound to have
lots of Nielsen flower power. NBC knows ``The '60s'' is going to be
must-see TV, even if Tim Leary himself might have told you not to
bother turning on your TV to tune this one in.

LIGHTWEIGHT `SIMPLY' IS EASY TO RESIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE 
Directed by: Mark Tarlov 
Produced by: John Fiedler, Jon Amiel and Joan Caracciolo Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Written by: Judith Roberts &QL; 
Starring: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flanery &QL; 
Rating: PG-13. (Mild profanity.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of decent Robert Palmer songs turned into
mediocre-to-bad movies continues with ``Simply Irresistible,'' a
pointless so-called romantic comedy that follows ``Addicted to
Love.'' Let's hope no one in Hollywood has ever heard ``Sneakin'
Sally Through the Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply Irresistible,'' starring a pair of thrice-named folks,
Sarah Michelle Gellar (of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' fame) and
Sean Patrick Flanery as the classically polar opposite love
interests, is simply enervating. This is the kind of movie you walk
out of with one thought: Why did this movie get made? Then a few
other thoughts come: How starved for pie-in-the-sky fantasy romance
does Hollywood think we are? Can I get my money back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply Irresistible,'' directed by freshman Mark Tarlov, is
light on both romance and comedy, as resistible as a thick wad of
bubble gum on the pavement that you've spotted 30 feet away. It's a
chick flick, sure, but ladies, please do not drag your beau to this
one; there will be too much hell to pay later, like maybe forced
back-to-back screenings of ``Varsity Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   The tedium in ``Simply Irresistible'' unfolds this way: We're in
Manhattan. Amanda (Gellar) has inherited a once-successful
restaurant from her mother. She is not a great cook, but she is
pretty and fetching. Tom (Flanery) is a stiff yuppie go-getter
who's putting together the final pieces of his upscale restaurant
within an upscale store, Bendel's. Amanda is failing at her own
restaurant. They meet _ oh so whimsically! _ in a food market. The
meeting is facilitated by a feisty, wise crab (don't ask). Amanda
and Tom do the tiresome dating/mating dance, though it's all chaste
(and boring) enough to barely merit a PG rating. There is
supposedly some sort of magic in the air because the couple are
literally lifted up off the floor to the ceiling when they're
embracing.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but can/will they work as well together? Luckily, Tom's
petulant French chef quits on opening night and Amanda is pressed
into action. Can she cut it? Will the kitchen staff obey her? What
about that sous-chef? The tension, well, it's palpable, more so
than it was in that Russian roulette suicide scene in ``The Deer
Hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Food, sumptuous food. That's the ingredient that sparks their
romance, and Amanda's culinary creations in the kitchen _ oh yes,
she suddenly can cook _ bring other diners to levels of
near-orgasmic bliss, too. There's a lot of chemical smoke pumped
into the dining area _ you know, symbolic magic. And that, folks,
is pretty much it. This movie is so old school it creaks and
groans. There is no tension, no challenge, no wit to speak of, no
depth to the characters, no sex, no reason to care.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Saturday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMPEACH &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans a 5-page package of impeachment stories
(including text):
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH (Washington) _ Developments on the impeachment. By Eric
Schmitt. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-WITNESSES (Washington) _ What we learn from Monica
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. By Jill Abramson.
(1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TEXT (Washington) _ Exceprts of deposition testimony
from the three witnesses. (2{ pages)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-MONICA (Washington) _ Mondica Lewinsky dueling with her
inquisitors. When Rep. Ed Bryant, a House manager, asked her about
the first ``salacious occasion,'' she took offense at the term,
because, ``This is my relationship.'' When Bryant complained about
being limited in questioning and said that if that was how it was
going to be, ``We could all go home,'' she replied, ``Sounds good
to me.'' By Francis X. Clines. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ROGAN (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Almost from the moment he was
elected to the House of Representatives, James E. Rogan was singled
out by fellow Republicans as the freshman most likely to become a
star. Now, as one of the 13 House prosecutors trying to convince
the Senate to remove the president from office, Rogan, 41, has
greater name recognition in his second term than do many of his
colleagues after decades in office. But it is this starring role in
the president's impeachment trial that has put Rogan on the
Democratic Party's short list of Republicans from moderate
districts who are most likely to suffer a voter backlash in 2000.
By Evelyn Nieves. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HUTCHINSON (Fayetteville, N.C.) _ At the same time Rep.
Asa Hutchinson was in Washington, deposing Vernon Jordan and
otherwise helping his fellow House impeachment managers further the
case against President Clinton, Vicki Young was nursing a bitter
cup of coffee at the Grapevine Restaurant plotting her
congressman's political demise. ``I think it's completely clear
that what the Republicans and Asa Hutchinson want is vengeance, not
justice,'' said the 45-year-old former auditor for a local
automotive supplier. They are very wrong in thinking people will
forget what they've done. I honestly think it's going to go against
them in the next election. That's what we're going to try to make
happen, anyway.'' A story on the reaction back home. By Rick Lyman.

GOLF: NIRVANA ON THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens all the time. One of the uninitiated will waltz into
the Viewing Stadium and see that I'm watching golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you watch golf on television? Are you getting paid for
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Do you see how clearly this misses the point? Nobody says a
thing when I'm forced to watch ``Jesse'' or some of that
impeachment nonsense, but when I choose to sit inside on a
perfectly sunny Sunday to watch a precious few hours of golf, all
of a sudden people are worried about my sanity.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably the biggest week for non-fans to watch golf, as
the Pebble Beach hootenanny captivates those wanting a glimpse of
this Tiger kid and a lot of Bill Murray and celebrity friends.
Don't ask me why people want to watch Clint Eastwood or Kevin
Costner hack away when they could get visual tips from somebody who
really knows how to play.
</P>
<P>
   But people do. When Michael Jordan or Charles Barkley steps on a
golf course, they end up on every network's sports report. Even
``Melrose Place'' star Jack Wagner _ who really can play _ gets
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, just so you watch. And if you do, you'll realize all those
bad jokes about plaid pants haven't applied in more than 20 years.
If you're going to mock, get it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mission, really, getting people hooked on golf viewing.
Say it loud, say it proud: There's nothing like watching
professional golf on television. Admittedly, you pretty much have
to be a golf junkie to really love it, but I know some people who
just watch to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, ESPN had a great promotion for its golf coverage.
It said, ``We all want the lesson. That's why we watch. Let ESPN
show us the way.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect encapsulation of why we watch.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, football and basketball are more fast-paced and
exciting _ but we're in apples and oranges territory here. There's
no question that the final round of last week's Phoenix Open _ with
Tiger and Justin Leonard charging _ was far superior to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what George Clooney is going to do after ``ER,'' I'd
rather hear what's new with Roger Maltbie or righteously great
Johnny Miller. I'd rather spend four days with Mike Tirico and Andy
North than a half-hour with Fran Drescher.
</P>
<P>
   Share the joy with CBS and perhaps the best collection of golf
announcers going. Jim Nantz is the calm voice who holds it all
together and will guide you through this phalanx of stars and
unfamiliar pro golf faces. But it's the supporting cast that makes
these CBS tournaments shine.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Ken Venturi. I could listen to Venturi dissect
someone's game or second guess club selection on a 24-hour tape
loop. Venturi doesn't pull many punches (but doesn't throw as many
haymakers as NBC's Miller), and gets you the analysis you need to
understand the golfer's decision making and course management.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kostis and Oosterhuis (and Bobby Clampett, too) provide
excellent on-course commentary. You can soak up the knowledge with
those two. But for sheer fun _ and let's face it, if you don't
watch much golf you don't give a damn about course management _
there's Gary McCord and David Feherty to entertain you.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's not slighting either's knowledge. But McCord is like
the John Madden of golf, so newcomers will love him, and Feherty
has a wonderful Irish accent, a quick wit and glib stories.
</P>
<P>
   You may be watching for the shenanigans of Murray, but the
die-hards out there will be attuned to pin placements, the stimp
meter, what the pros hit from 154 out and other such lovable
minutiae.
</P>
<P>
   And at day's end, when ``Sports-Center'' wraps it all up and
Kenny Mayne yells ``Get in the clown's mouth,'' we'll soak that up,
too.
</P>
<P>
   You can never get enough golf. ``Dateline,'' yes, golf no.

the Maryland sentencing. Indiana could determine that Tyson, in the
Maryland case, violated his probation from his 1991 rape conviction
and that therefore must do more jail time in that state. By Timothy

   HUSSEIN ADVISORY FOR NEWS, INTERNATIONAL EDITORS:
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service is preparing an obituary in preparation for the
death of Jordan's ailing King Hussein. The obituary, written by Cox
Newspapers Middle East correspondent Larry Kaplow, will move in the
International category within minutes of the official announcement
of the king's death. The story slugged JORDAN-NOOR, which moved
Wednesday for Thursday papers, is also being updated _ for those
Cox papers that have not run the story _ to reflect the king's
death and will also move in both the International and Lifestyle
categories. Cox News Service also anticipates President Clinton
will attend the funeral of King Hussein and expects White House
correspondent Bob Deans to travel with the president.

   JORDAN-HUSSEIN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ As they wait and pray for their
ailing king, Jordanians expect the worst. Though the royal palace
was not very forthcoming with information on King Hussein's
apparently grave condition Friday, his loyal subjects know that
their ruler -- the only one that the vast majority of whom have
known in their lifetime --will not be with them much longer. The
mood of the country and its people. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News

   CUBA-TOURISM _ HAVANA, Cuba _ Delightfully off-limits to most
Americans, I first visited communist Cuba in 1991 simply because I
wasn't supposed to. I had no idea what to expect. But it was like
traveling into a time warp. Rusty Russian Lada cars rattled
alongside 40-year-old Chevrolets. Old-fashioned pharmacies
displayed traditional glass and ceramic medicine jars. Billboards
of the bearded revolutionary hero, Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara,
dominated the roadsides. As a so-called ``forbidden zone,'' this
Pennsylvania-sized island just 90 miles off the South Florida shore
was certainly lacking _ there were few Americans and few T-shirts
to buy, few tacky souvenirs to browse, and no McDonald's. I
couldn't have been happier. On the downside, there was little to
eat, even in the best state-run restaurants, and few hotels that
could _ even with a stretch _ be labeled anything close to
luxurious. Still, I was hooked. (Emling, Cox News Service).

religious observance, or between right wing and left wing, the army
is the one institution with nearly unanimous trust and respect.
Political parties bid, offering plum posts, to sign up generals as
they retire from the army and are free for political allegiances.
In Israel, almost every man or woman must serve in the army and it
is often where career networks are forged. (Kaplow, Cox News

   IMPEACH-TAPES _WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky declared in her
videotaped deposition that President Clinton never suggested she
file a false affidavit to deny their affair and said she was ``a
pest'' to presidential friend Vernon Jordan in seeking a job.
Lewinsky said she now has ``mixed feelings'' for Clinton and
objected when her congressional inquisitor, Rep. Ed Bryant,
referred to her relations with Clinton as ``salacious.'' Congress
today released transcripts of depositions taken this week from Ms.
Lewinsky, Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. The trial
was in recess today, so both sides could prepare for Saturday's
presentations. Closing arguments will be held Monday, and then
deliberations, with a vote expected next Friday or sooner on
conviction or acquittal of the president on perjury and obstruction
of justice charges. (Sherman/Foskett, Atlanta

   GORE _ WASHINGTON _ It's tempting to say it's all over in the

AIRPORT SEEKS TO LIMIT COMMUTER FLIGHTS TO EASE DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco International Airport officials
are exploring a plan to ease the airport's worsening delays by
cutting the number of commuter planes and compelling airlines to
use bigger aircraft on short-haul flights.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is getting a cool reception from United Airlines, which
handles half of the 1,260 flights a day at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``First off, we fly the schedule we do in and out of San
Francisco International because of customer demand,'' a United
spokesman, Matthew Triaca, said from Chicago. ``We're not so sure
the airport can tell us how to set our schedule. We're not sure
they have the legal right to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco International Director John Martin said some
drastic measures had to be taken. The airport has earned the
Department of Transportation's designation as the worst in the
nation for weather delays.
</P>
<P>
   Airport spokesman Ron Wilson said the proposal would affect
shorter trips to regional cities such as Sacramento, Fresno and
Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea would be to cut back, say, three or four flights of
smaller airlines, and use just one 737 flight,'' Wilson said.
``It's not going to solve delay problems but it's going to have a
beneficial effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is discussing the plan with United and other airlines,
according to Wilson, ``and he'd like to do it tomorrow; he'd like
to do it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Small, propeller-driven flights carrying 30 passengers account
for 19 percent of flight operations at San Francisco, but only
about 4 percent of the passenger volume, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is that every 30-passenger plane takes up the
same space as a 747 or 737 and in managing that air traffic, every
plane has to be considered the same no matter what their size,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The runways can handle 60 flights per hour in ideal weather.
When weather is not ideal, however, the Federal Aviation
Administration imposes restrictions that reduces flights to 30 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said airlines base their schedules on ideal conditions,
causing delays in inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   Martin sees his plan as an interim measure and both sides agree
that the long-term solution is more runway capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has just completed a study of its runway needs, and
the ``really preliminary'' cost to expand the runways is $2.2
billion, up from earlier estimates of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal is to increase the distance between the airport's
parallel runways from 750 feet to 4,300 feet, which would require
filling in part of San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But that separation would allow simultaneous landings even in
bad weather, which is not possible on the current close-together
parallel runways. Yet any attempt to fill the Bay would lead to
opposition from environmental organizations.

JUNGLE THOUGHTS, IN THE SEASON OF ICICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun, Feb 7)  
(JT) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I had my druthers, I might live in a tropical paradise, where
there would be vines hanging from trees and exotic plants with huge
leaves, and everywhere a sense of lushness and green.
</P>
<P>
   The image is particularly attractive in the winter, when there
isn't much green to be seen, but it's a pleasant thought in
midsummer as well, when the grass gets a bit parched and the gaudy
hues of zinnias start to burn holes in the retina.
</P>
<P>
   At such times, I like to rest the eyes on something jungly. A
conservatory full of ginger plants, bromeliads and vining jasmine
would be ideal but, lacking that, it's good to have a few outdoor
annuals with a tropical look: cannas, for example.
</P>
<P>
   There is much unpleasant to be said about cannas. They tend to
be planted in ungainly clumps as accent plants among the marigolds
and petunias, or to sprout from the corners of lots like so many
survey markers. The flowers are no easier on the eyes than zinnias,
tending toward fluorescent oranges and reds.
</P>
<P>
   But the foliage is luxurious. The plants grow several feet tall
and have broad, spiky leaves that range from rich green to purplish
or bronze, often with contrasting veins. A swath of cannas against
a wall or fence is a fair approximation of the amazing fortune of
people who live in equatorial places where crotons grow through
cracks in the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Even better would be a swath of castor beans. Castor beans
aren't grown much anymore, probably owing to their highly poisonous
seeds. They were common when I was growing up in western Kansas, a
place where gardeners would risk almost anything for the sake of
something green to admire in high summer.
</P>
<P>
   We children were so thoroughly warned away from the prickly
seedpods that I assumed that the plant itself was dangerous, like
poison ivy. I know of no instance of any youngster's actually
falling ill from eating castor bean seeds, although most of us
would have taken that chance rather than swallow doses of its
derivative, castor oil, commonly administered for constipation. If
you are concerned about children, cut off the flower stalks as they
form. The foliage is the best part, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Castor beans grow to eight feet or more, with huge palm-shaped
leaves. The seedpods look like large cockleburs and form on stalks.
The pods I remember from childhood were nondescript, and were no
reason to grow the plant. But this year some catalogues are
carrying castor beans with brightly colored seedpods, said to be
suitable as cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny's Selected Seeds (1 Foss Hill Rd., Albion, Maine. 04910,
(207) 437-4301; free catalogue) has a variety called Carmencita,
available with either dark green foliage and pink seedpods or
wine-colored foliage and bright red seedpods. The description says
the plants grow four to five feet tall, slightly shorter than the
ones I remember but still suitably tropical in stature.
</P>
<P>
   Castor beans are grown from those noxious seeds, which should be
started indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost date.
</P>
<P>
   Cannas grow from fleshy roots, which are available by mail order
or in garden centers in the spring. They won't overwinter outdoors
where the ground freezes, so they must be dug up in the late fall
and stored over winter like dahlia tubers.
</P>
<P>
   Cannas and castor beans are sun-lovers, and they will be at
their peak in late summer, when lush foliage is at a premium in the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a tropical oasis in a shady area is actually easier,
given that hostas and ferns are already comfortable there. A few
good-size clumps of elephant's ear will provide the towering height
and grandiose foliage, and fancy-leaf caladiums are a pretty good
substitute for brightly colored toucans and parrots.
</P>
<P>
   Like castor beans, elephant's ear (Colocasia esculenta) is not
for delicate gardeners who favor the likes of miniature irises and
low-growing ground covers. It isn't poisonous; in fact, its roots
are edible. In the tropics it's grown as taro or dasheen. Cooked,
mashed and fermented, the roots are the Hawaiian staple called poi.
</P>
<P>
   It is imposing, however: it looks like a philodendron on
steroids. The leaves can be more than two feet long, rising on
six-foot stems.
</P>
<P>
   Both elephant's ear and caladiums grow from bulbs, which must be
started early indoors if they are to amount to anything by
midsummer. February is not too early. Elephant's-ear bulbs are
large, three to five inches in diameter, and will need a good-size
pot. Caladium bulbs are graded by size, and the biggest _ at least
an inch and a half in diameter _ will give the best results.
</P>
<P>
   Caladium bulbs are often available prepackaged at garden centers
or stores like Home Depot. W. Atlee Burpee (300 Park Ave.,
Warminster, Pa. 18991, (800) 888-1447) has both elephant's ear and
caladiums.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage lush foliage, it's a good idea to disbud the bulbs
before potting them up. The central bud is a bump, sometimes
pinkish or white, at the top of the bulb. This should be nipped out
with a sharp knife. Disbudding encourages secondary buds to emerge,
giving a plant with more leafy stems.
</P>
<P>
   Pot the bulbs, barely covered, in a light potting mix or plain
damp peat moss, and keep them in as warm a place as you can manage.
It takes as long as six weeks for disbudded caladiums to sprout, so
be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant's ear and caladiums can be dug up for storage over the
winter after frost has blackened their foliage. If you bury the
caladium pots up to their edges in the garden, you can take them
indoors before frost. It's a way to have the tropics available all
winter.

<P>
   As the West pays its respects to the memory of King Hussein of
Jordan, it should pause to acknowledge a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, his achievement was to hold together the country
he inherited from his father, despite the loss of the West Bank and
the influx of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, his legacy is to have made peace with Israel,
and helped broker more realistic positions by his Arab neighbors in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that the rather Shakespearian deathbed
maneuvers, dashing at the 11th hour his brother's 34-year
expectation of inheriting the crown in favor of his eldest son,
Abdullah, will come to good.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Hassan had a high reputation abroad, especially in
Israel where his fluent command of Hebrew and friendship with
leading politicians meant he was a known and trusted quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Son Abdullah, on the other hand, has a reputation merely as a
top soldier. It is assumed that he has learned political skills
from watching his father for the past 37 years, but it is not
certain.
</P>
<P>
   And it is assumed that, as someone educated in Britain, he
shares _ or at least understands _ the values of liberal democracy,
and will thus continue King Hussein's pro-Western, pragmatic and
peaceful policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the values of liberal democracy that the conundrum
lies. Western liberal democrats tend to take it as read that, if
the Arab countries were democracies, the prospects of peace in the
Middle East would be better. But it could be that it was preferable
that an enlightened despot should have ruled Jordan for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of democracy in a culture dominated by grievance
against external enemies is that it could throw up an Islamicist
demagogue who would want to fight again the wars of 1967 and 1973
against Israel, or fight the holy war against the
American-dominated world order.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, though, it could be argued that it is only by moving
towards democracy that the rage of Moslem fundamentalism will be
channelled into a constructive engagement with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence from other parts of the globe is unclear. India and
Pakistan are both democracies, and that has not stopped a series of
``hot'' wars, or an escalating ``cold'' war of nuclear weapons
competition. Nor have the excesses of Islamic theocracy been
noticeably curbed in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of democracy is not raised by the succession in Jordan
alone. Power has been effectively handed down in the house of King
Fahd in Saudi Arabia, while leaders in Egypt and Syria will be
replaced in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Gaddafi in Libya is not a well man, while even Saddam
Hussein must be approaching his rendezvous with mortality.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, King Hussein's limited moves towards a
constitutional monarchy should be seen as a welcome attempt to
secure power based on popular consent. King Abdullah should be
given support to broaden his democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for advancing the Middle East peace process,
though, lies in a different succession battle later this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israeli elections replace Benjamin Netanyahu with a
leader who can unite the forces committed to peace and dialogue
with the Palestinians, which are greater than the forces of
hostility, then King Hussein's life work stands a chance of being
completed. &QL;

KITCHEN CANISTERS DATE TO THE 19TH CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kitchens today have become sleek environments
with lots of free counter workspace. However, one steadfast kitchen
accessory, which has been on counters since the 19th century, is
the canister set.
</P>
<P>
   Originally just about any airtight container served as a
canister. They are intended to prevent the invasion of weevils,
mice, rats and roaches, as well as dust and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   An advertisement found in the library of the Strong Museum in
Rochester, N.Y., states that the flour saved pays the cost of the
Columbia Flour Bin, which secures flour from moisture, dirt and
vermin. This early flour canister, which also contained a sieve for
sifting the flour, cost between $1.30 and $1.50, for a 50-pound
capacity, in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   Tin-lined japanned copper flour canisters came in three parts,
with a sifting tray under the lid. Often the tin canisters also
featured stamped designs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its appeal as a decorative kitchen accessory,
this modern convenience also avoided the necessity of reaching down
into flour barrels or sacks.
</P>
<P>
   There were hinged canisters, for tea and coffee, which were
practical because the covers could never get lost. A two-pound
canister cost 10 cents; a four-pound size, 15 cents. Japanned
(lacquered or varnished to a hard glossy finish) black tin canister
sets from around the late 1890s, featuring fancy bronze designs and
stenciled lettering with lids that were removed by a small tab, are
worth $75 or more today, according to a periodical from the library
at the Strong Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Japanned blue and white tins with porcelain knobs held in place
with brass screws can be worth several hundred dollars today. In
addition to flour, cornmeal, coffee, sugar and tea, large canister
sets also would have included containers for rice, barley, and
smaller tins for spices such as cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg, allspice,
cloves and ginger.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1920s and 1930s, newer materials overshadowed tin.
A canister or pantry set might include 10 emerald-green glass jars
with metal screw-on lids and name labels.
</P>
<P>
   Decorated earthenware with domed lids and hand grips were called
canister or cereal sets and commonly numbered up to 15 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Today, canister sets usually consist of four airtight keepers
that cost anywhere from $10 to $60 and up, depending on the
materials, which range from patterned or solid ceramic to tinted or
clear glass and plastic. If space is at a premium, there are also
stackable clear plastic canisters with a vacuum seal, which may be
purchased individually, rather than as a set.

   Picasso and Matisse, Side by Side
</P>
<P>
   From the time they met in 1906, Picasso and Matisse were
fiercely competitive, and ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle
Rivalry,'' which opened last Sunday at the Kimbell Art Museum in
Fort Worth, is the first major exhibition to examine their
sparring. It brings together more than 100 paintings, drawings and
sculptures from around the world, juxtaposing many for the first
time. The show, which runs through May 2, will not travel.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged chronologically, the exhibit picks up the rivalry
around 1930, with Matisse recovering from a bout of artist's block,
while Picasso was enjoying a highly productive period, even teasing
his rival with parodies of his odalisques, dancers, studio scenes
and other paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Matisse began working again, and Picasso, apparently
fascinated by a Matisse retrospective and an exhibition of his
sculptures, represented in this show by works like ``Jeannette
III,'' responded with sculptures of heads and bathers and his
``sleeping beauty'' canvases, like ``Woman with Yellow Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Matisse then rose to the challenge with such paintings as ``The
Dream'' from 1935, prompting Picasso's gradual mellowing toward the
decorative aspects of Matisse's work. By the end of the 1930's, the
two observed a truce, with each exploring the other's pictorial
language in his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   During the war years, they exchanged some paintings and
drawings, most of which will be on view. In peace, the two began to
meet often and exhibit together, producing works like Matisse's
``Blue Nude II'' (1952) and ``Seated Woman'' by Picasso (1953).
Finally, following Matisse's death in 1954, Picasso began to
reinvent his colleague, painting elegies _ first, thematic works
like ``Women of Algiers'' and then a series of empty studios
reminiscent of Matisse's Vence interiors.

   A Spanish Peak Joins a National Park
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the fabled Alhambra in Granada have always been able
to gaze at the distant snowcapped Veleta Peak, which at 11,129 feet
rises as a breathtaking backdrop to the medieval Moorish complex.
Now, Veleta has become part of the new Sierra Nevada National Park,
a 213,790-acre nature preserve whose main western entrance is a
30-minute drive from Granada. The park contains 14 peaks above
9,600 feet, the tallest being Mulhacen, at 11,421 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Nevada is a Mediterranean mountainous zone that
already enjoyed some official environmental protection and now will
get more after Parliament approved it last month as the 12th, and
largest, national park in Spain. It has 2,100 species of fauna and
flora, including vast forests of pine, oak, chestnut and maple, and
rare plants such as an indigenous narcissus. Some 100 miles of
marked trails are open daily during daylight. Admission is free,
but the park management recommends that visits deep inside the park
be led by local guides (about $71 to $106 a day, at 141 pesetas to
the dollar).
</P>
<P>
   The easiest access from Granada is on Highway 395 toward the
Sierra Nevada ski resort at Prado Llano. The park's Dornajo
information center is on this road at kilometer 23. One can enter
the park there, or drive 30 minutes more along the same road to the
Hoya de la Mora parking area, closer to the base of Veleta Peak.
The Dornajo center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 4:30
to 7 p.m. (until 8 in summer). Information: (34) 958-340-625.

   Caymans History, With a Video
</P>
<P>
   The Cayman Islands' first national historic landmark, a great
house overlooking the sea, opened a visitor center with a theater
in December.
</P>
<P>
   The plantation house, Pedro St. James, once the home of an
English cotton grower and turtle harvester, William Eden, is the
center of the Pedro St. James National Historic Site, a heritage
park on a limestone bluff in the Savannah District along Grand
Cayman's south coast. The house itself opened early last year.
</P>
<P>
   The spot is known as the Cayman Islands' birthplace of
democracy, because it was there, on Dec. 5, 1831, that the
islanders agreed to elect their first legislators. In 1835, an
Emancipation Proclamation ending slavery was read on the building's
Palladian-style steps.
</P>
<P>
   The original stone house was built by slaves in the late 18th
century and through the years has been battered by hurricanes,
struck by lightning, pillaged during a time of abandonment, and
badly burned, among other vicissitudes. The restoration reflects
West Indian design between 1780 and 1840, with verandas, rough-hewn
beams, wooden pegs, gables, mahogany floors and louvered wooden
shutters. The decor includes old candle sconces, brass hardware,
Sheffield silver, English antiques and reproductions typical of the
comforts brought to the West Indies by the colonists.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-seat theater shows a 24-minute video reviewing more than
200 years of Cayman Islands history, accompanied by special effects
such as wind, mist and the sound of banging shutters. Among other
attractions at the 7.5-acre park are a traditional outdoor kitchen,
a restored century-old wattle and daub cottage, medicinal herb and
vegetable gardens, palm-lined walkways, a restaurant, gift shop and
spectacular views of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Pedro St. James Historic Site, (345) 947-3329, is open 8:30
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $8, $4 for children; those under
6 are admitted free.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Rights Sites Mapped on the Web
</P>
<P>
   A new historical itinerary with maps and photos tracing events
in the civil rights movement has been introduced on the Web. From
photos of Sammy Davis Jr. and the Moulin Rouge, an integrated hotel
and theater opened in Las Vegas in 1955, to the home in Daytona
Beach, Fla., of the Rev. Howard Thurman, whose book was a mainstay
for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the site describes and
shows 42 places in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary, ``We Shall Overcome: Historic Places of the Civil
Rights Movement,'' is found at www.cr.nps.gov/nr. It was prepared
by the National Park Service, the Federal Highway Administration
and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation
Officers. Many of the buildings on the itinerary are on the
National Register of Historic Places, but some are gone, and some
that remain are not open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Printed out, the text and pictures become a guidebook for
exploration of a turbulent period and its antecedents.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K May Be Bumpy Abroad, U.S. Says
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has issued an announcement about possible
malfunctions of computer-based systems outside the United States as
of Jan. 1, 2000. Financial services, including A.T.M. machines,
credit cards and banking transfers, may be affected, the notice on
Jan. 29 said, along with transportation, medical facilities and
communications. The department said it would publish details as
they became available and by Oct. 1, the Consular Information Sheet
on each country would note what was known about that country's
preparations. These may be seen on the Internet at
travel.state.gov.

STAINING THE OLD SCHOOL TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Feb. 7)  
(JT) 
 By TOM CONNOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it seemed that nothing of value in American tradition
remained to be copied and exploited, Harvard and Yale have
announced an agreement to license their team logos from the 1930s
and '40s for a line of T-shirts, sweatshirts and baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   When I last heard, the gear _ meant to evoke George Bush in his
Yale baseball uniform, circa 1948 _ was coming to the market this
winter from a company named Pangea, owned by two brothers, Lee and
Dan Mirman.
</P>
<P>
   Call me old school, but I find this crass commercialization of
the contents of other peoples' lockers appalling (paradoxically, a
term college administrators often used to describe my behavior).
It's bad enough that Ralph Lauren has made a gazillion dollars
fabricating ready-made heritage out of whole cloth. Now, the
Brothers Mirman are about to turn old upper-class sweat into gold.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I begrudge others the right to wear whatever they
want. It's just that men of my generation and stripe _ guys who
went to school in the '60s and '70s _ spent decades buying,
borrowing, inheriting and slowly assembling wardrobes of such
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Why suffer the bad food of boarding school or the
competitiveness and affectations of an elitist college, if
graduates of, say, Eddie Vedder Senior High School or Lafayette
Air-Conditioning Institute, can go into any store and come out
looking as if they prepped at St. Grottlesex?
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the current generation of preppies and Ivy League
students wear nothing  &UR; but &LR;  baseball caps and T-shirts. Or that new
traditional clothing looks far better than anything ex-preppies and
Ivy League undergraduates ever wore.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in The New York Times last November, the line of
vintage Harvard and Yale sports gear is intended to look ``as if
it's been worn 100 times,'' said Lee Mirman (a graduate of Eddie
Vedder High  &UR; and &LR;  Lafayette Air-Conditioning Institute, I believe,
although I could be completely wrong about this).
</P>
<P>
   What the new traditional clothes lack, of course, is an actual
history. Someone, in fact, once suggested passage of a law that
would require a check of school transcripts before people be
allowed into a Ralph Lauren store (perhaps it was me). At any rate,
there really is only one practical solution.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud to introduce Old School, a line of authentic men's
wear from my personal collection of vintage prep school and college
clothes. What these ancient garments are still doing in my closet,
I have no idea, but I no longer need them:
</P>
<P>
   _They're boring.
</P>
<P>
   _I would never want to appear so mired in the past that I've
continued to hold onto prep and college memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   _I don't want to look like someone who can't afford Polo.
</P>
<P>
   _In a complicated deal worked out between my parents and the
college administration, in exchange for allowing me to finish the
term, I agreed never to appear in public wearing anything that in
any way might link me to the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I think Old School clothes would look really good on
somebody else. So, the following is a sample selection of authentic
items from my spring catalog (prices available on request).
</P>
<P>
   BLUE BLAZER
</P>
<P>
   This classic prep school item is richly redolent of a brewing
accident in which a gallon jug of cider and raisins exploded in my
closet during the latter stages of fermentation. The jacket also
features a prominent stain in front (recent lab work has revealed
the substance to be chipped beef with a trace element of
saltpeter), and crib notes for ``The Lord of the Flies''
handwritten on the lining. &QL; 
ITEMS IN STOCK One. &QL; 
SIZE 38 short. &QL; 
CIRCA 1964. &QL; 
PROVENANCE Brooks Brothers. &QL; 
AUTHENTICATING DETAIL It smells bad.
</P>
<P>
   BAGGY KHAKIS
</P>
<P>
   Khakis epitomize the studied casualness that's at the heart of
the Old School look. These drab, shapeless slacks appear too bored
to be concerned with fashion. Although the pant legs tend to
balloon in winds above five knots, making short men like me look as
though they're wearing spinnakers, with a little tacking you can
sail into class or the office well ahead of the fleet. Come with
rep ties for belts. &QL; 
ITEMS IN STOCK Five or six. &QL; 
SIZES 28 to 34 waist. &QL; 
CIRCA 1968-72. &QL; 
PROVENANCE The Andover Shop; J. Press, and Max Keezer's Used
Clothing, Cambridge, Mass.; various roommates. &QL; 
AUTHENTICATING DETAIL Presoaked in ennui.
</P>
<P>
   DUCT-TAPED LOAFERS
</P>
<P>
   Like khakis, taped Weejuns, Top-Siders or tassled loafers allow
one to wear traditional class status symbols while appearing not to
give a hot damn. What's more, a roll or two of silver duct tape
transforms boring shoes into objects of mystery and value. Must be
worn without socks. (Historical footnote: during the mid- to
late-'60s, when socks were still mandatory for class, shoe polish
was sometimes applied directly to the ankles.) &QL; 
ITEMS IN STOCK Three. &QL; 
SIZES 8 and 9. &QL; 
CIRCA 1964-72. &QL; 
PROVENANCE Various retail stores. &QL; 
AUTHENTICATING DETAIL Handed down from my maternal grandfather, the
tape on these loafers was once actually used to repair ducts
(whatever they are).
</P>
<P>
   PINK LACOSTE SHIRT
</P>
<P>
   The original polo shirt, this was worn under both sports jackets
and dress shirts, and sometimes even with ties, but always with the
collar up. (A WASP affectation I've never understood, frankly. And
why pink?) Remarkably boring when worn with khakis. Nothing
interesting ever happened in this shirt. &QL; 
ITEMS IN STOCK One. &QL; 
SIZE Large. &QL; 
CIRCA 1970. &QL; 
PROVENANCE I forget. &QL; 
AUTHENTICATING DETAIL Collar cannot be turned down.
</P>
<P>
   CLUB TIE
</P>
<P>
   Preknotted to slip over the head at the last minute before
classes or meals in Commons, or to be hung on the doorknob when
entertaining women in the dorm room. Today, ties like this are as
rare as they are pathetically and irrevocably obsolete. Yet, by
virtue of its affiliation with a prefeminist, exclusive, male
social club, the item retains some charm. When worn as a headband
to a rugby match, it lends the wearer a snobbishness of a
particularly devious sort. &QL; 
ITEMS IN STOCK: One. &QL; 
CIRCA 1971. &QL; 
PROVENANCE Owl Club. &QL; 
AUTHENTICATING DETAIL Stiffened by blood, sweat and Watney's Red
Barrel Ale, this tie can be held straight out without bending.

   AMMAN _ King Hussein returned Friday to die in Jordan after
treatment for his cancer in the U.S. failed. He was rushed from the
plane in an ambulance to a closely guarded hospital where a palace
official said he was ``near death.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, mosques were packed with people
praying for the king's recovery. ``I hope God gives him more
days,'' said one Jordanian who had just left a mosque. ``The
Jordanians and the Palestinians both liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the king's doctor said that his ``internal organs had
failed'' after an unsuccessful bone-marrow transplant. During his
flight from the U.S. he was kept alive by a life support system.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein has ruled Jordan since 1953. He will be succeeded
by his eldest son Abdullah, appointed his heir only two weeks ago,
when the king briefly returned to Jordan declaring himself cured.
He suffered an almost immediate relapse.
</P>
<P>
   As rain lashed down on the Jordanian capital Friday Jordanian
radio played solemn music, but said only that the king had come
back to go into hospital. Jordanians are relying on foreign radios
and satellite television for up-to-date information on the king's
heath.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein spent his years as monarch trying to fend off
threats from his four powerful neighbors: Israel, Iraq, Syria and
Saudi Arabia. He frequently switched alliances, trying to keep
close to the U.S. without offending Arab nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   His death will create uncertainty in one of the pivotal states
in the Middle East since so little is known about his successor.
His decision to remove his brother Hassan, Crown Prince for 34
years, whose political views were known, a week before his health
finally collapsed has increased anxiety about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah has strong support among senior officers
in the army and security services and will take over the throne
without resistance. But the last minute change in the succession
may lead to longer term divisions within the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The king has faced serious political difficulties since the Gulf
war when 350,000 Jordanians of Palestinian origin were expelled
from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, which has produced
few political and no economic benefits. He also shifted decisively
against Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, in 1995 creating anger
against him in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the twists and turns of his policy the king was
genuinely popular among ordinary Jordanians, few of whom have known
any other monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Parties have been cancelled in the capital over the last week
and there was a minor run on the banks. Some people were openly
crying in the streets Friday morning as they heard the news that
the king was close to death. &QL;

   AMMAN _ King Hussein returned Friday to die in Jordan after
treatment for his cancer in the U.S. failed. He was rushed from the
plane in an ambulance to a closely guarded hospital where a palace
official said he was ``near death.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, mosques were packed with people
praying for the king's recovery. ``I hope God gives him more
days,'' said one Jordanian who had just left a mosque. ``The
Jordanians and the Palestinians both liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the king's doctor said that his ``internal organs had
failed'' after an unsuccessful bone-marrow transplant. During his
flight from the U.S. he was kept alive by a life support system.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein has ruled Jordan since 1953. He will be succeeded
by his eldest son Abdullah, appointed his heir only two weeks ago,
when the king briefly returned to Jordan declaring himself cured.
He suffered an almost immediate relapse.
</P>
<P>
   As rain lashed down on the Jordanian capital Friday Jordanian
radio played solemn music, but said only that the king had come
back to go into hospital. Jordanians are relying on foreign radios
and satellite television for up-to-date information on the king's
heath.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein spent his years as monarch trying to fend off
threats from his four powerful neighbors: Israel, Iraq, Syria and
Saudi Arabia. He frequently switched alliances, trying to keep
close to the U.S. without offending Arab nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   His death will create uncertainty in one of the pivotal states
in the Middle East since so little is known about his successor.
His decision to remove his brother Hassan, Crown Prince for 34
years, whose political views were known, a week before his health
finally collapsed has increased anxiety about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah has strong support among senior officers
in the army and security services and will take over the throne
without resistance. But the last minute change in the succession
may lead to longer term divisions within the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The king has faced serious political difficulties since the Gulf

 By MARIA ZATE 
 c. 1999 Hispanic Business 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The face of America is changing, and it shows in the nation's
advertising. More and more one can find Hispanic names and faces in
print, television, radio, and outdoor ads. Salma Hayek smiles for
Revlon in slick fashion magazines. Daisy Fuentes appears alongside
Ed McMahon to push Philips televisions, and Oscar de la Hoya touts
the virtues of dialing 10-10-321.
 &HT;    Hispanic faces and names push products in both Spanish-language
and English-language ads. In the case of the latter, Hispanic
images and themes are gaining increased visibility. Taco Bell
created a stir earlier this year with quirky spots starring a tiny
Chihuahua and his giant appetite for fast-food tacos. Some thought
the ad was exploitive, others found it creative. But most people
remembered the English-language ads because of the Chihuahua's now
famous Spanish words: ``Yo Quiero Taco Bell.''
 &HT;    Could the Taco Bell ad have been conceived as a viable spot five
years ago? Would it even have made it on TV back then? Probably
not. Whatever one's thoughts about the ad, Taco Bell and its
persistent Chihuahua exemplify a trend: the growing influence of
Hispanic culture in this country.
 &HT;    Hispanics in the United States continue to make their presence
known and felt. They number 30.3 million this year, a 20 percent
increase from 25.3 million in 1993, according to HispanTelligence,
the research unit of Hispanic Business Inc. And they are
increasingly exerting power at the cash register. Hispanic
purchasing power has ballooned to $273.40 billion this year, a jump
of nearly 33 percent from $205.98 billion just five years ago.
 &HT;    Given these numbers, it's not surprising that more advertisers
would choose to target the Hispanic market. Overall advertising
expenditures in the Hispanic market this year are expected to top
$1.7 billion, according to HispanTelligence. That marks a 21
percent jump from last year's total, and the highest year-to-year
percentage increase since 1993. In only five years, total ad
expenditures in the Hispanic market have more than doubled from
$829.73 million.
 &HT;    A look at the growth in ad spending among those with the deepest
pockets reveals plenty about the prevailing confidence in Hispanic
buying power. This year's top five advertisers alone have
dramatically increased ad spending compared to five years ago.
 &HT;    For example, Procter &AMP; Gamble, which spent an estimated $31.6
million to reach the Hispanic market in 1993, will spend $42
million this year _ a jump of 33 percent. Five years ago, Procter &AMP;
Gamble was the clear leader among Top 50 advertisers, spending
three times more on Hispanic marketing than the No. 2 advertiser at
the time, Anheuser-Busch (which had a Hispanic ad budget of $9.9
million in 1993). Today, Procter &AMP; Gamble remains in the No. 1
spot, but Sears _ the No. 2 advertiser this year with spending of
$25 million _ has closed the gap.
 &HT;    Sears has upped its Hispanic ad spending by 400 percent since
1993. Likewise, telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T has increased its
Hispanic market budget 184 percent from $6.7 million to $19 million
over the same period. AT&AMP;T's rival, MCI WorldCom, has enlarged its
Hispanic ad spending by a whopping 673 percent since 1993, from
$2.2 million to $17 million. And General Motors made big news last
year when it poured an additional $10 million into its Hispanic
marketing efforts. GM is expected to spend $17.5 million on
Hispanic marketing this year, a dizzying 775 percent increase over
the $2 million it spent in 1993 [see chart].
 &HT;    Companies spending less than the minimum $3.15 million needed to
make the Top 50 list this year have contributed more to the total
volume of advertisers targeting the Hispanic market than in years
past. This influx of firms with smaller Hispanic ad budgets is a
big reason U.S. Hispanic ad expenditures reached their highest
level ever.
 &HT;    Aside from its growing population and spending power, the
nation's Hispanic community appeals to advertisers for other
reasons as well.
 &HT;    The latest Census Bureau data show that Hispanics tend to be
younger than the overall population. U.S Hispanics average 26 years
of age, compared to 34 for non-Hispanics. Also, Hispanic families
are larger than those of other U.S. ethnic groups, and they tend to
have more children under 18 living at home.
 &HT;    Census statistics further reveal that Hispanics tend to have
distinct consumption patterns. They spend more on food eaten at
home; buy more beef, pork, poultry, and other meats as well as
fruits and vegetables; and they spend more on telephone expenses,
clothing, footwear, and personal care products and services. These
numbers clearly present opportunities for savvy advertisers looking
to expand their markets.
 &HT;    ``We don't do ethnic marketing just for the sake of saying that
we do ethnic marketing,'' says John Garcia, senior vice-president
of sales and distribution for cellular phone service provider
Sprint PCS in Kansas City. ``We use Hispanic marketing because for
us it's a good fit. In the Hispanic culture, keeping in touch with
family is very important. We have a product that this group really
needs.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Sprint PCS expanded its Hispanic marketing
to Southern California, adding to ongoing efforts in Texas and
Florida. The marketing mix includes sponsorship of events and a
Spanish-language customer help line, along with print, TV, and
radio ads in Spanish.
 &HT;    Hispanics also wield considerable purchasing power where
big-ticket items are concerned. According to a study by Chicago
Title and Trust Co. released last summer, Hispanics comprised 70.9
percent of the nation's first-time home buyers in 1997, a 12
percent increase from 1996 when Hispanics accounted for 63.5
percent.
 &HT;    The Chicago Title and similar studies have helped fuel an
increase in Hispanic marketing efforts by real estate firms,
mortgage companies, and banks in recent years.
 &HT;    Advertisers looking to capture a slice of the Hispanic market
continue to carve out territory by pouring money into specific
geographic regions, known as designated market areas (DMAs).
Hispanic purchasing power is concentrated in five DMAs around the
nation: Los Angeles, Miami-Fort Lauderdale, New York, Houston, and
Chicago.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles, the largest Hispanic DMA in the United States,
Hispanic ad spending will exceed $200 million this year, nearly a
23 percent increase over last year.
 &HT;    Not only is more money being spent in the top Hispanic DMAs, but
advertisers now have more choices when it comes to how their
message is delivered to Hispanic consumers. There are now more
radio stations and formats, magazines and newspapers, and TV
programs and stations that specifically target the Hispanic market
than five years ago.
 &HT;    In the Los Angeles market, there are now four Spanish-language
TV stations, with the latest addition from Liberman Broadcasting.
This veteran Spanish-language radio company began its foray into
television last August with KRCA, a full-power station that airs
7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. weekdays. It joins the big three already in
the market: Univision's KMEX, Telemundo's KVEA, and independent
station KWHY, owned by Harriscope of Los Angeles. All three are
among the top 10 billing stations in the nation, but Liberman
believes more money can be wrung from the market.
 &HT;    Beyond the increase in media outlets, the variety of programming
airing on radio and television is also growing.
 &HT;    Jeff Valdez, who fronts Si TV in Los Angeles, is among several
new producers who believe they can cash in on the changes taking
place. Si TV is a production company specializing in
English-language, Hispanic-themed programming. It produces the
English-language comedy show ``Funny is Funny'' for the
Spanish-language Galavision network on cable.
 &HT;    ``Five years ago, people called me an activist because I wanted
to do Latino programming,'' says Valdez. ``But I saw it as a
business opportunity. It wasn't about politics. It was about
dollars and cents!''
 &HT;    In music sales, the Hispanic market is definitely paying off for
the recording industry. Latin music sales jumped 25 percent last
year while the overall U.S. music market shrank by 2.4 percent,
according to the Recording Industry Association of America. In
1996, sales of Latin music (defined as product that is 51 percent
or more Spanish-language) totaled $391.7 million, increasing to
$490.7 million last year. The proliferation of Spanish-language
radio stations and Spanish-language music video programs
undoubtedly contributed to the increase.
 &HT;    Perhaps the biggest news in the Spanish-language media market
this year was the purchase of the Telemundo network by Sony
Pictures Entertainment and its partners, Liberty Media, Apollo
Management, and Bastion Capital. Sony hopes to lure viewers away
from competitors such as rival Univision with new programming that
focuses on the Hispanic experience in the United States.
 &HT;    Billings at the nation's top Hispanic advertising agencies also
show the tremendous growth compared to five years ago. In 1993, the
top 10 ad agencies had a total of $473.2 million in billings,
according to the Se Habla Espanol media and marketing newsletter.
The No. 1 agency at the time, Font &AMP; Vaamonde, reported billings of
$75.6 million, while the No. 2 agency _ Sosa, Bromely &AMP; Aguilar
(now known as Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates) _ had $66 million in
billings.
 &HT;    But last year the Top 10 ad agencies billed more than $533
million. The Bravo Group in New York was the No. 1 agency with $128
million, and Bromley Aguilar was ranked No. 2 with $122 million in
billings, an increase of nearly 85 percent in just four years.
 &HT;    ``For those of us who have been in the Hispanic marketing arena
for the last decade, it's really validating to see the changes in
advertising in the United States,'' says Adolfo Aguilar, president
and chief creative officer of Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San
Antonio.
 &HT;    ``America is changing every day. People always talk about the
influence of North American culture on Latinos,'' he says, ``but
there's also role reversal going on as well. Latinos are now
influencing the general market. And we have the numbers to prove
it.''

1993. Likewise, telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T has increased its
Hispanic market budget 184 percent from $6.7 million to $19 million
over the same period. AT&AMP;T's rival, MCI WorldCom, has enlarged its
Hispanic ad spending by a whopping 673 percent since 1993, from
$2.2 million to $17 million. And General Motors made big news last
year when it poured an additional $10 million into its Hispanic
marketing efforts. GM is expected to spend $17.5 million on
Hispanic marketing this year, a dizzying 775 percent increase over
the $2 million it spent in 1993 [see chart].
 &HT;    Companies spending less than the minimum $3.15 million needed to
make the Top 50 list this year have contributed more to the total
volume of advertisers targeting the Hispanic market than in years
past. This influx of firms with smaller Hispanic ad budgets is a
big reason U.S. Hispanic ad expenditures reached their highest
level ever.
 &HT;    Aside from its growing population and spending power, the
nation's Hispanic community appeals to advertisers for other
reasons as well.
 &HT;    The latest Census Bureau data show that Hispanics tend to be
younger than the overall population. U.S Hispanics average 26 years
of age, compared to 34 for non-Hispanics. Also, Hispanic families
are larger than those of other U.S. ethnic groups, and they tend to
have more children under 18 living at home.
 &HT;    Census statistics further reveal that Hispanics tend to have
distinct consumption patterns. They spend more on food eaten at
home; buy more beef, pork, poultry, and other meats as well as
fruits and vegetables; and they spend more on telephone expenses,
clothing, footwear, and personal care products and services. These
numbers clearly present opportunities for savvy advertisers looking
to expand their markets.
 &HT;    ``We don't do ethnic marketing just for the sake of saying that
we do ethnic marketing,'' says John Garcia, senior vice-president
of sales and distribution for cellular phone service provider
Sprint PCS in Kansas City. ``We use Hispanic marketing because for
us it's a good fit. In the Hispanic culture, keeping in touch with
family is very important. We have a product that this group really
needs.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Sprint PCS expanded its Hispanic marketing
to Southern California, adding to ongoing efforts in Texas and
Florida. The marketing mix includes sponsorship of events and a
Spanish-language customer help line, along with print, TV, and
radio ads in Spanish.
 &HT;    Hispanics also wield considerable purchasing power where
big-ticket items are concerned. According to a study by Chicago
Title and Trust Co. released last summer, Hispanics comprised 70.9
percent of the nation's first-time home buyers in 1997, a 12
percent increase from 1996 when Hispanics accounted for 63.5
percent.
 &HT;    The Chicago Title and similar studies have helped fuel an
increase in Hispanic marketing efforts by real estate firms,
mortgage companies, and banks in recent years.
 &HT;    Advertisers looking to capture a slice of the Hispanic market
continue to carve out territory by pouring money into specific
geographic regions, known as designated market areas (DMAs).
Hispanic purchasing power is concentrated in five DMAs around the
nation: Los Angeles, Miami-Fort Lauderdale, New York, Houston, and
Chicago.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles, the largest Hispanic DMA in the United States,
Hispanic ad spending will exceed $200 million this year, nearly a
23 percent increase over last year.
 &HT;    Not only is more money being spent in the top Hispanic DMAs, but
advertisers now have more choices when it comes to how their
message is delivered to Hispanic consumers. There are now more
radio stations and formats, magazines and newspapers, and TV
programs and stations that specifically target the Hispanic market
than five years ago.
 &HT;    In the Los Angeles market, there are now four Spanish-language
TV stations, with the latest addition from Liberman Broadcasting.
This veteran Spanish-language radio company began its foray into
television last August with KRCA, a full-power station that airs
7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. weekdays. It joins the big three already in
the market: Univision's KMEX, Telemundo's KVEA, and independent
station KWHY, owned by Harriscope of Los Angeles. All three are
among the top 10 billing stations in the nation, but Liberman
believes more money can be wrung from the market.
 &HT;    Beyond the increase in media outlets, the variety of programming
airing on radio and television is also growing.
 &HT;    Jeff Valdez, who fronts Si TV in Los Angeles, is among several
new producers who believe they can cash in on the changes taking
place. Si TV is a production company specializing in
English-language, Hispanic-themed programming. It produces the
English-language comedy show ``Funny is Funny'' for the
Spanish-language Galavision network on cable.
 &HT;    ``Five years ago, people called me an activist because I wanted
to do Latino programming,'' says Valdez. ``But I saw it as a
business opportunity. It wasn't about politics. It was about
dollars and cents!''
 &HT;    In music sales, the Hispanic market is definitely paying off for
the recording industry. Latin music sales jumped 25 percent last
year while the overall U.S. music market shrank by 2.4 percent,
according to the Recording Industry Association of America. In
1996, sales of Latin music (defined as product that is 51 percent
or more Spanish-language) totaled $391.7 million, increasing to
$490.7 million last year. The proliferation of Spanish-language
radio stations and Spanish-language music video programs
undoubtedly contributed to the increase.
 &HT;    Perhaps the biggest news in the Spanish-language media market
this year was the purchase of the Telemundo network by Sony
Pictures Entertainment and its partners, Liberty Media, Apollo
Management, and Bastion Capital. Sony hopes to lure viewers away
from competitors such as rival Univision with new programming that
focuses on the Hispanic experience in the United States.
 &HT;    Billings at the nation's top Hispanic advertising agencies also
show the tremendous growth compared to five years ago. In 1993, the
top 10 ad agencies had a total of $473.2 million in billings,
according to the Se Habla Espanol media and marketing newsletter.
The No. 1 agency at the time, Font &AMP; Vaamonde, reported billings of
$75.6 million, while the No. 2 agency _ Sosa, Bromely &AMP; Aguilar
(now known as Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates) _ had $66 million in
billings.
 &HT;    But last year the Top 10 ad agencies billed more than $533
million. The Bravo Group in New York was the No. 1 agency with $128
million, and Bromley Aguilar was ranked No. 2 with $122 million in
billings, an increase of nearly 85 percent in just four years.
 &HT;    ``For those of us who have been in the Hispanic marketing arena
for the last decade, it's really validating to see the changes in
advertising in the United States,'' says Adolfo Aguilar, president
and chief creative officer of Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San
Antonio.
 &HT;    ``America is changing every day. People always talk about the
influence of North American culture on Latinos,'' he says, ``but
there's also role reversal going on as well. Latinos are now
influencing the general market. And we have the numbers to prove
it.''

 c. 1999 Hispanic Business 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The face of America is changing, and it shows in the nation's
advertising. More and more one can find Hispanic names and faces in
print, television, radio, and outdoor ads. Salma Hayek smiles for
Revlon in slick fashion magazines. Daisy Fuentes appears alongside
Ed McMahon to push Philips televisions, and Oscar de la Hoya touts
the virtues of dialing 10-10-321.
 &HT;    Hispanic faces and names push products in both Spanish-language
and English-language ads. In the case of the latter, Hispanic
images and themes are gaining increased visibility. Taco Bell
created a stir earlier this year with quirky spots starring a tiny
Chihuahua and his giant appetite for fast-food tacos. Some thought
the ad was exploitive, others found it creative. But most people
remembered the English-language ads because of the Chihuahua's now
famous Spanish words: ``Yo Quiero Taco Bell.''
 &HT;    Could the Taco Bell ad have been conceived as a viable spot five
years ago? Would it even have made it on TV back then? Probably
not. Whatever one's thoughts about the ad, Taco Bell and its
persistent Chihuahua exemplify a trend: the growing influence of
Hispanic culture in this country.
 &HT;    Hispanics in the United States continue to make their presence
known and felt. They number 30.3 million this year, a 20 percent
increase from 25.3 million in 1993, according to HispanTelligence,
the research unit of Hispanic Business Inc. And they are
increasingly exerting power at the cash register. Hispanic
purchasing power has ballooned to $273.40 billion this year, a jump
of nearly 33 percent from $205.98 billion just five years ago.
 &HT;    Given these numbers, it's not surprising that more advertisers
would choose to target the Hispanic market. Overall advertising
expenditures in the Hispanic market this year are expected to top
$1.7 billion, according to HispanTelligence. That marks a 21
percent jump from last year's total, and the highest year-to-year
percentage increase since 1993. In only five years, total ad
expenditures in the Hispanic market have more than doubled from
$829.73 million.
 &HT;    A look at the growth in ad spending among those with the deepest
pockets reveals plenty about the prevailing confidence in Hispanic
buying power. This year's top five advertisers alone have
dramatically increased ad spending compared to five years ago.
 &HT;    For example, Procter &AMP; Gamble, which spent an estimated $31.6
million to reach the Hispanic market in 1993, will spend $42
million this year _ a jump of 33 percent. Five years ago, Procter &AMP;
Gamble was the clear leader among Top 50 advertisers, spending
three times more on Hispanic marketing than the No. 2 advertiser at
the time, Anheuser-Busch (which had a Hispanic ad budget of $9.9
million in 1993). Today, Procter &AMP; Gamble remains in the No. 1
spot, but Sears _ the No. 2 advertiser this year with spending of
$25 million _ has closed the gap.
 &HT;    Sears has upped its Hispanic ad spending by 400 percent since
1993. Likewise, telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T has increased its
Hispanic market budget 184 percent from $6.7 million to $19 million
over the same period. AT&AMP;T's rival, MCI WorldCom, has enlarged its
Hispanic ad spending by a whopping 673 percent since 1993, from
$2.2 million to $17 million. And General Motors made big news last
year when it poured an additional $10 million into its Hispanic
marketing efforts. GM is expected to spend $17.5 million on
Hispanic marketing this year, a dizzying 775 percent increase over
the $2 million it spent in 1993 [see chart].
 &HT;    Companies spending less than the minimum $3.15 million needed to
make the Top 50 list this year have contributed more to the total
volume of advertisers targeting the Hispanic market than in years
past. This influx of firms with smaller Hispanic ad budgets is a
big reason U.S. Hispanic ad expenditures reached their highest
level ever.
 &HT;    Aside from its growing population and spending power, the

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mention her name and the response is universal: Now, that girl
can sing!
 &HT;    Her voice takes you back to the good old days _ no synthesizers
or modern technology needed, just God-given talent. She's another
musical diva who will go down in history along with Aretha, Gladys
and Anita.
 &HT;    It doesn't matter if you're in the studio or at a music industry
function, on the A-train going to Harlem or driving in your car
down the sunrise highway, everyone agrees Kelly Price is all that!
 &HT;    Standng 5-foot-8 and tipping the scales at 200-plus, the
full-figured singer is confident and ready for the world. Her first
single, ``Friend of Mine,'' on her debut album, ``Soul of a
Woman,'' has made a big splash and continues to climb the charts.
The 25-year-old wife and mother of two has taken the music industry
by storm. Though her name has just reached the lips of many music
lovers, her soulful voice has been in the shadows for years.
 &HT;    Price, a native of Queens, N.Y., sang backup for Mariah Carey
and belted out the hooks on Biggie's 1997 ``Mo Money Mo Problems''
and Mase's ``Feel So Good.'' She's no stranger to the spotlight,
even though critics said she would never make her mark in the music
world until she shed some pounds.
 &HT;    ``I had a lot of doors closed in my face, even though I was
known,'' Price reveals during an interview with BLACK ELEGANCE
magazine. ``I was told that my weight would always be a problem for
me. So I dropped weight, then gained weight. I struggled with the
weight game for so long but it's no longer a problem for me. I am
free creatively and I know who I am. I'm comfortable with my life
even though I am the heaviest I've ever been. The difference now is
my attitude. I realize the weight does not define me or make me
unhappy. I am just free and there's nothing anyone can say about my
size that could bother me.''
 &HT;    Price, who had been singing in church since she was a little
girl, knew her voice was powerful; but it was the harsh words of
the critics that made her persevere and remember that success is
the greatest revenge of all.
 &HT;    ``I am happy being a thick Black woman,'' Price admits. ``I
don't let the dress size bother me any more. People used to say
that my weight was the one thing that would hinder me _ but the
only thing those people can do now is look. I always felt that God
had a plan for me and He did. He did it in His time, which is fine
by me.''
 &HT;    Price's journey has been long. She says her professional career
began at age 18 when, in 1992, her long-time friend, Darryl
Douglas, was hired to put a choir together for singer George
Michael, who was on tour in New York. One of the first people he
called was Price. Douglas had done such a good job for Michael that
he was hired to do the same thing for Mariah Carey, and Kelly was
also part of that choir.
 &HT;    ``The rest of the choir had taken a break one day and I stayed
behind with my sister.'' Kelly recalls. ``Darryl and I started to
sing. Mariah walked into the room but I didn't know it. She heard
me sing ... she just stood there the entire time. After the break,
Mariah smiled at me and I took my place with the choir.''
 &HT;    Later that day, Mariah Carey's background singers spoke to Price
on their boss's behalf and asked her to sing. Kelly didn't know it
at the time but Carey was in the wings listening closely. The
singers exchanged numbers and a week later, someone from Carey's
camp called to find out if Price was available to do MTV Unplugged
with them. ``I accepted the invitation and stayed with Mariah for a
little more than five years,'' says Price. ``I got a chance to do
some things but I spent most of my time watching what was going on
around me. I had a good time with Mariah and had a chance to travel
around the world with her, but I wanted more. I was doing very well
as a background singer and it was a hard decision to leave. I made
good money with Mariah and it was hard to walk away from a good
paycheck on a regular basis, to go out and start from scratch and
try to build myself up on my own. It was hard but it proved to be
the right decision.''
 &HT;    People in the music industry knew Price could sing but her dream
was to write and produce songs, too. Kelly Price never let
rejection get her down. She continued to write songs with the
belief that she would one day get a chance to do her thing, her
way. Then it happened again. By chance, Sean ``Puffy'' Combs heard
her sing.
 &HT;    ``I was with some friends (in a studio) and Puffy walked by
while I was singing,'' she says. ``He came back into the room and
spoke to my friends. I did not know Puffy was in the room. I was
just singing. When I turned around, he told me I have a beautiful
voice. I quickly made up some words and sang to his tracks and we
exchanged numbers.''
 &HT;    The next day, Puffy called and offered Price some work. She went
into the studio to do background vocals and he kept her busy,
working on his songs, four or five times a week. From working with
Puffy, Price met Ronald Isley and the rest is history. Isley signed
Price to T-Neck/Island Black Music _ and her self-composed,
14-track CD gets hotter by the day.
 &HT;    With a hot new CD and tour, Price says she will also do some
acting. Starring in the upcoming movie ``Dream Girls,'' she'll play
the character, Effie.
 &HT;    ``This is something new for me but I think I can handle it,''
Price says. ``Effie dealt with the same kind of prejudices that I
face (as a full-figured singer) and when the director came to me
about the role, I couldn't believe it. I was like `Ooooh my God'
because I am Effie. I know all about her pain and struggle.''
 &HT;    When it comes to dreams, Price's really did come true. ``I
encourage people to keep working at their craft and believe they
can do whatever they set out to do.
 &HT;    ``Don't let anything stop you.''

Q &AMP; A ON `X': SCENES WE'D LIKE TO SEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since ``The X-Files'' debuted on Sept. 10, 1993, I've written
about the show 19 times. (OK, with this story, it's an even 20.)
Still, after six seasons of regular viewing, I remain no closer to
the truth than Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) or Dana
Scully (Gillian Anderson).
</P>
<P>
   According to the commercials promising ``full disclosure,'' the
haze of mystery should lift Sunday when Fox airs ``Two Fathers,''
the first of a two-part episode that purports to clear up the
series' six-season ``mythology'' once and for all _ while asking a
few new questions along the way. (The second part, ``One Son,''
airs Feb. 14.)
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than serve up any more sanctimonious hypothesizing
about what I think the whole alien invasion/abduction mumbo jumbo
REALLY means, here's five years of questions with some answers I'd
like to see:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the dark syndicate and what are its plans for
cooperation with alien colonization?
</P>
<P>
   A: There has been some speculation that this group is made up of
editors at Entertainment Weekly, considering the insane amount of
publicity the show gets from this magazine. But actually, the
syndicate is the mastermind of Rupert Murdoch, who will be
introduced as The Australian Man, a diminutive megalomaniac bent on
world domination by controlling all media.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is alien abduction just an elaborate hoax manufactured by the
world's governments to distract people from their real agenda?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What really happened to Mulder's sister, Samantha?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mulder never had a sister. Through regression therapy, he
learns that Samantha was in fact his imaginary friend, ``Bernie,''
a 600-pound purple dinosaur who later changed his name and
currently bewitches youngsters through hypnotically repetitious
tunes on an inane kid show in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) Mulder's
father?
</P>
<P>
   A: During a climactic battle, CSM will gaze into Mulder's eyes
and in a booming voice declare, ``Fox, I am your father.'' He'll
then cut off Mulder's cell phone-clutching hand with a light saber
and demand he join him in the dark syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that Krycek (Nicolas Lea) has the power to give A.D.
Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) a heart attack with the flip of a switch,
what are his plans?
</P>
<P>
   A: No plans. It's just a little payback for having to sit
through Wes Craven's ``Shocker.'' (Pileggi starred in it ...)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the black ooze?
</P>
<P>
   A: India ink with Wessonality? Actually, it's leftovers from the
Exxon Valdez spill possessed by the angry, restless spirits of
hundreds of suffocated bottle-nosed dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do the disease-carrying, Africanized bees fit in?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're actually the creation of The Easy Riding Man (Peter
Fonda in a guest appearance), a crazed beekeeper who causes
worldwide panic when he unleashes smallpox-laced honey called
``Ulee's Gold'' on the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the faceless alien rebels?
</P>
<P>
   A: High school reunioners promoting ``The Rage: Carrie 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Dana Scully-Mulder?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not gonna happen. During the sweeps week crossover craze,
Mulder will marry ``Melrose Place's'' soon-to-be-unemployed Amanda
(Heather Locklear) prompting Scully to lock horns with Nelle
(Portia de Rossi) for the affection of ``Ally McBeal'' legal eagle
John ``The Biscuit'' Cage (Peter MacNicol).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens now that all the mysteries have been solved?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coming next fall on Fox, the wacky new sitcom ``Three Lone
Gunmen and a Baby.''
</P>

TOOLBOX: A NECESSITY FOR EVERY HOME, APARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 7)   (EDs: Stands for HARDWARE-STORES.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's easy to develop a case of the gotta-haves
when traversing through a hardware store. There are so many handy
items on display, and so many jobs to do at home.
</P>
<P>
   And all good tools may come to those who acquire them over time.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're just starting out as a handyperson, you have to
begin at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the once male-dominated hardware market is heading
toward gender-neutral, according to some recent market research.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters (77 percent) of the retailers polled at
the Ace Hardware Corp. spring convention said that women are
shopping more at their stores. At least 56 percent of this group
reported a dramatic increase, and 65 percent said that an important
factor is that a great number of women are in charge of
single-family households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are tackling bigger home improvement and repair projects
than ever before,'' said Paul Erickson, consumer affairs manager
for Ace hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a survey by NFO Research Inc. for Owens Corning
showed that women are doing more of the planning, purchasing and in
many instances household installation of everything from wall
coverings to bookshelves and molding to appliances than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tend to be on the cautious side when tackling a project
and come in looking for a specific tool to do that job,'' said
Chris Baffuto, manager of Country True Value Hardware in East
Greenbush, N.Y. ``Whereas many men will tend to use whatever they
have handy to do the job. In many cases, the tools women buy are
the handiest they ever need to buy. Lots of tools are acquired in
this way. But when many men and women come into a hardware store,
it's like being in a candy shop.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're ready to establish your own toolbox, a trip to
almost any such candy shop should prove user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   A hammer and a few screwdrivers are a good place to start. But a
well-stocked toolbox for the self-sufficient homeowner or
apartment-dweller should include a variety of essentials (along
with a good how-to book for $10 to $20) that can help you repair
just about any problem or do any job that should arise.
</P>
<P>
   The first advice from those in the business is to make sure your
tools are all of good quality, as they will ultimately perform
better, last longer and in many cases work more safely.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to begin is buying a prepackaged starter tool kit,
which can cost from $25 to $50 depending on the quality and
contents. These kits most often contain a lightweight hammer, deep
socket wrenches, needle-nose pliers, open-end and box wrenches,
general all-purpose screwdrivers, staple gun, small There are
common tool sizes, meaning used most often, according to Jason
Dupuis, sales associate at Shaker Ace Hardware in Latham, N.Y. But
jobs frequently come up that require the odd size you don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it makes sense to invest in small sets of variety
packs, according to Dupuis, such as $11.49 for a six-piece
screwdriver set that includes various slotted (flat) and Phillips
(cross-shaped, pointed tip) screwdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are handy items that you don't normally think of
buying until you need them, such as a fully adjustable long-nose
vise grip for $17.49 that comes in handy for holding down sink
parts when tightening them, or loosening a nut.
</P>
<P>
   There's often a use (like gluing down that stubborn piece of
table veneer that's popping up) for a three-piece set of adjustable
C-clamps for $7.49. To tighten the odd bolt or nut, you might
consider a 6-inch adjustable wrench for $9.49.
</P>
<P>
   For gripping and turning, a pliers set can be invaluable, which
includes needle-nose pliers, flat-nose pliers and cutting pliers,
for around $22.99. This set is also perfect for repairing jewelry
and cutting picture-hanging wire.
</P>
<P>
   Minihacksaws for $2.79 cut through picture molding, steel pipes,
plaster, plastic, brass or thin tubing. General all-purpose shears
in large and small sizes can be found for around $12.99 for cutting
string, paper, annoying carpet and drapery threads.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the little things that count. One gizmo that
prevents a lot of frustration is a small horseshoe magnet for
between $4.99 and $9.79. This is used to pick up nails or metal
screws that fall on the floor or behind a radiator or large pieces
of furniture. Magnetized screwdrivers are convenient, as they hold
the screw until it's in place. One magnetized screwdriver handle
with five bits costs around $10.
</P>
<P>
   Tweezers for $5.79 also come in handy for holding jewelry or
other small items for repair or gluing. Also include in the kit a
flexible putty knife for $4.59, tube of super glue for $1.49, a
three-piece nail-setter set for $7.79 to countersink nails into
paneling so they don't stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the small list a $2.39 six-piece precision screwdriver
set and/or an $8.99 jeweler's screwdriver set for eyeglass and
small appliance repairs, and an all purpose church key for $1.09 to
open jars and bottle.
</P>
<P>
   You can also throw into the mix a general assortment package of
tacks, nails, brads, machine screws, nuts and bolts for $2.79 to
$3.49, a roll of electrical tape for $1.50 and a $3.29 ball of
strong white cable cord for small tying jobs, and perhaps a pair of
work gloves that cost $3.99 to $6.49 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   And don't rule out other important tools, like a glue gun ($8.99
to $13.79); Exacto knife ($3.29); and tape measure ($7.99 for a
25-foot tape).

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The professors teaching this semester's
hottest course at MIT's Sloan School of Management stopped taking
applications after 150 students signed up for the 76 available
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simply titled Electronic Commerce and Marketing, the course had
far fewer takers in the past. But that was before the Internet
revolution reshaped the business landscape and allowed even those
with modest resources to generate quick fortunes on the World Wide
Web. Now many business students who once imagined making their mark
on Wall Street or in consulting firms dream of careers in
cyberspace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the time when you could decide whether you would
continue building stagecoaches, or whether you would go to a
different company and start building cars,'' said Rob Bailey, a
second-year Sloan student enrolled in the course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen it like this,'' said William DeLey, another
student. ``Everybody wants to take advantage of this new movement,
the Internet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm seems finally to have created a critical mass at
top business schools, which have begun offering new courses and
programs aimed at helping students capitalize on the ever-growing
influence of on-line services and marketing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Business School, for example, has opened an office in
Silicon Valley to develop case studies for teaching classes about
Internet company start-ups. The school is also offering a wider
array of entrepreneurial courses for the increasing number of
students interested in founding their own technology firms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Sloan announced Wednesday that, to accommodate
growing student interest in the Internet, it will offer a new track
of courses in electronic commerce and on-line marketing. It also
plans to expand a separate Entrepreneurship Center to create and
sustain local technology companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts are under way at Vanderbilt University, in
Nashville. In Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University's business
school recently announced a one-year master's degree program to
train students to run Internet companies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hot deals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members say the new courses have been inspired, in part,
by the recent flurry of big Internet-related mergers and
stratospheric rise of stock values in companies such as on-line
bookseller Amazon.com and Web-search firm Yahoo Inc., both just a
few years old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The predominant view at business schools, at least until a few
years ago, was that the Internet is just another channel for the
distribution of advertising,'' said Donna Hoffman, a professor at
Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management. ``In that view,
the notion was just to make do with having a single Internet course
on the curriculum.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, high-tech firms from software giant
Microsoft Corp. to dozens of tiny Internet companies such as
Wellesley-based search engine firm Direct Hit Technologies have
come to represent the fastest-growing segment of the economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the academics are taking notice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiters and alums are making it clear that this isn't just
a small change in the way advertising works. This is a change in
almost all areas of commerce,'' Hoffman said. ``They want people
who can understand that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Chesnik, director of electronic commerce at Lycos Inc.,
the largest Internet company in Massachusetts, said he often seeks
business-school students to work on projects at the Waltham firm.
Students are ``attracted to the uncertainty'' that surrounds any
on-line ventures _ and to the possibilities for striking it rich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seeking fast impact &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One is Keith Law, who is finishing his MBA coursework at
Carnegie Mellon and is interviewing with companies in New England,
including several that create software to automate large telephone
``call centers'' used by banks and other service companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law, 25, said that he could make more money at a larger firm,
but that a role in a smaller company would be ``a heck of a lot
more interesting and unpredictable.'' His goal, he said, is to have
a quick impact on strategy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Sloan, considered one of the country's top business education
programs, the expansion of the electronic-commerce curriculum comes
as part of an effort by the school's new dean, Richard Schmalensee,
to foster more high-tech development in the area. The new program
will also include new research support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea for more e-commerce courses came as faculty struggled
to handle the unplanned rush of students this semester. Each class
in the two-year MBA program includes about 300 students. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bane of an administrator's existence, to get these
sudden shifts in demand'' for courses, Schmalensee said. ``A year
ago, people were banging on the door to get more finance courses so
they could go work for investment banks. We've never had this kind
of pressure'' for Internet courses, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Erik Brynjolfsson, who will direct the new MIT program, also
attributes the surge in demand to the growing importance of
technology in almost all segments of the economy. Even students who
plan to work in banks, financial services or manufacturing expect
those industries will be ``transformed by new forms of electronic
commerce,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the specific Internet curriculum has not yet been drawn
up, Brynjolfsson said he would like to hire as many as four new
faculty members to teach the new classes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee called that plan ``a wish list'' but said the number
of new faculty hires is under discussion. ``It's not like we've
suddenly received some wisdom and doctrine we can suddenly dole out
to students,'' he said. ``We're going to be learning with them as
to where this is going.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear are expansion plans for Sloan's Entrepreneurship
Center. Its director, Ken Morse, said he has pledges for $16
million toward his goal of raising $60 million by 2001. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the new electronic commerce courses, the center will
encourage students to work on field projects for technology
companies. The contacts often lead to job offers and, Morse said,
ideas for further study at MIT. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morse said he hopes both his center and the new courses will
apply fields like economics, finance and marketing to the expanding
world of electronic commerce. The goal, he said, will be to
``integrate the traditional disciplines into these hot new areas.''

<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   A military man, a field commander, Sandhurst graduate. King
Hussein had the disconcerting habit when I first met him of calling
me ``Sir'' _ he used it with everyone, a gesture of respect that
humbled the visitor (and was intended to).
</P>
<P>
   That's why we called him the Plucky Little King, the PLK. Honor
was the word that came to mind. He was an honorable man. He
believed that if he trusted enough in another person, his good
faith would be returned; he was cruelly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who betrayed his hopes will come to his funeral.
The Gulf rulers, for example, who never understood why he could not
condemn Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1991; the Israelis
who showed their respect for their peace treaty with King Hussein
by sending a murder squad to Amman last year; Yasser Arafat, who
allowed his Palestinian guerrillas to attempt a coup d'etat in 1970
and lied to him about his secret deal with Israel in 1994; and the
American president who repeatedly promised the king a just peace in
the Middle East _ and then proved too cowardly to confront the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   And we shall have to suffer all the glitzy adoration that the
guilty show for dead kings.
</P>
<P>
   We've already heard President Clinton's soliloquy _ ``a
wonderful human being...a champion of peace'' _ and we know what
Arafat will say because he's said it before: that King Hussein has
been a Salaheddin, the warrior knight who drove the crusaders from
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was the Israelis who drove the Hashemites from
Palestine, but Clinton's words _ despite the gutless nature of the
man who uttered them _ somehow got it right.
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   When the king arrived at the prison, Shubeilath delayed him ten
minutes while he said goodbye to his fellow inmates. Hussein waited
patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was also, in an odd way, a careless man. His folly at joining
Egypt's war against Israel in 1967 was compounded in 1990 by his
support for Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein demonstrated an equal but more personal recklessness _
hubris, perhaps? _ when he rode in the cold, rain-lashed streets of
Amman two weeks ago in an open-top car.
</P>
<P>
   After his first brush with cancer, I asked the king if he had
been cured of his illness. ``The doctors gave me an excellent bill
of health,'' he replied _ how painful those words sound now _ and
then I noticed the packet of cigarettes lying on the table in front
of him. ``Ah, yes,'' he said. ``These are the only things I haven't
yet given up.'' And he flicked his finger at the packet in disdain.
</P>
<P>
   If his desire for peace showed vision, he lacked foresight. With
their usual obsequiousness, western as well as Arab leaders have
been praising the King for returning to Jordan Jan. 19 to fire his
brother Hassan and create his eldest son crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting his affairs in order'' was what they called it. But
even if we ignore the lack of any democratic process for the
succession, it was a bit late in the day to start switching your
crown princes around.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had cemented relationships with scores of kings and
generals and presidents _ albeit not always impressive
relationships _ was suddenly replaced by a man who knew none of
them. No wonder Jordanians fear the future.
</P>
<P>
   For Prince Abdullah is going to have a spot of bother with the
kings and presidents at that funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for example, will be keen to get the new monarch to set
the Iraqi opposition up with hearth and home in Amman, perhaps even
to risk a little military foray into Iraq to set up a ``safe
haven'' for Saddam's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis would be smiling along with that idea. At which
point Saddam would become a threat. But refuse the United States
president _ which is what Jordanians would want him to do _ and
Abdullah may start his reign with an unsympathetic if not downright
hostile Washington at his back.
</P>
<P>
   Threaten Saddam and the Americans will love him. Ignore
Washington and his people will love him; it's the same old trap his
father walked into in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But what Abdullah cannot be is his father. If relations are
breaking down between Egypt and Sudan, call King Hussein. If
there's civil war in Lebanon, ask King Hussein's advice.
</P>
<P>
   When Arafat and Netanyahu cannot abide each other at the Wye
Plantation, drag King Hussein from his sick bed to sort them out _
much good did it do the monarch, who was betrayed yet again.
</P>
<P>
   But it symbolized what the PLK was so good at: defusing the
Middle East explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

breaking down between Egypt and Sudan, call King Hussein. If
there's civil war in Lebanon, ask King Hussein's advice.
</P>
<P>
   When Arafat and Netanyahu cannot abide each other at the Wye
Plantation, drag King Hussein from his sick bed to sort them out _
much good did it do the monarch, who was betrayed yet again.

   But it symbolized what the PLK was so good at: defusing the
Middle East explosion.

   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

SINK DOESN'T HOLD WATER ANY MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 07, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My bathroom sink works OK, now it doesn't hold water. The
stopper doesn't seem to be seating properly in the drain opening. I
bought a new pop-up stopper, but that doesn't work either. Now,
what can I do? I did not replace the arm that operates the stopper.
</P>
<P>
   CALLER, with a leaking sink
</P>
<P>
   A. You may not have had to replace the pop-up, if it can be
removed by pulling it up. Clean the stopper of debris, hair, oil,
and other gunk that may be stopping the stopper. Use a bleach/water
solution, and also pour a cup of bleach in the drain to dissolve
more grease and hair. Use a big bottle brush to clean the drain.
Wear skin and eye protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, adjust the lift rod and pivot rod that are
under and behind the sink and operate the stopper. Sometimes the
lift rod gets bent in an ``up'' position. You may be able to bend
it a bit back where it belongs, or if not that, adjust it by
loosening a set screw and lifting the rod slightly, and resetting
the screw.
</P>
<P>
   If the stopper is attached to the pivot rod, adjustment of the
rods is the only way you can get it to work again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house needs painting, and I think itwould be better if we
replace the shingles on two-and-a-half sides. Cabot, the paint
company, suggested to preprime the shingles and finish with a solid
color stain. Others said to use a semitransparent stain. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   GINA PARKINSON, Newto, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you feel you must replace the shingles on most of the
house, you might as well do the whole house. And if you do it all,
use white cedar shingles and let them weather; you won't have to
stain or paint them ever. But if you do not do all the house, you
will want the new shingles to match the old. Prepriming and solid
color latex stain will allow a good match.
</P>
<P>
   If you do the entire house, and want a color, then go with the
semitransparent stain. But choose a dark color to prevent cedar
bleed (brown stains caused by water leaching tanins from the cedar
onto the finish) from showing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a big problem, but don't laugh. My condo is on the
fourth and fifth floors of a building, with the entry on the third
floor. I have a fine old sofa that needs rebuilding,
reupholstering, and refinishing; the works. But we can't get it
down the stairs, not even out of our entryway. Believe me, my
husband and sons tried. The only way to get it out is through a
window, maybe, or from the roof, by crane. But before we do that,
are there any upholsterers, rebuilders, and finishers who might be
able to do the job ``in situ'' _ in the house?
</P>
<P>
   S.H., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Here's another answer shorter than the question. It beats the
heck out of the handyman. All you can do is try upholsterers in the
Yellow Pages. Which brings us to a handyman's question: Are there
any furniture men willing or able to work on a piece on site? S.H.
and the handyman would sorely like to know.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My unfinished basement has fiberglass insulation in the
ceiling. I am concerned about invisible shards of glass sloughing
off the fiberglass and getting into the air I breathe. What can I
put over it to prevent this? And whatever I put up, does it have to
come down if and when I install a regular ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   BILL MUMFORD, Lakeville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Staple Tyvek or similar material to the ceiling joists. It is
an air stop but not a vapor stop, and while it is not designed to
go on a crawl space ceiling, it is what you need there. It will not
only help reduce heat loss into the basement, but is white,
reflecting what little light there is in the basement. You can keep
it up when you finish the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house was built three years ago, with a huge room with a
cathedral ceiling, open end to end. When cracks appeared in the
ceiling, a painter patched them, but they look worse than before.
An engineer said the cracks were from stress and settling, and
suggested $25,000 to shore up the foundation. Do I really have to
do that? Besides, how can I patch those cracks so they will not
show?
</P>
<P>
   DMITRI HOMSY, Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. From what the engineer suggests, your house is defective and
the builder should be brought to task. I would get a second opinion
concerning the foundation. There is another possible cause of the
cracks in addition to settling and stress, not necessarily due to a
faulty foundation. A large room with cathedral ceiling open end to
end is not always stable, and is subject to excessive stress.
</P>
<P>
   So, consider installing collar ties to connect the two slopes of
the cathedral ceiling. Collar tiles are commonly found in attics
under a gabled roof; the rafters form an upside-down ``V,'' and the
collar ties turn that upside-down ``V'' into an ``A.'' If you feel
that collar ties will spoil the aesthetics, then live with the
cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can fill the cracks with caulking: Press it in with
your fingers, smooth off and paint, if necessary. The caulking will
expand and contract with the movement of the ceiling, and should
stay in the cracks.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    MEDICARE REFORM MOVES TO NATION'S FRONT BURNER
 &HT;    910&AMP;add. With MEDICARE-DATA. For release Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While saving Social Security has received
widespread attention over the past year, a far more immediate and
controversial reform is looming: Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Without reforms, Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust fund _ the
Medicare Part A supported by the payroll tax _ is projected to be
depleted by 2008. Social Security is expected to be viable until at
least 2032.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the political pitfalls that derailed the Republicans'
1995 plans to reform Medicare, a bipartisan commission was
established. It is scheduled to make recommendations by March 1. By
law, proposals must receive 11 votes from the 17 members appointed
by the White House and congressional leaders to be adopted by the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be easy. The main proposal being considered would
radically change Medicare's structure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the government paying for a defined set of health
care benefits, the government would help the elderly and disabled
buy insurance from a variety of plans that would offer at least a
minimum set of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan by panel chairman, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., is
patterned after the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which
covers members of Congress and federal employees. They annually
choose which insurance plan they want and the government pays a
percentage of the average premium cost. People who choose a plan
costing more than the average must pay the difference. Those who
chose a less costly plan keep the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Under Breaux's plan, Medicare's two parts _ Part A pays
hospitals, while Part B pays doctors and related services _ would
be merged. Both workers and employers would continue paying the
1.45 percent payroll tax. Beneficiaries would also pay a premium
equal to 12 percent of the average national premium bid by
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Medicare fee-for-service program would be
treated as a plan in competition with the private insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's plan has won strong conceptual support from
Republicans, who see it as a way of bringing free-market
competition to a government-run program.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, elderly organizations and health providers have been
far more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the commission's seven other Democrats sent Breaux a
letter complaining that his plan did not reflect all of their
principles and requesting detailed answers about how it would
operate. Without those answers, the Democrats said, they didn't
think this week's meeting of the commission would be worth
attending. Later, the meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Five main issues are in contention:
</P>
<P>
   _ To what degree will the government set minimum benefits?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should prescription drugs be part of the minimum set of
benefits?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will those who choose to remain in the fee-for-service program
pay more than 12 percent of the average premium, and how firm is
that percentage?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should high-income seniors pay twice as much in premiums so
those at or near the poverty level don't pay any premiums?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should the age of eligibility be increase from 65 to 67 to
match Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said benefits under his plan would be at least as good as
under the current Medicare system, but the government would not
specifically spell out each benefit _ such as how many days would
be covered for a particular medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   That worries commission members and elderly groups who fear that
unless benefits are the same from one plan to the next, seniors
will have no way to compare which offers the best value.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Corry, AARP federal affairs director, said slight
flexibility may be acceptable _ like comparing a golden delicious
to a Granny Smith apple, ``but not an apple to a kumquat.''
</P>
<P>
   The prescription drug issue is among the most contentious.
Democratic panel members, following President Clinton's lead, want
Medicare to cover drugs. Without it, some say they won't support
the final package. Republicans, citing the large portion of seniors
who have a drug benefit paid either by former employers or through
Medigap insurance policies, are cool to making it a
taxpayer-financed benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., co-chairman of the commission,
suggested there were numerous alternative ways to add some drug
coverage _ possibly through an add-on program for which
beneficiaries might pay half the cost _ without making it part of
the defined benefit package.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that the elderly who remain in the fee-for-service
program, particularly those who are sickest or who may live in
rural areas without managed care plans, may pay a far higher
premium than the average if the fee-for-service program winds up
costing more than private plans.
</P>
<P>
   And there is opposition to Breaux's plan to have elderly persons
earning $40,000, or couples making $50,000, pay twice as much in
premiums so the poor would not have to pay any premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Max Richtman, vice president of the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare, notes that the rich already
pay far more for Medicare through uncapped payroll taxes while they
are working, and should not have to pay again on the receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see political support disappearing from those people,''
Richtman said. ``They'll start generating a lot of support to get
out of Medicare altogether and not pay in.''
</P>
<P>
   Richtman also worries that raising the eligibility age will
increase the number of uninsured who are in their late 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Health providers and even private insurers also have questions
and concerns about Breaux's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital
Association, said his group is concerned the plan may not provide
enough in payments to guarantee a basic benefit package comparable
to the current Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, said insurers worry that based the government will impose
so many regulations on insurers as to stifle rather than encourage
competition. Kahn said insurers also worry that putting a
prescription drug benefit in the fee-for-service program would
reduce the incentive many people have for joining a private plan.

US SHOULD BUILD A MILITARY BASE IN AZERBAIJAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Iranians hate the idea. The Iraqis hate the idea. The
Russians hate the idea. The French allow that it could be
destabilizing. What else do we need to know?
</P>
<P>
   The idea is this: Azerbaijan would like the United States to
build a military base on the Aspheron Peninsula, which juts out
into the Caspian Sea. No less than Vafa Guluzade, national security
adviser to the president of Azerbaijan, publicly extended the
invitation last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkish and American military bases,'' Guluzade told the New
York Times, ``would be welcomed here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great idea. It works for the Azerbaijanis, who are
understandably nervous about the recent joint military agreement
signed by Russia and Armenia. ``Azerbaijan is under a big threat
from Russia,'' Guluzade told The Times. ``They are waiting to use
the Armenians to strike against us.''
</P>
<P>
   It works for the Turkish government, which is under domestic
political attack for allowing US warplanes to launch missions over
Iraq from the Incirlik Air Base, located in southern Turkey. The
Turks like having a de facto US military base nearby; it has a
stabilizing effect. But it would be better politically if US
warplanes weren't on Turkish soil. Azerbaijan borders Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   It works for the other nations of the Caucasus. The four key
countries of this region are known as Guam, (Georgia, Ukraine,
Azerbaijan, and Moldavia). Each of them is desperate to enter into
some kind of joint defense agreement with the United States under
the NATO program known as Partnership for Peace.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen, but a US-Azerbaijan deal for a military base
would send a strong signal that the US and NATO are serious about
protecting the region.
</P>
<P>
   It works for the global energy industry, which is investing
billions of dollars in Caspian Sea oil exploration and development.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan is by far the richest country in the western half of
what used to be the Soviet Union. It sits atop and astride a sea of
oil and natural gas. In the next 20 years, it may emerge as the
leading energy-producing nation of the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Unless. The danger is what insurance underwriters call
``political instability.'' Political instability is bad for
business. It makes people nervous. Costs go up. Investors get
jumpy. Put a US military base in Azerbaijan and the likelihood of
political instability in Azerbaijan decreases dramatically.
Everyone calms down.
</P>
<P>
   As important, a US military base (or some kind of joint military
venture with the Turks or the Azerbaijanis) would make it more
likely that the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline would be routed through
Turkey and not Russia.
</P>
<P>
   This is crucial. Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan and the
center for oil exploration in the Caspian Sea. Ceyhan is a
Mediterranean seaport in western Turkey. The Russians believe that
Caspian oil should flow through a pipeline that heads north (into
Russian territory) and west. The more direct route is due west
across Azerbaijan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   A secure pipeline (made more so by the presence of US fighter
jets) would have a tonic effect on world energy supply and prices.
This is crucial to continued economic growth in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum is the most vital natural resource in the global
economy. Its current low is what prevents emerging markets from
collapsing. Insuring that it remain cheap is a vital US national
security interest.
</P>
<P>
   There are other strategic reasons why a US military base in
Azerbaijan makes sense. Foremost among these is to make war in the
region more difficult to wage.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's current political system may collapse into a fascist
heap. The first thing a fascist Russian government would seek to
``reacquire'' would-be oil fields. Baku would be all but impossible
to invade if the US operated a major military installation nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Second, building a base on the Apsheron Peninsula would send a
strong signal to the Iranians and the Iraqis that the US has every
intention of protecting its national security interests in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   If the US should acquire evidence that chemical and biological
weaponry is being readied for use in either Iran or Iraq, a massive
preemptive strike could be launced without a lot of diplomatic
interference. The Azerbaijanis would be more than happy to clear
their airspace in return for a US military presence.
</P>
<P>
   The national security establishment reacted to the Azerbaijani
offer with considerable tact, deflecting specific questions with
solemn pronouncements of further study and diplomatic mumbo-jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes that this means they are already negotiating the
details with the Azerbaijanis.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often that the US encounters such an opportunity. We
ought to accept the invitation without delay.

A COMPANY IS TRYING TO CORNER THE MARKET ON ANTIQUEs MALLS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE McLINDEN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A new Austin-based company is antiques-mall
shopping, but it's not after quaint knickknacks and sundry
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Antiqueland USA is quietly buying up antiques malls around the
country, armed with aggressive plans to become the growing
industry's first major consolidator.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the privately held company purchased the assets of
Antique Colony in west Fort Worth, its fourth Metroplex acquisition
in the past six months. In July, it bought Antique Mall On Rufe
Snow on N.E. Loop 820, Forestwood Antique Mall in Dallas and
Antiqueland in Plano.
</P>
<P>
   Company founders Corky Logue and John Orton are eyeing at least
20 other malls to add to their existing seven.
</P>
<P>
   The two are no strangers to business-building.
</P>
<P>
   Logue, who expanded New York-based EZ Pawn from one to 225
stores, founded Antiqueland USA in May. Orton's curriculum vitae
includes a stint with American Bingo Co., during which he helped
consolidate a segment of that industry.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two view the antiques-mall business as an
entrepreneurial frontier, Orton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is unlimited growth potential in this industry,'' he
said. ``There are 5,000 antique malls in the United States and, to
our knowledge, there's not anybody who owns more than five besides
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton said Antiqueland USA plans to go public within two years.
``Right now, we are just trying to raise our critical mass and
learn what the best business practices in the industry are,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Antiqueland USA's seven malls include locations in Houston,
Kansas City and Indiana. At least two acquisitions are pending in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Antiqueland USA said it seeks out well-positioned malls with
quality dealers and growth potential. It takes over their leases
but generally does not buy the buildings, said Corby Logue, vice
president of operations and son of the founder.
</P>
<P>
   The group's formula is to upgrade the properties, add cafes or
tearooms where practical, and offer antiques seminars and other
programs to generate customer traffic, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Antiqueland also plans to expand some of its malls, including
the 30,000-square-foot Antique Mall On Rufe Snow. The company is
adding 15,000 feet, taking over a site previously occupied by Leaps
and Bounds indoor playground.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the company renames a mall Antiqueland, depending
on the location and community-recognition level, Logue said. In all
but one instance, the company has retained the managers of malls it
has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of scale that Antiqueland realizes from
consolidating advertising, operating practices and purchasing power
benefit the new owners and the dealers who lease mall space, Orton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Corky Logue declined to comment for this report, saying only
that he will unveil bigger plans for the organization within 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   Antiqueland USA's concept seems to be a sound one, said Jim
Whitten, a retail specialist with CB Richard Ellis in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is in line with mainstream real estate and
how people are making money today,'' Whitten said.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000-square-foot Camp Bowie operation in Fort Worth is
home to about 100 dealers, who pay a flat $2 per square foot,
district manager Dianne Black said. Minibooths there start at $110
a month, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Loop 820 mall, spaces start at $250 per month for a
standard-size booth, plus 6 percent of a dealer's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Multiply dozens of dealers by a growing number of stores, and
profit potential ``could be enormous,'' Whitten said.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques malls are a relatively young industry, launched in the
mid-1980s when a weak economy forced shopping center owners to
explore creative leasing options, Orton said.
</P>
<P>
   The average sale at a mall is about $50; an antiques shop or
show sale can be several hundred dollars, said Milton Talbert Jr.,
first vice president of the National Association of Dealers in
Antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's nothing wrong with the malls,'' said Talbert, who
owns Show and Tell Antiques in Waco. ``There are a lot of people
who like to stroll through them, looking for that $2 vase or $10
item. We have for several years maintained booths at one of the
local malls.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbert said he wasn't aware that a company was attempting to
consolidate the antiques-mall industry. ``But it's not
surprising,'' he said. ``The opportunity certainly presents
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Antiqueland also is expanding its new Internet auction page, a
move that is expected to stimulate sales and increase awareness of
its properties, Corby Logue said.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a shrewd move, because Internet antiques and
collectibles auction sites are extremely popular in the trade,
Tolbert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrifically fun industry,'' Corby Logue said. ``We
like it for all the same reasons that our customers like it.''

WANTING TO PREVENT A VICTORY PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that President Clinton's spokesman has promised that his
boss won't throw a victory party when the impeachment trial is over
_ now that the White House has been declared a ``gloat-free zone''
_ maybe the Senate will finally find a way to call a halt to this
futile exhibition of political tap-dancing.
</P>
<P>
   After much talk about a plan to approve a ``finding of fact''
that would enable the Senate to pronounce Clinton guilty of
impeachable offenses without actually convicting him, it is now
obvious that the proposal was primarily a product of certain
senators' preoccupation with Clinton's penchant for dancing in the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how The Sun of Baltimore explained it:
</P>
<P>
   ``With the end of the impeachment saga now in sight, White House
aides took pains Wednesday to reassure senators that President
Clinton would not stage an `unseemly' victory celebration after his
expected acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects for such a celebration have put a chill in
Senate efforts to end the trial, with Republicans scrambling for a
graceful conclusion that would not appear to exonerate the
president of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators, especially Republicans, have been haunted by the
image of Clinton and House Democrats gathered on the White House
lawn in December for an exuberant show of solidarity just hours
after the House had voted to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a repeat performance has been the subject of
`very, very deep concern' among Republicans, acknowledged Sen.
James M. Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the White House has danced around the notion of
whether a victory show would be staged after the conclusion of the
Senate trial, which is expected next week. But Wednesday, Joe
Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman, finally addressed the matter,
declaring the `post-impeachment era' at the White House `a
gloat-free zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Think about what's happening here. Despite the fervent wish of
most Americans to get this impeachment business over with as
quickly as possible, the U.S. Senate has been holding up the works
in hopes of finding a way to keep Bill Clinton from celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Can you believe it? Can you believe that duly elected members of
the world's greatest deliberative body could be so petty and
paranoid as to thwart the Constitution and the will of the people
out of fear that the president will gloat?
</P>
<P>
   It would be funny _ if it weren't so annoying.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there's nothing the Senate can do to prevent
Clinton from claiming victory at the end of the impeachment trial.
Since the only outcome that the president might consider a defeat _
conviction and removal from office _ is a virtual impossibility,
the Senate is powerless to influence Clinton's reaction. If he
wants to do back-flips in the White House Rose Garden when the
trial is over, well, he can do back-flips until his back gives out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, don't forget, is the man who dubbed himself ``the
Comeback Kid'' after LOSING the New Hampshire primary in 1992. Who
could have been shocked that a politician who took a victory lap
after finishing second in an election would treat himself to a pep
rally after being impeached?
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wants to light up a cigar, pound a drum and slap
himself on the back once he's acquitted by the Senate, no
extra-constitutional ``finding of fact'' can stop him. We are
dealing with an arrogant, self-indulgent, highly competitive
individual here; when it comes to winning and losing, restraint and
good taste have rarely been Clinton's hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has promise-keeping, which could lead us to suspect that a
no-celebration pledge from Clinton might be worth no more than
those oaths he took when testifying about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president's mouthpiece says the White House has been
declared a ``no-gloat zone,'' let's take him at his word. Let's
hope that, just this once, Clinton will show some humility and
decorum.
</P>
<P>
   We might not want to bet on it. But we can hope.
</P>

HEALTH GROUPS SAY LIMITED SPENDING WON'T SNUFF OUT SMOKING HABIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated health groups oppose a plan that earmarks one-fifth
of the $200 million they requested for anti-tobacco programs,
saying Texas is jeopardizing its opportunity to save lives and
money.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the state settled with the tobacco industry for $15
billion, groups such as the American Cancer Society began lobbying
for a four-year $200 million pilot project that would include an
advertising campaign, a quit-smoking hot line and numerous
grassroots programs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, two high-ranking legislators are taking a different
approach in their preliminary outline for the first $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They want to set up a $200 million endowment fund that would
spin off interest payments of $10 million a year for tobacco
programs, said Cindy Antolik, director of government relations for
the American Cancer Society's Texas Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember why this money exists; it exists
because of costs to the state caused by tobacco,'' Antolik said.
``Texas needs to make a significant contribution to tobacco control
or those costs will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the proposal's authors, Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said he wants to guarantee
a steady stream of funding without committing future Legislatures
to anti-tobacco payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to build up a level of spending that when the
tobacco money is no longer there, we have to raise tax funds to
continue,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco payments will be made over a period of years, and
the comptroller will certify the amount available for each
Legislature to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal submitted last month by Ratliff and House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, would
distribute the first $1.8 billion among various health initiatives,
including medical schools statewide and a children's health
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators will have the final say, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, about 23 percent of adults smoke, a figure that has
remained largely unchanged over the past decade, according to the
Texas Health Department. A 1998 state Health Department survey
showed that 27 percent of sixth-graders used tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   While nicotine users continue to start early, limited spending
collides witl public expectations, said Senate Health Services
Committee Chairwoman Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to Joe or Jane Citizen,'' Nelson said, ``they
believe that money will be spent on health-related issues, with
most of it going to prevention of tobacco use or cessation for
those that are already addicted.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, a coalition of health and educational groups,
including the cancer society, proposed the four-year pilot project
to start snuffing out Texans' tobacco habit.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, if it is as successful as a similar program in
California, could result in an estimated 360,000 fewer smokers and
save more than 115,000 lives and $440 million in Medicaid costs,
according to a Texas Tech University analysis that was released
this week.
</P>
<P>
   California provides a good comparison because it resembles Texas
in population size and ethnic diversity, said John Blair, one of
the authors and director of Texas Tech University's Center for
Health Care Strategy. The American Cancer Society asked the center
to prepare the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   About $5.2 billion in health care costs could be saved, Blair
said. Those costs, he said, ``are being paid by somebody _ mainly
by employers and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Under California's program from 1989 to 1993, the proportion of
smokers dropped 5.3 percentage points, to 18.6 percent in 1993. But
smoking rates were also falling in the rest of the country, by 2.9
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, programs must rely on a steady stream of money
to counteract the clout of the tobacco industry, said Alan
Henderson, a public health professor at California State
University, Long Beach, and immediate past president of the
American Cancer Society's California division.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for example, the tobacco industry spends about $360
million annually on advertising and promotions, according to the
Texas coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have to tell you that for the tobacco industry,'' $15
billion is ``chump change,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas coalition's 26-page smoking cessation plan proposes
that the initial two years be devoted to anti-tobacco advertising,
stronger enforcement of laws and expanded local grassroots
programs.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide quit-smoking hot line would also be launched, as
would an outreach effort targeted at African-Americans and
Hispanics. The coalition's report says the two groups make up
one-third of Texas smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Antolik said the 1999 fight won't be the group's last. About $60
million will be needed every year for what Antolik describes as a
financially conservative, ``station wagon'' approach to tobacco
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is primarily the lives saved,'' she said. ``We're
concerned about Medicaid. But the American Cancer Society and the
health community is focused on the human loss.''

OWNER OF JOINT IN TIOGA, TEXAS, HAS BEEF WITH PROPRIETOR OF LA
KNOCKOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do Clark's Outpost in Tioga and a Texas-style barbecue
restaurant outside Los Angeles have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Not as much as the owner of the California restaurant would
initially have had customers believe, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Californian David Dickter learned of Clark's barbecue at a 1996
charity event hosted by the acclaimed chef Wolfgang Puck. Later, he
and the Clarks _ Warren and Nancy Ann _ talked about a business
venture that was never formalized. And the mistrust grew as the
Clarks battled to keep Dickter from capitalizing on their
restaurant's name _ and fame.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw for Clark, apparently, was a restaurant review
last month in the Los Angeles Times that said the Inglewood,
Calif., eatery ``flies in all of its meats from the well-known
Clark's BBQ in Tioga, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the Clark family had visions of their brisket being
Tioga's first import to Hollywood since native son Gene Autry. But
by the time Nancy Clark read the review of David Dickter's
restaurant, she was thinking about a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has turned into an old-fashioned donnybrook,'' Clark said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickter, the owner of the California restaurant, said
there's nothing to fight about. Two weeks ago, he quietly took down
the Clark's Outpost sign on his diner, and renamed it Authentic
Texas Barbecue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly haven't shamed her good name,'' Dickter said in a
telephone interview. ``I'm a big fan of her food. If she offered me
her product today, I would gladly take it. I love her product.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickter's conciliatory words have not appeased Clark. Until she
sees it for herself, Clark said, she won't accept that Dickter has
ceased to use her restaurant's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't quite believe it,'' Clark said. ``Somebody has to
take a picture of it. He had plenty of time to do this, and he
didn't do anything before that
</P>
<P>
   LA Times review. I don't want to call him a liar, but the way he
has handled himself has not been very trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the relationship, Clark felt different. When
Dickter, who learned about the Clarks' barbecue from the Wolfgang
Puck event, strolled into their restaurant about 60 miles northeast
of Fort Worth, the Clarks were intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about a California franchise arrangement in which
the Clarks would send meat to the Inglewood restaurant. The Tioga
restaurant has been touted in Gourmet Magazine and the Zagat
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership started to sour when Clark's husband, Warren,
visited California to look at potential sites, Clark said. Her
husband was unimpressed, she said, because Dickter's building
looked like ``an old Denny's.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Warren Clark's health quickly deteriorated. And as he lay
dying in the hospital, his wife said, he told her not to do
business with Dickter.
</P>
<P>
   Dickter said he is amazed at Clark's account. If it wasn't for
the Clarks, he said, he never would have opened a barbecue
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold my business, mortgaged my house, and then he refused to
help me, but I'm sure that's because he got sick,'' Dickter said.
``I was kind of left out on the hook, but I went ahead and built
this business from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   As for using the Clark's Outpost name, Dickter said Warren Clark
gave his blessing during his visit to California, and brought
recipes and stationery from the Tioga restaurant. Dickter said he
didn't believe that there was any conflict.
</P>
<P>
   When the California restaurant opened on July 4 last year, the
menu said the barbecue came from Clark's Outpost in Tioga and
referred to the Texas establishment's national reputation. Dickter
said he quickly replaced that menu once Clark objected. He still
gets his meat from three Texas suppliers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sign, he said he would have replaced it sooner but
didn't have the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would David Dickter want to be Clark's Outpost right near
the LA airport?'' Dickter said. ``In all the time we've been open,
only two to three people have mentioned the one in Texas. What
matters out here is that it is Texas barbecue. That is something
really unique. That is what people are coming for.''

 &HT;    THE JOY AND GRACE OF WALTER PAYTON
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, FEB. 7
 &HT;    COMMENTARY BY KEVIN LAMB
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO OF LAMB
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    NOTE: Kevin Lamb, now the medical writer for the Dayton Daily
News, is the only writer who covered the Chicago Bears beat all 13
seasons that Walter Payton played for them. Lamb worked at the
Chicago Daily News and the Chicago Sun-Times.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Practice was ending for most of the Chicago Bears, but the place
kicker was still booting field goals and Walter Payton was
watching. Of course, he wasn't just watching. Payton has never been
any better at just watching than wolves are at herding sheep.
</P>
<P>
   On this occasion, he was standing near the goal post and
throwing footballs at the balls that sailed past, end over end. Try
that sometime at home. Payton was hitting at least one in every
three of the moving targets 30 feet above.
</P>
<P>
   The moment captured the whimsy, hyperactivity and superb
athleticism with which Payton attacked both life and the National
Football League from 1975 through 1987. For all 13 of his seasons,
I had the pleasure of being paid to watch him embody the values
that make fans wistful for the good old days, when ball players put
their teams ahead of themselves and intimidated their opponents
with actions instead of words. I saw him break most of the league's
rushing records as equal parts tenacious competitor and playful
imp.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I saw him Tuesday night, I wondered briefly why
Sports Center was showing a picture of Payton's father, a thin and
quiet man who had died about 15 years ago. I was eating out with
friends, seeing the television without hearing it. I probably would
have recognized Payton sooner if this had not been the longest I
remembered seeing his face without a hint of a smile.
</P>
<P>
   So it took several seconds to piece the news together as the
words ``rare liver disease'' and then ``needs liver transplant''
popped up on the screen. The man who broke pro football's most
cherished record has a condition that strikes 30 people out of
every million and gives them an average life expectancy of two
years unless they receive a matching donor's liver.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Payton on the field always have been better suited
to silence than to sound. He was articulate when he bothered to
pause before a microphone or a note pad, once saying that to
describe his own running would be ``like trying to draw the wind.''
But nothing he said spoke louder than the 20-yard dash down field
after every play he ran with the ball in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter still plays like he's trying to be the best tailback in
the 10th grade,'' teammate Dan Hampton said late in Payton's
career.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to work like an undrafted rookie desperate to
make the team, but he needed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't,'' he said, ``whatever you accomplish, you'll
look back and say, 'Damn. If I did that, and I only worked so much,
just think what I could have accomplished if I'd exerted myself to
the fullest.' Why put yourself in that position? Just go ahead and
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton would while away the idle moments in practice by walking
50 yards on his hands or throwing 70-yard passes or catching punts
behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a practice in his rookie year, he was trotting off
the field behind an assistant coach who was moving too slowly. He
simply leaped over the 6-foot, 5-inch man's head.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, Payton assigned nicknames that stuck, much
to the discomfort of the general manager's right-hand man, Mr.
Potato Head. But he also was the sensitive teammate who cheered up
rookies who were frustrated by their sparse playing time.
</P>
<P>
   The games were his stage, though. Running with the ball, Payton
could dance and make players grab for air on one play, then lower
his head and make them gasp for air on the next. He needed no sound
track to embellish the Christmas Eve anticipation when he paused
behind the line, often scissors-stepping in place before darting
upfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he swept both ends on the same play. Sometimes he
disappeared into a pile and emerged five yards upfield. Sometimes
he blocked a defensive lineman off of his feet. Almost never did he
run out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   If Payton was underappreciated outside Chicago, it was because
he probably was the last star athlete who didn't morph from
performer to personality. Payton was just a football player. Only
rarely and reluctantly was he a pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   He came along at an awkward stage, after those beer commercials
had made Dick Butkus better known as Bubba Smith's straight man
than as the prototypical middle linebacker, but before the Sports
Center highlights became a significant piece of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   So well did he play football that intelligent people insisted he
was better at blocking and catching passes than as a ball carrier.
After a game early in Payton's career, Bears coach Jack Pardee
marveled at his versatile excellence that afternoon, ``running,
receiving, blocking and tackling.'' He played six downs at
quarterback in a game in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter's the whole package,'' Bears coach Mike Ditka said
around that time. ``He may not do some things as well as someone
else has done, but he does everything better than anyone else ever
has.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked of blocking as something he might as well do proudly
as long as he had to do it, but it was also his way of expressing
appreciation to his teammates, of showing he wasn't above them.
Payton bought gifts for offensive linemen before it was cool, and
he was the first back to let his blockers spike the ball after he
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Payton could be a pain in the rear end, certainly. And
literally. He liked to sneak up behind reporters and pinch their
behinds, demonstrating the strength of his grip. He also would show
off his quickness of hands by snatching the pen off of a notebook
in mid-scribble.
</P>
<P>
   During one exasperating interview, I pointed out that it was
really quite rude to be reading his mail at the same time I was
asking him questions. Payton responded with a look of bewilderment
that I didn't understand at the time because I didn't yet have
children who were old enough to give me the same look. (''Oh, you
mean it bothers you when I track mud across the living room carpet?
How was I supposed to know that?'')
</P>
<P>
   He was not so easily bored in football games, in part because he
decided as a rookie to set his sights on Jim Brown, who was
football's version of Babe Ruth. Where Brown notoriously arose
after tackles as if he might not make it to the huddle without
help, Payton made it his trademark to leap up from the ground as if
the nearest hash mark was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Payton missed a game his rookie year with a sprained ankle,
found out Jim Brown had played nine seasons without ever missing a
game and then proceeded to play in 186 consecutive games over the
next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1984 season began, Payton needed 687 yards to break
Brown's rushing record of 12,312. Franco Harris needed only 362.
Payton proclaimed it an even race, and later expressed
disappointment that Harris ruined it by missing the first few games
in a contract holdout. He retired three years later with a
4,414-yard cushion over Brown, and with records for yards in a
game, 100-yard games and 1,000-yard seasons that he also still
holds.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are much steeper this time. In 1997, 4,167 Americans
received liver transplants, but 1,131 more on the waiting list
died. Nearly 12,000 people are on the list for livers now. Payton
is afraid, naturally, but apparently not intimidated. At the press
conference when he disclosed his disease, Payton said, ``We're
leaning toward a cure.''

HARASSMENT COMES IN ALL SHAPES, SIZES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first thing you notice about Johnny Jones is his
size. The former college football and basketball player is 6-foot-8
and weighs 260 pounds. When he shakes your hand, it disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was involved in a sexual harassment case, but it's not
what you'd expect. Jones sued his female supervisor and his
employer, Service Merchandise Co., contending that his female boss
fondled him and hounded him constantly for sex.
</P>
<P>
   A jury sided with Jones and found that he had indeed been
sexually harassed and that Service Merchandise, which is based in
Brentwood, Tenn., retaliated by firing him. Though the jury awarded
Jones $4,500 in back pay along with attorney fees, he didn't get a
penny for emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   The jury didn't seem to believe that Jones could have been
damaged emotionally, said his lawyer, Steven E. Petrou. The
assumption is that what guy wouldn't love to be harassed by a
woman? So how can a man, especially such a big man like Jones, be a
victim?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun and romantic,'' said Jones, who fought back tears
as he recounted his struggle. Jones was the warehouse supervisor at
a Houston-area Service Merchandise, and he said the problems
started when his female supervisor began asking him for hugs
because she was having a ``bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   The hugs got longer and longer, he said, which led to a brief
affair. Jones said the harassment began after he ended the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He said his former boss fondled him in the hallway as he walked
by, hounded him for sex and told him he'd be sorry for stopping the
romance.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had a hard time going to work each day, fearing what
would happen next, and that he couldn't tell his wife about the
harassment because of the shame he felt. Jones said he and his wife
split up and that he tried to kill himself because he felt so
tormented.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he finally filed the lawsuit after complaining to his
boss' supervisor several times to no avail. He was fired less than
three weeks later, which the jury found was retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he never told any male friends about the harassment
he was getting from his boss because he knew they'd never believe
it.
</P>
<P>
   They would have said: ``Go for it, man,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CHANGING DOUBLE STANDARD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most people refuse to believe that a man can be victimized, said
Gerald Holtzman, an employment lawyer who represents employers.
They figure men like sex, they need sex _ it's what they live for,
he said, not surprised at all that Jones had a difficult time
getting an award for emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   There's such a double standard, he said. It's like the school
teacher who had an affair with her pre-teen student in Washington
state. After being warned to stay away, they were caught again
together and she got a short jail term. If that were a man, he'd
either be dead or in prison for 49 years, Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman said he gets a number of human resource managers who
call and pooh-pooh it when they report they've got a man
complaining he's being sexually harassed by a female supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, they don't believe that Suzie hitting
on Bill really bothers Bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's really rape, he said, because it's a control issue, and
it doesn't matter if the guy likes sex or is physically attracted
to women. He still has the same feelings as a rape victim.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CONSEQUENCES RUN DEEP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Holtzman were right, juries would never entertain a sexual
harassment case brought by a man, said Alan N. Magenheim, the
lawyer who represented Service Merchandise. He suggested Jones
didn't get any damages for emotional distress because of the facts
in the case, rather than any skepticism about men as harassment
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The jury didn't see that the alleged behavior had much effect on
his life, said Magenheim, who is appealing the verdict on behalf of
Service Merchandise. He said Jones was able to find another job and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of sexual harassment cases involving a female
supervisor will become increasingly common as more women move up
the management ranks, Magenheim said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones, he's trying to work out his anger by writing a
book about men who face sexual harassment, so other people will
understand the pain he has gone through.
</P>
<P>
   Men need to know that they don't have to suffer in silence like
he did initially, Jones said. They need to know that they don't
have to put up with fondling, groping or other lewd behavior any
more than a woman has to, he said.

JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE GETS COMPLETE MAKEOVER, NEW V-8 ENGINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On an expedition across the Sierra Nevada mountains of Northern
California in summer 1992, I drove a brand-new Jeep Grand Cherokee
on the famed Rubicon Trail from Georgetown to Lake Tahoe _ and
brought it out unscratched.
</P>
<P>
   I was among a group of automotive journalists and Chrysler
employees putting the all-new Jeep wagon to the ultimate test _ on
a trail that in the past has been primarily the domain of serious
off-road vehicles such as the civilian version of the military jeep
(Jeep CJ).
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith, who founded the now-famous Jeep Jamborees USA in
1953 beginning with a summer weekend run across the Rubicon, was
along for the 1992 trek. Out of all the vehicles along for the
ride, only the ones Mark and I were driving came through the trail
undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to take credit for keeping the Grand Cherokee in one
piece, but the vehicle should get most of the acclaim. What looked
on the outside like a modern sport-utility most ideally suited to
the needs of urban families turned out to be one of the best
off-road performers I've ever encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Off-roading has been my passion since I began exploring the
mountain trails of Appalachia with a Corvair Greenbrier minivan in
the mid-60s, and ever since, I've been on a quest for the best
vehicle to tackle the North American wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Cherokee comes close to perfection in that respect. No
matter how pretty it is, the Grand is a true Jeep underneath, and
there is almost nowhere it can't go.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, DaimlerChrysler has updated the Grand Cherokee, the
first major redesign since its early '90s introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a major change in the way it looks, however. It's
still obviously a Grand Cherokee, but with a redesigned grille,
round headlights, a steeper windshield, all-new body panels and a
whole new interior.
</P>
<P>
   Also don't expect it to be any roomier. It's not. One of my
original complaints about the Grand Cherokee was its cramped
interior; the class-leading Ford Explorer and most of the other
competition are roomier, especially in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bit more cargo area in the new Grand Cherokee,
however, thanks to relocation of the spare tire from inside to
under the cargo floor.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news comes from the drivetrain: The Limited, which
is the top of the line, is available with an all-new 4.7-liter V-8
engine ($960) that cranks out 235 horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of
torque. It replaces a less-efficient 5.2-liter V-8.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is a full cut above the 4.0-liter, 195-horsepower
inline six that has been the main powerplant of the Grand Cherokee,
and it offers extra pulling power for trailering and heavy loads.
</P>
<P>
   A new electronically controlled automatic transmission
accompanies the V-8, offering five forward speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Grand Cherokee comes in two-wheel-drive versions,
our test car had the all-new Quadra-Trac on-demand four-wheel-drive
system. This arrangement allows the Grand Cherokee to keep moving
on ice, snow, mud or sand even if three of the four wheels are
slipping _ and it's all automatic; the driver doesn't have to do
anything to engage it.
</P>
<P>
   On-road performance of the Grand Cherokee is excellent. Because
of its unibody construction, rather than the truck-style
body-on-frame layout of most competitors, the Grand Cherokee rides
and handles like a car.
</P>
<P>
   It's quiet inside, and creature comforts and luxury amenities
abound _ such as automatic climate control with dual controls
(driver and front passenger), power windows/mirrors/door locks,
AM/FM/cassette/CD stereo, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel,
cruise control, power 10-way memory front bucket seats, keyless
entry, universal garage-door opener and theft-deterrent system.
</P>
<P>
   Base price for the Limited model is $33,980 plus $525
transportation; with options, our test vehicle listed for $36,655
total.
</P>
<P>
   Among the extras were a 10-disc CD changer ($300), power sun
roof ($800) and full-size spare tire ($160).
</P>
<P>
   Fuel-economy ratings range from 17 miles per gallon in the city
and 23 mpg on the highway for the six-cylinder engine to 13 city/17
highway for the V-8. The tank holds 20.5 gallons of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE:
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Compact, five-door, five-passenger, V-8 powered,
four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle, redesigned for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Jeep's top-of-the-line SUV has been completely
updated, although it still looks much like it did before; biggest
changes are the new 4.7-liter V-8, a new automatic transmission and
a new Quadra-Trac on-demand four-wheel-drive system. Great for
exploring: This is one of the best off-road performers among the
sport-utilities.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Smaller inside than its main competitors; leg room is
tight for rear passengers, cargo area is limited.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford Explorer Limited, Mercedes-Benz M-class,
Lexus RX 300, Isuzu Trooper/Acura SLX, GMC Jimmy Envoy, Toyota
4Runner Limited, Mitsubishi Montero, Infiniti QX4, Mercury
Mountaineer, Oldsmobile Bravada, Land Rover Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 13 miles per gallon city, 17 highway
(4.7-liter V-8).
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $33,890 plus $525 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   PRICE AS TESTED: $36,555 (transportation included).
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: A-minus.

   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough

rewarded...

   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?

   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.

<P>
   By Robert Fisk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

   AMMAN _ King Hussein returned Friday to die in Jordan after
treatment for his cancer in the U.S. failed. He was rushed from the
plane in an ambulance to a closely guarded hospital where a palace
official said he was ``near death.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, mosques were packed with people
praying for the king's recovery. ``I hope God gives him more
days,'' said one Jordanian who had just left the mosque. ``The
Jordanians and the Palestinians both liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the twists and turns of his policy the king was
genuinely popular among ordinary Jordanians, few of whom have known
any other monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Parties have been cancelled in the capital over the last week
and there was a minor run on the banks. Some people were openly
crying in the streets Friday morning as they heard the news that
the king was close to death. &QL;

 &HT;    BILL AIMS TO CURB AIRLINE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two key senators introduced an ``Airline Passenger
Fairness Act'' Friday that would require carriers to tell customers
all the fares they offer, whether a flight is over-booked and why a
flight has been delayed, canceled or diverted.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would enable passengers to receive a full
refund within 48 hours after purchasing a ticket, to be told
beforehand when a scheduled flight will be delayed and to be
informed in detail about frequent flier programs, including the
number of seats that can be redeemed on each flight.
</P>
<P>
   And the bill would allow passengers to use whatever portions of
a ticket they desired without penalty _ ending airline restrictions
on buying two cheap round-trip tickets and using only a one-way
segment of each. The proposed legislation also requires that a
passenger receive checked baggage within 24 hours of a flight's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the airline could be charged by the federal
Department of Transportation with an ``unfair or deceptive
practice'' or an ``unfair method of competition'' for
non-compliance with any of the provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bill is intended to address the rising tide of consumer
complaints against airlines and ensure that passengers have the
information they need to make informed choices in their travel
plans,'' said co-author Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman of
the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department reported earlier this week that
airline passengers filed 7,571 service complaints with the agency
in 1998 _ a 15 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation aims ``to make sure that our first-class
aviation system doesn't give second-class service any more,'' said
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the co-author and a member of McCain's
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan sponsorship and chairman's involvement ensure
that the bill will receive prompt attention in the transportation
committee, which has jurisdiction over airline issues.
</P>
<P>
   However, both the airline industry and a passengers organization
expressed reservations about the congressional intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never a good idea for government to get involved in the
pricing policy of a business,'' said Dave Fuscus, a spokesman for
the Air Transport Association, a Washington organization that
represents the major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Fuscus said his association ``just got the bill this morning''
and will study it before issuing a formal position. However, he
spoke about some of the issues it entails.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring airlines to fully refund the purchase price of a
ticket if a passenger requests it within 48 hours of purchase is an
intrusion into pricing prerogatives, he said. Presently, airlines
charge premium prices for fully refundable tickets, but the matter
is better left up to the marketplace than controlled by Congress,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overbooking works extraordinarily well'' because people often
don't show up for flights they have booked, he said. Over-booked
passengers often line up for free tickets or vouchers offered as
compensation by the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare for someone to be involuntarily bumped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-passenger consumer group also expressed reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the Law of Unintended Consequences'' attached
to such legislation, warned David Stempler, president of the Air
Travelers Association, a Washington group that lobbies for
passenger causes.
</P>
<P>
   By imposing the new requirements, Congress ``could create a cost
burden on the airlines that could result in higher fares,''
Stempler said. ``We're always concerned when the heavy hand of
government gets involved.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the legislation was supported by the American Society
of Travel Agents, which issued a statement: ``Why is it every time
someone raises the possibility that passengers would get treated
properly the airlines respond by saying 'We're going to make you
pay more?' Providing basic respect and common courtesy shouldn't
cost more money.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors said airline passengers are owed basic protections:
</P>
<P>
   -- Fair warning if you might get bumped.
</P>
<P>
   -- Refund within 48 hours of buying a ticket, if requested.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ability to use your ticket as you see fit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information on all available fares.
</P>
<P>
   -- The right to know when something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prompt arrival of luggage at your destination.
</P>
<P>
   -- Useful information about frequent flier miles.

<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough
in another person, his good faith would be returned; he was cruelly
rewarded...
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein lies clinically dead in an Amman hospital,
having succumbed to his toughest enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd can barely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
Yasser Arafat suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted
after a near-fatal air crash. Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a
heart condition, and has lost his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a
road accident. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak has never appointed a
vice-president, let alone a successor.

dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes

   &UR; KING HUSSEIN RETURNS TO DIE ON JORDANIAN SOIL &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ King Hussein returned Friday to die in Jordan after
treatment for his cancer in the U.S. failed. He was rushed from the
plane in an ambulance to a closely guarded hospital where a palace
official said he was ``near death.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, mosques were packed with people
praying for the king's recovery. ``I hope God gives him more
days,'' said one Jordanian who had just left the mosque. ``The
Jordanians and the Palestinians both liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the twists and turns of his policy the king was
genuinely popular among ordinary Jordanians, few of whom have known
any other monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Parties have been cancelled in the capital over the last week
and there was a minor run on the banks. Some people were openly
crying in the streets Friday morning as they heard the news that
the king was close to death. &QL;

NBA DOUBLE TALK TAKES THE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a reason talk is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Any resemblance between what people say and what they mean is
purely coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Take the National Basketball Association. Some of the talk is so
cheap, linguists have classified it as pure trash. When all is said
and done, much more is said than done.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the belated start of the latest,
not-to-be-mistaken-with-greatest NBA season. The only way to fully
appreciate life in the NBA after Michael Jordan _ besides ignoring
it _ is to dig deep for the true meaning buried underneath the
rhetoric. Kids should not try this at home alone. NBA rookies and
rising stars should not try this unless accompanied by their
entourages.
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``I don't want to make any great predictions, but
I think the fans are going to see a somewhat more responsive
league.'' _ NBA commissioner David Stern, on healing the wounds
from the 191-day lockout.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``We'll be back to business as usual the
millisecond we think we can get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``We're looking forward to a successful year _ I
hope, or I won't be here.'' _ New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``Yikes, I'm sticking my neck out for _ gulp _
Latrell Sprewell.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``I think he's moving in the right direction.'' _
Vancouver Grizzlies coach Brian Hill on benched starting center
Bryant Reeves, who reported to training camp about 40 pounds
heavier than last year.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``Unfortunately, he's moving in that direction at
the speed of a glacier on Valium.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``We're like the Yankees. Everybody is a star. The
Yankees didn't have one star, but a bunch of stars, and that's how
we are.'' _ New Jersey Nets forward Jayson Williams, on the makeup
of his team.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``You could fit my knowledge of astronomy on the
head of a pin.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``There goes the season.'' _ Charlotte Hornets
center Derrick Coleman, after an elbow injury knocked out guard
Glen Rice for six weeks and a biceps injury will cause forward
Anthony Mason to miss the season.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``If at first you can't succeed, quit. I'm the
real Mailman. I've mailed in so many games and so many seasons,
it's a wonder I haven't gone postal.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``Charles Oakley as long as I was around _ nine
years _ you could do nothing but miss him. He really stood for
everything I believe in in the NBA _ hard work; toughness, both
mental and physical; played for the team; played hurt _ and it was
very, very hard to trade him.'' _ Van Gundy, on trading the aging
Oakley for the underachieving Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``Loyalty? What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``We are real excited to have added Billy Owens
and Olden Polynice.'' _ Seattle SuperSonics coach Paul Westphal, on
some of his team's off-season acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``We're easily excited.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``I think we've been relatively lucky with
injuries.'' _ Golden State Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``Since Latrell Sprewell left, my neck problems
have mysteriously vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``As far as our expectations for the season, I
think when you have as many new guys as we have, you understand
that it's going to be an adjustment year. We're just going to keep
our goals short-term, in five-game sequences, try to identify some
realistic win total during those five games and progress from
there.'' _ new Chicago Bulls coach Tom Floyd on a team that has
lost Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Luc Longley and Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``If we got a good draw, we'd have some chance to
do some damage in the NCAA tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``I think what we're trying to do right now is to
establish identity. ... We've got to create some positives down
here.'' _ Los Angeles Clippers coach Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``The season you are about to see is true. I hope
and pray that the names will be changed to protect the innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``(Owner Abe Pollin) wanted Rod (Strickland) to
know that we wanted him. Against my best wishes, he told me to
interject something else into the deal. He's the boss. I did it.''
_ Washington Wizards general manager Wes Unseld, after having
signed Strickland to a four-year, $40 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``When this does work out, I want everybody to
remember that IT WASN'T MY IDEA.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``We definitely have the talent ... I don't think
anybody has ever questioned that. But I think that everybody has
probably questioned our mentality and the way we approach the game,
and that's one thing that we've go to try to change.'' _ Portland
Trail Blazers guard Damon Stoudamire, on a roster that includes the
likes of Isaiah Rider, Rasheed Wallace and Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``We have so many knuckleheads, Gomer Pyle should
be the team mascot.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``As a coach, you just hope your team holds up.
You pray, you light candles, you do everything you can to just hope
your team holds up because it's going to be a hard run.'' _ Nets
coach John Calipari on his approach to the season.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``Some of the players around the league showed up
for training camp so out of shape, I thought they were sports
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said: ``I think our preseason has been as wild as you
can get. I don't think we'll ever see one like this again _ when
you start the first day with four players and then you keep adding
players by the hour, you try to get in a scrimmage and two
exhibition games in roughly 12 to 14 days and then you come up with
injuries. It's feasible that it could be a little rugged at the
start for everybody.'' _ Orlando Magic coach Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant: ``NBA Action _ it's fan spastic.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Harness my dog, muzzle my wallet
 &HT;    (Fixes ending.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I stopped by the hardware store the
other day, trying to find a harness for my $2,000 dog.
</P>
<P>
   That's Buster, the little rat terrier, white with black spots, I
found some six years ago under the overpass and brought home to
join our Family of Dog, presently numbering eight.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know at the time Buster would turn out to be a
$2,000 dog. Imagine my surprise!
</P>
<P>
   The boys at the hardware store thought I was bragging.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you wouldn't know it to look at Buster.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of a Jack Russell terrier. Buster's more of a jack
rabbit terrier, such are his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he has a little ``yo quiero'' in him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when I brought Buster home to live with us, it was love
at first sight for him and my wife.
</P>
<P>
   She still talks about that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming in the back door,'' she relates, dreamily, ``and
he was coming around the corner into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our eyes met,'' her voice trails off for a moment, ``and we
knew we were made for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, she sees as made of money, which is lucky
for Buster.
</P>
<P>
   Buster had been having back problems for some time. But one
morning last month when he got out of bed (yes, he sleeps in the
bed with us), Buster tried to take a step and simply fell over.
</P>
<P>
   We rushed him to the vet and soon got the report that there was
pressure on his spinal cord, probably from a slipped disk, and he'd
need an operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were my dog,'' our vet advised, ``I'd take him to
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we took off for Houston, where there's a special pet
hospital for neurosurgery, as well as cardiac care, cancer
treatment and most anything you'd find in a people hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Buster had his surgery, and Buster's doing fine. Never mind that
after a week in the hospital he came home looking a bit like
Frankenbuster, what with the stitches.
</P>
<P>
   He's presently halfway through five weeks of ``cage rest''
convalescence. Buster's making the best of it, and, for a fact, the
best is none too good for Buster. My wife lined the cage with an
electric blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I was at the hardware store shopping for a harness is
that Buster can no longer wear a collar. If he pulled on his leash,
wearing a collar, he well might reinjure himself.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason I call him my $2,000 dog ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, you don't have to take my word for it.
</P>
<P>
   I have the papers to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the bill from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm complaining, either, Dear.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- WELFARE. The two-year steady decline in
Connecticut's welfare caseload got bumpy in the final part of 1998,
perhaps indicating the state is now focusing on welfare recipients
who are more difficult to get off public assistance. (Working.)
Maggi
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA -- DRUGS. Georgia's two U.S. senators are criticizing
what they see as a lack of commitment to the drug war in President
Clinton's budget request. Williams
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA -- COLUMN. Weekly column from U.S. Reps. Dan Miller,
R-Bradenton, and Porter Goss, R-Sanibel. Williams
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA -- MONEY. Indiana's share of the federal budget pie
would be the same or more as last year in most areas under the
proposed FY 2000 budget unveiled by President Clinton this week.
Karamargin
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS -- KOSOVO. Sending U.S. troops to Kosovo as part
of a NATO force to restore peace between the Serb forces and ethnic
Albanians, should only occur if both agree to abide by a peace
accord, two Massachusetts congressmen said Thursday. Preston
</P>
<P>
   NEW MEXICO -- EDUCATION. Sen. Pete Domenici usually touts New
Mexico projects in President Clinton's annual budget. But on closer
inspection, Domenici, R-N.M., found there was one spot where the
state apparently lost out: education. Gorman
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- FUND. President Clinton's budget released this
week includes millions in federal dollars for projects in the
state, but prompted mixed reviews from area lawmakers. Fine
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- RYAN. After only the first full legislative week of
the 106th Congress, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, is already
showing the signs of a rising star in the Republican Party. Hurt

THE FANS A FIELD DAY AT PRO-AM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am is
known for getting the back hand from Mother Nature, and last year's
sloshfest is still imprinted on many people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something about the spectacle _ spread over three
courses _ that is worth enduring howling winds, the chill and a
phalanx of cell-phone-carrying people yelling ``Get legs!'' and
other golf cliches.
</P>
<P>
   This is the old Crosby Clambake, after all, and though it
doesn't have the same weighty feel to it that the U.S. Open in San
Francisco had last year, there is still something magical about the
Pebble Beach experience.
</P>
<P>
   This golf tournament is an event. People come from all over.
They are scarfing up $6 hamburgers and wearing their finest and
favorite golf logos. They are carrying chairs strapped to their
belts. They are walking briskly into gale-force winds off the
Pacific Ocean, risking really expensive souvenir golf hats for the
chance not only to see Tiger Woods or David Duval and the like, but
also Bill Murray and a host of celebrities and athletes willing to
have their swings ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   That happens. In fact, by the time Sunday rolls around and the
celebrity hackers are long gone, that's going to continue. Because
these spectators are fearless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, you shaped that one nicely,'' a fan says to Brett Quigley.
``What'd you hit there?''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of players here _ particularly in the practice rounds or
on Thursday and Friday when the crowds haven't been unreasonable or
unruly _ will talk directly to those on the other side of the rope.
It's part of the Pebble charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A six,'' Quigley responds. His amateur partner didn't fair so
well. ``Oh, Jesus, that's in the yard,'' a man calls as the ball
sliced awkwardly over the top of him and onto the front lawn of one
of the houses lining the 18th fairway. ``Hey, you've gotta get
under that ball!'' the fan yells.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's a swing doctor here.
</P>
<P>
   Life among the spectators is full of color. If you're still of
the mind that only rich, white people play and watch this game,
wake up. All races are evident _ as well as shapes and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you see a pair of tee-nage girls and wonder,
``Are you really golf fans?'' Until they say they've just come from
the fifth tee where Greg Kraft, then the leader, just drained a
sweet putt. Or where else do you find people standing side-by-side,
one clamoring for a celebrity, the other saying, ``I love this
Harrison Frazar kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the paying customer feels as though there's a license to
chat _ exactly the attitude cultivated through the years. When
tennis great Jimmy Connors knifes a lousy second shot near the
gallery, people are ready for him. ``Bad shot, huh?'' Connors asks
them. ``I could have done that,'' one man says matter-of-factly.
``Oh, let's not go too far,'' Connors says.
</P>
<P>
   When playing partner Payne Stewart badly overshoots the green, a
woman wearing a fake fur and orange tennis shoes says, ``Oh, my
goodness, that's horrible.'' And then, when he's in earshot, she
doesn't stop: ``You'll have to do better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   As people shuffle between Pebble Beach and Spyglass (to track
the Tiger) and over to Poppy Hills, there's a sense that they are
embracing the spectacle. ``If we hurry, we can catch Freddie
Couples,'' one man says to his teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long out here for the masses to understand the
rules of survival, either. Screw your hat on tight. Dress warmly.
And pay attention because the amateurs are picking off spectators
with errant shots.

<P>
   OLD-SCHOOL-CLOTHES (Undated) _ Just when it seemed that nothing
of value in American tradition remained to be copied and exploited,
Harvard and Yale have announced an agreement to license their team
logos from the 1930s and '40s for a line of T-shirts, sweatshirts
and baseball caps. By Tom Connor. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CREED-PERFUME (New York) _ In the $5 billion-a-year fragrance
industry, Olivier Creed, which relocated from London to Paris in
1854, is a tiny player. The privately held company tries to set
itself apart by cultivating the image of a premium label. By Rick
Marin.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET-SIXTEEN-PARTY (New York) _ The Sweet 16 party, which all
but disappeared for a generation, considered corny and unhip, has
become the rage in the last three to six months, especially among
girls who go to Manhattan private schools _ often taken to be among
the most socially precocious. The parties are not throwbacks to an
era of teen-age innocence, when a 16th birthday might have been
celebrated over ice cream at Serendipity by a dozen girlfriends.
The new Sweet 16 party is a rite of onrushing adulthood, with
behavior mimicking urban sophisticates a decade or more older. By
Monique P. Yazigi. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-SUPERMODEL (New York) _ Anxiously fingering her
waist-length hair extensions, the model Heidi Klum sucked on an
Altoid and nursed a Bellini cocktail, attempting to quiet her
preshow jitters. At Cipriani Wall Street last Wednesday night,
before Victoria's Secret's fifth-annual pre-Valentine's Day fashion
presentation, frantic television crews swarmed around Tyra Banks,
Stephanie Seymour and other super beauties. Ms. Klum is a Sports
Illustrated swimsuit model whose nickname is The Body. By Bill
Powers. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ There is much unpleasant to be said
about cannas. They tend to be planted in ungainly clumps as accent
plants among the marigolds and petunias, or to sprout from the
corners of lots like so many survey markers. The flowers are no
easier on the eyes than zinnias, tending toward fluorescent oranges
and reds. But the foliage is luxurious. The plants grow several
feet tall and have broad, spiky leaves that range from rich green
to purplish or bronze, often with contrasting veins. By Cass
Peterson. (Moved).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nose had a cold.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Creed, who is both the head of the Parisian perfumer
that bears his surname and its chief olfactory expert _ the
``nose'' in perfumese _ was sneezing, running, stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am enrhume, you know?'' Creed said on a recent visit to New
York. He offered a Gallic wave in the vicinity of his sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   Born in France but of British descent and affinity, he is the
seventh generation of the Creed family to run the company since its
founder received an appointment from King George III in 1760. In
the $5 billion-a-year fragrance industry, Creed, which relocated
from London to Paris in 1854, is a tiny player. The privately held
company tries to set itself apart by cultivating the image of a
premium label. It has no Elizabeth Hurley or other high-priced
spokesmodel. But it does have Creed.
</P>
<P>
   This 56-year-old chief executive has a playboy-aristocrat manner
and bespoke elegance that personifies the brand's blend of British
pedigree with French taste. In his tailored gray windowpane-check
suit ( Creed also designs and sells clothing), he wore the burnish
of the Paris Match eurocracy: steely, graying hair, Riviera-toned
skin. Even in New York, capital of the world, he appeared to be
slumming.
</P>
<P>
   In town for a ``signing'' at Barneys, Creed spent three hours
autographing flacons and interacting with fans as if he were John
Grisham making an appearance at Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   His following trickles down from royalty _ Charles and Diana
both commissioned scents _ to the Barneys bourgeoisie. A hot-pink
bottle of Creed's Spring Flower ($110 for 2.4 ounces) has become a
status object, on display in the restroom at the restaurant
Balthazar in New York and at Neiman Marcus in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing, Creed consented to apply his rarefied sensory
expertise to more pungent surroundings: the smells of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Creed bundled gamely into the back seat of a chauffeur-driven
white 1962 Austin with a perfume bar in the back seat that ferries
valued Creed customers around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to Balthazar?'` Creed asked, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. A hot dog stand in Columbus Circle. Upon debarking,
Creed was distracted by the unmistakable aroma of horse-drawn
carriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, yes,'' he said, inhaling appreciatively. ``My old stables.
A special smell.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps five show horses at his estate about 30 miles south of
Paris. ``All horses smell always the same,'' Creed said.
</P>
<P>
   Handed a sweaty frank, Creed held it to his nose like a cigar
aficionado inspecting a fine Macanudo. He sniffed a few times
before declaring triumphantly: ``It is a perfume! I can reproduce
the smelling of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Most modern perfumers can reproduce the ``smelling'' of almost
anything: the Malibu surf, burning rubber, plastic,but these
usually require chemical alchemy. Creed said he uses only natural
ingredients to concoct the 238 fragrances in his line. He also said
he shuns perfume or cologne himself for fear that it might cloud
his senses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this purist perfumer seemed as turned on by some of New
York's ranker odors as by Turkish jasmine, Bulgarian roses,
Mediterranean bergamot. Next stop on the smell tour: Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amusante,'' Creed said, lifting a chai tea latte to his
nostrils. ``Too much cinnamon. It is breaking the tea.'' To clear
his palette, he ordered an espresso, loading it with sugar and
swirling it in the cup like wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real person who likes espresso does not take sugar,'' he
explained, apologetically. ``But I am in need of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitality is not something Creed is used to lacking, judging from
the biographical tidbits he divulged en route downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides dressage, Creed's hobbies include tennis, skiing and his
passion, golf. He has a 35-year-old girlfriend, a Ferrari 456GT, a
4 handicap and 1,000 bottles in his wine cellar. ``Only the best
Bordeaux,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He works no more than three hours a day. ``After that, it is
very difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Nice, he entered the family business at 19, in Grasse _
perfume's Mecca in the south of France. He is divorced and has a
son, Erwin, who is 18, and a daughter, Olivia, 21. So far, neither
wants to be the next nose. But Creed appeared unconcerned about
succession: ``I am not going away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a perfume takes him about a year. An idea comes ``in
Rome, London, wherever,'' he said. He writes down a formula, then
mixes 600 to 700 ingredients in different combinations. He thought
up his new Green Valley scent on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very much like painting,'' said Creed, who once
considered, but eventually rejected, pursuing a career as a
painter.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains one location without which any odorific tour
of New York would be incomplete _ the source of perhaps the
ultimate New York smell.
</P>
<P>
   The subway.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near the booth in the Prince Street station, Creed
scooped subway air with broad, flamboyant gestures and breathed
deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in the subway, it is a special perfume,'' Creed
said. ``Of course I prefer to smell the good gardens with roses.''
</P>
<P>
   Detecting ``wet and damp,'' he whiffed nothing malodorous or
gross, noting that it was a cold winter day and illness had dulled
his nasal passages. Tossing his white cashmere scarf around his
neck, he climbed the stairs back to street level. He seemed
invigorated, a connoisseur even of the sewer. Evidently, no smell
is off-limits to a true nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cut the smelling,'' he said, striding down Broadway
toward his favorite New York restaurant, ``you cut the party of
life.''

TRUTH REVEALED ...WELL, SOME OF IT, BY `X' STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone else out there get the feeling that, soon after the
season opener, ``The X-Files'' crossed the center line and drove
off the cliff in pursuit of Thelma and Louise?
</P>
<P>
   If so, I have good news. ``The X-Files'' that you know and love
_ the one about Fox Mulder's quest to expose the conspiracy between
the shadowy Syndicate and the alien invaders _ is back, at least
for the next two episodes. And just in time. Another goofball
stand-alone episode like the Christmas one with Ed Asner and Lily
Tomlin as holey ghosts might have made me an ex-phile. Even the
``Dreamland'' two-parter, in which Mulder (David Duchovny) assumed
another man's identity, drove me to paying bills and doing the
laundry. On a critic's scale of disapproval, you can't sink much
lower without striking oil.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, viewers will find out in the February-sweeps
two-parter airing Sunday and Feb. 14 that the black oil that wreaks
havoc on the human condition is called ``purity,'' and it's the
lifeblood of the alien invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the mischievous style of Chris Carter, the
self-described paranoiac responsible for ``The X-Files.'' It is
also like Carter to open up a new can of worms as he puts the old
ones on the compost pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of stuff explained,'' Carter
promised, ``... (but) that doesn't necessarily mean everything's
wrapped up and finished. In fact, there's a lot to do.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. We'll learn a great deal about the conspiracy and
the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in these two episodes,
both written by Carter and Frank Spotnitz. But there's plenty of
truth still out there (see box).
</P>
<P>
   Carter assumes the series will run at least one more season _
its seventh _ and then he wants to build on the movie franchise
begun last summer. (He thinks the next film could be out in 2001.)
</P>
<P>
   ``An eighth season could happen,'' he said, ``but the plans are
to culminate at the end of season seven. I don't think you
necessarily have to have a movie in the theaters right after that.
Maybe a year is a good amount of time before the next movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As to how it all ends, even Carter isn't entirely certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to define it too early and too well,'' he said,
``you lose some of the fun of discovering it along the way. I use
the Lewis and Clark analogy all the time: They knew which direction
they were headed, (but) didn't know what they were going to find.
That's kind of the way we've been proceeding.''

NEW LAPTOPS DROP SIZE, WEIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not easy to make a notebook computer that is thin and
light, yet full-featured and comfortable to use.
</P>
<P>
   Design in a large screen, and you add weight and size. Want to
make it smaller than a traditional portable? You're going to have
to reduce the size of the keyboard, which will give the ham-handed
among us fits.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all cases, some components will need to be external _
such as a CD-ROM or floppy drive _ when it's far more convenient to
have them built in.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, it's just one maddening trade-off after another.
This is why building portable PCs is an art _ every company takes a
different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at a pair of portables, each with its own way to
shed weight and inches:
</P>
<P>
   _ Compaq Armada 3500, $3,300, Compaq Computer Corp.: The Armada
3500 is Compaq's replacement for one of the nicest road-warrior
machines the company has ever made, the Armada 4000 series.
Stripped down to its basics, the 4000 was a lean and mean system
that included a sleek, stylish case and an innovative battery that
doubled as a handle.
</P>
<P>
   The 3500 is not quite as slickly designed, but it is a powerful
machine. Like the 4000, its CD-ROM and floppy drives are contained
in an add-on unit that snaps onto the bottom of the notebookbook.
With this addition, it's a full-featured multimedia portable;
remove it, and it's a lighter weight traveler's system.
</P>
<P>
   The Armada I tried came with a 300 megahertz Intel Pentium II
chip (speeds up to 366 megahertz are available); 64 megabytes of
memory; a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive; a 13.3-inch active matrix
screen; and 16-bit stereo sound. You'll have to supply your own
modem in the form of a PC card; it's not built-in.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion base was equipped with an LS-120 drive, which can
use both traditional floppies as well as 120-megabyte disks, and a
24X CD-ROM drive. The expansion base also can take an Iomega Zip
drive, a DVD-ROM drive or a simple floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the base cannot, unfortunately, take an additional battery,
as with the Armada 4000. The 4000 could hold three batteries _ in
the handle, in the notebook itself and in the expansion base _ for
as much as 10 hours of battery life.
</P>
<P>
   The 3500 has only one battery, in the notebook itself. Given
that it uses a Pentium II chip _ which drains batteries faster than
the older Pentium MMX processors _ it has significantly less
staying power. I was able to come close to three hours of battery
life. I hate swapping out batteries, so this strikes me as a step
backward in design. Two _ or three _ batteries are always better
than one.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped to its basics, the Armada 3500 is 1.3-inches thick and
weighs just under five pounds. Adding the expansion base takes it
close to seven pounds. It's a full-sized notebook, so its keyboard
is roomy and comfortable to use. It comes with a trackpoint-style
pointing device that was sluggish out of the box, but was easy to
tweak to improve the responsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The screen was a joy to use. I used the Armada 3500 on a
cross-country auto trip to Florida, installing TravRoute Software's
Door-to-Door CoPilot, which uses the Global Positioning Satellite
system to keep track of your whereabouts on the road. The screen
was nicely visible, even in bright sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Performance was peppy, as you'd expect with a system with these
specifications. It would be nice either as a system for
presentations, on-the-road Web and e-mail use or for serious
spreadsheet crunching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Latitude LT, $2,600, Dell Computer Corp.: So far, I have not
been particularly enamored with the super thin-and-light machines
have hit the market lately. These include the Toshiba Protege
3010CT and the Sony Vaio 505.
</P>
<P>
   While they pack an impressive feature set into a tiny package,
they fall usually fall down in two areas _ the keyboard, which must
be downsized, and performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell Latitude LT _ which is a twin of Sharp's Actius
notebook _ overcomes both of these problems and does so with style.
It's easily the best in its category.
</P>
<P>
   It weighs in at 3.1 pounds and is only an inch thick. It comes
with a 266-megahertz Pentium MMX chip, 64 megabytes of memory, a
4.3-gigabyte hard drive, a built-in 56K fax modem, 16-bit stereo
sound and an 11.3-inch active matrix screen.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with an external 20X CD-ROM drive and a
second battery that clips on to the back of the LT. Without those
options, the price is a lean $1,999.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard on the Latitude LT is superb, both in size and
feel, and the keys are intelligently placed. I made very few
mistakes touch-typing on it. My only complaint is that the Delete
key is too small _ it needs to be larger, but at least it is in the
far, upper-right corner of the keyboard, so it's easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   For a pointing devices, it uses a touchpad. I've found Dell's
touchpads somewhat unresponsive in the past _ this one is
definitely an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The LT also is very powerful. The computer ran everything I
threw at it, including a couple of 3D games, with nary a stutter.
The screen, while a little dark, was nevertheless more than
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   The case is made out of magnesium, which handles one of the
other common complaints about super-thin systems _ that they feel
flimsy. The LT has a rock-solid feel for such a tiny machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude LT has so-so battery life when the single battery
in the unit is used _ I got just under three hours. But clip the
optional battery onto the back of the system, and battery life
jumped to nearly seven hours. This makes the LT a great machine for
cross-country plane flights.
</P>
<P>
   This computer gets my nod as the nicest road-warrior's machine
I've seen in a long time. Dell has done small-and-light right.

MOST NOTEBOOKS OK FOR GLOBAL TRAVELERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My brother is planning to go to Spain for a year and wishes
to purchase a notebook computer that will go with both 120- and
210-volt electrical current. Can you suggest one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, almost any notebook computer will do, because most
portable computers have external AC-to-DC power converters. What
you need to do is to get a notebook and then a converter that can
handle different AC voltages.
</P>
<P>
   Many notebook power converters already are set up to handle
between 110 and 240 volts. Even some with built-in converters can
handle multiple voltages.
</P>
<P>
   What's more important is getting an adapter that lets you use
the kind of power connections for your destination.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, you probably can go to the manufacturer of the
notebook for an international adapter. There are several places
online where you can buy them if the manufacturer doesn't have what
you need. One site, LaptopTravel.com (www.laptop-travel.com), lets
you click on the region where you'll be traveling and see if an
adapter is available for that area.
</P>
<P>
   For more sites, try doing a search for ``notebook power
adapters'' at www.yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think I'm going to wait to upgrade my new computer with a
Pentium III chip when they come out. I have a 166-megahertz Pentium
MMX chip right now. Can I just pop this one out and pop the new one
in?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pentium III line actually is a version of the Pentium II
that includes an additional bit of software code that helps
graphics and sound work better. Some folks have referred to this
addition as ``MMX 2.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentium III has more in common with the Pentium II than
the MMX version of the original Pentium. Specifically, it is
expected to use the same cartridge-style design common on the
Pentium II chip. It will not be compatible with the pin design
found on the original Pentium and Pentium MMX chips.
</P>
<P>
   In order to upgrade that machine with a Pentium III, you'd need
a new system board. It may or may not support the kind of memory
chips you have, so you may need to buy new RAM. It will come with
an AGP port for faster graphics, so you likely will want a new
graphics card to take advantage of it. In other words, you're
better off getting a whole new computer.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is expected to introduce its new line in March.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband got a new computer and recently started playing
these 3-D games. He plays with flight simulators and Quake II and
some driving games. They all have a first-person point of view. We
hooked our old computer to our new one in a network and he wants me
to play with him, but whenever I try, I get sick to my stomach.
Does this happen to a lot of people? Is it normal?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not a doctor, and I don't even play one on TV. But yes, I
think it's normal.
</P>
<P>
   My wife experiences the same thing, a form of motion sickness,
whenever I entice her into a Quake II death match. My boss' wife
can't even watch someone else play these games.
</P>
<P>
   And don't feel bad _ you're in good company. Todd Hollenshead,
chief executive at id Software, which makes the Quake games, admits
he can get motion-sick playing these games.
</P>
<P>
   Dramamine, anyone?

 By BILL POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anxiously fingering her waist-length hair extensions,
the model Heidi Klum sucked on an Altoid and nursed a Bellini
cocktail, attempting to quiet her preshow jitters. At Cipriani Wall
Street last Wednesday night, before Victoria's Secret's
fifth-annual pre-Valentine's Day fashion presentation, frantic
television crews swarmed around Tyra Banks, Stephanie Seymour and
other super beauties.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klum answered the same questions over and over: ``What's
your biggest fantasy?'' ``Plans for Valentine's Day?'' ``Are you
nervous?''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 1,000 camera-toting onlookers, and untold numbers
watching on the Internet _ more than two million attempts to log on
to the show were reported _ saw her strut down the runway in
nothing but Manolo Blahniks and fancy underwear. That was enough to
rattle even Ms. Klum, a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model whose
nickname is The Body.
</P>
<P>
   ``On photo shoots you can always hide things, or they can
retouch the image later,'' Ms. Klum said, leaving the hair and
makeup room. ``On the runway you always wish your body was a little
tighter, and you worry that if you walk too fast things start to
jiggle.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes before her 7 p.m. catwalk call, Ms. Klum, who
is 5 feet 9 inches tall and from Germany, took refuge in a
stairwell where her husband, Ric Pipino, a hairstylist, was smoking
and chatting with friends. She slipped off her Cartier watch and
Donna Karan cashmere dress, tucked them into a bag and handed it to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the show's not done yet,'' she said to him.
``I've been talking about it so much I feel like it's over
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovered by television reporters, Ms. Klum bade her husband
adieu. He took his seat in the grand ballroom, along with others
like the actors Rosie Perez and Wesley Snipes and the photographer
Patrick Demarchelier.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Ms. Klum emerged as a ``blue angel,'' in a
sky-colored bra and panties, and then returned looking like a late
1990s Barbarella in a python-print slip and a satin thong.
</P>
<P>
   When the 20-minute show ended, in a flurry of rose petals, the
evening's deejay, Mark Ronson, threw on Fatboy Slim's ``Praise
You,'' and selected guests headed for a party in the mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   As an escort, Pipino could bypass the crowd, and he found
admirers surrounding his wife, grinning and swaying to the music.
He grabbed Ms. Klum's hand, and the couple stole a moment for a few
hugs and kisses, sandwiched between a tower of speakers and a bare
column. After one more celebratory Bellini, Pipino nodded toward
the door, gesturing that it was time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife's hand was being kissed by Unik, a dreadlocked
party promoter. Then she was detained by Stephen Baldwin, the
actor, in a snug black T-shirt and a big gold cross. ``The lingerie
was more upscale than I anticipated,'' he said, and then they
talked about her possible involvement in his upcoming independent
film, ``One Tree Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipino gripped his wife's hand and pressed through the swelling
balcony, determined to reach the exit. A Fuji television crew from
Japan lassoed Ms. Klum for an interview before they made it to the
back staircase, where a reporter for ``Fashion File,'' a show on
E!, stopped her for one last battery of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will you do for Valentine's Day?'' the reporter asked.
Pipino rolled his eyes and grabbed a shrimp. ``I'll probably just
stay at home and do nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be doing a private show now in the basement,'' Pipino
said jokingly, as he swept her through the exit doors. On the
street, Ms. Klum exhaled a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go home and get out of these heels,'' she said,
adding playfully, ``and these clothes.'' &QL;

 &HT;    DOLE MAY BENEFIT BY GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN IN POLITICS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Monday, Feb. 8.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole is moving into the presidential
spotlight at a unique time in American history _ when, according to
political experts, the country is finally comfortable with the idea
of a woman in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are varied _ a growing pool of experienced female
politicians, a maturing of national attitudes about the role of
women in society, and, not coincidentally, a feeling that a woman
would not sully the presidency with the kind of lewd behavior
President Clinton has exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Clinton era, ``there is an appetite for change and
new faces,'' said Celinda Lake, a well-known pollster and
strategist for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Women who seek public office are generally viewed as more
trustworthy than men, Lake noted. But more to the point, in 2000
people will be more willing to vote for a woman because ``they do
not think a woman will be messing around with their interns all the
time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent poll by Lake for the nonprofit, nonpartisan
White House Project found that 76 percent of Americans say they are
ready to elect a woman as president.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are ``eager to change the political climate and see
more women in public office, including the presidency,'' said Marie
Wilson, president of the White House Project.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is not among the 20 countries that
have had female presidents or prime ministers in this century, it
does have more women holding political office than at any time in
its history, according to data from the Center for the American
Woman and Politics at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixty-five women serve in the U.S. Congress, a record nine in
the Senate and 56 in the House.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women hold 89 of the 323 statewide elective executive
positions in the country, another record. In Arizona, they hold the
top five constitutional offices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women occupy 1,652 of the 7,424 state legislative seats in the
nation, or 22 percent. This is also a record, and a fivefold
increase since 1969, when only 301 women were serving. In
Washington, more than 40 percent of the state lawmakers are women.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of that political pyramid is Dole, who is scheduled
to address a sold-out Chamber of Commerce dinner Monday night in
Manchester, N.H., her first appearance in the nation's first
presidential primary state since resigning from the American Red
Cross last month.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is she capable of ``restoring dignity and integrity to
the office of the presidency,'' but she also has ``a proven track
record of being able to get things done,'' said Earl Cox, a South
Carolina Republican who is leading a ``Draft Elizabeth Dole 2000''
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is ready for a woman in the White House, but it's
not really a matter of gender,'' added Cox. ``It's an issue of
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, GOP strategist Stuart Stevens, who worked in Bob
Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said that if Elizabeth Dole does
run for the GOP nomination, her campaign will not emphasize her
gender. ``I don't think she is going to run a kind of Helen Reddy
candidacy,'' he said, referring to the recording artist best known
for the 1972 feminist anthem, ``I Am Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Republican Party is looking for a ``compassionate
conservative,'' in the words of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, it
may be better served by a woman rather than a man.
</P>
<P>
   One of the GOP's biggest problems is the perception that is
dominated by men who lack compassion, Linda DiVall, a longtime GOP
pollster, said at a recent conference at the University of
Virginia. But Dole's strong Christian faith and scandal-free
service in two presidential cabinets and at the Red Cross
``demonstrates a humanitarian aspect that is sorely lacking with
the party,'' DiVall said.
</P>
<P>
   Lake, DiVall's good friend and Democratic rival, has a nearly
identical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liddy Dole is a very powerful combination of executive
expertise and compassion,'' said Lake. ``The so-called
compassionate conservative message - she's kind of the embodiment
of it.'' And if she's on the Republican ticket, either at the head
or as No. 2, will ``almost surely'' force the Democratic Party to
have a woman on its ticket, she added.

`GIRL GONE': MUSIC AND DANCE MAKING MADNESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Something is terribly wrong at St. Lulu's school for
proper young ladies. The teacher is going mad. Strange men wander
in and out. Students are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   That is the story the playwright Mac Wellman and the
choreographer Annie-B Parson tell in ``Girl Gone,'' a musical
theater piece performed on Wednesday night at the Kitchen. Wellman
builds his story through the steady accretion of surrealistic
detail revealed in loops of nonsensical dialogue that makes
irrational but gripping sense. Music and dance are woven seamlessly
through the piece, merging stylization and folk qualities to
suggest the kind of rigidity and hyperreality that often go with
madness.
</P>
<P>
   Three young women known as ``the evil sisters'' are playing a
game they call ``going away,'' to an imaginary country called Vadoo
that becomes all too real. A writer with a sneaky sympathy for his
characters, Wellman clearly has traveled through Vadoo himself at
some point. This is the country of anarchic childhood emotions,
particularly those of adolescent girls. ``Girl Gone'' resembles a
post-modernist re-envisioning of Christina Rossetti's fevered
``Goblin Market.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten dancers and actors play 14 quick-shifting characters who
emerge with impressive clarity under Paul Lazar's direction, in a
cast led by Cynthia Hopkins, Molly Hickok and Stacy Dawson as the
sisters and Kourtney Rutherford, Tymberly Canale and Rebecca
Wisocky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins' score and Claudia Stephens' costumes have a rich
peculiarity, and Joanne Howard's set creates distinct worlds with
just a few benches and scrims, lighted imaginatively by David
Moodey. The cast also includes Josh Broder, Anna Kohler, Tim
Cummings and Daniel Zippi. Produced originally by Ms. Parson's Big
Dance Theater and the Bat Theater Company, ``Girl Gone'' closes
Saturday night. It deserves a longer run.

in the business won't be among them: Nike, the largest exhibitor,

On this occasion, he was standing near the goal post and throwing
footballs at the balls that sailed past, end over end. Try that
sometime at home. Payton was hitting at least one in every three of
the moving targets 30 feet above. The moment captured the whimsy,

YOU'RE BEING WATCHED _ OR MAYBE NOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I heard that Microsoft is planning to make the
new Pentium with a special transmitter that will let them track you
whenever you log on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heightened Awareness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HEIGHTENED: You have a mighty high opinion of yourself. Why
in the world would Microsoft care what you do? You're really not
that interesting. I know. I've been tracking you myself.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I know everybody thinks Microsoft is pure evil,
but this really isn't its doing. It makes software. Intel makes the
chips, and even though most Intel machines run on Microsoft
operating systems, they don't absolutely have to.
</P>
<P>
   Intel built what amounts to a unique serial number inside the
new Pentium III chips, ostensibly as an added level of security.
Let's say your rat-faced neighbor swipes your user ID and password
for your online travel service. Since your credit card number is on
file there, he can easily sit next door and book himself and his
frumpy wife and ugly kid on the next slow boat to China, all at
your expense. If, however, that site also required that any
transaction be done from a PC with a known serial number, they
could reject the sale and notify you. You'd be well within your
rights at that point to walk next door and knock over his stupid
birdbath and ceramic chickens.
</P>
<P>
   When the self-appointed guardians of Internet privacy got wind
of this serial-number plan, they went ballistic and started
threatening boycotts. Intel reacted by turning the security feature
off, but that doesn't mean some Poindexter with an itch to see how
many times you visit the Nervous Sheep in Bondage home page can't
figure a way to switch it back on.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are already so many ways to keep track of things
like that, one more isn't going usher in the New World Order. Waste
your paranoia on better stuff.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The majority of the people believe that the
21st century starts on Jan. 1, 2000. It should commence on Jan. 1,
2001. Please help correct this general fallacy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stickler
</P>
<P>
   DEAR STICK: Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Who cares when
it begins? Our calendar is just an arbitrary numbering system that
not everyone uses anyway. In fact, I declare that the 21st century
begins ... wait a second ... almost ... hold it ... now! Happy New
Year!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I want to buy a program so that all a seller
has to do is type in the product code and it will print the
invoice, deduct the item from inventory, add in the tax, etc. It
must be so simple that my rather slow wife can use it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchant Of Venom
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MERCHANT: You know, I'm so happy my appeal extends even to
folks like you. Here, I'll speak so you can understand:
</P>
<P>
   Wife not slow. Wife no like magic box. Mama Bombay no like magic
box either. You call Mama slow too? Me get club and spear. Unn

PUTTING A (COMPUTER) BUG IN MY EAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try as I might to quiet the niggling little voice that arises
from the recesses of my brain, I'm having a tough time shutting out
the whispered ``Y2K'' that creeps into my mind late at night.
</P>
<P>
   What if THEY are right? You know who THEY are _ the Cassandras
of late-night radio and the Internet, sounding the alarm that
society as we know it is going to crater come midnight Dec. 31, and
all will be plunged into chaos and mayhem because of a two-digit
programming error in the computers that now run our lives.
</P>
<P>
   And the terrible part may not wait until the big analog dial in
the sky clicks over to 2000. It may come in the weeks prior to the
new year, when people start to panic about what might happen and
stampede the stores, clearing shelves of food, bottled water,
batteries and propane gas.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen just recently what can happen when a nation's food
distribution system breaks down. Colombians who lived through the
devastation of the earthquake that destroyed two-thirds of Armenia
last month looted what remained of the city and stormed the Red
Cross supply depot when food became a scarce commodity.
</P>
<P>
   The born skeptic in me, the one that led me into journalism,
says the proliferation of companies taking advantage of people's
fears is about as all-American as you can get. Companies selling
everything from a year's supply of prepackaged, dehydrated food
(enough for one adult for only $1,995!) to hand-cranked shortwave
radios are making a killing these days, and the more panicked folks
are about the potential for disaster, the more merchandise they
sell.
</P>
<P>
   But what if they're right?
</P>
<P>
   Reports fill the news wires daily about how various government
agencies or private businesses are working to become Y2K compliant
before the witching hour _ and how some might not make it. The
airlines' reservation systems are apparently OK, but what about the
planes themselves? Major industries, such as General Motors, might
be compliant, but what about all the little guys who supply them?
</P>
<P>
   Troubling signs abound. In a Y2K review last week about the
readiness of Atlanta's water and sewer systems, one presenter
recommended that the audience ``get as many five-gallon buckets''
as it could. No one was sure he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   At the same conference, John Stephenson, chief of staff for
Y2K-concerned U.S. Sen. Robert F. Bennett of Utah, gave what the
Cox News Service described as ``a moderately negative overview of
U.S. readiness and the assertion that Congress, if need be, can
respond in a hurry to Y2K problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that make anyone feel better, knowing that ``if need be,''
Congress can respond in a hurry? The little voice in my head just
got louder.
</P>
<P>
   The United States isn't the only place where the millennium bug
is an infestation problem, although our high-tech nation has far
more computers and a higher level of reliance on technology than
most other countries. Russian officials appealed this week to the
United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for $3
billion needed to help fix the computer system that controls
Russia's nuclear weapons. This after a U.S. deputy defense
secretary admitted last month that there's ``some nervousness'' in
Washington about Russia's potential computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   And in China, the Beijing Morning Post reported this week that a
survey of the country's most crucial enterprises revealed that more
than half didn't even know how to detect a computer glitch in their
systems.
</P>
<P>
   That voice in my head is screaming.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: New Year's Eve will be celebrated at home
this year. And the next trip to the store will include a stroll
down the bottled water and canned food aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Now be quiet!

   UNDATED _ What do Clark's Outpost in Tioga, Texas, and a
Texas-style barbecue restaurant outside Los Angeles have in common?
Not as much as the owner of the California restaurant would
initially have had customers believe, apparently. Californian David
Dickter learned of Clark's barbecue at a 1996 charity event hosted
by the acclaimed chef Wolfgang Puck. Later, he and the Clarks _
Warren and Nancy Ann _ talked about a business venture that was
never formalized. And the mistrust grew as the Clarks battled to
keep Dickter from capitalizing on their restaurant's name _ and
fame. By BILL HANNA. Story has moved in ``a'' general news

programs, saying the state of Texas is jeopardizing its opportunity
to save lives and money. Soon after the state settled with the
tobacco industry for $15 billion, groups such as the American
Cancer Society began lobbying for a four-year $200 million pilot
project that would include an advertising campaign, a quit-smoking
hot line and numerous grassroots programs. Instead, two
high-ranking legislators are taking a different approach in their
preliminary outline for the first $1.8 billion. By CHARLOTTE HUFF.

PLAYA DEL CARMEN GOES INTERNATIONAL

   PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico _ Mexico's Mayan Riviera stretches 130
kilometers from tourist-overrun Cancun south to the historic
coastal ruins of Tulum. Strategically located midway between the
two lies the charming seaside resort of Playa del Carmen.
</P>
<P>
   It's remembered by even somewhat-recent visitors as a sleepy
village with hogs running loose in its potholed streets. But that
image is outdated. The potholes remain, but an international
coterie of mostly young vagabonds has pushed aside the pigs.
</P>
<P>
   On my recent visit, every other commercial building seemed to be
undergoing renovation to handle the 20,000 residents and surging
tourist trade. And yet, the small-village charm has been retained.
Any destination in town easily reached on foot. Visitors have no
need for rental cars or taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful Isla de Cozumel is just 12 miles and 30 minutes away
by ferry. Taxis and buses make Akumal (once ``diving capital of the
world''), Tulum, Cancun and numerous other tourist diversions
within easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   On dining rounds and pub crawls, I encountered a surprising
number of Europeans, mostly young Brits, French, Germans and
Swedes, and even a few Australians. Many have taken up residence,
contributing to the international flavor of the small hotels,
restaurants and bars. Restaurant fare is diverse and increasingly
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Small and cozy describes most of the spots in Playa del Carmen,
but the bar at the Blue Parrot hotel is pickup central, the place
to see or be seen, and usually the busiest spot in town. Friends
highly recommend the hotel as a comfortable and convenient place to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   I, however, chose the more sedate Pelicano Inn, where each room
comes with a hammock, many on balconies that overlook the sea. And
if it's luxury you're looking for, try the nearby Continental Plaza
Playacar.
</P>
<P>
   Just offshore from Playa is the 250-kilometer-long Honduras
Reef, the Western Hemisphere's longest reef, stretching to Belize.
It accounts for the placid wave action along the white-sand beaches
and the abundance of snorkeling and diving facilities throughout
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby archaeological ruins worth extended visits include
Xel-ha, Tulum and Coba.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Tulum is perched on a limestone cliff overlooking the
azure sea. A small beach below El Castillo, the site's most
impressive structure, was packed with swimsuit-clad tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Coba lies just west, encroached on every side by jungle. It has
the tallest pyramid on the peninsula, offering stunning views that
are a suitable reward for the 12-story climb to its top.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered the nearby marina of Puerto Aventuras too late to
explore it fully, but this is the place to go if you are interested
im diving, sailing or fishing. Returning with friends from a trip
to Tulum, I stopped by for a late-afternoon meal and was charmed by
several dolphins frolicking in a nearby pool.
</P>
<P>
   For the price of hamburgers, we were treated to a unique show. A
pair of dolphins, separated from two other groups by nets, were
clearly agitated. Their antics attracted the rapt attention of the
other dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Aventuras offers a range of rental units, from
condominiums to two large hotels and two bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO ...
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Playa del Carmen and Cancun share the same
airport. Taxi fare from the airport to Playa runs $40-$50. Your
hotel may be able to make a better arrangement for you. Experienced
travelers with a command of Spanish can cut costs considerably by
using the local buses, but it is not easy for neophytes.

MUSLIM WOMEN HEAR THE CALL OF A STORYTELLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was only a creation of the imagination, a young woman of
Baghdad who told 1,001 spellbinding stories to an Arab king
hundreds of years ago. Her name was Scheherazade and her marvelous
tales, a collection known by Western readers as ``The Arabian
Nights,'' have been a part of life in the Islamic world for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But now Scheherazade herself is getting a powerful new image as
a feminist icon, a provocative role model and an inspiration for
Muslim women who are seeking to take a stronger role in Islamic
society without abandoning their religion or their culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became obsessed with Scheherazade,'' Azar Nafisi, a former
university professor in Tehran, Iran, said of the fictional
heroine, who used her courage, erudition and wit to face down her
own likely death and, in the process, transformed a kingdom and a
king.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nafisi has been teaching since last year at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.
``In Iran,'' she said, ``I was trying to teach and write literature
and be the kind of woman I wanted to be without compromising.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven from two teaching jobs because of her independence and
her refusal to wear an enveloping head scarf, Ms. Nafisi collected
six of her brightest female students in Tehran and began an
intensive extracurricular study of a multivolume version of
Scheherazade's stories, which Iranians, who are not Arabs, prefer
to call ``One Thousand and One Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands of Islamic women from North Africa to Southeast
Asia _ writers, lawyers, leaders of self-help health organizations,
teachers and professors, even those working clandestinely in home
schools in Afghanistan _ have had to react to opposed phenomena in
recent decades: Western feminism and the Islamic fundamentalism
that seeks to set back decades of modernizing trends in a number of
Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the story of Scheherazade (or Shahrazad, as she
is also known) fills two needs. It demonstrates that women need not
``Westernize'' to expand their rights and roles within their
societies, and that Islamic history and literature may provide the
most effective tools against today's Muslim zealots.
</P>
<P>
   Scheherazade, always a popular literary figure, has therefore
become a powerful symbol, too.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ms. Nafisi will join two other Muslim women _ Fatima
Mernissi, a Moroccan scholar, and Mahnaz Afkhami, an
Iranian-American who founded an international Muslim women's
organization, Sisterhood Is Global _ in a program titled
``Shahrazad Then and Now'' at the Freer Gallery in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The three will talk and lead a discussion in the gallery. They
are billing the program as a discussion of how powerful literary,
artistic and historical figures relate to ``the present-day reality
of Muslim women and their continuing use of subversive methods to
affect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   To look at Scheherazade anew is to see a Muslim woman's life
before the accretions of male-centered customs and interpretations
of the Koran consigned girls and women to invisible, second-class
citizenship. Listen to how Scheherazade is described in ``The
Arabian Nights,'' as translated by Husain Haddawy from a
14th-century Syrian manuscript (W.W. Norton, 1990):
</P>
<P>
   ``Shahrazad had read the books of literature, philosophy and
medicine. She knew poetry by heart, and studied historical reports,
and was acquainted with the sayings of men and the maxims of sages
and kings. She was intelligent, knowledgeable, wise and refined.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheherazade was not only a fictional character but also a
literary device invented to fill the role of narrator of the
``frame'' story around the tales, which include raucous, bawdy
adventures as well as morality lessons and stories loved by
children, like Aladdin and Sinbad the Sailor.
</P>
<P>
   In the frame story, Scheherazade was the daughter of the vizier,
or chief minister, to a king, Shahrayar, who had been betrayed by
his queen and turned violently against all women. Every night he
would summon a new young virgin to his bed for sex, and every
morning he would ask his vizier to have her put to death.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Scheherazade told her father she wanted to volunteer to
go to the king. The vizier was distressed, but could not stop her.
</P>
<P>
   Scheherazade contrived with her sister, Dinarzad, to start a
storytelling session in the king's chamber before the first night
ended. With her encyclopedic knowledge and narrative skills,
Scheherazade established a pattern of spinning out an exciting
tale, but stopping before it reached an end, sparking the
imagination of Shahrayar. He decided to let her live another day to
hear what happened next _ and then another day, and another and
another.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of three years, Scheherazade had borne the king
several children and had taught him through her stories not only to
trust her but also to understand that there were good and bad
people everywhere. She had, moreover, saved the rest of the
kingdom's young women from slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   While the glorification of such a character might strike some
Western feminists as less than stunning progress in asserting
women's rights, Islamic women say that within their culture it's a
good starting point.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, Bouthaina Shaaban, a professor of English at Damascus
University, said in a telephone interview that while recently
completing a book on female Arab novelists who wrote from 1899 to
1990 she found that many drew on Scheherazade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak about Scheherazade from the point of view of language:
that a woman used language to deter physical violence,'' Ms.
Shaaban said. ``Arab women in particular have resorted to the use
of language as a way of fighting their battles, whether these are
social or educational or political battles.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, Ms. Mernissi, a research scholar at Rabat's Mohammed
VI University, said in a telephone interview that this was not the
first time Scheherazade had inspired a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1920s,'' as a number of Muslim countries began to
modernize and secularize, she said, ``big names in the Arab world
spoke of Scheherazade as an example for intellectuals fighting for
their rights. She was a fighter for the right of free expression.
Someone once made a list of theater plays inspired by Scheherazade.
It was enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to use her as a way to build self-confidence,''
said Ms. Mernissi, who lectures and leads group discussions among
students, many of whom face unemployment or generally bleak
economic prospects when they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, if I'm faced with a killer, I will use all my means, I
say. I ask them: Where did this woman get this self-confidence?
This woman gained the right to live by using the right words. It's
fantastic material for talking about the extremely tragic problems
society has. And it teaches how to fight violence with words.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim feminists _ and not all accept that label, even when it
seems to fit _ invariably tell a Westerner asking about
Scheherazade that the Islamic world has always had strong women,
and still does. In Damascus, Ms. Shaaban dismissed contemporary
Western views of Islamic women as ``absolute nonsense'' and
``irrelevant to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Afkhami, who was minister for women's affairs in the
government of the last shah of Iran, agrees. ``The Occident's view
of the Orient has always been based on very submissive and quiet
women in the background or the voluptuous, sexual occupants of the
harem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Islamic women looking at their own history see women in a
range of very visible and active roles. Muslim women today are very
much hampered by a lot of traditions and a lot of cultural
impediments, but in fact they are living their lives in a very
decisive and articulate way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslim women have largely stopped being reactive to Western
feminism,'' she said. ``It releases a whole lot of positive energy
for us not to have to say what we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see that the salvation of our part of the world lies in our
being able to recreate our culture and our beliefs in ways that are
conducive to the life we must live,'' Ms. Afkhami continued.
``Muslim women are not giving up their faith; they're not giving up
their traditions or their culture, but they are reimagining them in
ways that let them build on that and get strength and nourishment
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prototype is Scheherazade,'' she said, ``who made her
world as she talked about it.''

   The federal government has banned cigarette smoking on airplanes
and in office buildings. Now comes the next stop on the smoke-free
frontier: postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service will unveil a new stamp on Feb. 18
celebrating Jackson Pollock's contribution to Abstract
Expressionism. The stamp, only the second to commemorate an
American artist, is based on a 1949 Life magazine photograph
showing the denim-clad artist, a chain smoker, in his studio
pouring paint onto canvas, a cigarette hanging precariously from
his mouth. But in an artist's rendering of the photograph on the
stamp, the cigarette has vanished.

   ``We're not honoring a smoker who happened to be an artist;
we're honoring a very good artist who happened to be a smoker,''
said Don Smeraldi, a spokesman for the Postal Service. ``Smoking is
not the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced philatelists know that this is not the first time a
cigarette has been excised for a postage stamp. A 1994 stamp
commemorating the blues guitarist Robert Johnson shows him lacking
his signature cigarette, which appeared in the original photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Holmes took the Pollock photograph for a Life cover
article, ``Jackson Pollock: Is He the Greatest Living Painter in
the United States?'' and Life licensed it to the Postal Service for
use as an artist's reference. Postal officials turned the
black-and-white photograph into a color version, she said, adding
that ``they cropped off his bald head, and I think it's all just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone finds this revision harmless. David Lubin, an
expert in cultural symbolism at Colby College in Waterville, Maine,
said the Pollock stamp was an example of the ``government trying to
sanitize American history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has taken the cigarette out of the photograph
because they think it's in the public's best interest, but that is
an ethically shaky position to take,'' he said. ``The question is,
Should we expunge cigarette smokers as role models?''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Harrison, director of the Pollock-Krasner Study Center in
East Hampton, N.Y., said: ``It's a distortion, but I understand why
it was done. Frankly, when you see it on a letter, you won't know
the difference, but it's unfortunate that bad boy Jackson can't get
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A cigarette has appeared on a stamp at least once: a 1982
20-cent stamp honoring the centennial of the birth of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt shows a profile of the president and his
cigarette holder.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp honoring Pollock, who died in 1956, is part of the
Postal Service's ``Celebrate the Century'' series, a showcase for
famous people, discoveries, historical and cultural events and
inventions in particular decades. The stamp is part of the 1940s
series, which also includes a determined Rosie the Riveter; the
Slinky toy; Jackie Robinson, the first black major league player;
big-band music, and the television puppet Howdy Doody.
</P>
<P>
   The first American artist to be pictured on a stamp was Norman
Rockwell.

   DRAFT-REVIVAL-REVIEW (Washington) _ A quarter century after the
last conscripts mustered at boot camp, the idea of reviving the
draft has gained new currency among a small lot of academics,
lawmakers and, even, military commanders. They argue that a
restoration of the draft _ perhaps as part of some compulsory
national service _ would not only answer the personnel crises
facing today's volunteer forces but also provide a much-needed
curative to the military's growing detachment from society. By

   EX-SPIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Hundreds of former CIA and KGB

capitalism, providing protection, intelligence and political risk
assessments to U.S. companies extending their reach to emerging
markets and other global hot spots. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-LENDING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ever since the global
financial crisis began in East Asia 19 months ago, the public
debate has focused on how to keep poor countries from borrowing too
much money. Now, though, economists and policy-makers have been
struck by a new insight: whenever somebody is borrowing too much,
somebody else is lending too much. So begins a new debate about how
best to restrain the lenders who got the countries into trouble in

behavior. A look at the experiences of journalism students sent as

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ENGLAND-REVIEW (London) _ In 1386, Michael de la Pole,
Earl of Suffolk, became the first person in history to be
impeached. His case also marked the first appearance of the phrase

the U.S. Senate. By Alan Cowell.

   HOMELESS-DEPRESSION-REVIEW (New York) _ Depression and
manic-depression, with its wild mood swings, are becoming
recognized as a significant cause of homelessness. Shelters have
long been filled with schizophrenics, people whose hallucinations
and delusions force them out of jobs, homes and relationships. But
the link between depression and homelessness is only now becoming
clear. By Lynette Holloway.

<P>
   SOCSEC-STOCKS-REVIEW (Washington) _ What would happen if the
government were investing hundreds of billions of dollars of Social
Security reserves in the stock market, and congressional
anti-abortion forces decided that none of this money should be put
into companies that make or import abortion pills? That is the kind
of nightmare foreseen by economists and politicians who oppose
President Clinton's plan to beef up Social Security reserves by
investing some of the money in stocks. Political tampering, Alan
Greenspan said, could endanger `the efficiency of our capital
markets and thus our economy.' By David E. Rosenbaum.

   CENSUS-REDISTRICT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the political
implications of dueling census methods. The Supreme Court ruled out
using a method of counting called statistical sampling in doling
out the 435 House seats among the states in 2001. This kind of
sampling, which is used by pollsters and advocated by the Clinton
administration, would help account for the disproportionately large
number of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, poor people and city
dwellers who have been overlooked by census-takers. By James Dao.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Windswept heavy rain and mountain snow will lash the Pacific
Northwest as a potent Pacific front sweeps toward the coast. Wind
gusts over 60 miles an hour will occur at many exposed coastal
locations later Saturday and Saturday night from extreme northern
California to Washington. East of the Cascades, showers will
develop in the valleys while intermittent snow occurs in the
mountains of northern Idaho and western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Mild weather with ample sunshine will prevail from the east
slopes of the northern Rockies to the western and central Plains.
Gusty winds from the west will be common near the hilly terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will become heavy at times in the cool air over northern
Texas and Oklahoma as low pressure moves across the southern
Plains. Showers and some potent thunderstorms will develop Saturday
afternoon over parts of eastern Texas as increasingly humid air is
drawn north. The area of rain and imbedded thunderstorms will be
spread toward the lower Mississippi Valley later Saturday and
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, the day will begin with some sunshine near the
coast, but clouds will increase during the day. Patchy showers will
precede a weakening front as it moves from the eastern Ohio valley
to the interior Northeast. Patchy light snow and flurries will
occur from southeastern Ontario to northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonable warmth will cover most of the Southeastern states.
Sunshine will be abundant near the Atlantic coast but clouds will
thicken in the afternoon near the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Storm
</P>
<P>
   A fierce blizzard swept over coastal southeastern Alaska on
Friday signaling a reawakening of one of this hemisphere's
perennial storms. The Aleutian low, named for its proximity to the
Alaskan archipelago, appears on weather maps for most of the year.
Gales which develop off the east coast of Asia are drawn toward the
large temperature contrasts in the Aleutians that result as polar
winds meet the warmer waters of the Pacific. In the Atlantic,
surges of frigid air from Greenland provide the energy for a
similar atmospheric whirlpool known as the Icelandic low.

`NIGHT RIDE HOME': IMPERFECT PEOPLE SURVIVING A LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Night Ride Home'' has the courage to depict imperfect people
who are walloped by a heartbreaking loss and emerge only slightly
wiser and no closer to perfection than before.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the film, to be shown Sunday on CBS, is the
quietly disturbing performance of Rebecca De Mornay as Nora Mahler,
a woman whose only fully formed human relationship is with her
teen-age son, Simon (Jordan Brower).
</P>
<P>
   Nora's other sustaining bond is to the horses she keeps on her
ranch, a place of unlikely beauty where she has lived since
childhood. (The bright vistas that frame this dark tale were shot
in Oregon.)
</P>
<P>
   When Simon is killed in a riding accident, thrown by his
mother's favorite horse, Nora falls apart. Her lonely husband, Neal
(Keith Carradine), and their daughter, Clea (Thora Birch), who was
Simon's riding companion when he died, are left to wrestle silently
with their own loss and guilt, while Nora withdraws further into
her grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its no use,'' she tells Neal from the hospital bed where she
lies sedated. With nowhere else to turn, Neal summons his
no-nonsense mother-in-law, Maggie (Ellen Burstyn). But if Maggie is
going to provide some nurturing help to her daughter, it will be
the first time. Neal is not the only person Nora has frozen out.
</P>
<P>
   Lost and nearly defeated, Neal declares to Clea: ``We'll just
have to get through this. Have to. Get through it. We'll find a way
to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carradine speaks these words, and nearly all of Neal's
pedestrian speeches, through a mask of weary pain that touchingly
suggests the anguish underneath. This husband has been isolated in
the best of times. Now, in the worst, he begins to wonder whether
he can ever save Nora or whether his only hope is to try to save
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The script (by Ronald Parker and Darrah Cloud, from the novel by
Barbara Esstman) offers Ms. De Mornay speeches that are no more
eloquent than her co-star's. But she, too, communicates despite the
words, managing to tell her story most memorably through her
silences. The terror in her blue eyes is haunting.
</P>
<P>
   Never sniveling, she molds the portrayal of a woman trapped by
her own fears and disappointment. Starting with the scenes before
the son's death, Ms. De Mornay and the director, Glenn Jordan,
depict a woman believably uncomfortable in her skin. Even her
well-scrubbed good looks compound the tragedy: Nora suffers in the
cold while she seems to radiate sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burstyn and the other principal cast members _ notably Ms.
Birch and Lynn Thigpen as Neal's levelheaded office assistant _
keep the production grounded in a world that may not hold any happy
endings. But even in such a frightening world, the film seems to
say, you can survive the pain if you don't insist on enduring it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night Ride Home'' is the 200th presentation of ``The Hallmark
Hall of Fame.'' This drama could help sell some Valentine's Day
cards. It will certainly move vast quantities of Kleenex.

 &HT;    HUMAN-ANIMAL BOND BECOMES CONCERN OF CHANGING SOCIETY
 &HT;    (Graphics information below.)
 &HT;    By Jeff Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Recognizing that dogs, cats and other animals have
become ``family members,'' veterinary schools are beginning to
teach their students how to deal with pet owners' problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connection between people and their companion animals
requires veterinarians to develop and cultivate special skills to
meet the needs created by these relationships,'' said Laurel
Lagoni, a family counselor on the staff of the Colorado State
University veterinary school. ``Their clients are not just the
animals they are treating for medical concerns, but also the human
owners, who have emotional concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is required courses in human-animal ``bond-centered
care'' for students at the school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 55 million dogs in America and more than
that many cats. Americans spend an estimated $20 billion a year on
their pets.
</P>
<P>
   According to the results of a 1995 survey by the American Animal
Hospital Association, these animals have moved into family roles
that are much more personal than traditional activities such as
catching rats in the barn and barking at strangers who drive up.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 70 percent of pet owners refer to their animals as
their ``children,'' and 79 give their pets holiday or birthday
presents.
</P>
<P>
   Of around 1,200 pet owners covered in the survey, 62 percent
said they often sign their pets' names on letters and cards.
</P>
<P>
   Lagoni is coordinator of the Colorado school's Argus Center for
the Human-Animal Bond, which took its name from the mythical dog of
Ulysses. According to the myth, Ulysses returned to his home from
20 years of traveling, wearing disguise because of a war that was
going on at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disguise, his faithful old dog, Argus, recognized
him.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed a lot since those days, and especially in
the past few decades, Lagoni notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is changing so much that people are relying on their
pets more as family members,'' she said. ``The divorce rate is
high, people move around more so human families are dispersed and
many elderly people are alone. As human support systems break down,
people are turning to animals for
</P>
<P>
   companionship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagoni said she was in a family guidance practice when
veterinarians at the university clinic began calling on her to help
such human problems as bereavement when animals had to be put down
or desperate anxiety when a pet had medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that there are dark sides to the human-animal
bond. An estimated 12 million animals are destroyed each year in
America because the relationship doesn't work out, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The animal hospital association says that pets often share the
brunt of familial abuse.
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet page, www.healthypet.com, the association
estimates that 88 percent of pets living in households with
domestic abuse are either abused or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Of women who enter shelters to escape abuse, 57 percent owned
pets that were killed by abusers, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
   The bond also works against pets who are left alone, sometimes
confined in apartments, while their owners are at work. The problem

view,'' Lagoni said. ``Many of these animals have great, loving
homes and have great lives, but as a consequence, they don't get to
be dogs and cats.''

   She said the new dog-human relationship is showing up in a
number of areas of society besides vets' offices. Some employers
now allow workers to bring their pets to work, she said, and
``doggie day care'' enterprises are springing up.

   ``I understand the dogs just love it,'' she said. ``They get to
exercise. They get to play with the other dogs and then, at the end

GEEZERS ON THE GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday Feb. 8)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While you were napping, the United Nations declared 1999 the
International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who is hurtling toward Older Person status at the
speed one normally associates with rogue asteroids, this
declaration does not come a moment too soon. If the United Nations
had waited much longer, I might have whizzed right past Older
Person status and gone directly to Gibbering Geezer or, worse yet,
Lawn Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota, of course, is absolutely lousy with Older Persons to
the point that you can hardly throw an empty Metamucil bottle out
your car window without smacking one in the head. (Lame joke: If
you want to start a stampede in a Sarasota movie house, you don't
yell ``Fire!'' You yell ``Viagra!'')
</P>
<P>
   Older Persons, at least of the Sarasota variety, are quite
active and engaged and much too busy to give the United Nations a
day of their time, much less a year. If your idea of an alert Older
Person is someone who can rock and drool at the same time, you need
to get a load of the old folks from Sarasota. They run marathons,
play championship golf and tennis, write novels, play in jazz
bands, go to college and just generally make us younger folk feel
like soggy Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   I used to look forward to being an Older Person, but now I'm not
sure if I have the stamina. As someone who gets dizzy bending over
to pick up the morning newspaper, it's hard to imagine turning 65
and suddenly feeling the urge to skydive, water-ski or scuba-dive.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, Sarasota-style, is a lot more than wandering around
in your bathrobe mumbling to yourself; it's a full-time job that
requires energy and commitment. The situation is only going to get
worse once the United Nations' message of empowered
senior-citizenship gets around.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, there is already too much pressure on
Older Persons without the United Nations getting into the act. The
first question that's asked of a person approaching his or her 65th
birthday is, ``What are you going to do when you retire?''
Somewhere along the line the definition of retirement changed from
``to stop doing'' to ``to start doing'' and the whole idea of
retirement has been a lot less attractive ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The old notion of retirement as ``long days of nothing special
interrupted by frequent naps'' has no relevance in today's society.
Retirees often find themselves working harder for longer hours
(and, of course, lower pay) than they did when they held the
stressful, full-time jobs they were so anxious to quit.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to think of retirement as a time when the most
strenuous thing you have to do is scuff out to the kitchen for a
fresh cup of tea, but the reality is far less relaxed. In Sarasota,
many Older Persons fill their time doing volunteer work, performing
in community theater, becoming active in local politics or
otherwise flitting about in a decidedly un-old-fogeyish way. While
I have no quarrel with Older Persons who wish to remain active to
the point of carrying their own coffins, I don't think there should
be a stigma attached to Older Persons who prefer that their
retirement years proceed at a more leisurely pace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the folks at the United Nations may think otherwise,
there is nothing wrong with an Older Person going through an entire
day without doing anything that promotes his or her physical or
mental well-being or results in the betterment of mankind. If all
you managed to do in the last 24 hours was feed yourself and hit
the mute button when the Jerry Springer show came on, you should
not feel that you squandered your time.
</P>
<P>
   Life, after all, can be very pleasurable if you don't let your
retirement get in the way.
</P>

SOFTWARE FOR KIDS BREAKS $15 BARRIER 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer prices have been dropping steadily for more than 10
years. And rapidly, too. It took years for a top-shelf computer to
break the $1,000 level, but it only took another year or less to
fall below the $500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Because computers are the big-ticket item, their price drop has
drawn the most attention. But software prices are running lower,
too.
</P>
<P>
   About three or four years ago, the average price of children's
software program was in the $30 to $40 range. Today, good programs
can be had for half that.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Humongous Entertainment introduced two children's
titles in the $15-and-under price range. The two programs, Pajama
Sam's Lost and Found and Spy Fox in Cheese Chase, are for the
3-to-8 and 5-to-10 age groups, respectively. The programs are on a
hybrid CD-ROM (computer talk meaning, ``Windows or Macintosh
machines'').
</P>
<P>
   Pajama Sam and Spy Fox are animated cartoon characters. Sam's an
irrepressible youngster who has managed to misplace his clothes and
toys. He crawls under the bed to search for missing items, and in
the process meets some old friends and finds some new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Otto the boat will drift Sam down a river to collect missing
items in an arcade-like game. Other friends like Rosie the sled and
Trigger the wagon help Sam, too, as children learn basic skills
while solving the simple problems needed to complete the tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The program also has features that can be customized so children
can return to their favorite game level. If they have problems with
a level, they can deactivate whatever is blocking progress and come
back later.
</P>
<P>
   Spy Fox's adventure begins at the Museum de Fromage, where his
old Nemesis, Russian Blue (a cat) has made off with the prized
cheese. It's up to Spy Fox to track her down, and the chase takes
him through 100 levels and several forms of transportation. They
include an air cycle to fly over an amusement park, a water scooter
to go along rivers and Venetian canals, and snowmobile.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-drawn animations are nicely done, the plot is engaging,
and the end result is a lot of fun for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Parents probably won't mind spending time with their children in
front of the computer while they play. And they can also help
children use a custom level editor that lets children create up to
15 custom levels they and their friends can play.
</P>
<P>
   The games should be available in retail and computer stores. If
not, visit the Web site (www.humongous.com) or call, tollfree,
1-800-499-8386.

`GRETTY GOOD TIME': SO FULL OF LIFE, SO DETERMINED TO DIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gretty Myers is quite a character.
</P>
<P>
   As written by John Belluso and brought to vivid, troubling life
in a powerful performance by Fiona Gallagher at Ensemble Studio
Theater, this young woman is funny, flirtatious, sexy, sly,
mischievous and mean.
</P>
<P>
   She's a good friend and a nasty enemy, who can charm you at one
second and turn on you the next.
</P>
<P>
   She is full of life, and she wants to die.
</P>
<P>
   Gretty Myers is the riveting focus at the compassionate heart
and thoughtful soul of Belluso's gripping ``Gretty Good Time,''
which, through Sunday, will be applying high drama and sharp satire
to questions of life and death and to dreams of altering the past.
</P>
<P>
   German-born Gretty is 32. She has been a polio victim since the
age of 15 or 16, when her parents took her to the United States for
treatment. Now, in 1955, with all but one arm paralyzed, the sits
bitterly in a wheelchair in a nursing home insisting on her right
to die. ``I will have choice,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, her only escape from the life she loathes is
through her dreams. In them, she enjoys the company of Hideko
Kimura (Anna Li), one of the Hiroshima Maidens, her face disfigured
by radiation burns in the atomic bombing 10 years earlier, who has
been transported to the United States for her 20th corrective
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible medium for the meeting of these two women who
would travel backward through time to change their lives is the
television version of ``This Is Your Life,'' with Hideko as the
subject, the co-pilot (Baxter Harris) of the B-29 that dropped the
bomb as a guest, and Ted Neustadt as the unctuous, intrusive host,
Ralph Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Belluso's talent for caustic humor and satire mingles in these
scenes with his keen sense of the wellsprings of guilt and regret
as his play, smoothly directed by Susann Brinkley, cuts back and
forth between the broadcast and Gretty's dreams and the nursing
home.
</P>
<P>
   There, Gretty plots to feign a heart attack to facilitate the
escape of her best friend, a wealthy, eccentric alcoholic, Dolores
McCloud (Sally Loeb), whose zest for life clashes with Gretty's
yearning for death. There, too, Gretty deals with her own guilts,
battles the elderly Dr. Caplan ( Harris again), who may be
condemning her to life in an iron lung, and seeks to enlist the
handsome, new, young and divorced Dr. Henry (Richard Joseph Paul)
in putting her out of her misery.
</P>
<P>
   As a character, Gretty may not be easy to take, but as created
by Belluso and portrayed by Ms. Gallagher, she is fascinating,
thought-provoking company.
</P>

 &QL; 
BIGBABY (Phoenix) - Lyndon Voss is just 14 months old and weighs 47
pounds, more than twice the average size for a baby her age. The
``National Enquirer'' dubbed her ``America's Largest Baby.'' From
the time Lyndon was born, she has gained about a pound a week,

Y1K (Phoenix) - There is so much hoopla over the coming change in
millennium, that it will probably come as a surprise to learn there
was hardly any thought given to the last change. In A.D. 999, there
was no panic over Y1K. Almost no one got worked up over the end of

EDIT-REAGAN (Phoenix) - Ronald Reagan ranks as one of this nation's
great presidents. And now Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., wants to put a
60-foot carving of Reagan on Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of

memorializing Reagan on Mount Rushmore, we suggest conservative
Republicans borrow a few pages from the Gipper's playbook and start

VICTORIA'S SECRET SHOW IS WEB BROADCAST HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It may not have been much of a milestone in
Western civilization, but as landmarks go in the Internet's
development as a broadcast medium, this week's Webcast of the
Victoria's Secret's lingerie fashion show was right up there.
</P>
<P>
   An eye-popping 1.5 million visitors logged on
to &UR;  &LR; www.broadcast.com and www.victoriassecret.com to watch the
hourlong show, which included 17 minutes of top models parading
around in the latest next-to-nothings.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers don't even include the people who were turned away
because of the crush of viewers already logged on to the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's true the streaming video could only be seen in a tiny
window on the screen. And yes, it was choppy, snowy, low-quality
video, certainly compared to that splashy Super Bowl ad by
Victoria's Secret that promoted the Webcast last Sunday. And yes,
the ``server'' computers handling all the requests to watch the
show were nearly overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems led some critics, such as Zona Research, a
Redwood City consulting group, to focus on initial reports about
what didn't happen: ``Before the Internet can become a robust
multimedia vehicle and a trusted medium for business, it has to
resolve bandwidth issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get on and I couldn't do it,'' said Zona research
associate Tom Huskerson. ``It was a problem with bandwidth and with
what the servers could handle. These types of problems, when it
comes to the Internet, will have to be dealt with. The Net is
growing exponentially, and companies are struggling to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   But those legitimate complaints almost miss the point.
</P>
<P>
   Like the John Glenn shuttle launch and President Clinton's video
deposition, people tuned in, in huge numbers, despite the cruddy
reception, to see something through the Web. That size audience
starts to approach the numbers for many cable television
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Lilliputian viewer numbers that have typically
accompanied Web-based video and audio broadcasts, the turnout
implies that sometime in the future, when the technology smooths
out the many current shortcomings, the Internet can be a viable
competitor to _ and even a replacement for _ both broadcasters and
cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that's what Broadcast.com's brash president Mark Cuban
has been saying for some time.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, he predicted his site will become the
place for high-definition digital television in the future, once
his company and Intel finish work on an HDTV tuner card for
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people's first exposure to HDTV won't be some special
television that costs thousands of dollars, it'll be a card in
their computer that costs a few hundred dollars,'' Cuban said.
``We're the future of TV. We will be the digital set-top box. The
days of network dominance are already gone.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Cuban acknowledged online video's current painful
limits, he also said that will change fast enough, judging from the
quick improvements in sound quality on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, people used to condemn the quality of audio
on the Net,'' Cuban said. ``Now no one complains about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Huskerson said, there is one other thing that
broadcasters and cable companies can't do: let you choose what you
want to watch, when you want to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the ability, if you miss a program, to go and watch
it,'' Huskerson said. ``You'll be able to download and watch it in
streaming mode.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DRIVING MUSIC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gran Turismo was one of the best games to hit the PlayStation
last year, a crackerjack driving simulation that has since become
the standard for the genre, thanks to its great graphics, terrific
game play, exquisite detail and a really hot soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Well, somebody noticed. Now EMI Records has released ``The Sound
of Gran Turismo,'' the game's soundtrack with complete versions of
songs by 18 performers, including Garbage, David Bowie, Blur and
Supergrass.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing a soundtrack seems a little odd, especially because
you (ITAL) could (UNITAL) just play the game disk in your CD player
and get at least snippets of all the songs. But the idea fits with
the video-game industry's continuing efforts to be taken at least
as seriously as the movie business (there's nothing like shooting
low in your ambitions).
</P>
<P>
   The video game business (ITAL) did (UNITAL) gross roughly as
much last year as the movie biz's domestic box office; its use of
animation is increasingly as sophisticated as in many films,
despite technology limitations; and a lot of talent and franchises
are now routinely jumping back and forth between the two mediums.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one of the brothers who created Myst and Riven
went off to create films and released a soundtrack of music from
the best-selling games. And there'll soon be an animated film based
on the hugely popular Final Fantasy role-playing games, as well as
just-released half-hour animated episodes based on the Dark Stalker
fighting genre.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, movies have been the basis for an endless array
of video games, though seldom very memorably (the N64's James Bond
action game GoldenEye being a notable exception). So count this as
part of the convergence we keep hearing about.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the ``Grand Turismo'' album itself is pretty cool,
if you like your music generally loud and fast. Melodies even work
their way into the driving beats behind the rock, alternative and
dance mix. Appropriately, this is indeed driving music for people
breaking the speed limit. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The cancer that afflicts Jordan's King Hussein _
non-Hodgkins lymphoma _ attacks the body's lymphatic system, which
defends against disease and infection.
</P>
<P>
   The lymphatic system, a network of vessels throughout the body,
carries lymphocytes, a white blood cell that attacks invading
micro-organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In a healthy person, lymphatic cells replace themselves in an
orderly fashion. But when non-Hodgkins lymphoma strikes, it causes
those cells to multiply out of control. Eventually, the tumor cells
can spread to other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which will afflict 56,800 Americans this
year while killing 25,700, is the fifth most diagnosed cancer in
men and the sixth in women.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include a swelling in the lymph nodes of the neck,
underarm or groin, fevers, sweats and weight loss. The cancer is
definitively diagnosed through a biopsy of an enlarged lymph node.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation and chemotherapy are used to either cure a patient or
kick the cancer into remission for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer recurs, doctors will administer even larger doses
of combined radiation and chemotherapy. But to do so requires that
a patient first bank his or her bone marrow, which normally would
be killed by the high-dose treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bone marrow auto-transplant allows physicians to give doses
that might not otherwise be given,'' Dr. David Golde,
physician-in-chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York and an oncologist who specializes in tumors of blood-forming
organs, explained Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the treatment, doctors return the marrow to the patient.
In the best-case scenario, the cancer has been eradicated and the
bone marrow, which forms the basis for the body's blood supply,
will reconstitute healthy blood components including lymphocytes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the patient's bone marrow also has been attacked by the
cancer, physicians may not remove the patient's bone marrow for
banking and instead may look for a suitable bone marrow donor,
usually a family member, to make a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of this procedure is that the donor's bone marrow
could attack the patient. In effect, the host could be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cells could emerge that recognize the host as a foreign
invader,'' said Golde. ``They then attack the organs.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hodgkins lymphoma is an umbrella term for about a dozen
different malignancies that attack the body's lymphatic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a series of diseases,'' said Golde. ``What they have
in common is the malignancies of the lymphocytes. But they are
quite distinct syndromes with distinct prognoses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some won't become life threatening for several years after
diagnosis, while others are highly malignant.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgkins disease, named after a British physician, is a rarer
type of lymphoma that will strike about 7,200 Americans this year,
mainly young people ages 15-34 and people over 55, and kill 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of lymphoma cases are non-Hodgkins, which is
more fatal than Hodgkins. According to the American Cancer Society,
the 10-year survival rate is 77 percent for Hodgkins disease and
only 44 percent for non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Survival drops to 66
percent and 36 percent, respectively, after 15 years.

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES: WHY THE TORTOISE ISN'T BEATING THE HARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Mark Hulbert is editor of Hulbert Financial Digest, a
newsletter based in Alexandria, Va. His column on investment
strategies appears every other week. E-mail:
strategy(AT)nytimes.com.)
</P>
<P>
   These are the times that try value investors' souls. The
best-performing stocks over the last five years have been the sort
that value advisers say we should avoid _ companies with sky-high
price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, like America Online and
Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Value investors try to find solace in numerous academic
historical studies that have concluded that over the very long run,
value outperforms growth. But the patience of these investors is
wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the average growth stock in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index trounced the average value stock in the index, 42.2
percent to 14.7 percent, its widest margin ever, according to Barra
Inc., a research firm in Berkeley, Calif. The firm breaks the index
into the S&AMP;P/Barra Growth Index and S&AMP;P/Barra Value Index, based on
its component stocks' price-to-book ratios.
</P>
<P>
   The wait may go on for value investors. Some recent evidence
suggests that value's historical advantage is not as pervasive as
past studies seemed to show. Among a big portion of stocks, it may
be nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best illustration comes from the long-term
performance of the group of growth stocks known in the early 1970s
as the Nifty 50, an informal collection of large-capitalization,
fast-growing stocks that brokerage firms _ some with different
Nifty 50 lists _ were pushing as sure bets. In the early '70s,
investors didn't think twice about paying 70, 80 or even 100 times
earnings for Nifty 50 stocks like Merck and Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were among the biggest casualties of the 1973-74
bear market, the Nifty 50 stocks have long served as Exhibit A in
value investors' argument about the supposed folly of growth-stock
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the long-run performance of these stocks has been
surprisingly good, according to a study of Morgan Stanley's Nifty
50 by Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania. Siegel found that if an investor
had bought a basket of these stocks at the bull-market high in
December 1972, just before the 1973-74 bear market, and held them
through August 1998, his long-run performance would be just about
as good as that of the S&AMP;P itself _ about 13 percent, annualized.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the results, Siegel concluded that ``as a group, the
Nifty 50 were worth the price paid by investors at the bull market
peak of the early 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   Results like Siegel's have led researchers to dig below the
surface of the historical studies that find value stocks
outperforming growth stocks. One who did so was Tim Loughran, a
professor at the University of Iowa, who discovered a major
qualification: Value significantly outperforms growth only among
the smallest stocks. Among the 20 percent of companies with the
largest market caps, a category well represented by the S&AMP;P 500,
there is no significant difference in the performance of value and
growth stocks, he concluded in a study published in the Journal of
Financial and Quantitative Analysis. That quintile accounts for
three-quarters of the market value of U.S. equities.
</P>
<P>
   These findings help explain why the S&AMP;P/Barra Value index has
failed to outperform the S&AMP;P/Barra Growth Index over the long run.
In the 20 years through 1998, the two indexes' annualized returns
are similar _ with the Growth Index slightly ahead, 17.8 percent to
17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What size must companies be in order for a value-oriented
approach to outperform a growth-oriented one? According to
Loughran, value strategies work best among the bottom 20 percent of
stocks, as ranked by market capitalization. (To be among this group
today, a company's market cap must be no larger than about $200
million.) A value approach in this group returned 11 percentage
points more per year, on average, than a growth-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
   Value approaches also work with somewhat larger stocks, though
the outperformance falls by about half. But don't expect value
approaches to outperform growth significantly among the biggest 20
percent of companies: Loughran said the tiny 1.8 percent difference
he tracked was likely due to statistical aberrations.

ZEROING IN ON JAN. 1 HAS ZERO SIGNIFICANCE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - It wasn't only in the Middle Ages that people were
unclear about the advent of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   There is an argument this time over whether the new millennium
begins in 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I have news for both sides: The millennium came and went
three years ago, and nobody noticed.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a millennium has to be the millennium of (begin ital)
something, (end ital) and both 2000 and 2001 will be the millennium
of nothing. If either can be called a millennium, then any year can
be, for any year is 1,000 years after the year that came 100
centuries ago. This is a tautology.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all a long way to say that the celebration that is
coming up at the beginning of next year _ or for some people, the
year after _ is a completely arbitrary and meaningless event.
</P>
<P>
   Our calendar system implies that we live 1,999 years after the
birth of Christ, but if we believe the Bible _ and most people who
care about the existence of Jesus do _ he must have been born in 4
B.C. or before. King Herod died in that year, and the Bible says
Herod was king when Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the millennium of Jesus' birth was at least three years
ago. What we'll be celebrating next Jan. 1 will be the millennium
of no significant event.
</P>
<P>
   It will be nothing but a lineup of zeros on the speedometer.
</P>
<P>
   If we are waiting for some significant event that will happen
after a thousand-year era, it already must have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Or we can wait another 30 years and see if the millennium
signifies the time since the death of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seems to faze the millenarians, who can't wait for
their crystals to start talking to them on New Year's Day. It ain't
gonna happen. &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia scientists are hunting for plants that may hold the key
to healing human ailments.
 &HT;    EDs.: Embargoed for Sunday Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For centuries, people in India have cleaned their
teeth with the twigs of the neem tree, a relative of mahogany. They
have smeared neem-leaf juice on skin disorders, drunk neem tea as a
tonic and placed neem leaves in their beds, cupboards and closets
to drive away bugs.
</P>
<P>
   To these people, neem has miraculous powers.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories can be repeated for thousands of other plants
around the world used by native people to treat infections, pains,
fevers and other maladies. Scientists have begun paying serious
attention to this medicinal folklore, because from the plants may
come the next miracle drugs against cancer, heart disease,
parasitic infections and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several University of Georgia researchers will become the
latest cadre of specialists scouring the tropics for therapeutic
plant species. Under a new $2.5 million, five-year federal grant,
the UGA scientists will focus on the homeland of the Highland Maya
people in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. Five research
teams from other institutions are conducting searches in eight
other countries in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The new research greatly expands previous efforts to find
medicinal plants. Although pharmaceutical firms have trekked for
decades through the tropics for plants with therapeutic value, the
forays picked up steam in the 1980s when the National Cancer
Institute contracted with the Missouri Botanical Garden in St.
Louis, the University of Illinois in Chicago and the New York
Botanical Garden to gather thousands of plant specimens in the rain
forests of South America, Asia and Africa. Extracts from the
leaves, stems, flowers, bark and other parts of the plants were
screened for anti-cancer properties.
</P>
<P>
   Out of about 14,000 plant specimens collected so far, extracts
from about 2 percent have been found to have anti-cancer potential,
and may be candidates for more rigorous testing and possible drug
development.
</P>
<P>
   But under a new federal program that began in 1992, the
international search for therapeutic plants _ a process called
``bioprospecting'' _ has been greatly widened to look for
treatments for other ills.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the program is designed so that the
development of powerful new drugs from natural products can provide
an economic return for native people in Third World countries.
That, in turn, will encourage the sustainable use of native plants
and other natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential rewards (from bioprospecting) should provide
benefits to the source country and local communities that are the
stewards of these resources,'' says Joshua Rosenthal of the
National Institutes of Health's Fogarty International Center.
Moreover, he notes, the sharing is a requirement under the 1992
United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which has been
ratified by more than 170 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The program means that much of the rain forest land _ now being
lost at a rate of 50 million acres a year _ may not be cut for wood
products and agriculture; rare plants and animals won't lose their
habitats; and residents won't resort to environment-damaging
activities to escape crushing poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia team ``will discover, isolate and evaluate plants
that might have medicinal value and then use them to help develop
the local economy of the Highland Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya through
sustainable production,'' says Brent Berlin, an anthropologist who
directs UGA's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The plant search is sponsored by a consortium of agencies that
includes the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Agency for
International Development and the National Institutes of Health and
its Fogarty International Center. The six research teams, including
UGA's, are known as International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups.
The UGA group includes eight senior researchers and several
graduate students in biochemistry, anthropology and molecular
biology.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, the program was developed out of concern that
over the decades, some drug companies committed what Berlin says
was the equivalent of plunder by taking plants from a country,
developing them into medicines with high commercial value, and
leaving almost nothing behind for the host country that supplied
the natural product. Similarly, the National Science Foundation
says that one pitfall of bioprospecting is the danger of falling
into a new form of colonialism _ extracting and exporting raw
materials from developing countries without increasing the capacity
of the countries to develop and export their own products.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Butler, an intellectual property rights lawyer at UGA,
has been working closely with Berlin, his colleagues and Mexican
officials to develop agreements that will provide adequate legal
protection for Maya participants in the project.
</P>
<P>
   A systematic search for plants that may hold cures for diseases
is a daunting task. There are more than 220,000 flowering plant
species in the world, but only about 2 percent to 5 percent have
been tested for possible effectiveness against diseases, even
though indigenous peoples have used the plants for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the scientists in their search is the knowledge that
nearly 80 percent of the 150 most commonly prescribed drugs are
derived from plants and other organisms. The heart drug digitalis,
for instance, was derived from foxglove. Aspirin came from the
white willow tree and penicillin from a fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, scientists at Eli Lilly and Co., while
searching for an anti-diabetes drug in plants, found instead two
powerful anti-cancer drugs, vincristine and vinblastine, in the
rosy periwinkle.
</P>
<P>
   The tropics are the focus of most of the plant surveys because
climate, varied terrain and rainfall make tropical rain forests a
vast botanical garden of biological diversity. However, the rapid
loss of these places to logging, agriculture and other purposes has
prompted a new urgency in the search for therapeutic plants.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and his wife, anthropologist Elois Ann Berlin, who is a
co-leader in the plant inventory portion of the project, have been
collecting information for the past 11 years on how the Highland
Maya use various native plants to treat a wide range of illnesses.
The Maya's homeland is the world's third richest in numbers of
vascular plant species because of the diverse habitats and terrain
found in the region, from mountains to deep valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlins and other members of the UGA group, working with
native people and local scientists, will focus initially on nearly
900 commonly known species in the Highland Maya's homeland. Many of
these species have been used for centuries by Maya people in
medicinal preparations to treat ailments ranging from infections to
stomach maladies. But the chemical properties of these medicines
remain largely unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to determine what the key ingredients are and what
parts of the plants are medically necessary,'' Elois Ann Berlin
explains. ``We now have a good idea of the most important species
that are used in traditional curing by the Highland Maya; we just
don't yet know how they work.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, thousands of other plants will be scrutinized. The
work could start as early as March if Mexican collecting permits
and agreements on intellectual property rights can be finalized by
then. The Georgia researchers will collaborate with scientists from
Mexico's El Colegio de la Frontera Sur.
</P>
<P>
   Specimens of the same species may be collected from several
spots because the soil, water, terrain or other factors at certain
locations may influence the chemical makeup of plants. Also, the
time of the collection will be carefully noted because the
biochemistry of plants may differ between night and day.
</P>
<P>
   Extracts from the plants will be screened at UGA and other
institutions for indications of an effect against more than a dozen
maladies. Extracts that show promise will undergo additional
testing, and more specimens of those plants may be collected.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia researchers also will work closely with the private
company Xenova Discovery Ltd. of Berkshire, England, which will
screen the extracts for novel drugs that could be patented.
</P>
<P>
   If an extract shows promise against certain diseases but cannot
be patented, the plant's pharmacological properties and potential
use in the growing international herb market will be documented.
``This could provide a major economic growth model for Chiapas and
other areas,'' Elois Ann Berlin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We . . . want to actively promote beneficial plant species in
home gardens and community medicinal plants projects, since this
knowledge is seriously threatened due to rapid cultural change,''
she adds.

 &HT;    On the edge, dancer's ever ready to leap
 &HT;    EDs.: Embargoed for Sunday Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For better or worse, Mark Morris likes to get naked.
And dance. And talk.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily in that order. But never mind. As perhaps the
world's most celebrated choreographer, he makes for pretty good
copy. When he's not collaborating with the world's most famous
dancer (Mikhail Baryshnikov) or its most famous classical musician
(cellist Yo-Yo Ma), he's probably going out to dinner with his best
friend, the world's most famous unemployed fashion
designer-turned-professional bon vivant (Isaac Mizrahi).
</P>
<P>
   It's a dreary day, and Morris has just finished rehearsal at his
rented City Center space in Midtown Manhattan. Baryshnikov, looking
fabulous at 51, bounces out of the room. Morris, after stripping
down naked in front of a total stranger to don his street uniform
of stretchy pants, burgundy polo shirt and big, expensive leather
jacket, retires to a neighborhood bar, Christer's on West 55th
Street, for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Cherubic as always, but having recently shorn his signature
long, curly tresses, the choreographer talks, among other things,
about his company's Friday and Saturday concerts at Atlanta's
Rialto Center for the Performing Arts, his recent trip to India and
the infamous black-and-white photograph shot by Annie Leibovitz
during the White Oak Dance Project tour of 1990-91. Turns out it
was taken in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That picture of me naked on the divan was shot on Cumberland
Island,'' Morris says, rapturously, pronouncing the word ``divan''
in his best faux-French accent (``dee-VAHN!'') while simultaneously
puffing on a Gauloises and sipping a Stolichnaya and tonic with
lemon through a straw. ``The sofa was outside on Cumberland Island!
Isn't that wild? It was so hot, too! Oh, my god!''
</P>
<P>
   Unprintable in a family newspaper, that picture is a sendup of
the history of nude portraiture from Titian to Ingres to Manet.
Come to think of it, it kind of encapsulates the work of Morris.
Silly at times, but steadfastly serious about his craft, the
42-year-old Morris has restructured the order of modern dance as we
know it, creating a highly musical, highly accessible and, though
he would deny it, highly derivative body of work that teeters
between the playful and the profound, the sacred and the scabrous,
the humorous and the horrific. As Joan Acocella puts it in her
unauthorized biography, ``Mark Morris'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
1993): ``The history of dance is his shopping mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into a blue-collar Seattle family, classmate of cartoonist
Lynda Barry and saxophonist Kenny G, he decided that he wanted to
be a flamenco dancer at 8, joined the communal Koleda Balkan Dance
Ensemble at 13 and left for New York at age 19, never to finish
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really started when he was about 18 months old,'' says his
mother, Maxine Morris, 81. ``He hadn't started to walk yet, but he
could dance. He'd hear some music, and he'd stop wherever he was
and hang on to something and dance with a big smile on his face.
Right away, we knew he was a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept that up and got little groups together while he was
still in grade school,'' she continues from her home in Seattle.
``He taught them dances that he made up. They would perform for
nursing homes and places like that just for fun, and everybody
loved them. And if they did it for a Jewish home, they would do
some Jewish dances that he had learned _ or made up.''
</P>
<P>
   After dancing with Lar Lubovitch and Eliot Feld, and being
rejected by Paul Taylor, Morris started his own company in 1980. He
was 24, and the success was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, in an unprecedented move, his company was invited by
the Belgian government to become the resident company at the
national opera house. With his caustic tongue and flamboyant style
set loose in the conservative capital of Belgium, he became the bad
boy of modern dance and the enfant terrible of the European press.
After three tumultuous years and several masterpieces (``L'Allegro,
Il Peneroso ed il Moderato,'' ``Dido and Aeneas,'' ``The Hard
Nut''), his contract was not renewed. His company returned to New
York, more knowledgeable of the ways of the world but never again
to have that sort of financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   After years as a vagabond troupe, the Mark Morris Dance Group,
which has an annual budget of $3.2 million, recently purchased a
building near its home theater, the Brooklyn Academy of Music. That
project, with a $6 million price tag, is scheduled to open next
spring or summer.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Morris has created dances for the San Francisco
Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre and the Paris Opera Ballet. He
won a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant at 35 and was the
subject of Acocella's full-length biography at 37.
</P>
<P>
   After this month's tour of Florida and Georgia, Morris will
unveil ``The Argument,'' set to Schumann's ``Five Pieces in Folk
Style,'' in Boston on Feb. 25-28. Baryshnikov and Ma will star.
Besides appearing regularly at the Brooklyn Academy of Music,
Morris has a continuing relationship with the University of
California at Berkeley, where he often stages world premieres,
including last year's ``Platee,'' hailed as a revelatory operatic
achievement. On March 18-21, ``Dixit Dominus,'' a large-scale piece
set to the music of Handel, will get its premiere at Berkeley. A
new commission for the San Francisco Ballet will be seen in April.
And from May 6-8, ``L'Allegro'' will be staged at the Kennedy
Center in Washington. That's his mother's favorite piece, and she
plans on being there.

 &HT;    Tune in to the times: Networks need to get with the program by
rethinking the antiquated system of sweeps, industry insiders say
 &HT;    EDs.: Embargoed for Sunday Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barreling down Track No. 1, here comes ``Stephen King's Storm of
the Century,'' a wickedly addictive new six-hour miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Dead ahead, Fox Mulder is about to get some of the answers he's
been seeking for five years on a special episode of ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are scheduled to collide at 9 p.m. one week from
tonight, and the millions of viewers who want to see them both are
just bodies in the way, victims of sweeps scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a train wreck,'' says David Hill, chairman and CEO of Fox
Broadcasting. ``From a network viewpoint, sweeps are the worst
thing possible. They're ridiculous. They're an anachronism.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweeps _ when Nielsen Media Research measures the
demographics of local TV affiliates, so the stations can set their
ad rates _ are part of an antiquated system that is responsible for
a lot of what's wrong with network television today. It's a system
that was developed in the '60s and '70s, when there were no cable
channels, no VCRs, no remote controls. The networks held the
viewer, and even the advertisers, who support the whole system,
captive.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the former jailers are the prisoner, as the TV networks
are restrained by an interlocking set of arrangements that no
longer works. Virtually everyone agrees the model needs to be
changed, but no one can figure out how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If you think network television could be better _ and who
doesn't? _ it's largely because of this train wreck of a system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get serious and change our game, we're gonna be
left in the dust,'' warns Steven Bochco, executive producer of
``NYPD Blue.'' ``We ought to be reinventing the medium, changing
the rules of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, executive producer of ``The X-Files,'' echoes
Bochco: ``The next successful person will be the person who
reinvents network television in terms of how business is done.''
</P>
<P>
   That business is different for the networks and cable. While the
networks depend completely on ad dollars, cable gets its revenues
from both ad dollars and from payments from cable operators, such
as Atlanta's MediaOne. Also, cable never bought into the rigid
system of creating and launching shows that the networks did.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen sweeps _ held in February, May, July and November _ are
a small but annoying piece of the overall puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   In order to please their local affiliates, the networks will air
big specials and all new episodes of series for the next four
weeks. George Clooney leaves ``ER''! Horrific home videos on Fox!
Guest stars and plot twists and stunts all around!
</P>
<P>
   Come March, the cupboards will be bare, and re-runs will abound,
because most series only have the money and manpower to make 22
episodes a season. This frustrates viewers, who will then click
over and see what's on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurting us all,'' says Leslie Moonves, president of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Is it ever. ABC, CBS and NBC have been steadily losing viewers
to cable for years, but in recent months the erosion of network
watching has accelerated. Of the 56 network programs that returned
in the fall, 41 are getting lower ratings than they did last
season. Of the six networks (counting Fox, the WB and UPN), all are
down in their ratings this season except the WB. Basic cable
viewing surged 14 percent in the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that there has been higher-than-usual
``executive churn'' at the top network levels. Two former cable
executives _ Scott Sassa and Doug Herzog _ have been brought in
recently to run NBC and Fox's entertainment divisions,
respectively, in an attempt to turn around what Variety magazine
might call the ``web woes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been erosion to the networks,'' acknowledges NBC's
Sassa, ``but networks are the only beach-front, Class A real estate
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but they're beach-front property in which waves are
tearing away at the foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we've not yet really faced the music,'' says
Sandy Grushow, president of 20th Century Fox Television. ``We all
sort of hear it playing vaguely in the background. But it's been
reasonably easy to deny.''
</P>
<P>
   While viewers gorge themselves on miniseries and new episodes
this month (and try not to think about the barrenness to come), an
even more damaging game is being played in Los Angeles: pilot
season. Right now, the networks are frantically signing contracts
with actors and writers, preparing to shoot dozens of pilot
episodes that may become series in September _ and they're all
fighting over the few who can really make a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bunch of lemmings trying to crawl over each other
for the same talent at the exact same time,'' says Joel Shukovsky,
who produced ``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On some level the system is rigged _ literally rigged _
against creating a hit television series,'' says Fox boss Grushow.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are all in pilot season gridlock now because they
remain tied, against their better judgment, to the idea of a big
fall season premiere, when 40 or so new shows roll out in a
two-three week period, competing against each other, plus all the
returning favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fall '98 premieres, only three _ the WB's ``Felicity,''
ABC's ``Sports Night'' and Fox's ``That '70s Show'' _ have
generated sustained viewer buzz, and none of those is truly a hit
in terms of ratings. Conversely, the only fall '98 debut to crack
the Nielsen Top 10, NBC's ``Jesse,'' is there only because it's on
Thursday night; it has ratings, but no true viewer attachment.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the series that stand out are the ones that debut
in the midseason, which runs more or less from January to April.
``Providence'' and ``The PJs,'' both of which debuted last month,
show signs of becoming hits, following the trail established by
past midseason shows such as ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' ``The Practice'' and ``King of the Hill.'' (It's
a trail that goes all the way back through ``The Simpsons'' to
``Dallas.'')
</P>
<P>
   These shows became hits, not just because they were different or
good (some are both), but because they could be heavily promoted
and not get lost in the fall clutter.

<P>
   ATLANTA: the fall clutter.
</P>
<P>
   The obsolete idea of a big fall season (something cable doesn't
have) is, in turn, linked to what's called ``upfront ad sales.''
After the networks unveil their fall schedules in May, advertisers
commit to spending billions of dollars. There's no rule that says
there has to be an upfront (advertisers would spend as much money,
just spread around a bit differently), but it's always been done
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow calls the network sales departments prisoners of the
upfront.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, counters Jack Myers, publisher of The Myers Report, an
industry newsletter that tracks TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising community is not requiring the networks to
premiere all their shows in the fall. The rules are being
self-imposed. The advertising community would be responsive to a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the outdated pilot-upfront-fall cycle extends
to the summer as well. The late Brandon Tartikoff, former head of
NBC, warned more than 10 years ago that the networks could not
continue to hang out ``Gone Fishin' '' signs during the summer,
airing only re-runs and shows that weren't good enough for the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a few exceptions _ ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' last
summer, ``Northern Exposure,'' which debuted in the summer of 1990
_ the networks continue to play dead during the summer. This past
summer, basic cable saw its biggest ratings jump in history at the
networks' expense. For the first time ever, the ratings of basic
cable channels, taken as a whole, surpassed the ratings of ABC,
CBS, NBC and Fox. It was only a symbolic victory, but one widely
noted within the TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   As it becomes harder and harder to get a hit series, the
networks are abandoning entertainment and filling their schedules
with more newsmagazines. There are about 13 hours of newsmags on
the Big Four right now, and although that number varies from week
to week, it is the most prime-time news shows ever.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dateline NBCs'' and ``20/20s'' are cheaper to make than
entertainment series and rarely just flame out completely the way
some series do. But many producers believe that most newsmagazines
are just quick fixes and tend to look alike, that it's the
entertainment series that build viewer loyalty and give the
networks what little remaining identity they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you stop the downward spiral that the networks seem to
be on?'' says Fox's Grushow. ``I don't think another episode of
`Dateline' is going to do that. I do think another `ER' has the
possibility of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks are also forced by overall falling ratings to move
shows more frequently. Some moves are to get more sampling; some
are just born of desperation. Some moves are ``strategic,'' such as
Fox shuttling ``King of the Hill'' from Sunday to Tuesday, where it
has lost almost 50 percent of its audience. Some strategy. Or NBC
moving ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' to Sundays last season, where
co-star Jane Curtin says, ``Scud missiles couldn't find us.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when a switch is successful (``The X-Files'' from
Friday to Sunday, for example), the networks may win the time slot
but lose the war, as viewer frustration increases.
</P>
<P>
   In a focus group convened recently by ABC Research, senior vice
president Alan Wurtzel heard something that should chill every
network. ``They can tell you the ABC schedule for, say Tuesday
night from 15 years ago, but they can't tell you the ABC schedule
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we talk about network erosion is that the
programming on network television just isn't as special and
exceptional as it used to be,'' says Tom Werner, executive producer
of ``3rd Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   But that really isn't the case. Take Wurtzel's comparison. The
ABC Tuesday schedule his focus group remembered included ``Happy
Days,'' ``Laverne and Shirley,'' ``Three's Company'' and ``Hart to
Hart.'' The current counterpart on ABC Tuesdays includes ``Sports
Night,'' ``Home Improvement,'' ``Spin City'' and ``NYPD Blue.''
It's hard to argue that today's lineup is less exceptional than the
older one; in fact, the opposite is obviously true, even though
ratings are much lower for the current shows.
</P>
<P>
   The principal difference is there was so much less competition
in the early '80s, so one night on one network was easier to keep
track of. But while competition has expanded tremendously (along
with that great equalizer between cable and the nets, the remote
control), the networks are unable to extricate themselves from the
straitjacket of the system they created.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current system is not going to last much longer,''
predicts Allen Ginsberg, executive vice president of media for the
ad agency BBDO South.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows what the new system, which could be coming
in a few years, will look like. But Jamie Kellner, CEO of the WB
network, thinks it will look like radio does today: ``very
fragmented, very small audiences.'' BBDO's Ginsberg thinks it might
be even more fragmented than radio, looking more like a newsstand,
with scads of magazines aimed at tiny niche audiences: not just dog
owners, but owners of specific breeds of dogs.
</P>
<P>
   What's unknown is how this new model will allow the networks to
make enough big advertising dollars to launch the next broad-based
hit _ the next ``ER'' or ``NYPD Blue'' or ``X-Files,'' shows that
cost millions to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you create a hit?'' asks Ken Solomon, president of USA
Studios Television (the folks who made ``Columbo'' and ``The
Rockford Files,'' among many classics).
</P>
<P>
   ``How will anyone know it's there?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the solution could be worse than the problem.

 &HT;    Ministers _ like their flocks _ are not immune to wrongdoing
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Power, money and women.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unholy trinity that has wrecked the lives of many
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any pastor will struggle with all three,'' the Rev. Timothy
McDonald, president of Atlanta's Concerned Black Clergy, said. ``If
he says he's not, he's lying.''
</P>
<P>
   This unholy trinity is making headlines again. The trial of the
Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention
U.S.A. Inc., recently began in Clearwater, Fla. Lyons is charged
with stealing millions to finance a lavish lifestyle that included
a $700,000 waterfront home he purchased with a female colleague,
with whom he denies having had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of a prominent minister being involved in scandal
is nothing new. The flameouts of big-time evangelists such as Jim
Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart have been well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   Bakker was convicted of defrauding contributors of PTL, his
Charlotte, N.C.-based ministry, of more than $150 million. Swaggart
was caught visiting a prostitute and later asked for forgiveness on
his nationally syndicated program, crying out that ``I have
sinned.''
</P>
<P>
   When the outrageous details of such scandals make news, people
often dismiss them by saying that the fallen pastor was simply a
con man.
</P>
<P>
   But scholars and veteran preachers say the pulpit is full of
subtle temptations that can corrode the character of even the most
vigilant pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys start out in the ministry with a fear and
trembling that keeps them close to God,'' said the Rev. Gary
Miller, pastor of Rockdale Baptist Church in Conyers (Ga.). ``But
the longer you serve, the better you get at the mechanics, and the
danger becomes getting good at what you do. Then you're not quite
as open to input and you're not seeking God's direction.'' The
stage is then set, he thinks, for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your public prayers outweigh your private prayers, you're
on real thin ice,'' Miller said. ``It's just become a facade.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind such a facade are the typical weaknesses of any human
being. But they can be deadly when combined with the power of the
pulpit, said Robert Franklin, president of the Interdenominational
Theological Center, a collection of predominantly black religious
graduate schools in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are often personal flaws in an individual's psyche that
become magnified once they're in the pedestal of the pulpit,''
Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those flaws is greed.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of financial accountability in many churches would be
shocking in the business world. But it is not unusual for a
minister to have full control of a church's finances with little or
no oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement can lead to a church becoming a victim of
the ``informal compensation package,'' a euphemism for stealing
coined by the Rev. Calvin Pressley, an ITC professor who
specializes in church finances.
</P>
<P>
   Pressley said many pastors don't plan to rip off their churches.
The process usually starts small, with a leader who ``dips'' into
the church offering for lunch money. The ``dipping'' can easily
become a cancer that spreads throughout the church's leadership
because no one is keeping track of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a climate where you have accountability, only the thieves
will steal,'' Pressley said. ``In a climate where there is no
accountability, everybody will steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Power, not just money, can corrupt a pastor as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the black church, the minister is next to God,'' McDonald
said. ``He is given carte blanche. Often the minister says, `The
Lord told me,' and that kind of seals it if you disagree with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Such power comes with certain perks, McDonald said. The pastor
is often expected to display the trappings of success _ fine
clothes, fancy cars, a good home _ even though most preachers make
ordinary money. Some congregations even buy luxury cars for their
pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Even a preacher who is not interested in material trappings may
feel the pressure to acquire them. For years, McDonald drove a 1983
Toyota Corolla. When he recently bought a 2-year-old Lincoln
Continental, he sparked jubilation in his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pastor reflects the membership,'' McDonald said. ``The
members will say, `We want our preachers to look good. We want them
to live in nice homes.' But a lot of preachers take that to
extremes. They don't want to live in a comfortable home. They want
to live in a mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Power, however, isolates. Ministers are taught to maintain a
distance from their congregation for fear that familiarity may
breed contempt. McDonald knows of one preacher who won't even let
members of his church touch him because he thinks it interferes
with his ``anointing.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald thinks such aloofness destroys a pastor's ability to be
close to others. ``Many pastors are some of the most lonely people
in the world,'' he said. ``A lot of them are in therapy and a lot
of them are in AA.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastors who do struggle rarely find help from the church, said
the Rev. Freddie Gage, head of Wounded Heroes, a national group
based in Euless, Texas, that combines psychological and spiritual
counseling to help clergy in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When Gage was hospitalized with clinical depression, he said,
many ministers shunned him because they thought his emotional
problems resulted from lack of faith. Most preachers don't feel
free to be human among their colleagues, Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we shoot our wounded, we leave them in the field
to bleed,'' Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that there are a growing number of ministers who are
struggling, and cites a recent poll conducted by Focus on the
Family, a Colorado Springs, Colo.-based ministry, to support his
concerns:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Seventy percent of clergy say they have a lower self-image now
than when they started out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Seventy percent do not have someone they consider a close
friend.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eighty-one percent say they have insufficient time with their
wives.
</P>
<P>
   In their loneliness, some pastors turn to extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys come home exhausted and they don't have anything left to
invest in their family,'' said Miller. ``They give their best to
their work and give the leftovers of their emotions to their wife
and kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a pastor falls into wrongdoing, it's difficult to stop.
That's because pastors _ like ourselves _ find ways to justify
corruption, said Cornelius Plantinga, an ordained minister who
examines corruption in ``Not the Way It's Supposed to Be'' (William
B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., $16, 216 pages).
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on in corruption we feel guilty, but when we get deep in
corruption we rationalize it,'' he said. ``We say things to
ourselves like, `I worked like a dog all week and I deserve some
fun tonight. . . . I'm only human, I'm not perfect. . . . I was
provoked.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A momentary transgression can become a habit. The habit becomes
a shadow lifestyle. Plantinga compares this process to an ocean
liner that is designed to keep sailing, even after some of its
compartments are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person can seal off a part of his life that is very corrupt
and maybe keep it from wrecking everything,'' Plantinga said.
``There are people who are successful for an amazingly long time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Plantinga said eventually maintaining a secret life all
becomes too much. ``It's like compartments in a ship,'' he said.
``You get enough of them flooding, the ship sinks.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid stumbling, Plantinga said, ministers need a ``healthy
self-suspicion.'' They must constantly question their behavior and
seek people who will be brutally honest with them.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Erwin, a minister and author of ``The Jesus Style''
(Yahshua Publishing, $10, 208 pages), said a minister should also
imitate the leadership style of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin said that in the secular world, the higher a person goes
up the ladder, the more unreachable the leader becomes. Yet the
deeper Jesus went into his ministry, the more he allowed people to
see the depth of his inner emotions. He even wept publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors ``have bought into the system that the world uses,''
Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lyons trial unfolds, Plantinga said, spectators should
not look on with indifference or glee. They should watch with
humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we are just astonished that someone we respected and
trusted has indeed got a whole other side of their life that we
didn't know about,'' he said. ``But one of our reactions ought to
be one of recognition. We ought to say, `I, too, am a sinner and we
all live double lives to a certain extent.' ''

 &HT;    Battle to clear tree stumps, brush begins
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE _ This is high planning season for most gardeners, a
time to focus inspiration harvested from the rich store of
catalogs, magazines, garden shows and mind pictures. So many ideas,
so much pent-up gardening desire.
</P>
<P>
   Every year during this season of anticipation, I pluck an idea
or a few and get busy with them. These projects never are grandiose
or particularly fancy but always capable of dominating the early
part of my spring gardening. Some have been as simple as ridding my
Atlanta garden of English ivy or spreading dozens of bags of
composted manure _ or cleaning up years of unraked leaves. (I've
stopped raking. Again.)
</P>
<P>
   One year, I was consumed with finding a ground cover for an open
space in front of the fish pond, eventually hitting on dwarf mondo
after trying and failing miserably to establish Irish moss, Scotch
moss and Georgia moss.
</P>
<P>
   Another year, I just had to have English boxwoods, launching a
quest that took me all the way to Charles City, Va. Then, there was
the year I decided the Boston ivy had to come down from the brick
wall in favor of the smaller-leafed creeping fig, more in scale
with my tiny urban space. The ivy did not go gently, still popping
out of the ground years later. And, in my most difficult battle, I
set out a few years ago to get rid of dwarf bamboo, as it demanded
to be the garden's sole occupant. My struggle against the plastic
grass continues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here I go again. This year, on the ridge in McCaysville, I
fight the battle of the stumps.
</P>
<P>
   In a space about 20-feet square at the end of the Japanesque
garden squat a half-dozen stumps, mostly red maples, in varying
stages between life and death. The space, rich with years of fallen
leaves, also is home to a million saplings, blackberry bushes,
briers and broom sedge. I can't resist the sedge, but everything
else must go; I want that space for bamboo (tall canes, not dwarf),
which will sway in the mountain breezes, making a good-looking,
sweet-sounding background for nearby Japanese maples and pines.
</P>
<P>
   Late last summer I made a pass at clearing the space, and the
other day I attacked again _ armed with anticipation, a hatchet,
pruners and a pick. I knew this clearing job wouldn't be easy, made
more difficult by winter's unusual growth-promoting warmth. Even
rotting stumps had put out hardy shoots all around, trees bent on
regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to tame this space gives me new appreciation for the work
Ronald Reagan used to do when he ``cleared brush'' on his ranch in
Santa Barbara, Calif. Exhausted and breathless at times, I fought
through and pruned away my sharp-toothed bramble, cut rambling
shrubs to the ground, dug out what roots I could, hauled away
rocks, hacked at the stumps. Some hacked back, making the hatchet
bounce as if I were chopping at a football.
</P>
<P>
   I could hasten the process with chemicals, I suppose. I'd rather
not. I'm aiming for a more natural rebirth of this space; I want it
cleared by brawn, sweat and time. One old stump is almost where I
want them all to be: charcoal-colored, soft at the center, with
bright green moss and white lichen growing inward from its edges.
</P>
<P>
   As the stump's slow death continues, I will scoop out its center
and plant flowers _ zinnias this spring, chrysanthemums in late
summer. In some season soon it will give way to the three spreading
clumps of bamboo I already have planted. At least, that's the plan.

 &HT;    A second floor gives a '50s house more practical space,
contemporary face lift
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ranch house families had it made in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Kids finally got their own rooms. A second bath meant no
standing in line. The den became the draw for that new rabbit-eared
gizmo. And Mom declared her formal living room off limits, reserved
for entertaining guests.
</P>
<P>
   But today's ranchers _ many of them empty-nesters _ often prefer
an office to a third or fourth bedroom, one large master bath to
several small ones, a multipurpose family room nice enough for
entertaining anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Harvey and Jeanne Weiss. Frustrated by
their ranch-style home's boxy rooms, low ceilings and sterile
kitchen and baths, the owners sought open spaces, dramatic volume,
updated fixtures and warm natural materials. But, being big
gardeners, the Atlanta couple didn't want to give up part of their
yard to an expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The solution?
</P>
<P>
   They went up. The second-story addition gave them not only
additional and more efficiently used space but also the opportunity
for a face lift _ a contemporary stuccoed facade that shrouds any
trace of its ranch skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is all about living inside and out,'' said
architect Jim Choate, who won a 1998 design award from the Georgia
chapter of the American Institute of Architects for the house.
</P>
<P>
   The owners had considered moving the house off the site, and
building a new one but opted for a less expensive route. By
choosing an uncomplicated contemporary design, Choate was able to
maintain the best of the late-'50s brick veneer while adding
much-needed volume and a nontraditional mix of materials that
blends the house with its wooded setting.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-square-foot house was a typical ranch, with three
bedrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen and den, when purchased
in 1986. But three years ago, the owners decided they'd had enough
of the traditional design and layout. ``We wanted better use of
space _ a house in which we actually would use every inch of it,''
said Jeanne, who served as general contractor for the project.
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted to open its dark rooms to a view of the hilltop
surroundings. ``We were lucky enough to have an acre in the city,
so we said we may as well enjoy every centimeter of it,'' said
Harvey, a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Choate focused on the core of the house. He eliminated the walls
and chimney separating the living room on the front from the family
room on the rear and expanded the family room'sexterior wall 4
feet. The old living room was used to expand the dining room.
Finally, Choate raised the entire area's 8-foot ceilings, opening
the space to a second floor, which he extended over two wings.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, he added a master bedroom suite on one side and a
study on the other, connected by a bridge spanning the two-story
living area, for an additional 2,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen also was gutted, redesigned with an island and
completely updated, while a wall separating one of the original
bedrooms from the hallway was removed to create an open office.
</P>
<P>
   Because the roof had to be removed and steel columns and beams
incorporated into the wood frame structure, the owners moved out
during the nine-month project.
</P>
<P>
   The inconvenience paled in comparison with the fear the couple
had when rain and wind from Hurricane Opal passed through Atlanta
one night during the renovation. The tarp was blown back, but not
enough to cause major damage. ``I still hear sounds at night and
think about the roof, I was so worried about it during
construction,'' Jeanne recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the project was a breeze. ``The secret was Jim's
plans,'' Harvey said. ``We never changed one thing from the
drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   For Choate, of the Atlanta firm of Surber Barber Choate &AMP;
Hertlein Architects, the thrill was as much in integrating
materials as it was in redefining space. ``I tried to blend
things,'' he said. ``People have this misconception that modern,
contemporary design is cold and stark, but this is warm and human,
with natural materials such as the stone and wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The white brick exterior was covered in tan stucco, left natural
to give the facade a European feel, while redwood trim was used to
temper the contemporary look of towering black-framed windows.
</P>
<P>
   Choate repeated the stucco inside on a foyer wall, further
blending indoors and out. A steel-clad cabinet partition partially
separates the entrance from the dining room and family room,
helping direct the flow. Hardwood floors and maple and cherry
cabinetry tie the three spaces together, a scheme repeated in the
open kitchen, where stainless steel and granite give the wood a
contemporary edge. And the mix continues up the stairs from the
landing _ where slate and limestone warm an adjacent fireplace and
hearth surrounded by two-story windows _ to the railings, made of
cold-rolled steel and cladding.
</P>
<P>
   The owners were so pleased with the results they said they
wouldn't change a thing, even if building from scratch, which
raises a key question for ranchers: How cost-effective is adding a
second floor?
</P>
<P>
   If an owner aims for something complex, such as a traditional
design with many architectural intricacies, the cost can be as much
or more than building, Choate said. But for creating the simple,
clean lines of a contemporary structure, the basic box of a
ranch-style home can be an ideal, and less expensive, foundation
for going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a pretty neutral palette to start with,'' he said, ``a
great blank canvas for renovating.''

&HT;        CLINTON'S BUDGET GIVES MILLIONS IN FEDERAL DOLLARS TO
PENNSYLVANIA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine   c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- President Clinton's budget released this
week includes millions of federal dollars for Pennsylvania
projects, but drew mixed reviews overall from local lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly $1.8 trillion federal spending plan for fiscal year
2000 is only a blueprint for how federal money should be doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, Pennsylvania would got federal dollars
to obtain more land at Gettysburg National Park; rehabilitate
Johnstown's Flood Control project; study alternatives to the Maglev
mass transit system; and finish a design of a mine-drainage project
in Nanty Glo known as the Webster Discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Released in a week peppered with events that are bringing to a
close Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate, state lawmakers
were unable to identify all the federal programs for Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they had seen figures for a number of programs. The
National Park Service would receive $5.7 million to acquire three
parcels of land at Gettysburg. Those 99 acres would include one
site of a privately owned 310-foot tower which will be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the controversial Maglev, or magnetic levitation rail line
that would take travelers from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, got a
$20 million dollar boost. The money would go toward researching a
cheaper alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President's budget does reflect some desirable policy
goals by increasing defense spending, and allocating funds for
national treasures like Gettysburg National Park,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum was critical of the President's national initiative --
the centerpiece of which would set aside 62 percent of the
projected $4.4 trillion surplus over the next 15 years for a
``reserve pending Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His plan falls short in three major ways,'' Santorum said,
``He expands the size of government drastically; fails to provide
significant tax relief for working Americans and does not offer a
long term fix for Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said Social Security was the most important domestic
issue and and he would monitor how Clinton uses the surplus to
bolster the program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan also offers major increases to programs that will
benefit states such as Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The education budget calls for a $25 million increase in
Technology Literacy Challenge grant funds, which boosts funding to
$450 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Several schools in the Johnstown area are expected to receive
grant money, but individual schools are not listed, said Rep. John
Murtha, D-Johnstown.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha was pleased to see $6.8 million to continue revamping the
Johnstown Flood Control Project and $140,000 to design the mine
drainage ``Webster Discharge'' project at Nanty Glo.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha touted several initiatives that would benefit the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan provides $6 billion in tax credits to help people
afford long term care; allows people between the ages of 55 and 65
who don't have health coverage to buy into Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this age group often find themselves uninsured if
they lose their job or they're already having health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's plan is expected to face fierce opposition and
revision in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Republicans, Santorum already criticized the President
for not providing a significant tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage the President to work with Congress to achieve a
fiscally sound, pro-economic growth budget that allows the
taxpayers to keep more of their paychecks and feel confident about
their retirement security,'' Santorum said.

JORDAN DENIES HE TOLD LEWINSKY TO DESTROY NOTES TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential confidant Vernon Jordan heatedly
contradicted Monica Lewinsky's allegation that he told her to
destroy drafts of notes she wrote to President Clinton, according
to Jordan's deposition made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that he told Lewinsky to destroy the notes is
``ridiculous,'' he said. ``I'm not a fool, and the notion that I
would suggest to anybody that they destroy anything just defies
anything that I know about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan made his comments Tuesday in his videotaped deposition,
excerpts of which will be aired at the Senate impeachment trial
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As a long-time friend and confidant of Clinton's, Jordan was
asked by the White House to arrange for a job for Lewinsky in late
1997 shortly before her name appeared on the witness list of
lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., the House prosecutor who
questioned Jordan, started the three-hour session by saying he had
looked forward to an opportunity to meet Jordan, Jordan drew
laughter from prosecutors, senators and congressional staff by
answering: ``I can't say the feeling is mutual.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Georgia native, alternated between folksiness and
acerbic humor in his exchanges with Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   His deposition largely was a condensed reprise of his five
appearances last year before the grand jury probing whether Clinton
committed perjury and obstructed justice in hiding his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had testified before the grand jury before Lewinsky
eventually did, the deposition was the first time that Jordan was
faced with questions about discrepancies between his version and
Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   He resolved one discrepancy by changing his prior testimony
about whether he had a breakfast meeting a hotel restaurant on Dec.
31, 1997. Jordan had denied in his grand jury testimony but,
confronted with his credit card receipt for the hotel breakfast on
that date, he told Hutchinson that he did in fact meet with her
then.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the documentary evidence, Jordan said this week that it
was ``undeniable'' that the breakfast took place. However, he
continued to deny that he advised Lewinsky at the breakfast to
destroy drafts of the love notes she had written Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky had testified that he gave her that advice and that she
went home and discarded 50 such notes.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also disputed Lewinsky's testimony that Jordan knew of
the sexual nature of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors have keyed in on what Jordan knew about the
relationship and when he knew it in order to bolster their
contention that Jordan and Clinton were finding Lewinsky a job in
New York in exchange for her silence in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has insisted he knew nothing about any sexual contact
between the two. In the deposition, he specifically denied
Lewinsky's contention that she told him about ``phone sex'' with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told the grand jury she mentioned ``phone sex'' to
Jordan on Dec. 22, 1997, three days after she was subpoenaed as a
witness in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what's phone sex?'' Lewinsky quoted Jordan as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know what phone sex is,'' Lewinsky replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' Jordan said, according to Lewinsky. ``I'm just
an old man. I don't know what phone sex is.''
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Jordan said that while he recalled Lewinsky
telling him she talked on the phone with Clinton, ``if Ms. Lewinsky
had told me something about phone sex, I think I would have
remembered that ... given my age, I would probably have been
interested in what that was all about.'' Jordan is 63.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan reiterated how on Dec. 19, 1997, the day Lewinsky
tearfully informed him of the Jones lawsuit subpoena, he separately
questioned both Lewinsky and Clinton on whether the two had a
sexual relationship. Both denied it. ``I did satisfy myself'' that
there was no such relationship, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, he would have kept on trying to find a
job for Lewinsky in New York even if the answer had been ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing how ``disturbed'' and ``emotional'' Lewinsky was
over the subpoena, Jordan concluded ``she had a `thing' for the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky tried to avoid giving a deposition in the Jones case by
signing an affidavit on Jan. 7, 1998, denying any sexual
relationship with Clinton. In her grand jury testimony, Lewinsky
said she sought out Jordan's advice, a contention that House
prosecutors viewed as more evidence of his-help-for-her-silence.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan denied giving Lewinsky any advice about the affidavit. He
said he ``skimmed'' the text but told her to discuss any
substantive matters with the lawyer Jordan had recommended to her,
Frank Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not my job to advise her about an affidavit,'' he said.
``I don't do affidavits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson was trying to illustrate what House prosecutors have
long contended: That Lewinsky's false affidavit and the job search
on her behalf were part of efforts by Jordan and Clinton to buy her
silence about her affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, Clinton and Jordan have denied this contention.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Hutchinson if the Jones lawsuit subpoena led him to
suspect it might be linked to Clinton's interest in the Lewinsky
job search, Jordan responded: ``I did not give it a thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan repeated that he kept Clinton apprised of all
developments in the Lewinsky job search and the signing of the
affidavit. And he said that after presidential secretary Betty
Currie first asked him to help in Lewinsky's job search, ``There is
no question but that ... I was acting on behalf of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   This contradicted his grand jury testimony last March when
Jordan said that assisting Lewinsky simply was in response to
Currie's call and he had no reason to believe Clinton even knew
Lewinsky.

LEWINSKY SPARS WITH HOUSE PROSECUTORS; PROTECTS CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In her deposition for President Clinton's
impeachment trial this week, Monica Lewinsky nimbly fought off
repeated attempts by House prosecutors to condemn the president,
saying that she still admires him and believes he is a good
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings'' about the president, Lewinsky said,
according to transcripts of her four-hour deposition released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the former White House insisted she told the truth last
August in testimony before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
grand jury ``irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings are in
my testimony today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky sparred with House prosecutor Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
throughout Monday's question-and-answer session, using short,
carefully worded answers and at times sounding like the president
himself with her precise definition of words.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had lied in an affidavit to lawyers for Paula Jones
in Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, when she said
that she had only seen the president at work-related events,
Lewinsky said: ``It's incomplete and therefore misleading. Well,
it--it is true; it's not complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's tactics frustrated Bryant who often asked the same
question from several different angles only to come up with little
or nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Senate released transcripts of depositions taken
this week from Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal. Excerpts from all three are to be
played at the impeachment trial on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors are trying to prove that Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice in an attempt to cover-up his affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the depositions, the House prosecutors failed to produce the
kind of bombshell that some senators said was needed to turn the
tide of the impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial point in Lewinsky's deposition came when Bryant zeroed
in on a telephone call between the former intern and the president.
On Dec. 17, 1997, Clinton phoned Lewinsky at around 2 a.m. to tell
her that she was on the Jones lawsuit's witness list and might be
called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Lewinsky that she could possibly get out of being
deposed in the case by filing an affidavit to Jones' lawyers
denying that she had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky insisted that Clinton never told her to lie in the
affidavit. ``There was no discussion of what would be in an
affidavit,'' she said. ``I don't think I necessarily thought at
that point it would have to be false.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant pressed her, Lewinsky admitted that she and the
president that night also discussed their ``cover stories,'' which
they had worked out early in their relationship to keep their
affair secret. Later, Lewinsky used those cover stories in her
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lewinsky explained her frequent visits to the White
House after her transfer to the Pentagon by saying she was bringing
papers to Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky insisted that there was no connection between his
suggestion that she file an affidavit and their cover story
discussion during the same conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, were (the cover stories) in connection with the
affidavit?'' Bryant asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe so, no,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been against (the president's) interest in that
lawsuit for you to have told the truth in an affidavit, would it
not?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really comfortable _ I mean, I can tell you what would
have been in my best interest,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the deposition, Lewinsky also refused to say the
president lied when he denied touching her in a sexual manner.
However, she did say that she believed they had sex under the
definition used by Jones' lawyers in their deposition with the
president last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel comfortable characterizing whether what he
said was truthful or not truthful,'' she told Bryant. ``I know I've
testified to what I believe is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times during the deposition, Lewinsky showed that she
continued to have warm feelings for the president. She said he was
``intelligent'' and said she still admired him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Bryant referred to Lewinsky's initial encounter with
the president as their ``first so-called salacious occasion,'' the
former intern asked if he would call it something else.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked her what she would like him to use, Lewinsky
struggled for a moment, then said: ``It was my first encounter with
the president, so I don't really see it as my first salacious _
that's not what this was.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was not alone in her fight against Bryant. Joining
Lewinsky in the hotel suite were a number of the president's
attorneys, including Nicole Seligman, Clinton ally Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., and her lawyers Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes after the deposition started, Cacheris jumped in to
remind Bryant that he could only ask questions on topics that
Lewinsky had already covered during her grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy then told Bryant that Senate Republicans had agreed that
prosecutors could not ask explicit sexual questions about
Lewinsky's relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant completed his questioning, Seligman told the room
that the president's lawyers had no questions for the witness. She
then said: ``Ms. Lewinsky, on behalf of the president, we'd like to
tell you how very sorry we all are for what you have had to go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky responded with a short, ``Thank you.''

MILLENNIUM CHANGE THE LAST TIME WAS NO BIG DEAL  
 (ADV: WITH Y1K-SIDE. EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There is so much hoopla over the coming change in the
millennium, it probably will come as a surprise to learn that
hardly any thought was given to the last switch-over.
</P>
<P>
   In A.D. 999, there was no panic over Y1K. Almost no one got
worked up over the end of the thousand-year epoch. And no wonder _
it was a very different world.
</P>
<P>
   Our change is notable mainly as a novelty: people watching the
turning of zeros on a speedometer.
</P>
<P>
   The primary doomsayers are those who worry about our computers,
which they fear will let airplanes drop out of the sky at midnight
on the last day of the year and cause all the banks to lose all our
financial records and leave us all broke. The fear is considerable,
but considerably less biblical.
</P>
<P>
   But if we are all now waiting for the great ball to drop at the
end of the millennium, in 999 it was different. Almost no one knew
it (begin ital) was (end ital) 999. There are many reasons why it
should have been that way.
</P>
<P>
   Europe in the 11th century was a very local place: People lived
their entire lives within a few miles of where they were born.
</P>
<P>
   There were few towns, little circulating money and a lot of
farming. The Roman Catholic Church provided more political
stability than kings and princes did. What we know as nations today
hardly existed then.
</P>
<P>
   Although Europeans of the time were Christian, their beliefs
played out locally rather than internationally, and their
Christianity often was laced with local superstition.
</P>
<P>
   So, they grew and ate their crops, raised their families and
were buried, all in blissful ignorance of what might be happening a
few hundred miles away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they had no use for time zones or uniform weights
and measures _ nor uniform calendars.
</P>
<P>
   We are used to a common date: 1999 is a figure agreed to pretty
much around the world, understood even in non-Christian nations.
But the A.D. (or C.E. _ ``common era'') system of year-numbering
was not universally adopted throughout Europe until the 14th
century. And the concept of B.C. wasn't devised until the 17th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Back in A.D. 1000, years were calculated mostly by the reigns of
local princes. Someone might say, ``I was born in the third year of
King Otto's reign.''
</P>
<P>
   Many educated people used a calendar dated from the supposed
creation of the Earth, the Anno Mundi calendar. But because there
were conflicting theories about how old the Earth might be,
multiple versions of that calendar were in use.
</P>
<P>
   Still others might date years from the founding of Rome (Ab
Urbis Conditae), a system left over from that dissolved empire.
</P>
<P>
   And others used a calendar that began dating time with the reign
of Emperor Diocletian, who persecuted Christians. Hence, that
system measured time ``from the years of martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   There were so many calendars that the date we know as Jan. 1,
1000, also was known as 1754 A.U.C, 716 Anno Diocletian, and either
6494, 6501, 6505, 6506, 6507 or 6508, according to which A.M.
calendar you subscribed to. It was also the 16th of Tevet in the
year 4760 in the Jewish calendar. (It was a Wednesday, by the way).
All of these calendars were in use at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar system we all use now was devised by Dennis the
Short (a k a Dionysius Exiguus) in the sixth century, but it took a
while to catch on. Even he didn't use it when dating his letters.
</P>
<P>
   And even if everybody finally could agree on A.D. 1000, they
didn't agree when it might begin.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, the new year began on Christmas Day; in Florence, on
March 25; in Venice, on March 1; in France, on Easter; in England,
on various days, including March 25, Dec. 25 and Jan. 1; in Spain,
on Jan. 1; in Constantinople, on Sept. 1 or 24; and in Armenia, on
July 9.
</P>
<P>
   So it hardly could be surprising that on what we might call Dec.
31, 999, there were very few anxious people waiting for the skies
to open and the thunder to roll.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that there were people using the A.D. calendar _ the
Venerable Bede used it in his history of England _ and there was
some millennial ferment a thousand years ago. But although some
people waited for the end of the world, they tended to do so within
a few discrete monasteries. And even they could not agree when the
end actually would come.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was just as much anxiety 33 years later, when some
people expected the end to come on the millennium of Jesus' death.
</P>
<P>
   There was parallel millenarianism on special years of each of
the other calendars in use, which diffused any panic that might
have built up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the important differences between now and then is that we
are a measuring society. We like things exact. When we talk of a
millennium, we want it to be precisely 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, such precision was really beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   A millennium was a long time, and a time between significant
events, but it was not necessarily something to tabulate on an
adding machine.
</P>
<P>
   It must be remembered that the early Middle Ages _ which lasted
until just about A.D. 1000 _ were the receding wake of the Roman
Empire. Its ideas and social structures largely were derived from
the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Romans, the word ``millennium'' defined a time we
more properly might call an ``era'' or an ``epoch.'' The Roman
numeral ``M'' stood for ``a long time,'' and that was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   And that should not be surprising, because the Roman century _
or ``saeculum'' _ could have as many as 120 years in it.
``Saeculum,'' in fact, meant ``age'' more than ``century.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a concept borrowed from the earlier Etruscans, whose
saeculae counted not years, but generations, and were meant to
measure the time from a grandfather's birth to a grandson's death.
Their saeculae averaged about 108 years, although it expanded and
contracted according to the longevity of those doing the counting.
</P>
<P>
   So the very notion of even centuries adding up to even millennia
would have been totally foreign to the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, it is not at all strange if we now say that the first
century A.D. had only 99 years in it _ which is what is sometimes
said to justify our celebrating the second millennium next January
instead of the arithmetically correct 2001.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the problem has always been that a millennium,
whatever its official length, is purely a mental construct and has
no genuine relation to the real world. Unlike the passing of
seasons or the rising and setting of the sun, which are actual
events in the real world, the millennium is merely an arbitrary
choice.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there is the experience of being alive; on the
other, ideas about that experience.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing magical about the number 1000. If we used a
base-12 numbering system _ which in many ways is just as convenient
as our base-10 system, if we count knuckles on the fingers of one
hand with our thumb instead of counting fingers on both _ a century
would be 144 years long and a millennium 1,728 years long. It would
not be any more real.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayan calendar was based on a 20-year cycle and its
millennium would be 8,000 years long.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which way you add it up, the millennium is all in your
head. &QL;

SHOULD A MAN TRY TO WRITE IN A WOMAN'S VOICE AND VICE VERSA? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my
portion of these pages, for I know I am not clever.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of this passage, the prolific and prolifically clever
Charles Dickens, demonstrably believed the contrary. What novelists
do, after all, is invent characters, and first-person narration, in
which an imagined character is given a voice as well as a point of
view, is a common convention.
</P>
<P>
   But in the cited passage, the speaker is Esther Summerson, the
protagonist of the novel, ``Bleak House,'' who alternates chapters
with an arch and satiric omniscient narrator more identifiable with
the writer himself. Esther is a typically self-effacing and angelic
Dickens heroine but the only female narrator in his entire output.
And as a result, ``Bleak House,'' published in 1853, remains much
discussed as both a narrative anomaly and a social one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the most controversial of his works at the
time and is still the subject of enormous discussion among
scholars,'' said Alison Case, a professor of English at Williams
College and the author of ``Plotting Women,'' a forthcoming book on
female narrators in 18th- and 19th-century fiction. ``Dickens'
friend, John Foster, said, `It was an experiment not worthy of
success and certainly not successful.'''
</P>
<P>
   This marked an interesting moment in the history of the
relationship between writer and narrator, which itself is complex
enough to have spawned an academic discipline (called narratology),
one of whose more piquant issues is cross-gender narration: that
is, male writers speaking in the voice of a female characters, and,
though historically less often, vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Male writers seem to take on the first person to prove their
virtuosity and/or empathy,'' said Joseph Boone, a narratologist and
professor of English at the University of Southern California,
``while, at least historically, women writers, often working under
male pseudonyms, might use the male first person as part of their
attempt to `pass' and prove themselves professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past several decades, female writers have claimed their
narrative authority much more aggressively. Indeed, cross-gender
narration is a technique that is employed today _ by writers of
both sexes _ far more often than it has ever been in the history of
the novel (and probably more often than narrations that cross other
boundaries, like race and ethnicity). But even so, it's relatively
rare, and for many readers, it intensifies the challenge that all
novels extend to them _ to suspend disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to contemporary works like ``Oldest Living Confederate
Widow Tells All'' by Allan Gurganus, ``The End of Alice'' by A.M.
Homes and ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' by Arthur Golden is often
informed by surprise, if not discomfort, at the gender gap between
the teller of the tale and the controlling intelligence behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always asking me how I did it,'' said Gurganus, in
a recent interview, 10 years after the publication of ``Confederate
Widow,'' the purported memoir of an uneducated but shrewdly
observant woman who at age 15 had married a 55-year-old veteran of
the Civil War. ``Hundreds, if not thousands, of women, saying to
me: How did you know? But what's weird is not my knowing, it's how
weird most people consider that knowing. We live in a culture where
it's considered an immense feat to assume a woman's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writing is an act of presumption. ``Listen,'' the the
voice of the narrator says, ``I have a story to tell.'' Playwrights
routinely give voice to characters of the opposite gender, but they
do not routinely cede to any character the authority to tell the
story the way it is conferred on a narrator in fiction. A
first-person narrator more easily creates the illusion of an
intimacy, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Readers tend to identify quickly with the first person,'' said
Norman Mailer, one of whose books is written in the assumed voice
of Marilyn Monroe. (Another was in the voice of Jesus.) ``The
danger is they are determined not to let the author get away from
them.'' Indeed, the first-person technique, particularly for
literal-minded readers, can obscure the lengths to which writers
will go to separate themselves from their creations.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of ``The End of Alice,'' an aging pedophile in jail
for the murder of a 12-year-old girl, for example, is not exactly a
stand-in for the young woman who created him. ``That I was writing
so far from my own experience, people found that unfathomable,''
said Homes. ``I did a radio interview where a guy called in and
said, `That's OK, Thomas Mann was a pedophile, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are probably both obvious and psychologically
complex, first-person intimacy combined with cross-gender narration
seems particularly provocative. This was the presumption behind
``Written on the Body,'' a 1994 first-person novel by Jeanette
Winterson about a passionate, adulterous love affair in which the
beloved is a married woman, but the gender of the narrator-lover is
coyly, skillfully obscured. Some obvious questions are raised: Does
a voice have gender qualities? Do men and women speak differently,
observe differently, think differently, love differently?

BLUMENTHAL SAYS HE NEVER SPREAD `STALKER' STORY ABOUT LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House aide Sidney Blumenthal said in his
videotaped deposition that he now believes President Clinton lied
to him about Monica Lewinsky making sexual demands, but he insisted
he never spread Clinton's false account of Lewinsky to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In sometimes testy exchanges with House prosecutors in the
Senate impeachment trial, Blumenthal said he was not the source of
news reports that portrayed Clinton as a victim of Lewinsky, and
reported Lewinsky was known as a ``stalker.'' One of the articles
attributed the information to ``White House sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he regarded his Jan. 21, 1998, meeting with
Clinton as a ``private conversation in confidence, and I didn't
mention it to my colleagues ... friends (and) family, besides my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified behind closed doors at the U.S. Capitol on
Wednesday. The Senate released a transcript of his deposition on
Friday and portions of the videotaped version may be played before
Senators when the impeachment trial resumes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   What Blumenthal did with Clinton's story is important to House
prosecutors seeking to buttress the second impeachment article,
contending Clinton obstructed justice in covering up his affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The second article charges Clinton with making ``false and
misleading statements'' to potential witnesses in order to mislead
the grand jury that last year probed allegations of perjury and
obstruction being developed by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment article says nothing about spreading such
statements to journalists, but any linkage between the White House
and negative stories about Lewinsky could prove embarrassing to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal repeated the story he first told the grand jury last
year: On the day the Lewinsky story broke in the Washington Post,
Clinton told him that he had been counseling Lewinsky, but she had
demanded sex from him and he rebuffed her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Blumenthal that Lewinsky had said she was known as
``the stalker,'' and that she ``would claim that they had an affair
whether they had or they hadn't,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very upset,'' Blumenthal said. ``He was a man in
anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he accurately reported the conversation in his
grand jury appearances last year. But when Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., one of the prosecutors, asked him whether he now believes
Clinton lied, Blumenthal said ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that at White House staff meetings on how to
handle the burgeoning Lewinsky scandal, ``We felt very firmly that
nobody should ever be a source to a reporter about a story about
Monica Lewinsky's personal life, and I strongly agreed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged talking to one journalist, Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette columnist Gene Lyons, who compared Clinton to TV
late-night talk show host David Letterman, a victim of a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Lewinsky, ``I told him, in no uncertain terms,
that I wouldn't talk about her personally,'' Blumenthal said. ``I
drew a line.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea of Lewinsky being a stalker might have taken
hold in the press through ``talking points'' that Lewinsky gave to
Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee whose secret tape-recordings of
Lewinsky talking about her relationship with Clinton sparked the
Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The ``talking points'' were meant to advise Tripp on how to
answer questions on another Clinton imbroglio _ his alleged groping
of former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. Among them was the
suggestion that Tripp might say someone was stalking the ``P,''
referring to president.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was speculation last year that someone in the
White House had authored the ``talking points,'' Lewinsky herself
said she wrote them.

 UNDATED: love differently?  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's funny, isn't it, how everything gets broken down into
basic distinctions between the sexes, as though we have no other
way of distinguishing things?'' said Homes, one of whose previous
novels, ``Jack,'' was written in the voice of a teen-age boy and
whose next novel is narrated by both a man and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is a male kind of novel and a female kind of
novel. People have always said to me, `You write like a boy.' But
the voice of a novel occurs obliviously, according to what's
appropriate to the material. It's `Who should be best telling the
story I want to tell?,' not `Can I take on a male voice?'''
</P>
<P>
   Writers can _ and do _ feel free to impersonate anyone they wish
and in any way they wish. That is why they often find so-called
politically correct criticism (How dare you presume to speak for
The Other!), especially irksome and foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially with the focus on gender studies today, the feeling
in some quarters is that voices shouldn't take on `the other,'''
said Joyce Carol Oates, who has written two novels with male
narrators, ``Zombie'' and ``We Are the Mullvaneys.'' ``But it's not
an issue. It's just as difficult to create a woman as a man.
Basically, you're working with language to create a voice, and
sometimes there are gender qualities in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cheuse, whose novel ``The Grandmother's Club'' was written
in the voice of an elderly Jewish woman, concurred. ``You can't not
do it if you get the call to do it,'' he said, adding that his
novel floundered through several versions until he rewrote it, at
last, in the first person. ``The voice comes into your head and you
allow it to speak. If the voice is female, you let it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, when the novel arose as a form, two if its
earliest masters, Daniel Defoe (in ``Moll Flanders'' and
``Roxana'') and Samuel Richardson (in the epistolary novels
``Pamela'' and ``Clarissa'') assumed the female narrative disguise.
The sensitivity of readers to the technique, however, arose later.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one seems to have thought Richardson's attempt or desire to
impersonate the feminine, or his affinity with the domesticity
often associated with the novel, as a genre-odd,'' said Boone at
Southern Cal. ``It would take the more Victorian milieu of the next
century to make more `sensational' male writer's attempts to speak
in the female first person. One of the more audacious examples was
`Bleak House.'''
</P>
<P>
   It worked the other way around as well. Charlotte Bronte's
``Jane Eyre: An Autobiography'' was published under a pseudonym,
the gender nonspecific Currer Bell, and it immediately unleashed a
critical debate over the sex of the author, with claims, on the one
hand, that no man could have written so intimately about a
governess and on the other that if a woman did write it, it was
unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reviewer said that no man could have written a book so
concerned with curtains,'' Oates said with a laugh. ``I always
liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronte's first novel, ``The Professor,'' was written from the
male point of view, but it wasn't published until after her death.
Indeed, all the Bronte sisters explored the cross-gender issue.
Most famously, in ``Wuthering Heights,'' Emily framed the story of
Heathcliff and Catherine, largely told by the servant, Mrs. Dean,
within a narration by Lockwood, a male visitor to the moors.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 20th century, female narrators, written by men or
women, were few enough; those that did exist, said Case at
Williams, were usually speaking contemporaneously to the events
being described. They were keen observers, but rarely granted the
power of shaping a story that comes with a retrospective view.
``There are some obvious reasons for this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long men had the cultural authority to speak for women
in so many ways, from religion to medicine, authority to speak for
and on behalf of women. Women have historically had trouble
speaking for themselves, let alone for men. To make a gross
generalization, this is a kind of cultural authority people have
turned away from in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars generally point to Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' published in
1922, as initiating the era of broad narrative experimentation that
novelists enjoy today. ``Ulysses'' concluded with a famous episode
of cross-gender narration, Molly Bloom's internal monologue, which
opened the landscape for Faulkner's daring narrative stews in books
like ``The Sound and the Fury'' and ``As I Lay Dying.'' Even
Hemingway seemingly aped Joyce with a woman's internal monologue at
the end of ``To Have and Have Not.''
</P>
<P>
   So how is it done? ``I imagine a man,'' the writer played by
Jack Nicholson in the film ``As Good as It Gets,'' offered as a
cynical response ``and I take away reason and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   But off screen, writers talk about the same painstaking work it
takes to speak credibly in any voice. Gurganus, for example, called
the process of writing ``Confederate Widow'' ``undertaking a Ph.D.
in intentional femaleness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that you begin with almost a detective kind of
logic,'' Gurganus said. ``If she didn't get an education, she'd use
this locution instead of that. If she has to cook meals for nine
children and worry about their clothes, she'd know fabrics and
shortcuts involving cornbread. Metaphors begin to merge from
whatever is in reach in her kitchen and at her writing table. It's
when you live with that long enough, then the quantum stuff starts
to happen, and that's when it really gets amazing.'' In the end,
Gurganus said, it changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent seven years writing `Confederate Widow,' and I think
it was the most politicizing experience I've ever had, `` he said.
``It was tremendously enlightening. It's a shadow-land critique of
being male to assume the female disguise, and one of the things you
realize is that women really know more than men.''

 &HT;    JORDAN'S HUSSEIN NEAR DEATH, SUPPORTERS KEEP VIGIL WITH TALES OF
HIS CHARITY
 &HT;    EDs: Contains optional trim.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Six years ago this heating repairman threw
himself against the car of Jordan's King Hussein and begged him for
help. The banks were foreclosing on his family's house.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ordered his guards to let Monther Abed Al-Saida talk.
Later, the king answered his request with US$15,000, saving the
family from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, amid rain and windy 40-degree weather, Al-Saida
kept a vigil with about 200 other Jordanians outside the King
Hussein Medical Center, where the 63-year-old monarch was likely in
his last hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give the king my soul, not because he saved my house,
but because I love him,'' the 25-year-old Al Saida said through the
red-and-white checkered Bedouin scarf shielding his face from the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, the crusader for peace who survived assassination
attempts and invasions to rule for 47 years, was being kept alive
on life-support machines after a hasty return to his homeland
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   His subjects, many with tears in their eyes, swapped stories of
the generosity of the man many call ``our father.'' They recalled
the time he stopped to change a man's tire or tours he took of
Palestinian refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The capital took on a tense feeling of dread. A chilling rain
drenched banners hung just three weeks ago for what had been a
joyous return from the hospital, when he was thought to be
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, he appeared to be nearing the end of a seven-month
battle with lymphoma, a deadly form of cancer. After a failed bone
marrow transplant, the king apparently slipped into a coma Thursday
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   According to his wishes, he was rushed back to Jordan so he
could die in the vulnerable little country that he had protected
from neighboring wars and turned into a keystone of stability in
the Middle East. He rode from the airport to the hospital in an
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations were being made for both the logistical and
psychological challenges that await Jordan as its leader lay dying.
Jordanian television ran a retrospective on his life, and
newspapers reassured readers that the king had provided for a
smooth transition to his son Abdullah.

   A downtown hotel was being outfitted with press rooms in
preparation for a funeral that could see some 40 world leaders in
attendance. Members of parliament met to decide how Abdullah will
be sworn into office -- a procedure that Jordanians have not had to
employ for nearly half a century. Some hoped for another Hussein
miracle, an escape from death. But insiders in Jordan's tight-knit
upper-class thought of preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the thing that controls us is the political situation, not
his health,'' said Jordanian journalist Sultan Hattab. ``They are
watching for the reactions of the people . . . they are preparing
to announce (Hussein's death) at a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattab said he spoke Friday evening with a friend and doctor who
had just been to Hussein's hospital room. The doctor, former
Jordanian prime minister Abdel Salem Majali, said the king was on
life support systems while his sister, Princess Basma, sat weeping
near his bed and wife, Queen Noor, remained stoic and strong.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reuters, the king's family, decided Friday night to
leave him on the life-support system keeping him alive for
``whatever time it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattab said they must arrange the ascension of Abdullah and the
funeral. He said that Abdullah will almost certainly choose
Hussein's favorite son, 18-year-old Hamzah, to be the crown prince
-- his own back-up for the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his death, Hussein was expected to be carried four miles by
military parade from the hospital to the grounds of the Raghdan
Palace, where his mother, father and grandfather are buried.
According to Islamic custom, the king would be buried as soon as
possible, preferably within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   If so, and official Jordanian spokesmen were still saying Friday
night that Hussein was undergoing treatment and that foreign press
were rushing talk of his demise, the burial would end a tumultuous
three weeks in a country that values stability more than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, Hussein returned to Jordan after six months of
treatment, saying he was recovered. Hundreds of thousands of
Jordanians lined the streets to his palace as he braved cold and
rain to wave at them through the sunroof his Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with his health deteriorating, he made a major move. He
removed his brother Hassan from the role of crown prince, which he
had held for 34 years. In his place, he appointed the 37-year-old
Abdullah. Abdullah was sworn into the job just hours before a
feeble Hussein returned hastily to Minnesota for a last attempt at
the ill-fated treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the switch in their heir to the throne, a letter from
the king let the reserved Jordanian public in on palace intrigue,
including ``parasites'' who the king said were slandering his
family.
</P>
<P>
   But that ugly view of the royal family did not matter to
Jordanians Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends.)
</P>
<P>
   A coffee server recalled the time he saw the king cry at a boy's
funeral and how the king shook his hand when he received his
coffee. Journalist Hattab remembered the medals the king gave him
for breaking the taboo against speaking on Israeli television.
Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel is still unpopular and
Hattab had been facing threats from the public.
</P>
<P>
   In the Al-Hussein refugee camp, about 100,000 Palestinians live
in crumbling block houses and rains fill the alleys with three-inch
deep currents reeking of sewage. It provides a view both of
Jordan's flailing economy, but also the king's old-school largess.
A 1987 Nissan Suny(CQ) is parked on the street. Arabic script on
the door reads: ``A gift of King Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God gives King Hussein more years to live because he made
things better for me and my family,'' said 40-year-old Ali
Al-Saide. Serving in the Jordanian army in 1977, he stepped on a
land mine and lost his right leg below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, after making a request through the government
ministry where he works as a $150-a-month clerk, Hussein gave him
the car.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, many of the people under the giant photo of
Hussein that marks the entrance to his medical center, insisted
they would stay until they heard news of the king's health --
knowing it would likely be tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled under a blanket in the back of a covered Nissan pick-up
truck, three adult sisters wept. One held her four-month-old baby
and their brothers stood nearby in the cold night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hear the latest word,'' said Ghazi Al-Adwan, 43.
``We are worried about the king's health. It is the most sad moment
of our lives.''
</P>

APPROPRIATE REAGAN MONUMENT WOULD BE REBUILT GOP  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE FEB. 5 ARIZONA REPUBIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ronald Reagan ranks as one of this nation's great
presidents. Even those troubled by his Iran-contra conduct and
budget-busting Pentagon spending must concede that it was under his
leadership that the United States vanquished communism, rebuilt the
military, and restored America's prosperity and global influence.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, this seemingly most ordinary of men restored a
confidence and spirit that many Americans had lost under Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Reagan made conservatism respectable, even
fashionable for a whole new generation.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons and more, his staunchest supporters have
sought to honor Reagan. Washington's National Airport was renamed
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. And now Rep. Matt
Salmon, R-Ariz., wants to put a 60-foot carving of Reagan on Mount
Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   In coming up with such an idea, critics suggest Salmon had too
much time on his hands skipping President Clinton's State of the
Union address. At first blush, the idea seems, well, monumentally
nuts. But the idea has been circulating for years among
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. of ``American Spectator''
magazine lobbied for Reagan's canonization on Mount Rushmore.
William F. Buckley Jr. has endorsed the idea. ``Investor's Business
Daily'' editorialized in support of it last year.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives, it doesn't get much better than Reagan. Given
the hammering Republicans have been taking at the hands of Clinton,
it's understandable why Salmon and others yearn to honor Reagan and
recapture the glory years.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than devoting their efforts to memorializing Reagan
on Mount Rushmore, we suggest conservative Republicans borrow a few
pages from the Gipper's playbook and start winning a few _ starting
with the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan stood for less government, a strong defense, freedom and
individual rights. Above all, Reagan believed in this country.
Forget Mount Rushmore and start rebuilding a party Reagan would
recognize. &QL;

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LEWINSKY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 70-30, a motion to subpoena
Monica Lewinsky to appear before the Senate in President Clinton's
impeachment trial. Supporters of the motion said Lewinsky's
presence in the Senate would provide senators an opportunity to
judge her credibility. Opponents said that it is time to vote on
the impeachment articles, and Lewinsky's live testimony would add
nothing new to the House prosecutors' case. A ``yes'' vote favors
the motion.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: WRITTEN
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 73-27, a motion to allow only
the written transcripts of the testimony of Lewinsky, presidential
friend Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
Supporters said they want to protect the privacy of the witnesses.
Opponents said that the public has the right to see the same
evidence as the senators including the videotapes of the
depositions. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 62-38, a motion to allow both
the videotaped testimony and written transcripts to be presented at
the impeachment trial. Supporters said the video and transcripts
are needed for a fair trial. Opponents of the motion believed that
the videotapes and transcripts are unnecessary because they yield
no new evidence. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 56-44, a motion to overlook the
final steps of the impeachment trial and go directly to closing
arguments. The motion would have put an end to the trial.
Supporters of the motion said that the trial has gone on long
enough, and a final decision needs to be made. Opponents said that
all of the evidence has not yet been heard, so the trial is not
over. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.

BIG CONCERN OVER BIG BABY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Lyndon Voss is just 14 months old and weighs 47
pounds, more than twice the average size for a baby her age. The
``National ``Enquirer'' dubbed her ``America's Largest Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   She has gained about a pound a week from the time she was born
until last month, when she began to level off. At the rate she was
growing, she would have been bigger than her 5-foot-1, 109-pound
mother by the age of 2.
</P>
<P>
   From their Phoenix apartment, her parents search for answers:
Why has their only child become so big? What will life will hold
for her if they can't control her size?
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon is taller than average but not nearly tall enough to
explain her weight gain. Doctors at Phoenix Children's Hospital can
find nothing medically wrong with her, hospital spokeswoman Jane
Walden says.
</P>
<P>
   The baby does have hypothyroidism, but medication she has been
taking since she was 6 months old should have curbed any unusual
weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very frustrating,'' said Lyndon's father, Les Voss,
32. ``No one can give us any answers.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 5 feet 10 inches, weighs 180 pounds and says no one in his
family or that of his wife, 25-year-old Gabi Voss, is particularly
big.
</P>
<P>
   Gabi and Les hope the lull in Lyndon's weight gain will hold.
They have put off having any more children until they know for sure
what is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of her parents' worries, Lyndon is a happy baby with big
blue eyes and curly blond hair. She plays on the floor with
Teletubbies dolls, colorful characters from a children's television
show.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, she sits in the splits, one thick leg sticking out
either side. She doesn't walk yet, pulling herself across the floor
or rolling around.
</P>
<P>
   Her clothes were made for kindergartners. The pants, twice as
long as her legs but wide enough, are rolled up. She smiles easily,
flashing eight teeth and throwing her arms into the air when her
mother says, ``Hooray!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lyndon can't fit in a walker or the swings at a nearby
park. She can't squeeze into highchairs at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   She's big enough for a toddler bed. But because she is still a
baby, she would get hurt if she rolled out. Gabi has trouble
lifting her over the crib rails now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like her to have the same advantages as a normal
1-year-old,'' Gabi said. ``She's missing out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the mall or park, people stop Gabi to ask about the pretty
little girl in the stroller. Often, they expect her to walk and
talk. Lyndon doesn't talk much yet, sometimes grabbing a pillow
shaped like a cow and calling it ``moo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We either get positive comments like, `Oh, she's so cute. God
bless her,' '' Gabi says. ``Or, they say, `Look at that chubby
baby!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon didn't start out big. She was born on Nov. 26, 1997, at
Guam Naval Hospital, where her father was stationed. Les was in the
Navy for almost seven years. Lyndon weighed 7 pounds, 3 ounces and
was 21 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   A thyroid test soon after birth was abnormal, so it was taken
again. The second time, doctors said it was slightly high, but
nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lyndon was 6 weeks old, she weighed 14 pounds. At 18
weeks, she weighed 18 pounds and was wearing clothes made for an
18-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   At 24 weeks and 24 pounds, another test showed the baby had
hypothyroidism. She was still gaining a pound a week.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Phoenix in July. At Phoenix Children's
Hospital, doctors told the parents that Lyndon's growth was normal,
except for the huge weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   The baby gets a bottle of whole milk three times a day. She is
always drinking water and soaks four or five diapers a night. Gabi
gets up about every hour to change her.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon eats small portions of vegetables, fruit, noodles and
chicken, among other things. The only treats she gets _ pudding,
gelatin _ are non-fat. Occasionally, she eats ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Gabi is working with a nutritionist to make sure Lyndon eats
right. She doesn't want Lyndon to lose weight. The goal is to
maintain her weight as she gets taller and not gain any more.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon's picture and story have appeared in the ``National
Enquirer,'' ``Weekly World News'' and ``Focus,'' a Japanese
magazine. She was featured on the television shows ``Inside
Edition'' and ``Maury Povich'' as well as a Japanese television
show called ``Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Enquirer'' story starts: ``Talk about baby fat!''
</P>
<P>
   Gabi has sent letters to newspapers, magazines and television
shows, hoping that _ through the publicity _ she will find some
clue as to what is wrong with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be doing these types of things, but they pay
us a little, and it helps out,'' Les said.
</P>
<P>
   It is expensive caring for Lyndon, her father says. Her diapers,
for example, cost $44 for a pack of 96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Edition'' paid for the Vosses to take Lyndon to two
specialists in Newwark, N.J., in November. Like the Phoenix
doctors, they found nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of other big babies contacted the Vosses after
hearing their story, sharing ideas about medical treatments and
daily living.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-month-old Curtis, for example, who lives in Cincinnati,
weighs 53 pounds. Austin, just two weeks older than Lyndon, lives
in Chicago and weighs 46 pounds. He is diabetic. Gabi keeps in
touch with their parents through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ``Enquirer'' called Lyndon ``America's Largest
Baby,'' the record, according to the Guinness Book of Records,
belongs to Zack Strenkert of New York, who at 17 months in
September 1996 weighed 70 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I know, Lyndon is the biggest girl in America,''
Gabi says, admitting that she doesn't like the title. ``I'd rather
she be the smartest or the prettiest girl.'' &QL;

TWO NEW FORWARDS ADDED TO THORNTON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The new-look Bruins took the ice for practice Friday.
Gone were centers Shawn Bates and Chris Taylor. In their place were
forwards Antti Laaksonen and Cameron Mann, who were skating on the
second line with Joe Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, 0-6-1 in their last seven games, hope to end that
free fall Saturday against the red-hot Flyers in Philadelphia. The
Flyers have one loss in their last 23 games (16-1-6).
</P>
<P>
   President-general manager Harry Sinden and assistant GM Mike
O'Connell met for 90 minutes with coach Pat Burns and his staff
after Thursday night's embarrassing 5-4 loss to the Islanders. The
upshot was that both the newcomers will be seen for more than a
shift here or there. They will take a regular spot in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are several: First, it might wake up the rest of the
team, make them realize their roster spots are not necessarily
safe. Second, they might bring a fresh approach from the very
successful Providence team and provide a lift to the struggling
parent club. Third, management will not dismantle the club through
trades, and this is the obvious short-term solution. If this
doesn't work, more drastic steps will be taken. Burns said he
wouldn't rule out anything, including the possibility of goalie Jim
Carey getting an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has remained very positive throughout the slump and said
he will continue to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give them a shot,'' he said of the new players.
``They can't be doing any worse than some of the (other) guys. We
sent Shawn Bates and Chris Taylor to Providence. Sometimes the
low-end guys suffer for the upper guys. We're going to give them an
opportunity, play them, and see how they do. We will never know
until we try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the two demoted players, Steve Heinze appears to be
headed for the biggest hit. In Friday's practice in Wilmington, he
skated on the fourth line with Ken Belanger and Peter Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dmitri Khristich) has to get going,'' said Burns. ``Heinzie,
I don't know what's going on with him. He's got to be better.
There's nothing happening right now. I've had some good talks with
him, encouraging talks with him. I've been in his corner. Sooner or
later, somebody's looking at it saying, `Why is he still out
there?' And they're not completely wrong, but he's still a guy who
might score a goal for you. We can't take him out of the lineup, I
don't think. He has to be there. If someone else is not going on
another line, we'll fill him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns isn't sure how things will go Saturday. After one period
against the Islanders, the Bruins were ahead, 2-0, and things
looked good. Then it all fell apart. Burns had a root canal
Thursday morning, but it was nothing like the root canal he was
given by his team that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys know I went to bat for them and they didn't
produce,'' said Burns. ``Everything they worked hard for and talked
about Friday was shot down in 40 minutes. Jason (Allison) had a big
game. Then, for the first time, I look at my defensemen and think,
`What's going on?' We patch up one hole and another hole happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the length of the postgame meeting with management,
Burns didn't get the impression that anyone was panicking. At least
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they think there's a crisis,'' he said. ``There
are a lot of teams behind us. I don't think it's time for panic. I
don't think it's time for major panic. All we did is change two
guys. Chris Taylor and Shawn Bates, what did they do? They just
played. With these (new) guys in the lineup, it might push some
individuals to be better or they might take our spot. There's an
opportunity to see what we've got _ let's do it. If I can get three
lines and four defense thinking the same way, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping their fortunes will turn around against Philly,
against whom he will install backup Rob Tallas in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be the solution,'' said Burns of the recalls. ``We're
going to give them a full opportunity, not one or two shifts. I
said, `Play like you're playing in Providence. Never mind my
system, play like you're playing in Providence. If it's working
down there, it might work up here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Laaksonen comes in with 42 points, 16 of them goals, in 41 games
with Providence. He is tied for the AHL lead in plus/minus at
plus-28. Mann has 46 points, 21 goals, in 43 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is a chance to play at this level and try again,''
said Laaksonen. ``You have to be confident. We have a lot of
confidence down there. When you have confidence, hopefully, it
carries on here. We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for Mann to even find out he'd been called up.
He said he slept through the six calls from coach Peter Laviolette,
who eventually had to call someone to wake him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a little tougher than the past because they're
looking for something, a spark,'' said Mann, referring to the
expectations surrounding his arrival. ``Coming in (Friday morning),
things looked pretty down. I haven't been used to that at all.
We've been having a lot of fun down there. I hope I can bring a fun
attitude, and it can be contagious. The past times I've been up,
I've played a bit and then I'd sit. It was tough to get into a
groove. If I get an opportunity this time, I can go into it with
the frame of mind that I'm not afraid to make mistakes. I'm going
to go out and play my game and work hard, and hopefully, things
will go my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas is thrilled about the challenge of facing a team on the
kind of roll the Flyers are on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said. ``This is a real good test for me. It's
a good test for all of us. I'm going to go in with a smile on my
face. It's going to be a hard, hard-fought game. I have a good
feeling about it.''

   Right wing Rob DiMaio missed practice because of back spasms. He
is expected to play Saturday . . . Anson Carter and Kyle McLaren
remain sidelined by ankle and shoulder woes, respectively. Both
will be on the trip to Western Canada that begins Tuesday night in
Edmonton, but it's unknown when they will be able to play. Carter
is the closer of the two to returning.

   NEW YORK _ All the boys were talking about her hip-revealing
Gucci skirt, as she swirled around the dance floor to the pounding
beat of a Puff Daddy CD with her best girlfriend from school.
</P>
<P>
   The guys all gaped at Nicky Hilton, a tall blonde, whose waist
and shoulders also played peekaboo in a black tube top, as she
tugged on her Patricia Fields cowboy hat, pretending to care less.
</P>
<P>
   When the music ended, she signaled to her friend, Olympia
Scarry, who was dressed every bit as stylishly _ and as skimpily _
and both teen-age girls grabbed unsuspecting boys from the crowd to
kiss them. Three minutes later, they ended the make-out sessions
and pushed the boys away, then returned to dancing with each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the sort of behavior normally seen in the ballroom of
the River Club, a staid private athletic and dining club on East
52d Street, whose members include Henry Kissinger. But when Marissa
Bregman celebrated her 16th birthday there this past November, it
 &UR; was &LR;  typical of the new wave of Sweet _ but not so innocent _ 16
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Like the extravagant bar and bas mitzvahs of the 1980s (remember
the one held on the Queen Elizabeth II?), and the return of
white-gloved debutante balls a few years later, the ante for
teen-aged entertainment has been raised again in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweet 16 party, which all but disappeared for a generation,
considered corny and unhip, has become the rage in the past three
to six months, especially among girls who go to Manhattan private
schools _ often taken to be some of the most socially precocious
teens anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are not throwbacks to an era of teen-aged innocence,
when a 16th birthday might have been celebrated over ice cream by a
dozen girlfriends. The new Sweet 16 party is a rite of onrushing
adulthood, with behavior mimicking urban sophisticates a decade or
more older. Tartan-wearing schoolgirls by day turn into
designer-clad vixens by night. They have their makeup done
professionally, their hair highlighted and blown-out at top salons
like Gils Ferrer on East 74th Street, and they even fish for
mentions in Page Six. The party for Marissa Bregman, who is a
daughter of the movie producer Martin Bregman, was a black-tie
affair for 200 with engraved invitations, preceded by several
pre-parties at the homes of teen-age friends. A
photographer-associate of Patrick McMullan, the party shutterbug
whose work appears in Vanity Fair and New York magazine, was on
hand to document the doings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the kids were young, you had swim parties and sleepovers,
but after 7 the parties stopped,'' said Gail Davidson, the mother
of Abigail Davidson, 15, who attends the Trinity School. ``I would
say, `Let's have a birthday party,' and she would say, `No, no,
no.' '' But ``suddenly,'' Ms. Davidson said, ``she wanted to have a
Sweet 16 party. Other parents with older kids said they hadn't
heard about them for years, but now they all want one.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls are asking their parents for everything from formal
parties at private clubs (one is coming up at the Friar's Club), to
parties in downtown lounges like Jet and Chaos, with price tags
that run from $5,000 to more than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bloomberg, the financial news mogul, gave his daughter
Georgina a Sweet 16 party with a deejay at City Wine and Cigar Co.
in December. The parents of Jenny Tollin, a 10th grader at the
Horace Mann School, rented out all of Planet Hollywood last
Saturday night for their daughter's Sweet 16 bash. And Alesandra
Baker, who goes to Spence, had a formal dinner in her Park Avenue
building's party room.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Raynes, 14, who attends the Dwight School and has gone to
many Sweet 16 parties lately, said, ``The rule in the whole entire
thing is that the adults totally don't care, and they can't stop
anything that's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, nice as that may sound to a teen-ager, parents still
supervise (as much as their children allow them to). Marissa
Bregman relegated her parents to the upstairs parlor of the River
Club, though every so often they came downstairs for a peek. Her
father, whose movie credits include ``Serpico'' and ``Carlito's
Way,'' looked in around 10 p.m. and said: ``Where did all these
boys come from? My daughter goes to an all-girls school.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the boys were friends of Marissa's, a sophomore at the
Spence School, who resembles a young Courtney Love, but others were
crashers, who had talked their way past security guards and handed
their coats to the French maid hanging them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to see girls,'' said Justin Belmont, who
attends the Trinity School and gave a pre-party for 20 before
Marissa's bash. Justin gave Marissa a Tiffany necklace with an
``M'' for her birthday, and said he would have brought a gang of
friends, as he usually does to Sweet 16 parties, except he's close
to the Bregman family, and ``wouldn't want to be responsible for
their actions at her party.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Hilton, who transfixed the boys with her shimmying with
Olympia Scarry, her best friend, helped Olympia plan her own Sweet
16 party late last month. It was in the Viper Room at Speed, a
dance club, and the guest list ranged from 15-year-old boys to
friends like Stefan deKwiatkowski, 28, a bona fide member of the
junior jet set that many of today's privileged teen-agers seem to
look up to.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia, a 10th grader at Convent of the Sacred Heart, arrived
near midnight dressed in black opera gloves, high heels and a
low-cut pink dress notched in the front to reveal the white slip
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Many uninvited men in their 20s tried to get into the private
Viper Room where the party was held, but they were stopped by
security guards, who were also on hand to stop teen-agers from
passing to other parts of the club where alcohol was served.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be so careful with these girls,'' one guard said.
``The way they look, they are so mature there is no way to tell the
difference between 16, 21 and 25.'' Guests over 21 were issued
lime-green wrist bands so bartenders would serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia and Nicky, who is an heir to the Hilton Hotels fortune,
both can pass for much older, and they say they have little trouble
getting into clubs or being served alcohol. They are already
familiar enough with the night scene as 10th graders to be a little
bored by it, and prefer the private Sweet 16 parties instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dresses get shorter and the legs get longer,'' said Howard
Stein, the owner of Au Bar, who has seen 16-year-olds out partying
since 1978 when he owned Xenon. ``It's a battle keeping alcohol out
of their hands all night,'' he said. ``Someone always ends up with
their knees on the cold tile of the ladies as she monopolizes a
stall.''
</P>
<P>
   Private-school girls in New York City are getting ``hotter,
sexier,'' Stein asserted. ``It's preparation for the days downtown.
They are wearing training micro dresses. You don't see a bunch of
gawky girls with buck teeth with retainers. You understand where
the term `jail bait' came from when you see these girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pamela Sicher, a child psychiatrist who practices on the
Upper East Side, said, ``The time in boys' or girls' lives in which
they become capable of reproduction is actually a time in the life
of kids, going back to primitive times, that is celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sweet 16 party today arrives when teen-agers are coming
of age faster, she said, often speeded on their way to adulthood by
willing parents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents on the privileged end of things are giving too
much and requiring too little,'' Dr. Sicher, who is on the faculty
of the Yale Child Study Center, said. ``They are providing too few
challenges. What happens is that these children later have trouble
figuring what their worth is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls are imitating something,'' she said. ``They are
identifying with their mothers or other significant figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrice Adcroft, the editor in chief of Seventeen magazine,
thinks that what precocious teen-aged girls are imitating are the
lives of young celebrities they read about and see on television
and in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in the teen-age population _ the so-called echo baby
boom _ has engendered a new A-list in popular culture, she said,
with stars of a few years ago like Demi Moore being replaced by
younger faces, including Drew Barrymore, Brandy and James
Vanderbeek (Dawson in ``Dawson's Creek''). Teen-agers identify with
these teenlike stars. ``They want to live the way stars live, or at
least have some of the things they do _ their clothes, the
partying,'' Ms. Adcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ferrari, the managing editor of Teen People, said it
was logical the Sweet 16 party would return because American
culture is celebrating its new ``youthquake.'' She said: ``For a
long time it was uncool to be a teen-ager. Teens who were born in
the '80s _ the children of the baby boomers who are teen-agers now
_ have a very different attitude about their age group. Suddenly
with this generation it's cool again, like in the '50s and '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sweet 16 party is also strong in some other circles of girls
around the city. It seems to catch on within a high school, or a
neighborhood. For several years, girls at Fontbonne Hall Academy in
TK and Bishop Kearney High School in TK, Brooklyn, have had
elaborate Sweet 16 parties, costing up to $20,000, in catering
halls, with the birthday girls dressed in Nicole Miller gowns from
Kleinfeld's, a wedding shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 150 people at Debal Gardens,'' a catering hall in
Bensonhurst, said Gina Piazza, now 18 and a freshman at Wagner
College. During her high school years, she said, ``I went to at
least 60 Sweet Sixteens.''
</P>
<P>
   Her younger sister, Vanessa, a 15-year-old and a 10th grader at
Bishop Kearney, is planning hers for July. ``I didn't book it yet,
but it has to be different than my two sisters','' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In some Hispanic communities, the Quinceanera, a traditional
coming-of-age party celebrated when a girl is 15, has been
superseded by the Sweet 16 party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Latina girls are choosing Sweet 16s. In some cases, it
may be an attempt to become more Americanized,'' said Tracy
Houseman, a math teacher at Mother Cabrini High School in
Washington Heights, adding that TK girls in her classes had had
them.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sense of teen-agers yearning for a life style that
is inappropriately grown-up, there is an innocence to today's Sweet
16 parties, an undercurrent of childishness beneath the sultry
dresses and vixenish poses. It is just as common to see girls
dancing with girls, or in circles of girls, than with boys.
</P>
<P>
   And nature is still dealing sophomore boys a raw hand compared
with girls their age. Even as Nicky, Olympia and their female
classmates seem far more grown-up than 16-year-olds of the past,
many of the boys look gawky and out of place, as if they would
rather be trading baseball cards or toggling a joystick.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa Bregman, although she wore a sultry Kenzo dress and
red-sparkle makeup to her party, applied by Mack from salon, said
she does not have a boyfriend. In her class at Spence, she said,
there are only two identifiable couples. ``I'm friends with
everyone,'' she said. ``I don't want to get involved yet. I have so
much work for school right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Both at her party and at Olympia's, very few people were seen
drinking (many were puffing away on Marlboro Lights). Olympia's
mother, Marlis Scarry, the only parent in the Viper Room that
night, bought bottles of Champagne and poured it for the teens at
midnight. ``There's nothing wrong with midnight Champagne for
16-year-olds,'' she said. ``I bought as much as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she added, ``The party really calmed me down.
The children acted so well. I can sleep better now.''

DYNAMIC DUO HAVE MADE MARK ON AMERICAN THEATER  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In calendar terms, 34 years is no time at all. In the
world of theater, it's one for the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Lanford Wilson and Marshall W. Mason worked together for the
first time in 1965, when Mason directed Wilson's ``Balm in
Gilead.'' It was the beginning of a partnership that would
encompass nearly 30 plays and lead to Tony Awards and a Pulitzer
Prize for Wilson and an Obie Award for Sustained Achievement for
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, it's quite possible that Mason, now a member of
Arizona State University's theater faculty in Tempe, Ariz., will be
on the phone with Wilson, hashing over the details of their latest
projects, of which there are several.
</P>
<P>
   It is the longest collaboration between a playwright and a
director in the history of American theater.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this month and continuing into fall, the university
celebrates the relationship with revivals of two of Wilson's early
plays and a national symposium that focuses on the duo's
contributions to the stage. If schedules permit, the event will
include a third production: the premiere of Wilson's ``Trinity'' (a
working title that may change), with Mason at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is to bring wider attention to a partnership that is
not nearly as well known outside of theater circles as it should
be,'' says Victoria Holloway, artistic director of ASU Theatre and
director of the first of the revivals, ``Lemon Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   That darkly comic look at a father-son relationship that leads
to tragedy opens Feb. 26 and will be followed in April by ``Balm in
Gilead,'' directed by Daniel Irvine, another longtime Mason
collaborator. Also in April, Wilson will be on campus to conduct a
residency with students and to workshop ``Trinity,'' a play about
the creation of the first atom bomb that, if all goes well, will
have a full production in November.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, that production will coincide with a symposium
organized by Bonnie Eckard, head of the university's theater
program, that will explore the men's legacy to world theater.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the attraction between the two, Holloway says.
Mason likes ``real plays about real people.'' Wilson creates, in
the words of the ``New York Times' '' Vincent Canby, ``recognizable
characters seen through poetic eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the hindsight of history, it's difficult to conceive of one
without the other. Mason's detailed, highly textured productions of
``The Rimers of Eldritch'' (1967), ``Hot l Baltimore'' (1973),
``Talley's Folly'' (1980), ``Fifth of July'' (1981), ``Angels
Fall'' (1983), ``The Mound Builders'' (1986) and ``Burn This'' (198
7) have defined and honed Wilson's style of lyrical realism.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the playwright's deceptively gentle _ but, in
reality, complex and perceptive _ approach to human relationships
has sharpened Mason's understanding of the intricate rhythms
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Few of his peers have Mason's skills in interpreting the play of
emotions within a family or a romance, as witnessed by his
critically acclaimed productions of ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night'' for Arizona Theatre Company and ``The Night of the Iguana''
for the university.
</P>
<P>
   The ASU festival also will take note of Mason's career outside
of his partnership with Wilson. Mason trained at the legendary
Actors Studio and has staged the premieres of more than 100 plays,
including works by Jules Feiffer, William Hoffman, John Patrick
Shanley, Corinne Jacker and Milan Sitt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Mason, 58, co-founded New York's Circle Repertory
Company with Wilson, actress Tanya Berezin and other friends.
Although no longer in existence, Circle Rep retains its justly
deserved reputation as the greatest developer of new American work
for the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Playwrights haven't been the only ones to benefit from Mason's
attentions. He discovered and nurtured the careers of many
contemporary actors, including William Hurt, Jeff Daniels, Kathy
Bates, Judd Hirsch, Lindsay Crouse, Richard Thomas, Christopher
Reeve and Trish Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Mason's schedule includes a New York revival of
``Hot l Baltimore,'' to mark the comedy's 25th anniversary, and the
world premiere of Wilson's ``Book of Days,'' which already is being
hailed as the playwright's masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Mason also has opened a Los Angeles production of William
Hoffman's ``Riga,'' a drama the two workshopped at ASU, when
Hoffman was the university's playwright-in-residence.
</P>
<P>
   Those commitments preclude Mason's early involvement in the
festival, Holloway says, and led to her directing ``Lemon Sky,''
which Wilson has admitted is inspired by his own fragmented family.
</P>
<P>
   She and Wilson are hardly strangers. They met in 1989, when the
playwright dropped in on rehearsals of her production of
``Serenading Louie'' (a play that, coincidentally, Wilson was
writing the same time as ``Lemon Sky''). Last season, the two
worked closely on the regional theater premiere of Wilson's ''A
Sense of Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to his visit to campus,'' she says.
``Aside from being a great playwright, Lanford is loads of fun.
Everyone is stimulated by his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway and Eckard are negotiating with the university's
Institute for Studies in the Arts to videotape Wilson's stay in
Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, there is no substantial footage that
documents Lanford and Marshall working together,'' Holloway says.
``That's almost criminal. We're not talking about ordinary people
here. These are two giants.'' &QL;

TEXAS PRISON OFFICIALS SEEKING WAYS TO EXPAND DEATH ROW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas may have the most well-oiled execution
machine in the nation _ putting far more condemned killers to death
and at a faster pace than any other state _ but prison officials
say they are still running out of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known for several years that at some point we were
going to run out of space,'' Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas
Board of Criminal Justice, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So Wayne Johnson, director of prisons, said he has staff
examining the possibility of expanding men's death row by splitting
it between two prison units: the current death row site at the
Ellis Unit outside Huntsville and at the Terrell Unit outside
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials already have talked about moving men's death
row to Terrell, but Johnson said that would only gain the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice about 50 more beds _ enough to take
care of needs for only about two years.
</P>
<P>
   There are 447 men and eight women awaiting execution.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions of moving death row arose as a result of a special
investigation into the Thanksgiving night escape of death row
inmate Martin Gurule and the attempted escape of six others that
same night. Gurule drowned, apparently shortly after going over the
wall. Investigators placed most of the blame on staff errors, but
they also said the 34-year-old Ellis facility's design presents
security problems that aided the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Terrell Unit has an overall capacity for 2,900
inmates, it has only 504 segregation beds _ the type of housing
Johnson said would be needed to house death row prisoners. If men's
death row is divided between two units, Johnson said the work
capable inmates would most likely be housed at one facility and all
other condemned prisoners at another.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials, however, are also examining whether the work
program for death row prisoners will be halted. Polunsky suspended
the work program as a result of the escape, but prison attorneys
are trying to determine whether federal court orders in the Ruiz
prison reform lawsuit require the agency to continue the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked for our staff ... to research the legal
implications of the work capable program and whether it can be
fully discontinued, modified or whether we are under some
obligation to continue it under its present configuration,''
Polunsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky would like to halt the work capable program, but should
TDCJ be required to continue it, he said officials are studying
putting the prisoners to work in a different type of industry.
Before the program was suspended, most of the 175 to 180
work-capable &UR;  &LR; death row prisoners labored in the garment factory at
Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we need to have a work capable program that has a
meaningful job training program, since all the participants are
obviously terminally disadvantaged,'' Polunsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said even if the work program is continued, many of the
freedoms those inmates used to get will be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said recreation time will be cut to two hours a
day _ the length that investigators recommended in their report.
Until the Gurule escape, work-capable inmates were allowed 14 hours
of recreation a day on weekdays and 10 hours on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he will make his recommendations to Wayne Scott,
executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, in
two to three weeks _ in time for the criminal justice board to
consider at its March meeting.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LEWINSKY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 70-30, a motion to subpoena
Monica Lewinsky to appear before the Senate in President Clinton's
impeachment trial. Supporters of the motion said Lewinsky's
presence in the Senate would provide senators an opportunity to
judge her credibility. Opponents said that it is time to vote on
the impeachment articles, and Lewinsky's live testimony would add
nothing new to the House prosecutors' case. A ``yes'' vote favors
the motion.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: WRITTEN
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 73-27, a motion to allow only
the written transcripts of the testimony of Lewinsky, presidential
friend Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
Supporters said they want to protect the privacy of the witnesses.
Opponents said that the public has the right to see the same
evidence as the senators including the videotapes of the
depositions. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 62-38, a motion to allow both
the videotaped testimony and written transcripts to be presented at
the impeachment trial. Supporters said the video and transcripts
are needed for a fair trial. Opponents of the motion believed that
the videotapes and transcripts are unnecessary because they yield
no new evidence. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 56-44, a motion to overlook the
final steps of the impeachment trial and go directly to closing
arguments. The motion would have put an end to the trial.
Supporters of the motion said that the trial has gone on long
enough, and a final decision needs to be made. Opponents said that
all of the evidence has not yet been heard, so the trial is not
over. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.

EARTHQUAKE IN COLOMBIA HAMPERED EFFORTS FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The powerful earthquake that struck this
country last week not only killed a thousand people and leveled an
entire city. It also dealt a significant setback to the
government's efforts to negotiate an end to more than three decades
of armed conflict with leftist guerrillas, according to political
analysts and diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
   The peace effort was already stumbling after the announcement
just days before the quake that the main rebel group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was suspending its
participation in the talks, which began on Jan. 7. But the
earthquake's chaotic aftermath has both weakened the hand of
President Andres Pastrana and distracted his government while
offering new opportunities to his adversaries on the left and
right.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who took office last August, made major concessions to
the rebels to bring them to the negotiating table, temporarily
ceding to them an area the size of Switzerland. Though the
war-weary public approved of those actions, the slow and inept
official response to the earthquake on Jan. 25 and the widespread
looting that followed have clearly damaged the government's
credibility and undermined public confidence in the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army and the police have not been able to protect us from
the vandals, and they have not been able to furnish us with the
relief supplies we need,'' Javier Cardona, an automobile mechanic
in Armenia, the city most severely affected by the quake,
complained last week. ``So tell me, how are they going to be able
to deal with the guerrillas?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Manuel Marulanda, the principal leader of the FARC, who
is known as Sureshot, was born in the earthquake zone, his forces
have never been able to make much headway there. The region is
filled with small landowners who grow coffee, rather than peasants
who work at low wages for plantation owners. And electricity,
water, schools and other public services are more plentiful than in
many other rural areas where the guerrillas have established
footholds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this part of the country, we like to work hard and make
money, not mess around with politics,'' said Gustavo Mejia, who
lives in Armenia and works at a coffee-processing plant just
outside the city. ``There's not much sympathy for the guerrillas
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colombian political analysts worry that such attitudes may
change as a result of the mishandling of disaster relief efforts.
Unless the government's performance improves, warned Maria Jimena
Duzan, a columnist for the newspaper El Espectador, ``it is going
to be difficult to prevent a space being left open in a few weeks
for Sureshot to achieve what he has never been able to do in all
his years of guerrilla struggle: open a front in coffee country.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that from happening, Pastrana has proposed spending
hundreds of millions of dollars on reconstruction efforts in
Armenia and other stricken parts of the coffee zone. But doing so
will force him to revise his plans to outflank the rebels and win
over their base of support in other areas of the countryside that
have largely been neglected by the government.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his overall strategy, Pastrana had intended to
``extend the government presence and weaken support for the
guerrillas by delivering public services'' to areas where the FARC
is strong, said Alejandro Reyes Posada, author of a study called
``The Geography of Violence in Colombia'' and a professor at the
National University here. ``But by devoting so large an amount of
resources to earthquake reconstruction, he is going to be deprived
of the opportunity to invest in peace in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, government revenues are likely to be affected as a
result of the disaster and the damage it has inflicted on the
coffee industry, one of Colombia's main sources of income. The main
coffee harvest is scheduled to begin in a few weeks and although
the crop itself was not severely damaged, many processing plants
were, and some open courts where beans are usually dried are now
occupied by families who were displaced by the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the rebels nor the right-wing paramilitary groups have
shown much willingness to grant Pastrana a truce while he and his
government struggle with earthquake relief. At the height of the
tumult in Armenia, for instance, two human rights advocates were
assassinated and four others were kidnapped, apparently by
paramilitary organizations set on intensifying their ``dirty war''
against anyone they regard as a guerrilla sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   The quake has also had an immediate impact on the military
balance of power. After the looting last week in Armenia, the
minister of defense, Rodrigo Lloreda, said an additional 6,000
troops and police officers would be sent to the earthquake zone, an
action that would stretch the ability of the Colombian military to
mount attacks against the guerrillas if the peace talks do not
resume.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The military forces are already decentralized,'' moving from
one place to another to respond to guerrilla attacks, explained
Juan Gabriel Gomez, a researcher at the Institute of Political
Studies and International Relations at the National University.
``This only disperses them further.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas were originally scheduled to withdraw from the
demilitarized zone, where they have established de facto
administrations, on Sunday. That deadline was already in jeopardy,
but the earthquake has made the withdrawal even more unlikely,
since so many troops and officers who might be needed to force the
guerrillas out are occupied with disaster relief. Colombian press
reports are predicting a postponement of several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, relations between the Pastrana administration and
the military high command, which has never shown much enthusiasm
for his decision to negotiate with the guerrillas, are quite tense
at the moment. Victor Ricardo, the head of the government's ``Peace
Commission,'' incurred their wrath when newspapers reported that he
had supplied the FARC with a document detailing links between
senior military officers and paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 30 statement, a group of senior officers said they
found it ``extremely odd'' that official documents should end up
``in the hands of an armed group that exists outside the law'' and
complained of ``defamations, accusations and insults, both personal
and institutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The document concluded by announcing that ``today more than
ever, we generals and admirals find ourselves cohesive in strategy
and goals,'' with an ``unshakable commitment'' to ``the defense of
the sovereignty, independence and integrity of national
territory.''

DISGRACED BROKER ADMITS FRAUD, CONSIPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former investment broker Arthur Good pleaded guilty
Friday to 43 counts of wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering
in a scam prosecutors said ``ruined uncounted lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, 51, appeared before US District Judge Edward F. Harrington
and sat staring at his hands while assistant US attorney Stephen
Huggard detailed what he has called one of the biggest investment
scams in Massachusetts history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He defrauded the young; he defrauded the old,'' Huggard said.
``He defrauded the rich; he defrauded the poor. He defrauded
strangers; he defrauded lifelong friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme, a classic Ponzi operation that ran from 1996 to
1998, collected more than $20 million from investors who believed
Good was putting their money into a no-risk, high-return trading
program, Huggard said.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact the money was never invested. Instead, Good conned
investors into thinking they were getting big returns by giving
some of them payments that he had actually collected from other
investors. He kept more than $7 million for himself, Huggard said.
</P>
<P>
   The money ``unfortunately has probably disappeared into Mr.
Good's lifestyle,'' Huggard said. ``He lived very, very well on the
backs of an awful lot of people who trusted him.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, who will be sentenced in April, faces six to eight years
in prison under terms of a deal negotiated with the US attorney in
exchange for his cooperation. Good agreed to help authorities build
cases against an unknown number of co-conspirators. If he hadn't
cooperated, federal guidelines dictate a sentence as long as 12
years, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, ``this is a a very long sentence for a white-collar
crime,'' said US Attorney Donald K. Stern. ``The investigation is
ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Good told the judge he ``accepted full responsibility'' for the
crimes. He agreed to turn over $3 million in cash, his home in the
pricey Hospital Hill section of Quincy, Mass.,and half a dozen
luxury cars, including three identical BMW sedans _ one blue, one
black, one silver.
</P>
<P>
   Good was released on his own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they continue to look for cash and other assets
that might be hidden in foreign bank accounts. But they added it's
not likely bilked investors will get much of their money back, even
after Good's assets are liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frankly not optimistic that victims are going to get
anything back but pennies on the dollar,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Good's scheme came to light only after some of Good's former
clients complained to the state Securities Division that he had
mishandled their accounts. Division investigators said they
discovered a web of deceptions that ultimately led them to the
Ponzi scheme. They turned it over to the FBI, the IRS, and the US
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators working on the case said that by early January
they had identified at least 100 victims from all walks of life.
They had lost sums ranging from $10,000 to $1 million. As the case
has been publicized in the past month, however, the number of
victims has nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get at least four or five calls a day,'' Huggard said.
``It's impossible to say how many are still out there.''

<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Kathy Passanisi stood before more than 100
managers at Bausch &AMP; Lomb headquarters here and asked one of them
what he would say if his son came home with spiked green hair and a
cluster of earrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're starting to look more like your mother,'' came the
reply.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Passanisi paused, then, dropping to a whisper, warned, ``Do
not try to be funnier than me.''
</P>
<P>
   She needn't have worried. As a chorus of laughter subsided,
dozens of managers in her audience again leaned forward intently,
brows furrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter is serious business to executives here, as
traditionally staid companies are hiring ``humor consultants'' like
Ms. Passanisi to invigorate employees stunned by increasing demands
and rapidly changing technology. Banks, phone and computer
companies, government agencies and insurance companies _ precisely
the businesses that would seem the least receptive _ are among the
new clients.
</P>
<P>
   These consultants are not being hired just to entertain. Their
goal is to teach executives that laughter will work wonders in
communicating with employees, perhaps helping them overcome fear of
the boss.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it can help keep workers healthy, the consultants
insist, and they back that up by tossing around fancy words like
``eustress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Passanisi began her lecture by discussing the difference
between eustress _ a positive stress often sparked by laughter or
satisfying work _ and its darker cousin, distress. And she warned
the executives that their behavior and manner could create positive
or negative stress depending on how they reacted to humor.
</P>
<P>
   Like many consultants interviewed, she insisted that laughter
was inevitable _ that jokes would always be told. But if they are
not being told to executives, she said, they are often being told
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating how she used humor to play off tough situations,
Ms. Passanisi donned the 22-inch crab hat that is a hallmark of her
lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a little crabby today,'' she said. ``Does it
show?''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dunkelblaugh, a psychologist and management consultant, said:
``Humor is a tough sell. It's one of those things that everybody
believes in but nobody wants to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   But humor is, in fact, selling, especially in the computer
industry, where business is booming but the topics at conferences
are often dry and the language is full of technical jargon. Ms.
Passanisi charges $5,000 an hour for her presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Humor, to be sure, will never take over corporate America. But
at least in seminars, humor is all the rage, and ``the message has
been accepted by a lot of strait-laced companies,'' said John
Morreall, a Tampa, Fla., management consultant who talks about
using humor to sustain employee health and foster a collegial
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Many consultants say humor, to the extent it helps deal with
stress in the workplace, can be used to combat rising health care
costs and problems retaining creative talent in a tight job market.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter is now even discussed at IBM's Palisades Executive
Conference Center, a cathedral to management education just up the
river from Manhattan in Palisades, N.Y., where senior executives
attend four-day seminars. Since 1996, the programs have included
Morreall as a keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Just five years ago, the idea of putting a humor consultant in
front of 500 executives at the IBM center would have been, well,
laughable, said Marion Atwater, program director for marketing and
advertising at the IBM Advanced Business Institute, which runs the
seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never would have featured a humorist because it wouldn't
have been in sync,'' Ms. Atwater said. ``It wouldn't have had the
audience appeal. If you go back and say, `What were the audience
expectations, late '80s, early '90s?' it wasn't step back and have
a laugh, it was get in your Porsche and drive as fast as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations of conference-goers are changing, consultants
say, as some American workers set different goals, with more
emphasis on leisure and reducing stress than on getting dump trucks
full of cash. Many of those workers cannot easily forget the days
when intense competition from overseas and a wave of corporate
layoffs made it hard to sit back and have a good chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``America got a wake-up call,'' said Terry Paulson, a
psychologist and professional lecturer. ``What leaders did was say,
`Enough having fun, let's get back to making money, downsizing and
adding value.' They didn't take humor seriously. Now we're
realizing the value.''
</P>
<P>
   The client lists of humor consultants are just one indication
that some companies that used to think of laughing as goofing off
are beginning to value humor. Ms. Passanisi gets repeat business
from SBC Services Inc., the San Antonio company responsible for
uniting phone companies in the Southwest. Paulson has made
presentations for the Federal Reserve Board, Charles Schwab,
Fidelity Investments and the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Even without calling in consultants, some business leaders in
notoriously dull industries are trying to pep up their employees
with humor.
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, president of Year2000 Partnership.com Inc., a
company working on the millennium computer problem, has put up
$6,000 to sponsor a contest for jokes about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a bunch of kids around a campfire who've scared
ourselves so badly that we can't get to sleep,'' said de Jager, who
thinks it is funny that he has been asked to give a Year 2000
presentation in September 1999 when everyone else is panicked about
it now. ``This is dull, boring, monotonous work, and unless we take
a step back, we're going to burn out. It's hard to laugh about this
stuff, but we can.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   De Jager can, at least. ``How many Year 2000 programmers does it
take to screw in a light bulb?'' he asks. ``None, it isn't broken
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Further down the corporate food chain, a little playfulness is
making a comeback after the corporate fretfulness of the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   John Garbo, director of Clinical Data Resources at Daughters of
Charity National Health Systems in St. Louis, appreciates this.
During the time the sun is shining on weekdays, his charges can be
found in a basement staring at numbers on computer screens. Except
before meetings, when they blow soap bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts me in a better mood so that I can be more responsive
to my employees' ideas,'' Garbo said. ``If I forget to blow bubbles
sometime, I hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Management professionals are encouraging the bubble-blowing and
other levity because even the top salaries are sometimes not enough
to attract creative people to jobs, such as writing software, that
are often filled with tedium.
</P>
<P>
   And as managers try to link manufacturers, technicians and
administrators, and the line between manufacturing and service
companies blurs, computer companies in particular have been ravaged
by ``change, change, change all the time,'' said Carol Schoenfeld,
director of executive education programs at the IBM Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark International Inc., a computer printing-products company
in Lexington, Ky., hired Ms. Passanisi for seminars during a period
the company called re-engineering, which often involves large-scale
reorganization of work and has sometimes been used as a code word
for downsizing. The ``r'' word ``brings fear to a lot of people, so
we had to use humor to get people ready,'' said Wayne Cornelius,
the company's manager of education. ``Having the medical research
gives us some idea that what we're doing is not frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Spotting frazzled nerves, it is easy and instinctive for some
executives to nudge burned-out workers to tell jokes. That much
done, the next selling point for humor consultants is helping to
plan corporate humor they cannot be sued for. Because so much of
what is funny is sexual by nature, even the naturally lighthearted
have reason to play it safe and stay unfunny at work, where sexual
harassment lawsuits are an overhanging threat.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants peddling productive humor stress that a relaxing
atmosphere, in which laughter is acceptable, will really take hold
only if it comes from the top. At Southwest Airlines, the flight
attendants sometimes sing their seat belt instructions, dropping to
a whisper to tell passengers the airplane will be moving
``veryveryfast.'' Humor consultants credit Herbert Kelleher, the
airline's screwball founder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most committed humor consultants acknowledge
that there are many situations that are simply not amenable to
their brand of management advice. Morreall remembers a lesson he
learned on a cold February morning at Genesee Brewing Co. here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use humor as a piece of candy to resolve your
hunger,'' Morreall said. ``These guys were damn resentful. Some of
them turned their bodies 90 degrees to avoid looking at me.''

ECONOMY GENERATES JOBS AT FAST PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US economy continued to generate jobs at a breakneck pace,
adding 245,000 new jobs in January and holding the unemployment
rate to a very low 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Strong hiring across all lines of business, particularly
services, pushed unemployment to historic lows for black and
Hispanic workers, two groups which have chronically suffered from
high joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly jobs report released Friday by the Department of
Labor indicates ``accelerating momentum'' in the job market, said
Richard DeKaser, chief economist for BankBoston Corp. ``Persistence
and a full year with the unemployment rate under 5 percent is
beginning to lift all ships,'' and minority workers ``are enjoying
the benefits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate overall, at 4.3 percent, was unchanged
from December, the government said. But joblessness among Hispanics
fell a full percentage point, to 6.6 percent in January, its lowest
rate since the government began keeping such statistics in the
early 1970s, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment among blacks was 7.8 percent; although down only
0.1 percentage points from December's level, the rate for blacks
has fallen sharply from levels a year ago of 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The favorable employment report comes a week after the federal
government reported that the economy bounded ahead at a 5.6 percent
annual rate in the October-December quarter of 1998. For the year,
gross domestic product grew by 3.9 percent, matching 1997's growth.
With one-third of the world in recession, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan has reffered to the United States as an ``oasis of
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   And the good news rolls on: Wages for both low-wage and minority
workers were up last year, according to a report released this week
by the White House. Even the manufacturing sector, which shrank
dramatically last year, picked up in December, as orders for
manufactured goods rose 2.3 percent, to $343.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ever-ready economy,'' said Nancy Kimelman, a senior
economist for Thompson Global Markets in Boston. Strong job gains,
she said, indicate ``not just a rapid rate of growth now and in the
recent past but a healthy dose of optimism about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the manufacturing sector lost jobs last month due to
softness in exports of goods to Asian and other countries in the
midst of deep recession. However, the 13,000 decline in employment
in smoke-stack industries was not as deep as the average 20,000
monthly job losses seen, on average, in 1998, noted Denis
McSweeney, BLS regional commissioner in Boston. Manufacturers have
given up 285,000 jobs since last March.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the manufacturing slump, Kimelman said, ``We have
an economy that is moving ahead at speeds that break the sound
barrier, yet the economy isn't even firing on all cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had previously reported that job gains in
December were 387,000; that was revised downward to 298,000 _ still
a fast clip, and still more than the 245,000 jobs added in January.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest producer of jobs last month was again the service
industry, which accounted for nearly half _ 114,000 _ of new
employment. Engineering and management services for business
accounted for 44,000 of those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry hired 15,000 workers in January, a
month when the weather tends to put a chill on hiring. Low interest
rates and warm weather continued to encourage home building and
home buying. Construction has added 184,000 jobs since September.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were also made in the retail industry (30,000 jobs);
financial, insurance and real estate (22,000); retail (30,000); and
health services (6,000).

NASA REARRANGES SHUTTLE FLIGHT SCHEDULE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA has juggled shuttle launch plans for this year because of
delays in preparing a large orbiting X-ray observatory and in
Russia's service module, a component of the new international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   The changes cut to five from six the number of shuttle flights
planned for the year. The first mission will be launched from
Kennedy Space Center in Florida in late May rather than early
April.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery will launch May 20 with a crew of seven to
stow supplies aboard the new space station and install exterior
cargo cranes.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra Advanced X-Ray Observatory, the most powerful
telescope of its kind, will follow July 9. Veteran astronaut Eileen
Collins, the first woman to command a spaceflight, will lead a crew
of five.
</P>
<P>
   Recent problems with the electronic circuitry in the Chandra's
command and telemetry system forced a delay in plans to launch the
observatory in April. Previous difficulties with the spacecraft's
software prompted a delay from an August 1998 lift-off.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope was flown Thursday to Kennedy from its production
facility at TRW Space and Electronics Group in Redondo Beach,
Calif. Technicians will install replacement circuitry at Kennedy
while the telescope undergoes launch preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The only flight not changed is the Sept. 16 launch of the
shuttle Endeavour with a large radar system installed in the cargo
bay. A half-dozen astronauts will use the radar gear to produce a
three dimensional map of much of the Earth's surface on a mission
sponsored by the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month delay in Russia's plans to launch the new
international station's first living quarters, the service module,
has caused the greatest disruption to shuttle station assembly
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis is now to blast off Oct. 14, more than two months late,
with a crew of five astronauts, and supplies to equip the service
module for the station's first resident crew. An American and two
Russians are to arrive early next year for a stay of several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery will fly the final mission of the year, lifting off
Dec. 2 with a crew of seven, and the station's first section of
external framework, its steering gyros and docking equipment for
the outpost's first U.S. power-generating solar arrays. Previously,
the mission had been scheduled for an October lift-off
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Russian officials plan meetings during the next two
months to assess the readiness of the service module. Additional
delays in its launch from Central Asia would force delays in the
last two shuttle flights of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial problems have been responsible for a
succession of launch delays in the service module. Initially, it
was to launch in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first two components of the international station were
launched and joined in Earth orbit late last year.

<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. _ At the same time that Rep. Asa Hutchinson
was in Washington, deposing Vernon Jordan and otherwise helping his
fellow House impeachment managers further the case against
President Clinton, Vicki Young was nursing a bitter cup of coffee
at the Grapevine Restaurant, plotting her congressman's political
demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's completely clear that what the Republicans and
Asa Hutchinson want is vengeance, not justice,'' said the
45-year-old former auditor for a local automotive supplier who has
become a fledgling anti-impeachment activist in recent weeks.
``They are very wrong in thinking people will forget what they've
done. I honestly think it's going to go against them in the next
election.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, in the face of poll after poll showing overwhelming
sentiment for a rapid end to the impeachment process, Hutchinson
and the other House managers have insisted that they felt
duty-bound to pursue impeachment to its fullest conclusion. If
there is a political price to be paid for this, they said, they
will just have to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's supporters say they are confident that the popular
congressman, who has played a high-profile role in the proceedings
_ both on the Senate floor and before the television cameras
outside the Senate _ will safely overcome any lingering discontent
over impeachment before re-election time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But many Arkansas Democrats are not so sure. They smell blood in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   And they point to such things as the emergence of Vicki Young, a
political novice who was so incensed by Hutchinson's role in the
impeachment that she has taken it upon herself to organize meetings
to build a grass-roots movement to do something about it, as an
indication that the final bill presented to the House managers in
2000 may just prove higher than some of them can pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's hard to say if his role in the impeachment will
hurt him,'' said Ann Harbison, the Democratic Party chairwoman for
Washington County, the second most populous in the district.
``Hutchinson is enormously popular. But I think it's safe to say
that we will field a strong, well-financed candidate against him in
2000. There is a feeling that he may be vulnerable now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor and Arkansas Republican
Party leader, is in his second term representing the state's 3rd
Congressional District, which encompasses the northwest corner of
Arkansas. Whites make up 96 percent of the district's population,
and it is the fastest growing and the most Republican part of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton narrowly carried the district in 1992, winning 43
percent to 42 percent for President George Bush, and narrowly lost
it in 1996, when it went 45 percent to 44 percent for former Sen.
Bob Dole. Indeed, Republicans have represented the district since
1966, usually with little significant opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Hutchinson won the seat to succeed his brother, Tim,
who was elected to the U.S. Senate that year. Asa Hutchinson won 56
percent of the vote in the 1996 general election. The Democrats did
not run anyone against him in 1998 and he was easily re-elected,
winning 80.8 percent of the vote to a reform candidate's 19.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks local Democratic leaders, spurred by state party
officials, began reaching out to several potential candidates, and
said they hoped to announce something solid soon.
</P>
<P>
   But even those most eager to capitalize on the congressman's
potential vulnerability acknowledge that it will be an uphill
battle for the Democrats to recapture the district. And many
independent observers agree.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Moseley, the editorial page editor of The Southwest Times
Record in Fort Smith, the district's largest city, said that almost
every letter the paper received from readers before Hutchinson's
appearance in the Senate in January as one of 13 House managers in
the impeachment trial had praised him.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, letters criticizing the congressman's
impeachment role began to arrive in increasing numbers, Moseley
said, and the sentiment now seems to be running about 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost no one criticized him before this, so there's no doubt
that it's hurt him,'' Moseley said. ``But this is a very
conservative Republican district, so I expect he'll continue to
represent it in Congress despite all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Art English, a political-science professor at the University of
Arkansas, said that while he suspects that impeachment sentiments
in the district are pretty much in line with the rest of the
country, he does not think this means that Republicans will turn
against their congressman. ``I'd be very surprised if that turns
out to be the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clyde Hawkins, the Democratic Party's chairman in Scott
County, in the southern part of the district, says he does not
believe the party has a chance of unseating Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I think he's getting high praise for the way he's
done his job during this, at least that's what I'm hearing in this
part of the district,'' Hawkins said. ``Frankly, I don't think we
can touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have responded to Hutchinson's critics with a series
of radio advertisements saying that ``some people still believe in
truth and justice,'' and ending with a simple, ``Thank you, Asa.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gray, who runs the congressman's district office in
Fayetteville, says he has been amazed by the wave of calls the
office has received during the impeachment proceedings, especially
last fall, when the House was considering the impeachment issue,
and in January, when it came before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had something like 1,100 calls in October about impeachment
in this one office alone,'' he said. ``And they were pretty well
split on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young finished her coffee and looked around the otherwise
empty back room at the Grapevine Restaurant in Paris, Ark., a small
town in Logan County, at the southern edge of the 3rd District.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got so angry about this impeachment dragging on and on
that I called the state party officials and asked, `What can I
do?''' she said. She was advised to call friends, organize meetings
and build an organization.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen people attended the first meeting at the Grapevine
a few weeks ago. A second gathering is scheduled for next Monday
night. State party officials will drive over from Little Rock to
speak to them, Ms. Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking this one step at a time,'' she said. ``But we're
not giving up. They have been unfair to the president and they're
going to pay for it.''

KUDOS FOR CUOMO AND HIS WORK AT HUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 07, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years is a long time to be in the same Cabinet regime, by
Washington standards. So Andrew Cuomo, after four years as an
assistant secretary and now two years into his own reign as boss of
Housing and Urban Development, has to be a grizzled veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo only recently decided to shelve any ambition he had to run
for the seat being vacated next year by US Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the other Twin Tower of the New York Democrats when the
secretary's father, Mario the Eloquent, was governor of New York
for a 12-year skein.
</P>
<P>
   You need upwards of $10 million, maybe twice that, to win a
Senate seat in New York, and to raise that, Cuomo would have had to
fold his bureaucrat's tent and work the phone-and-flattery route
full time. So he's sticking to his trade _ finding housing for poor
people and working families _ for the final two years of Clinton,
and maybe for something down the line if Al Gore gets promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Since no Cuomo is a slouch when it comes to political
philosophizing, Andrew C. has a simple articulation for what ails
the Big Two political parties, beginning with his own Democrats:
``Ultimately, the vindication of progressive politics will come
only when people believe the government is competent. The voters
have heard the beautiful articulation of goals; they agree with us
on the goals, of community, of mutuality.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats of the Big Government '60s screwed up in the
delivery, he concedes. ``The problem is, we frustrated people, and
lost them with the perceived failures of government.'' His own
agency _ HUD _ ``was the poster child for failed government.''
</P>
<P>
   He alluded to the recent stink over the Boston Housing
Authority's takeover of the Bromley-Heath housing project after the
tenant management group was found lacking and police made arrests
for organized drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston, they believe public housing is a failure'' when
people hear of problems in the projects, Cuomo said. ``Until we as
Democrats can match the beautiful articulation of the goals with
defensible, sensible means, we don't win.'' Voters will not trust
the Democratic Party's nostrums about governing, he says, ``until
you have the progressive vehicles'' that work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is doing the best he can at this time. What he
understands _ as any good politician understands _ is you can only
do as much as the people allow you to do. My premise is, can you
get the people to let you do more; they'll give you the money if
they are confident you know how to spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy of the Clinton era created a downdraft for
the families closest to the bottom. Housing costs everywhere went
up. But the federal government's role in creating new housing was
drastically curtailed beginning in the Reagan era, when mistrust of
government grew _ ``Government is the problem,'' Reagan argued in
his first inaugural _ and money for housing subsidies and
construction began to dry up.
</P>
<P>
   HUD today has about 2 million housing units, most in cities such
as New York, Chicago, Boston, and Los Angeles. With so many of the
GOP congressmen coming from Southern and Western districts,
``People in public housing are naturally not in their
constituencies,'' said Cuomo. Many of the GOP congressmen minted in
the Gingrich Revolution of '94 ``didn't have any public housing''
to speak of in their districts, and were not interested in funding
those old Big Government programs.
</P>
<P>
   But now 5.3 million American families are ``underhoused,''
according to HUD studies. Rents will rise as the economy flies.
``We didn't build any affordable housing for 10 or 15 years,''
Cuomo said. That has begun to change, with even conservative
Republican congressmen coming around to the belief that it is
political suicide to vote against programs that build housing in an
era when population growth demands much more new construction.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leaders in Congress are held captive by what Cuomo
asserts is ``a truly radical fringe. But they are a very powerful
radical fringe, much more powerful than the left ever was in the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The radical right-wingers calling the GOP shots in Congress and
in the broad grass-roots organizations ``are a much smaller, much
more intense group, yet they control the whole show.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said he believes Senate majority leader Trent Lott ``is
afraid of them. . . . It is fascinating how they control the party
agenda.'' The GOP's impeachment drive has derailed legislative
consideration of many issues, he argued, ``but that suits them just
fine. This is another shutdown of the government, only they can't
do it like they did last time, with a lockout. Now they do it with
a ruse.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the nation's capital is ``a town obsessed with
misdeeds. It is not a pursuit of justice, but pursuit of injustice.
They don't want to go near any of these concepts of social justice
and government, they stay consumed with apparent criminal justice
over a sex act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans ``swore to eliminate HUD'' but had to bow to
political reality and restore funding for many housing programs,
Cuomo said. ``Politically, they lost the stick they used to beat us
over the head with.'' How? HUD implemented many of the changes
critics claimed were essential. ``I admitted the need for reform;
we had a crackdown on bad landlords, booted out bad tenants. At
that point, public housing didn't work. We didn't go on throwing
good money after bad. We ended the rip-offs. And we went from being
just the poor people's department to one for the working poor, and
the lower middle class.''
</P>

   HUD is now ``a success story,'' claims Cuomo, with even some
Republican critics admitting that the retooling of the creaky
department has increased efficiency and decreased the petty
corruption that had dogged it for years.

SENATORS MAP EFFORT TO CENSURE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans and Democrats tinkered Friday
with drafts of a censure resolution condemning President Clinton
for misleading the nation and hampering federal investigations into
the White House sex and cover-up scandal.
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a key author of a
Democratic-led censure resolution, said she had 21 co-sponsors for
her resolution and ``a number of Republicans who are interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive to end the impeachment trial by the end of next week
could be threatened by a funeral for Jordan's ailing King Hussein,
who remained on life support late Friday. A number of senators have
said they would attend a funeral for the ailing monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was in recess Friday as House prosecutors and White
House lawyers prepared to present their final evidence in the case
Saturday. Both sides said they would use excerpts of videotaped
testimony from former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to censure the president after the conclusion of the
impeachment trial grew as a Republican plan _ to adopt a ``finding
of fact'' _ dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The finding of fact would put the Senate on record as concluding
that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice in trying
to conceal his affair with Lewinsky. By contrast, a censure
resolution would reprimand the president.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and supporters of the president agreed that House
prosecutors have not persuaded two-thirds, or 67, of the senators
to approve the articles of impeachment and remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said that under the censure proposal, Clinton would
not be required to sign the measure or pay a fine, a suggestion
that was floated early in the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was working on the resolution with Sens. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., among others.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said the censure resolution should
``indicate that we believe this is just plain wrong _ that it is
harmful to the nation and doesn't set the kind of example that we
expect from the No. 1. citizen.'' Chafee said he expected
bipartisan support for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who supports a censure of the
president, predicted the proposal ``should have bipartisan
support,'' adding: ``If we can do that quickly and don't get caught
up in parliamentary snafus, I think it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., said he hoped the number of
senators participating in the drafting process would expand in
coming days so that ``we will have had a broad base of support.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is being designed to avoid legal terms such as
``perjury'' and ``obstruction of justice'' in favor of making a
``clear and unequivocal'' condemnation of the president's conduct,
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure, again, that the failure to remove this
president ... not be misunderstood as a vindication of his
behavior,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said ``a tough censure resolution''
would signal that senators ``who are voting to acquit will also be
highly critical of the president's conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said she was open to ``other
options that are still in the works'' to repudiate Clinton's
actions without conviction and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got to make sure that there is not a
misinterpretation of a vote to acquit the president by not getting
two-thirds of a majority to convict him,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the president
continued to believe that a congressional censure for his behavior
would be ``appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The censure drive nonetheless faced an uphill effort to persuade
skeptical senators.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the Constitution does not give
the Senate authority to punish an impeached president ``beyond
ouster and prohibition from a further office.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said that senators will have ample opportunity to
condemn the president's behavior in their closing statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend beyond
ouster and disqualification from future office-holding,'' Specter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Senate meets its timetable of a final vote on
impeachment by next Friday, the issue may linger until later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and others have
threatened a filibuster against a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate acquits Clinton on Friday and then takes up a
censure motion, Gramm and other presumably would announce their
filibuster. A motion to end the filibuster would require 60 votes
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Although there may be enough votes to shut down the filibuster,
Senate rules require a 48-hour delay between the time the motion is
made and the vote on whether to end the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Senate is planning a week-long recess to honor
Presidents Day, the lawmakers might not get around to the business
of the censure resolution until the week of Feb. 22.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The word ``sprawl'' does not even appear in the
index of ``Earth in the Balance,'' Vice President Al Gore's earnest
1992 treatise on the environment. But these days that word _ which
embraces a set of creeping suburban problems from traffic
congestion to loss of open space _ has emerged as one of the
reigning buzzwords in the political lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians as diverse as Gore and Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey have made the issue a priority, and voters around the nation
have shown their concern in the most tangible way that taxpayers
can, by passing billions of dollars in bond measures to buy and
preserve undeveloped land and approving ballot measures intended to
slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl, in sum, is the new language of environmentalism. It is
seen by political strategists as perhaps the best way to engage
voters in a debate that had become more abstract over the last two
decades as regulation curbed many of the most egregious
environmental abuses, from pesticides to pollution, that had
animated suburbanites in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The new debate is being driven by some of the same concerns that
inspired the original movement, but now the length of a commuter's
daily drive is increasingly seen as an environmental issue like
chlorofluorocarbons or global warming. And political strategists
say that the voters who are most concerned about these issues _
suburban women _ are a voting group that helps decide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a period of prosperity, it's not about how much we have;
it's about how we hold our lives together,'' said Alex Castellanos,
a Republican political consultant who has worked for candidates in
states like Texas and Florida and helped spread the concept of the
soccer mom. ``So all these quality-of-life issues, from health care
to the environment, come to the fore. A lot of it is the
feminization of politics. The warrior of the suburban jungle is the
mom out there in her suburban assault vehicle, and there's no oasis
for her, no place for her to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Joe Six-Pack is not concerned about green space, he is
not the dominant force on the spectrum anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With its Teddy Roosevelt-style emphasis on conservation in the
classic sense, the fight against untrammeled sprawl finds an
equally comfortable place in Gore's emerging presidential campaign
theme of ``practical idealism'' and in the ``compassionate
conservative'' mantra of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And although
it has not emerged as a top-tier issue like education or crime in
public opinion surveys, it is steadily gaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Ventura County, just west of here, voters in November
overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative called SOAR _ for Save
Open Space and Agricultural Resources _ which will force every
proposed development that requires a zoning change to be approved
by a public referendum. Similar measures were passed in four
individual cities within the county, just one beachhead among some
200 measures worth $7 billion that passed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Whitman successfully pressed for $1 billion
in borrowing to set aside half the state's remaining 2 million
acres of open space over the next 10 years. Voters overwhelmingly
approved the measure in November.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide survey last year by the Public Policy Institute of
California found that more than a quarter of Californians saw
population growth and development as a big problem in their region
_ hardly a surprise in a state that is expected to add 18 million
more people, an entire New York state, to its current population of
more than 32 million people by the year 2025. In the San Francisco
Bay area, where Silicon Valley has fueled a boom, nearly 40 percent
of respondents saw growth as a major problem, while a third of
residents statewide saw transportation and traffic congestion as a
big problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue which, on the surface, seems like a very
policy-wonk kind of thing,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director
for the nonpartisan institute. ``But there's a lot of public
sentiment and concern about the everyday annoyance of sprawl and
growth, and the long-range problems associated with air pollution
and environmental degradation. And, after all, most Californians do
live in suburban regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how suburban is defined, so do about half of all
Americans, and the sprawl issue is increasingly seen as a way for
politicians like Gore to take the lingering elitist tinge off
environmentalism and cast it in terms readily apparent to average
voters. In its current budget proposal, the Clinton administration
is seeking more than $1 billion in new spending to help local
governments preserve open space, ease traffic congestion and
promote environmentally sensitive economic development as part of a
``livability agenda.'' And it seeks another $1 billion for a
``lands legacy initiative'' to preserve parklands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an upscale issue in the sense that if you're worried
about your basic material well-being, you don't have so much time
to be worried about your quality of life,'' said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster in Washington who said he saw increasing
interest in the issue among political clients. ``But once you pass
that threshold, even in rural areas, where family farms are
threatened by development, this is really an issue that cuts across
the board for folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting just how much steam a given issue may have in an
election, much less a presidential contest still more than a year
off, is notoriously difficult, and an economic downturn could
quickly relegate sprawl to back-burner status. But Mellman notes
that many of the congressional seats in swing districts are
centered in suburban areas, so the issue could well loom large in
local contests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because most land-use decisions are the province of
cities, counties and states, it is not entirely clear what role the
federal government may play. In announcing the administration's
initiative last month, Gore took pains to say that the government
should not act as ``beauty commissar'' but should instead provide
financial incentives _ like transportation aid _ for localities to
work together.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moe, who was chief of staff to Vice President Walter
Mondale and is now president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in Washington, said that although sprawl was often
portrayed as the natural free-market consequence of normal and
desirable growth, the reality was that government action at all
levels had effectively subsidized it for years, by actions as
simple as building federal office buildings on the outer edges of
cities instead of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``State policy is the single most important factor in trying to
deal with this issue, and there's not a one-size-fits-all
solution,'' said Moe, an author of the book ``Changing Places:
Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl'' (Henry Holt, 1998).
``Sprawl is affecting people much more directly, in terms of air
quality, visual blight, all these manifestations. It's hitting
people right in the face and they see it and know it and don't like
it. They're not quite clear what needs to be done, but they know
that the way we're doing it is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to the National Press Club in Washington, Moe
ticked off a litany of sprawl's reach: Since 1950, Pennsylvania has
lost more than 4 million acres of farmland, an area larger than
Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, while metropolitan Phoenix
now covers some 600 square miles, an area larger than Delaware. By
at least some estimates, in the next half century sprawl is
expected to consume more than 3.5 million acres of California's
Great Central Valley, the nation's greengrocer.
</P>
<P>
   If sprawl is often couched as a motherhood issue, not every
group approves of efforts to limit it. The National Association of
Home Builders has warned that it will fight any efforts to limit
new federal money for infrastructure like roads. In at least some
cases, developers have successfully co-opted anti-sprawl efforts.
In Arizona, for example, a measure narrowly passed last fall that
would set aside $20 million a year for 11 years to buy open space,
in exchange for a ban on development fees and restrictions on urban
growth.
</P>
<P>
   And Castellanos, the Republican consultant, said Gore could be
hurt by any sign that he still subscribed to a ``fairly '60s style
environmental agenda,'' and he insisted that the Republicans' most
important issue was the high taxes that forced families to work
longer hours to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to quality of life, you can either give someone
a park to go to or you can give her more time to go to the park,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Mellman, the Democratic pollster, said it would be
possible for Democrats to attack Republican candidates who seemed
too willing to allow unbridled development. But he added: ``I think
it's really an issue that unites more than it divides. It goes to
the question, Can you understand and articulate the kinds of
concerns that people have in their lives? This is an opportunity to
do that.''

WORKING: HOW TO BREAK THE CHAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 7)  
(lb) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I work for a lawyer who has become very abusive. He tells
clients that I am messing up their cases and losing paperwork. He
alternately curses me and calls me ``dear.'' At the same time, he
is constantly giving me small gifts.
</P>
<P>
   I am seeking other employment, but he has tried to stop me. Now
he insists that we walk out of the office together so that other
lawyers in the building can see that he, in his words, owns me. His
best effort at flattery was to tell me jokingly that if I left, he
would die.
</P>
<P>
   I know he has behaved this way toward former female employees,
but since he is a sole practitioner and I am the only employee,
there's no way for me to go over his head. Any advice?
</P>
<P>
   A. Get out. Your boss sounds not just abusive, but downright
creepy. Even if his more bizarre statements are in jest, his
fixation on you seems decidedly unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things he's doing come close to being physically
dangerous _ walking her out and making subtle threats,'' said
Cindia Cameron, organizing director of 9 to 5, National Association
of Working Women, which is based in Milwaukee. You should check the
hours that your building has a security guard on duty, Ms. Cameron
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In finding a new job _ and in surviving in the meantime when
there are only two of you _ you face an especially sticky
situation. First, make sure you have calmly told your boss exactly
what behavior you find so objectionable. Then, if you still have
to, put your points in writing and present them to him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cameron advises being as specific as possible. ``There's no
point in saying, `Your behavior is making me crazy,''' she said.
Instead, ask your boss to refrain from giving you presents, calling
you ``dear'' and criticizing you in front of clients.
</P>
<P>
   Save a copy of your note at home. If the situation worsens and
you resign before finding other work, the documentation could help
you collect unemployment insurance benefits. ``She would have a
viable argument that she didn't quit per se, but was really forced
to quit in terms of how he treated her,'' said Doris Ng, a lawyer
for Equal Rights Advocates, an advice and counseling organization
based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Because your boss seems intent on sabotaging your job search,
try to keep him in the dark about where you're looking. Should
potential employers ask for references, simply explain that you
can't list your current boss because he does not want you to leave,
Ms. Cameron advised.
</P>
<P>
   As for your rights, legal action doesn't sound like a choice at
this point. ``There's no law against being a jerky boss,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although your workplace certainly sounds hostile, whether your
boss' behavior rises to the level of sexual harassment is open to
question, Ms. Ng explained. ``There doesn't seem to be any quid pro
quo involved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than prolonging the fight with your boss, better to
simply end it. And after you escape to a new job, just make sure
you don't leave him a forwarding address.

TEXAS PARDONS BOARD TAKES STEP TO REVISE CLEMENCY RULES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Under attack in and out of court for the way
it processes condemned inmates' pleas for reprieves, the Texas
Board of Pardons and Paroles on Friday took the first step in
revising its clemency rules.
</P>
<P>
   The board's six-member policy committee voted unanimously in a
15-minute meeting to shift the deadline for filing petitions for
capital reprieves or commutations to 25 days before a scheduled
execution. Previously, such pleas were accepted as late as five
days before the execution date.
</P>
<P>
   The measure will require a second committee approval before it
becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
   Parole board Chairman Victor Rodriguez said the new deadline
will allow the board's 18 members, who are scattered around the
state, significantly more time to consider a condemned inmate's
pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of work compressed into those five days,''
Rodriguez said. ``The petition had to be received and reproduced
and shipped out to board members. Then they had to consider and
resolve the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez described the action as ``the first step'' to other
possible revisions such as providing for face-to-face interviews
between inmates seeking clemency and board members. Only once in
recent years _ last year's Karla Faye Tucker case _ have board
officials met with the condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, clemency is granted by the governor after a
positive recommendation by the parole board. Gov. George W. Bush
repeatedly has said that in making his decision he considers only
questions of an inmate's guilt and whether he has had full access
to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who lives in San Antonio, declined to discuss the
nature of other possible rule revisions, but specifically opposed
opening reprieve hearings to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would reserve that option (to hold closed sessions)'' he
said. ``I would not give that away. The courts have upheld our
right ... and we believe it serves the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Parole board members have been criticized for voting behind
closed doors, often faxing vote forms from their offices in distant
parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   That policy has been scrutinized by state and federal courts,
but, though sternly criticized, has been allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers noted the Legislature has exempted the parole board's
reprieve deliberations from the Texas Open Meetings Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer the question for the board,'' said Gary Cohen,
an Austin defense attorney who deals with the parole board in his
practice. ``But I can speculate that the board wants to avoid the
spectacle of a mini-trial. As a defense attorney, I like government
to be out in the open, but that creates difficulties for government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God! That's what democracy's about. I don't think
inconvenience to an agency of the government should stand in the
way of difficult issues being resolved in the light.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rules revision must be published in the Texas Register
and withstand a second policy committee vote before going into
effect, a process that may take months, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   It will not affect the case of Danny Barber, who is scheduled to
be executed Thursday for a 1979 Dallas County murder. Barber
received a reprieve one hour before his planned December execution
after his lawyers challenged clemency procedures. The stay later
was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A similar challenge, filed by Joseph Stanley Faulder, a Canadian
citizen who also narrowly escaped execution in December, is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear a second appeal from
Faulder, based on the allegation that international law was
violated when he was denied access to Canadian diplomats after he
was arrested in the 1975 murder of a Gladewater, Texas, woman.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities contended they were unaware of Faulder's
nationality.

JANUARY JOB GROWTH IS DOUBLE PREDICTORS' FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite freezing weather across much of the nation
and a financial meltdown in Brazil, the U.S. economy barreled ahead
last month and created a quarter of a million new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The January job growth, reported Friday by the Labor Department,
was twice what forecasters had predicted. But even with a heavy
influx of workers into the labor force in January, unemployment
stayed at 4.3 percent _ the lowest level in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department lowered December's job gain to 298,000 from
the 378,000 it had initially reported. Still, nearly a quarter of a
million jobs have been added in each of the last 12 months on
average, making the labor market look stronger than at any time
since the height of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   That buoyancy has many forecasters, most of whom were predicting
a broad slowdown just weeks ago, now saying that 1999 is likely to
become the fourth consecutive year that economic growth will be
well ahead of the long-term trend of roughly 2 to 2.5 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American economy is the energizer bunny: It just keeps
chugging along,'' said David Wyss, chief economist of Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI, who predicts the economy will grow 3.5 percent this
year. If that happens, as many forecasters now predict,
unemployment will fall even further.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market investors shrugged off the jobs data Friday, hoping
that a strong economy would bolster corporate profits and easily
absorb the effects of rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With job losses easing in manufacturing and with hiring robust
in construction and services, the portion of Americans with jobs
has leapt to an all-time high of 64.5 percent. (In Germany and
France, by contrast, the figure is below 50 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the new jobs last month were in managerial and
professional occupations, leaving just two out of every hundred
college graduates out of work _ most of them simply in transit from
one job to another.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of the Midwest and South, namely Fargo, S.D., and
Raleigh-Durham, N.C., unemployment has dropped close to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the Midwest had the lowest unemployment, 3.5 percent
as of December, the latest regional figures available. The West had
the highest jobless rate, 5.2 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still some pockets of relatively high
unemployment. In the New York City area, unemployment has fallen to
6.8 percent, down sharply from the 8 to 9 percent level of just a
couple years ago. Still, its unemployment rate _ along with that of
Los Angeles and Miami _ is one of the highest among cities with
populations over 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the chief worry now is that things may be getting too
good. Investors saw the specter of higher interest rates in
Friday's report.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned
last month that he and his colleagues, who left rates unchanged at
their most recent monetary policy meeting, were watching for signs
that the tight labor market was fueling wage inflation. And while
the broadest, most reliable measures of labor costs have been
holding steady, the report Friday showed that hourly earnings for
production and other rank-and-file workers jumped 6 cents last
month, to $13.04. That brings the rise over the last 12 months to 4
percent, well above the 1.6 percent rate of inflation and even the
strong 2.7 percent gain in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Executives in most industries are complaining about rising job
turnover and the difficulty of finding qualified workers. According
to a new survey by the Olsten Corp., a temporary-help company, 77
percent of employers reported shortages of workers, up from 69
percent in 1998. Hardest to find are computer programmers,
accountants and financial professionals, but entry-level sales,
telemarketing and medical workers are also scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The shortages help explain why businesses are again spending
heavily on new machinery and equipment. Companies are not only
substituting technology for bodies, but are also trying to replace
skills with software. McDonald's, for example, now has pictures of
burgers and shakes, not words, on its cash registers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But what is a worry for Greenspan and a headache for employers
is a terrific boon to workers, especially those at the bottom of
the pay ladder who have had the most trouble getting and keeping
jobs, especially good ones. Unemployment among both black and
Hispanic workers, already the lowest in a generation, drifted even
lower last month. So did unemployment among workers with only high
school degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, gains for the bottom one-fifth of workers have
been occurring for a while now, said Jared Bernstein, an economist
at the Economic Policy Institute. He cites as an example young
black women with only high school degrees, a group that typically
has had extremely high unemployment rates. But the portion with
jobs has leapt by 10 percentage points, to 58 percent, in the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That increase is historically unprecedented,'' said Bernstein,
who notes that the hottest topic among scholars who study labor
markets now is ``why this recovery has been so good to folks at the
bottom.'' The gains have come not just in jobs, he points out, but,
equally important, in pay and training opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of the strong labor market are not exactly a
mystery. Troubles in the rest of the world may have sliced deeply
into exports from the United States and caused job cuts in
factories. But they have also indirectly fueled consumer and
business spending by pulling inflation and interest rates down.
Prices for raw materials and imports generally have fallen,
intensifying price competition and prompting foreigners to snap up
American stocks and bonds. And all that domestic spending _ on
everything from computers and cars to new houses and furniture _
means more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In January, virtually the only corners of the economy with
accelerating job losses were the oil patch and the mining
industries, battered by the lowest commodity prices since the
collapse of energy prices in the mid-1980s. Makers of heavy
machinery, which depend heavily on foreign markets, cut 9,000 jobs
last month. But other manufacturers, namely auto makers and
companies that cater to the construction trades, added workers.
</P>
<P>
   Job losses for manufacturing as a whole have slowed sharply.
Just 13,000 jobs, on net, disappeared last month, the smallest loss
since September. The weaker dollar may be helping. American
manufacturers are a lot more competitive at 113 yen to the dollar
than they were at 147 yen last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in construction continued despite blizzards in the
Midwest and Northeast, with 15,000 construction jobs added on top
of 99,000 jobs in December.

BMW CHIEF RESIGNS; MANAGEMENT OVERHAUL ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After a board room battle that lasted more
than seven hours, the chief executive of BMW AG resigned Friday and
the board announced a broad overhaul of top management.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent ouster of Bernd Pischetsrieder as chief executive
came after huge losses at Rover, the British manufacturer of cars
and sport utility vehicles that BMW bought in 1994 and has since
shored up with more than $3 billion in investment.
</P>
<P>
   Pischetsrieder's departure sent shudders through Britain,
because it raised grave new doubts about BMW's willingness to
bankroll further expansion at Rover. The shake-up could also
undermine BMW's steadfast insistence on remaining independent.
</P>
<P>
   The British minister of industry, Stephen Byers, announced that
he would fly to Munich to meet with BMW's new chairman about
Rover's big factory at Longbridge, near Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   BMW said both Pischetsrieder and the company's director of
new-model development, Walter Reitzle, had resigned.
Pischetsrieder, 55, will be replaced as chairman by the company's
current chief of production, Joachim Milberg, 50.
</P>
<P>
   BMW also said it would install new executives in charge of
development, marketing and production.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and analysts said it was clear that
Pischetsrieder was forced out because he was too closely committed
to the existing Rover strategy to make any big changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about much more than a change in management,'' said
Klaus-Juergen Meltzner, automobile analyst at Deutsche Bank in
Frankfurt. ``This is about a change in strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that Friday's actions could also shake BMW's
commitment to remain independent, because the company will have a
difficult time steering Rover back to profitability unless BMW
teams up with a high-volume carmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Pischetsrieder orchestrated the purchase of Rover for $1.2
billion in 1994, just one year after he took over as chairman.
Dismissing concerns from other BMW executives, he insisted on
expanding Rover's product range with a view toward raising
production to 500,000 cars from 300,000 in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some advances, Rover is believed to have lost more than
$500 million in 1998. To stop those losses, BMW replaced its top
executive at Rover in December and negotiated a deal with unions to
trim 2,500 jobs. In exchange, the company promised to invest
heavily in modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Rover's problem reflects the high value of the British
pound, which has made Rover cars expensive in other markets and
caused a surge of cheap imports into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But investors and board members also said many of the problems
came from Pischetsrieder's strategy of having Rover produce a full
range of cars in almost every price category.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Pischetsrieder would be leaving have been rampant in
German newspapers and magazines for days. What was more surprising
was the simultaneous dismissal of Pischetsrieder's chief rival and
critic, Reitzle. Most analysts had assumed that Reitzle would
become chairman if Pischetsrieder lost the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The company board is dominated by members of BMW's founding
Quandt family, who collectively own 46.5 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   According to German press reports, family members blamed
Pischetsrieder for Rover's poor performance and wanted a basic
change in strategy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   British political leaders were on full alert as the BMW board
met throughout the day Friday. Byers, the minister for industry,
reiterated the government's willingness to provide financial help
to save Rover's big factory in Longbridge. British television
carried live reports on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's own line of high-priced sedans and sports cars continues
to enjoy strong sales and healthy profits, and company executives
have repeatedly insisted that they want BMW to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   But since Daimler-Benz's merger with Chrysler and Ford's recent
agreement to buy Volvo's car business, BMW has come under growing
pressure to find a big partner to achieve the economies of scale
needed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true with Rover, because many of its cars
are midprice or inexpensive mass-market vehicles. In contrast to
BMW's luxury sedans, which enjoy higher profit margins, Rover's
prices have been squeezed by ever-tougher competition.
</P>
<P>
   Meltzner of Deutsche Bank said BMW faced a tough choice: Either
scale back Rover's product line and shut down factories, or put
Rover under the roof of a much bigger partner. Volkswagen AG has
indicated it might have an interest, but BMW has thus far spurned
all of VW's overtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their plans to increase production are very ambitious, and I
have my doubts they can achieve them,'' Meltzner said. ``If they
don't achieve their numbers, then they won't derive the economies
of scale they have been expecting, either.''

<P>
   As investment pundits warn about an Internet bubble and Bill
Gates of Microsoft wonders where the mania for Internet stocks will
end, Michael S. Egan is quietly keeping his chips on the virtual
table.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, 58, knows something about building companies. He made a
fortune by turning around the Alamo rental-car company and selling
it to Republic Industries in 1997 for $625 million, with his stake
worth about $587 million. Then he started an investment company,
Dancing Bear Investments, and looked for promising businesses.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, he was becoming infatuated with cyberspace. ``I
started doing a lot of business electronically with the airline
reservation systems and the Internet,'' he said in an interview.
``It was quite apparent that it was going to be the major economic
revolution of the world since maybe the printing press or
currency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Egan wasn't about to invest in a company just because it had
dot-com in its name. He was looking for a startup nobody else had
heard of and true grit in the people in charge. ``They had to have
a high, high work ethic,'' he said. ``They had to be able to suffer
a blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan, an alumnus of Cornell University, mentioned to the
university's president one day that he was looking for a ``media
play on the Net.'' Perhaps, he was told, he should check out a
company called Theglobe.com that a couple of recent graduates, Todd
Krizelman and Stephan Paternot, had started while still in college.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com calls itself an Internet ``community'' that offers
its users entertainment, information and shopping opportunities.
Egan liked the concept and flew to Ithaca to have lunch with the
two men. After five hours of talks, he made it clear he wanted to
buy into their venture.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, he dispatched Edward Cespedes, a Dancing Bear
executive, for follow-up talks. ``Ed was told that he couldn't
leave the office until the negotiation was done,'' said Krizelman,
now 25, one year older than his partner. ``He lived on our couches
in the office and shared meal after meal of Chinese food with us.''
Six months later, Egan paid $20 million for a 51 percent stake in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff came last Nov. 13. In its first day of trading, the
stock of Theglobe.com rocketed 606 percent, from $9 to $63.50, the
biggest first-day run-up of any initial public offering. ``It was
an adrenaline day if there ever was one,'' Egan said. His stake of
roughly six million shares is now worth $382 million.
</P>
<P>
   Egan has made other smart investments, most notably a
controlling stake in Nantucket Nectars, a Massachusetts juice
maker, that he sold last year to Ocean Spray for an undisclosed
profit. Even for this low-tech venture, his enthusiasm was
boundless.
</P>
<P>
   Tom First, one of the founders, recalled a conversation on a
private jet: ``He starts talking about how the company would be a
$200 million company within five years while I'm concerned that on
our one van in Boston the shocks were blown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan has used some of his wealth to lead the life of a country
squire, building a $12 million mansion in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
for temporary shelter while he renovated his main spread nearby,
and assembling a Nantucket vacation compound of 15 houses, a dining
hall, a movie house and a baseball diamond for a family that
includes five children and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But his fears after selling Alamo _ that he would ``dry up and
blow away'' _ proved groundless. As he looked for investment leads,
he says, he heeded a lesson he learned when he was 15 and was
helping to build a family amusement park in his native Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   He was having trouble managing a work crew of a dozen Native
Americans and hired a middle-aged chief named White Cloud as his
assistant. White Cloud got instant results, making him realize that
``it's the people around you who get the job done for you.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Egan at first pursued a career in tourism. But a
``humbling'' job in food service, followed by a low-paying stint in
academia, cooled that ambition, and he jumped at the chance to run
an old friend's family business.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the cluttered Silicon Alley office of Theglobe.com
recently, he looked more like an artist than an investor with his
snowy white hair, black pullover sweater and black trousers. But he
talked like an investor as he dismissed fears about an Internet
stock bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very good reason a lot of capital is pouring into
the Internet,'' he said. ``Fifty million or 100 million data bases
being joined with three billion users.''
</P>
<P>
   In other recent deals, Egan bought and sold AutobyInternet Inc.
and bought a majority stake in Inteletravel, a privately held
Internet travel company. He plans to take public his own start-up,
Certified Vacations, a travel company, at the end of this year.
Last Monday, Theglobe.com announced its first acquisition, the
expected purchase of Azazz.com, an Internet retailer.
</P>
<P>
   What drives Egan? He says he wants to help young entrepreneurs
make their way. The other day, he says, he had breakfast with the
two founders of Nantucket Nectars, both in their early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the enthusiasm for life in their eyes and hear it in
their voices,'' he said. ``Maybe I'm trying to recapture my
youth.''

INVESTING WITH MARK L. YOCKEY: ARTISAN INTERNATIONAL FUND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The financial crisis in Asia and Latin America has been a good
reason for Mark L. Yockey, manager of the Artisan International
fund, to favor European stocks. But it is not the only one. He
follows a bottom-up approach to picking stocks, looking for
focused, fast-growing companies run by progressive, profit-minded
management _ and he is finding more and more of them in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, you've had a sea change in the last five years in
the quality of the management,'' he said. ``A whole new wave of
management came in, and they really were more focused on
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnessing that kind of management awareness for his fund has
helped Yockey earn an average annualized return of 21.4 percent
from Artisan International's inception in December 1995 though
January of this year, versus just 8.3 percent for the average
foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Lanky, With his salt-and-pepper hair, Yockey, 42, works in a
29th floor office in San Francisco with three analysts. The four
travel the world, sizing up companies that have caught their
interest.
</P>
<P>
   One of their rules of thumb for stocks is that the company's
forward price-to-earnings ratio should be no greater than its
three-year forward earnings growth rate, a variation of the common
price-earnings growth, or PEG, ratio, which compares a stock's p/e
with its one-year earnings growth rate. Yockey looks for big profit
margins and cash flows, but also for management that zeroes in on
its best business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love focused managements,'' he said. ``If you try to do one
thing, you can probably do it pretty well. But you try to do six
different things, and you know what? It just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that his tenure has been without bumps. In 1997, 13 percent
of the fund's assets were in Latin America and 8 percent in Hong
Kong. Downturns in those markets resulted in a return of just 3.5
percent that year versus an average of 5.1 percent for its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation is another theme, especially in telecommunications
_ and not just for European companies. Metronet Communications of
Calgary, Alberta, is taking advantage of deregulation to provide
voice and data services to business customers. It is the fund's
biggest holding, at 4.5 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of the company is Craig Young, who headed
Brooks Fiber Properties, a local telecommunications services
company bought by MCI Worldcom last year. ``He successfully built
one company and sold it,'' Yockey said.
</P>
<P>
   Metronet is building broad-band fiber optic networks for
high-speed communications in major Canadian cities. Yockey expects
company revenues to grow from $200 million this year to $500
million or $600 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think in 2001 they'll become profitable,'' he said, versus
losses he expects them to post for both 1999 and 2000 due to
capital expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan International first bought class B shares of Metronet at
the initial public offering price of $16.23 (United States) in
December 1997. The shares closed on Friday at $38. Yockey's target
price for January 2000 is $60.
</P>
<P>
   The hot product of another pick, Finland's Nokia, is a little
wireless phone that also keeps an electronic list of names and
numbers and receives e-mail messages. ``Nokia is driving the
cellular phone business on a global basis,'' Yockey said.
</P>
<P>
   He first invested in Nokia in the fall of 1997, at the outset of
the Asian financial crisis, when the price of ADRs was down to $37,
from about $50. ``The stock had been creamed because people were
saying that the sales in Asia were going to be poor,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's earnings grew by more than 60 percent in 1998,
and the ADRs have shot up to $130.375; his target in 12 months is
$175. He estimates Nokia's average annual earnings growth is 30
percent, and its 1999 price-earnings multiple is 28.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia management has done a brilliant job, Yockey said. ``Ten
years ago they were a little company up in Finland that nobody had
ever heard of, and today they are one of the global leaders in the
cellular communications market.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care companies are another favorite. He invested in Roche
Holding AG, the Swiss drug giant, in October at about 16,000 Swiss
francs and has a target price of 22,000 francs for January 2000. It
closed on Friday at 18,250 francs.
</P>
<P>
   He calculates Roche's three-year earnings growth rate at 23
percent, below its 1999 price-earnings multiple of 26. He said he
made an exception to his usual stock-selection rules because Roche
was ``one of the best companies in the world'' and because he
expected a major acquisition soon, which would bolster its
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was upbeat about new Roche drugs, including Xenical,
for obesity; GS4104 for influenza, and several for cancer.

   From One Household, Two Microsoft Slayers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find a more computer-literate pair of
lawyers than David and Mary Boies. Boies (pronounced BOYZ) is the
Justice Department's hired gun and lead trial lawyer in the
Microsoft antitrust case who has spent the last two weeks gleefully
reducing the executives of the software behemoth to stammering
schoolboys on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Mary, also a litigator, has taken up a second career
as a software developer. She was frustrated with the resistance of
two sports-happy children to learn to type, so she created
educational typing programs that revolve around soccer and
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``Slam Dunk Typing,'' distributed by the Learning Co.,
briefly became a top-10 seller last fall among home-education
programs. A new title, ``All Star Typing,'' is to be released next
month. The Mavis Beacon series ``is the Microsoft of typing
programs,'' Ms. Boies said, ``but we're taking the giant on.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies, a former partner at the Manhattan firm Cravath, Swaine &AMP;
Moore, has his own side job: keeping his own firm, a start-up, in
business. The Justice Department pays him $50 an hour, one-tenth
his usual rate, so he works on other cases in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   The clients don't seem to mind. Lee Weissman, an American
business consultant who is suing the Saison Group of Tokyo for
breach of contract, calls Boies one of the country's best
litigators. ``If you want something done, go to a busy person,'' he
says.

   Last Tuesday, Oprah Winfrey told viewers to turn off their
vacuums and stop microwaving their chickens because she had a
special guest. Brad Pitt? No, Theodore J. Forstmann, the investor
who buys troubled companies and shores them up. He was on the show
to talk about the Children's Scholarship Fund, a charity he backs
that gives scholarships to underprivileged youngsters so that they
can attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been the only executive hitting daytime TV. In
December, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, made a guest appearance
on the Rosie O'Donnell show, where he confessed to having a
``criminal record'' of four or five speeding tickets. He also
informed viewers that his two-and-a-half-year-old daughter's
favorite book is ``Everybody Poops.''

Professor Amartya Sen, the 1998 Nobel laureate in economics. He was
ushered into a barely furnished room and questioned by police for
more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Americans and Europeans enter Switzerland without visas. Not
Indians. And Sen, for all his prestige in the West, is an Indian
citizen who arrived at Zurich airport near midnight without a visa.
``The police were very skeptical about my financial means,'' Sen
said. ``They asked whether by any chance I had a bank statement
with me, which I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen, 65, master of Trinity College in Cambridge and a Harvard
professor, produced identity cards, his green card, credit cards
and a letter from the Swiss Embassy in London promising him a visa
at the airport so he could speak at the World Economic Forum in
Davos.
</P>
<P>
   He finally got the visa after satisfying the police that he was
solvent and would not stay on as an illegal alien. He mentioned the
experience in his speech, and Ruth Dreifuss, Switzerland's
president, came up afterward and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one seems to pay attention,'' Sen said, ``to the
difficulty Third World citizens have in traveling.''

   Sam Zell, the Chicago real estate investor, has a knack for
capturing the economic moment in the New Year's music boxes he
gives to friends and clients. With the real estate market in
recession as 1994 opened, they played ``Stayin' Alive 'til '95,''
an altered version of the Bee Gees song.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 675 boxes strike _ what else? _ a global theme.
Designed by the sculptor Michael Speaker and titled ``The Whole
World in Our Hands,'' they feature hands cradling a globe that is
circled by a tiny airplane. At the touch of a button, a chorus
sings lyrics like ``We got telecommunications in our hands'' and
``We got euros and new currencies in our hands.'' One New York
recipient said: ``He knows it's bizarre. But he believes in the
content.''

   Pressing the Issue Of Pay Inequality &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compensation continues to swell for top corporate management
even as wages for the work force rise only marginally, a wage gap
that some people consider a problem for the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent of Business Week's annual studies found that at
the 365 biggest companies in the country, the ratio of the chief
executive's pay to that of a factory worker grew to 326 to 1 in
1997. The ratio was 44 to 1 in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   High time then, according to an advocacy group in Boston called
United for a Fair Economy, to bring the issue to the board room.
This year, the group's Responsible Wealth project has recruited
shareholders to file resolutions at eight companies to examine the
wage gaps within their labor forces.
</P>
<P>
   Resolutions on the proxies for Allied Signal, BankAmerica,
BankBoston, Citigroup and General Electric ask the companies to cap
the chief executive's pay at a specific multiple of what the
lowest-paid full-time employee makes; the multiple would be
established by each company.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution at AT&AMP;T seeks a flat cap on the chief executive's
pay, not linked to the compensation of the lowest-paid worker. A
resolution at Huffy, the bicycle maker, asks the company to report
on the ratio between the highest- and the lowest-paid workers
during the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   No one at United for a Fair Economy is expecting the resolutions
to pass; social-issue resolutions rarely muster the support of more
than 2 percent or 3 percent of voters. But last year, in a test,
the group floated the General Electric proposal and was glad to see
it draw 6 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Klinger, the Responsible Wealth coordinator, said a vote
``in the 10 to 20 percent range would be significant'' and would
force a board to consider action of some sort. The object of the
project, he said, was to raise the issue to a level of public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is not just a flavor of the season, he added. The
group expects to expand its efforts to other companies for many
shareholder meetings to come. ``We see this as a multiyear,
sustained effort,'' Klinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel M. Gold &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Balances Without Checks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government began a concerted effort to persuade
people receiving federal payments _ including Social Security,
veterans' benefits and federal pensions _ to take direct deposit of
their money. Accompanying January payments were notices pitching
the advantages of direct deposit, the automatic transfer of
payments into bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The pitches will keep coming. Why? Washington saves about 40
cents for each payment it makes directly into a bank account
instead of printing, mailing and processing a check.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury says that since 1996, when Congress first ordered
payments to convert to electronic transfers, direct deposit has
risen to 74 percent of Social Security checks and almost 77 percent
of veterans' benefits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, as many as 10 million federal payees don't have bank
accounts. The government hopes to entice them with a proposed
bare-bones electronic transfer account, with no minimum balance,
four free withdrawals a month and monthly fees of no more than $3.
Washington would even pay banks the set-up fee. Final guidelines
are expected by this summer. &QL;

<P>
   Now that fourth-quarter earnings are mostly in the books, it is
clear that the worst fears about last summer's emerging-markets
panic did not pan out. Indeed, it suddenly seems that many
naysaying forecasters are painting a far brighter earnings
landscape for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At Merrill Lynch, economists recently raised their forecast for
earnings growth of the companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index to 3.5 percent in 1999, up from a previous prediction, in
mid-December, of a 5 percent drop. That's an 8.5-percentage point
swing in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   The change resulted from ``continued strength in the economy and
less pressure on profit margins, which is the result of continued
restructuring,'' said Gerald D. Cohen, a senior economist at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is far from alone in its optimism. ``I'm very bullish on
corporate earnings,'' said Byron Wien, United States strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The economy has a lot of momentum,
and I'm optimistic earnings are going to exceed expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among strategists, the average estimate for that growth is 4.1
percent for companies in the S&AMP;P 500, versus 0.2 percent in 1998.
according to IBES International, a research firm. And among the
industries in the index, the engines are likely to be technology,
health care and perhaps energy _ a huge 1998 loser that most
analysts see stabilizing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for investors, especially with the stock
market at record levels and valuations. In the absence of lower
interest rates, better profits are probably the best catalyst for
more market gains.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some strategists suggest that the factors that dampened
earnings in last year's third quarter _ the first time in seven
years that profits declined for American corporations _ have proved
extremely short-lived. Edward Kerschner, a Paine Webber strategist
who expects profit growth of 5 percent to 8 percent in 1999,
contends that the poor third quarter resulted from several
coincidental factors, including the market plunge in August, the
General Motors strike and a steep drop in oil earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, emerging markets still gyrate. But in the case of GM, the
company has already stunned industry analysts by suggesting last
month that its earnings could top $10 a share in 1999 if the
company meets aggressive financial and production targets. And many
analysts do not think oil prices can fall much below their current
$12 level.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts, who estimate profits for
individual companies and tend to be far more optimistic than the
strategists, are forecasting aggregate profit growth of 17.2
percent for the companies in the S&AMP;P 500, versus the strategists'
estimate of 4.1 percent, according to IBES The gap between the two
groups' forecasts is generally far less.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are already starting to scale back their estimates,
as has often been the case in the past. The analysts tracked by
IBES lowered their first-quarter profit-growth forecasts for S&AMP;P
500 companies to 4.4 percent as of Jan. 28, down from 5.5 percent a
week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even given the customary volatility of such forecasts, the
change represented a surprisingly large reduction in such a short
time, said Joseph Abbott, an equity strategist at IBES.
</P>
<P>
   Why are analysts optimistic?
</P>
<P>
   In technology, they see continuing strong sales of personal
computers, software and semiconductors _ and they know that slack
overseas demand in 1998 could make this year's numbers look that
much better. IBES estimates are for white-hot earnings growth of
35.6 percent for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Health care is getting help from continued good results at
pharmaceutical companies, which have been coming up with an array
of new drugs. IBES expects 15.9 percent earnings growth for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   One big turnaround sector is likely to be financial companies,
with expected earnings growth of 17.7 percent _ although the gain
would be from last year's disappointing numbers, which were dragged
down by third-quarter disasters in emerging markets and hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   While oil prices could fall again, further depressing energy
stocks, some analysts think the industry may have bottomed.
Kerschner calculates that if earnings in the industry had been flat
in the fourth quarter, instead of declining over 63 percent as
analysts estimate they did, total domestic corporate profit growth
would have been about twice as high for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, strategists predict that several sectors could be
disappointments this year, particularly two that can suffer in
periods of slow growth: basic materials and commodity companies and
capital equipment suppliers like the Case Corp., Deere &AMP; Co. and
Caterpillar Inc. ``That's where the real vulnerability is,'' said
Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call in Boston.

FOR NEW ORLEANS, MARDI GRAS IS BECOMING AN ALL-YEAR CASH COW

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7)  
 (af)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The calendar says Mardi Gras season lasts seven
weeks this year, from King's Day (Jan. 6) to the climactic Fat
Tuesday (Feb. 16).
</P>
<P>
   But for the industry behind ``laissez les bon temps rouler'',
Mardi Gras has become a rapidly growing year-round business with
global exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically, it is by far the single-largest special event,''
says Marc Morial, the mayor of New Orleans. ``It's bigger than Jazz
Fest, it's bigger than the Sugar Bowl, it's bigger than the Super
Bowl.'' An annual study by James J. McLain, an economics professor
at the University of New Orleans, shows that Mardi Gras spending in
the New Orleans area alone has more than tripled in 12 years, to
$840 million in 1998 from $240 million in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   To see that growth in tangible form, look no further than the
bead- and trinket-strewn racks of Accent Attic, which takes in more
than $6 million a year by supplying members of krewes _ the clubs
that sponsor and ride on Mardi Gras parade floats _ with the
so-called throws they shower on revelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mardi Gras is over 100 years old, but it has made tremendous
growth in the last 15 years,'' said Accent Attic's owner, Dom
Corlone, a former jewelry salesman who went into the Mardi Gras
business in 1980. ``Fashion jewelry was difficult because if you
didn't sell it right away, it was out of style. Mardi Gras, what
you buy won't go stale. It looked like a safe business to go
into.''
</P>
<P>
   But growth has also attracted competitors who underpriced some
of Corlone's products, so lately he has emphasized catering to the
krewes' desire for exclusive trinkets. On his annual buying trip to
Asia, Corlone designed a special necklace for Le Krewe d'Etat,
which he has since kept under wraps lest other krewes rush to
competitors for copies.
</P>
<P>
   The secret: ``For the night parade, glow-in-the-dark beads,'' he
said, and a battery-powered flashing-eye medallion.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 Accent Attic stores, bead prices range from less than
2 cents a strand for 18 inches of plastic beads to $1.16 for an
8-foot-long string of fake pearls. There are also bracelets, hair
ties, surgical scrubs, hats, banners, stuffed toys, women's
underwear and all manner of beverage containers in the official
Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold.
</P>
<P>
   According to McLain's report, the average krewe member will toss
$540 of this stuff to the crowd, and it's not uncommon for a float
rider to go through $1,000 worth or more. In all, McLain estimates
that more than $9.1 million in throws were tossed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Throws are a visible but small part of the industry that has
grown up around the 60 separate Mardi Gras parades in New Orleans
each year. There is bigger money in building parade floats, a
market dominated by three specialist companies.
</P>
<P>
   The largest is Kern Studio, parent of several family-run
concerns, which gets $20 million in annual revenue from outfitting
33 of the parades, according to Barry Kern, the company's
president. Kern and his siblings, Brian, Blaine Jr., Blainey and
Thais, run the 52-year-old company with their father, Blaine Sr.,
the founder.
</P>
<P>
   Kern maintains more than 300 floats and thousands of ornamental
props, which are often recycled: This year, a giant bust of John
Wayne was altered to become Freddy Kruger's scarred visage. The
company is now building its largest float, the 240-foot-long ``S.S.
Endymion,'' with a million feet of optical-fiber lighting effects
powered by a generator ``which we believe could light up a minor
league baseball park,'' said Ed Muniz, captain of the Endymion
krewe. Dues from Endymion's roughly 2,000 members underwrite the $2
million cost.
</P>
<P>
   Once a seasonal business, Kern is now busy year-round, and not
just because it is already designing floats for 2000 before the
1999 models have rolled. The company runs tours of its float
factory and rents its warehouses for parties.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kern said the company's facilities, known as Mardi Gras World,
are host to about 125 parties a year averaging 650 guests each.
``It's a cash cow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still not the whole cow. Kern gets 20 percent to 30
percent of its revenue by using its Mardi Gras skills in other
businesses, like building facades, decorations and rides for theme
parks and running parades in places from Philadelphia to France to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for Mardi Gras products is increasing outside of New
Orleans as seasonal celebrations grow in cities like Galveston,
Texas and Shreveport, La., and in Mobile, Ala., where a parading
tradition predates that of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Accent Attic makes 15 percent of its sales out of state, from
Italy to Guam and even the Asian countries where the beads are
made. ``We ship it right back to Hong Kong, because you can't find
it there,'' Corlone said.
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses get in on les bon temps, too. Bakeries across
Louisiana add extra shifts to crank out a Mardi Gras tradition,
king cakes _ brioche dough circles filled with spice, fruit or
cheese and dusted with green, yellow and purple sugar with a small
plastic baby doll baked inside. The cake is served at the beginning
of the season _ the feast of the Epiphany; whoever is served the
slice with the doll buys the next year's cake.
</P>
<P>
   Gambino's, one of the larger bakers, has a separate plant that
cranks up in late December to turn out up to 5,000 king cakes a
day, about half shipped to out-of-town customers in a $25 to $50
Mardi Gras kit with paraphernalia like beads, cups and a CD of
suitable music.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before Mardi Gras, one day's orders from Gambino's
included shipments to Britain, Norway, Spain Switzerland, Belgium,
Japan, Taiwan and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The Mardi Gras bonanza even reaches neighborhood concerns. Small
hardware stores do a brisk business in a peculiar product: folding
wooden ladders with a seat attached and wheels on two of the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Children sit on top to watch the parades, and afterward the
ladder is collapsed and used as a rolling carrier for ice chests,
sleepy kids and Mardi Gras booty.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Deutch, owner of four Ace Hardware stores, said the
contraptions bolster what are otherwise the slowest months for
hardware retailing: Mardi Gras season accounts for more than half
the ladders his stores sell.
</P>
<P>
   The ladder-seats typically cost about $60, but ladder shoppers
also commonly buy spray paint, staple guns and glue guns to
decorate the ladders. The city's famous termites help assure that
customers come back year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city goes to some lengths to stave off direct
commercial tie-ins with parades, commercialism occasionally creeps
in anyway, especially in the suburbs. The Popeye's restaurant chain
gives krewes ``doubloons'' to throw that can be redeemed for a
discount on a chicken dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A local potato chip company, Zapp's, makes Mardi Gras-colored
bags of chips for use as throws. And Anheuser Busch has sent the
Budweiser Clydesdales every year since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no Nike or Nokia Mardi Gras. ``We are opposed
to commercial involvement in the parading events,'' Morial said.
``It doesn't need to be changed. Why overanalyze something that is
so successful?''

NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN IN HISTORICAL SETTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There is too much history in Rambouillet to let
something as insignificant as a passport problem bother the French.
</P>
<P>
   Rambouillet, the French chateau where the warring factions in
Kosovo are supposed to closet themselves Saturday in an attempt to
end the fighting in the Serbian province, would never be confused
with any place in Pristina, the Kosovar capital.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was the petty bureaucracy so common to Pristina that
put in question the start of the talks, which are supposed to
conclude within two weeks, under the threat of NATO military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   When two of the delegates from the Kosovo Liberation Army showed
up at the airport in Pristina Friday without passports, Serbian
officials refused to let them board the French government jet that
was waiting to bring them here. The 14 other members of the ethnic
Albanian delegation refused to board the plane without their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats worried that the talks would be scuttled. The
French, however, who are hosting the talks, took the setback in
stride, saying they expected the Albanian delegation to arrive in
time for the start of talks.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 miles southwest of Paris, Rambouillet was once the
playground of the French aristocracy. It was a refuge for kings and
Napoleon. For the last 102 years, it has been the summer residence
of the French president, France's Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   And if American, European, and Russian diplomats can pull it
off, Rambouillet will take its place alongside Camp David as a spot
where enemies put aside historical baggage to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Rambouillet can trace its roots to the 14th century, but it
became firmly entrenched in French consciousness in 1547, when the
king, Francois I, died there after falling ill on a hunting trip in
the surrounding woods. Forty years later, Henri III took refuge
there when he was driven out of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The Count of Toulouse, son of Louis XIV, bought the chateau in
1705 and rebuilt it, decorating the west wing with rococo woodwork,
and commissioning a series of canals and man-made islands on which
elaborate parties were held. Rambouillet's woodwork is rivaled in
France only by Versailles, the palace where the treaty that ended
World War I was signed 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1783, Louis XVI bought Rambouillet, mainly for the hunting to
be had in the nearby forest of some 500,000 acres. Marie
Antoinette, however, was not impressed, derisively referring to it
as a toad pond. She longed for her beloved Trianon at Versailles.
To appease her, Louis built something resembling a cafe inside an
English garden, where Marie Antoinette's lady friends sipped milk
concotions and nibbled fresh cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Rambouillet was virtually abandoned during the French
revolution, its furniture sold off. But, of all people, Napoleon
fell in love with the place, restoring it to much of its grandeur.
In 1815, before he left in exile, Napoleon spent a night of quiet
reflection at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, it became the summer presidential residence, but after
the Germans invaded France during World War II it was also a
headquarters for the French Resistance. In August 1944, General
Charles de Gaulle gave the order to liberate Paris as he sat at an
ornate desk at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   If all the negotiators manage to arrive at the chateau, they
will be asked to write the latest chapter in its extraordinary
history. The opulence may be disarming.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish their day's work, the negotiators will retire
to the grand dining room, where they will eat well under a
550-pound bronze chandelier. They will retire to some of the 30
bedrooms with Pompeiian frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the senior American negotiator, Christopher Hill, the
US ambassador to Macedonia; his European counterpart, Wolfgang
Petritsch of Austria; and Russian diplomat Igor Mayorsky hope that
the history of Rambouillet will rub off on the delegations from
Pristina and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In its opulence, Rambouillet is completely different from the US
air base at Dayton, Ohio where the agreement to end the Bosnian war
was hammered out. Dayton presented all the charm of an airport
lounge. Rambouillet is another matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the history and sophistication of Rambouillet will
inspire the Serbs and ethnic Albanians who, citing their own
histories, have been waging a war utterly lacking in
sophistication, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   French officials, however, believe that history matters.

WINEMAKERS GET OK TO TOUT HEALTH BENEFITS OF PRODUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US winemakers won the federal government's permission Friday to
put labels on bottles that allude to the ``health benefits'' of
wine and invite consumers to write the government to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department, which regulates alcohol sales, approved
the new labels at the behest of wine producers _ and to the dismay
of some health groups.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that small daily amounts of alcohol lowers the risk of
heart attack and stroke has been accumulating for 20 years. But
some studies have also found hints of health risk, such as a
slightly elevated risk of breast cancer in women.
</P>
<P>
   The larger concern, however, is that a federal health imprimatur
on wine bottles _ right next to already-required warnings that
alcohol can cause birth defects among infants born to women who
drink _ will be seen as ``permission'' by some to drink too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies have shown that the incidence of heart disease in
those who consume moderate amounts of alcohol is lower than in
nondrinkers,'' said Carole Bullock, a spokeswoman for the American
Heart Association, ``but there's still a concern that these studies
may not tell the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside of alcohol consumption, the Heart Association said,
include alcoholism, high blood pressure, obesity, stroke, suicide,
and accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence
criticized the new labels because they ``could potentially be
disastrous'' for people who have difficulty limiting their alcohol
intake. The Council said the government should have defined
``moderate drinking'' in the new labelling.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Boston University authority on moderate drinking, Dr.
R. Curtis Ellison, did not expect the new wine labels to have much
effect on people's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows already there are some health benefits from
wine and alcohol already,'' said Ellison, director of BU's
Institute for Lifestyle and Health, which receives about 10 percent
of its funding from the alcoholic beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will have minimal effect on heavy drinkers,''
Ellison added. ``But if you're going to put any labels on a bottle,
you should tell the truth. This doesn't say, as it should, that the
health effects of light drinking are good and the effects of heavy
drinking are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue, according to some scientists, is that the
scientific basis for singling out wine drinking for its beneficial
effects is much more slender than the data for moderate consumption
of any alcoholic beverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Treasury arm
that regulates alcohol producers, said it wasn't taking sides on
the controversy but merely permitting wine producers to mention
``health benefits'' and to suggest that consumers ask their doctor
or the US Department of Agriculture for more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol beverage labels are approved by the Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearm Bureau to make sure they do not contain statements . .
. that are likely to mislead consumers,'' the agency said in a
press statement. ``ATF worked with industry to modify their
proposed statements to meet these criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Knight, the Treasury Department's chief counsel, noted that
the agency ``can only deny labelling statements if they are false
or misleading'' and said the new wine labels meet that standard
``because these statements do not make any health claim.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two approved labels permits wine producers to say:
``The proud people who made this wine encourage you to consult your
family doctor about the health benefits of wine consumption.'' The
other invites consumers interested in learning about ``the health
benefits of wine consumption'' to write the Department of
Agriculture for its Dietary Guidelines for Americans. It gives an
address and a website for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Dietary Guidelines make no distinction between wine
and other alcoholic beverages. They advise that drinking ``no more
than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per
day for men'' has been linked with lower risk of heart disease, and
they warn against health risks.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA defines a a drink as 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of
wine, and 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits.

JUSTICE CHIEF CRITICIZED IN MEDIA DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a case that is being widely criticized as setting
a dangerous precedent of unequal justice, Hong Kong's justice
secretary has revealed she did not prosecute a powerful media
magnate implicated in fraud in part because it could have put the
woman's newspaper group out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars, lawyers' groups and legislators across the
political spectrum Friday condemned the revelation, saying it
implied the government has one standard of justice for the rich and
another for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper baroness Sally Aw, chairman of Sing Tao group, was
named a co-conspirator last year, but never charged in a scheme to
inflate circulation figures for her Hong Kong Standard newspaper to
boost advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung said Thursday she did not
prosecute Aw in part because there was not enough evidence that Aw
intended fraud, but also because it was not in ``the public
interest.'' Aw's media group is facing financial problems, and
Leung said Aw's prosecution could have caused the business to go
under, costing many jobs and creating a bad image overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Yash Ghai, a law professor at University of Hong Kong, said he
was flabbergasted by the reasoning, which he called ``inconsistent
with...legal principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of law says all people must be treated fairly,
whether you're a factory owner or a factory worker,'' Ghai said.
``The implication here is that if you are an important person and
others depend on you for their livelihood, then you escape the law
_ and that isn't right.'' By the same rationale, ``if you're a
senior civil servant, they could say the reputation of the
government is at stake'' and not prosecute, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hong Kong returned to China in 1997, observers worried
aloud about the future of the British-style judicial system here.
Many legal analysts say the Aw case calls into question fairness in
post-handover courts, which in turn could undermine Hong Kong's
reputation as an uncorrupt and level playing field for
international business.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal advocates, however, cautioned that the decision
should not be read as the death of rule of law, but rather viewed
in the context of other recent cases. In a landmark immigration
case last Friday, Hong Kong's highest court ruled that it _ and not
Beijing _ has final jurisdiction over legal cases involving Hong
Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leung's revelation that she considered factors other than
evidence in deciding not to prosecute Aw sparked widespread
outrage, spurring some critics to call for her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Others demanded that she turn evidence over to an independent
counsel who would review if Aw should be held accountable along
with three of her executives, who were fined $61,000 last month and
sentenced to jail terms of between four and six months.
</P>
<P>
   Many have suspected that Aw, whose father made his fortune
through the famed Tiger Balm ointment, was given special treatment
because she is politically well connected. Aw is a local
representative to the Chinese People's Political Consulative
Conference in Beijing, and a friend of Hong Kong Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa, a former director of her Sing Tao group.
</P>
<P>
   But Leung denied that any consideration was ``given to the
political and personal status'' of Aw. She said the main reason was
lack of evidence, but said she also considered whether Aw's
prosecution would cost jobs or give Hong Kong a bad name because of
the failure of a media group after the handover.
</P>
<P>
   Aw had admitted in a statement to corruption investigators that
she approved plans to inflate circulation numbers, but denied
knowing ``details of the deception as you called it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the barrage of criticism, Leung won points for her
frankness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the attorney generals have refused to explain,''
said Anthony Chow, president of the Law Society of Hong Kong.
``They would have said `I don't have to give an explanation' _ full
stop. Or `There's not enough evidence,' full stop. At least Leung
is willing to be transparent about the whole thing...We should
remember that she's not obligated to explain.''

TWO SEPARATISTS SENTENCED TO 24 YEARS IN PRISON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Johnie is cq) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Two Republic of Texas separatists were
sentenced Friday to 24-year prison terms for threatening to kill
federal officials by shooting them with cactus needles coated in
deadly viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Johnie Wise, a 72-year-old former sea captain, and Jack Abbott
Grebe Jr., 43, both military veterans from Olmito, Texas, who had
no previous record, were sentenced for threatening via e-mail to
use weapons of mass destruction. The threats were sent to the
Internal Revenue Service and the Drug Enforcement Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were sentenced, Wise and Grebe each read long,
rambling statements, insisting that the case against them was a
fraud and that U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle had no jurisdiction
over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell was my client saying?'' defense attorney Keith
Uhles later inquired of Tagle's court reporter after Wise was
sentenced. ``It sounded like incoherent rambling.''
</P>
<P>
   When Grebe concluded his statement, he told the judge his
business with the court was over and announced he was leaving. He
took a step toward the door _ and four U.S. marshals _ before Tagle
ordered him to return to the bench and receive his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have courage, honor and integrity, you will stop this
travesty,'' Grebe told the judge, and added later: ``You have no
authority over me. I am not the one on trial today. Only the
fiction is on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagle, referring to extensive pre-sentence investigations, noted
that both men were intelligent and could have contributed to their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it stinks. It's a big bummer,'' said Steve Wise,
referring to his father's lengthy sentence. His uncle, Jim Wise,
added, ``I think it's a clear case of entrapment and all we can do
is appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Uhles called the case ``frightening,'' and said
the government prosecuted Wise and Grebe because of their ties to
the Republic of Texas, a separatist group whose members believe
Texas was annexed unlawfully and is not a part of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear these men were targeted because they were
associated with the Republic of Texas, a group that does not have
mainstream beliefs,'' Uhles said.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre case developed last summer when John L. Cain, a
self-employed Harlingen computer consultant, went to FBI agents
with his concerns about Republic of Texas supporters who had hired
him to develop a computer database. The separatist group has a
number of supporters who meet regularly in the diner of a Harlingen
truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   Cain eventually told agents that Wise and Grebe wanted him to
help further their separatist cause by intimidating President
Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno and other government officials
with death threats sent over the Internet. Cain said he told the
men he had devised a way to make it appear the e-mails were sent
from a computer in a public library.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials secretly videotaped a meeting last June 26, in
which the FBI informant sent the threats from his home computer as
Wise and Grebe drank wine and watched.
</P>
<P>
   The men were arrested last July as FBI agents, firefighters and
hazardous materials experts raided Wise's lakeside trailer home and
confiscated chemical drums and jars of liquid, which later proved
to contain the ingredients for making orange marmalade and soap. No
weapons were found. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; During a two-week trial last October, federal prosecutors told
the jury that the plotters had discussed developing home-grown
strains of rabies and anthrax, coating cactus needles with them,
and using compressed gas from a disposable cigarette lighter to
shoot federal agents and their families with the poisoned darts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors conceded no weapons were ever made by the
defendants, who were acquitted on a charge of conspiring to use
weapons of mass destruction as well as five other counts of sending
threatening messages to Clinton, U.S. Customs, the FBI, the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Wise and Grebe were convicted for sending two threatening
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cain, an informant the FBI paid $18,000 for his time, testified
that Wise said one of the first victims of the unusual weapon would
be a Brownsville county court-at-law judge who had not allowed
Republic of Texas members to act as their own attorneys in her
court.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's sentencing, defense attorneys Uhles and Dan Hering
asked for a new trial and a verdict of acquittal, again claiming
Cain and the FBI had fabricated the case against their clients.
Judge Tagle denied the motions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A third defendant, Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, was acquitted by the
same jury that convicted Wise and Grebe. He attended the sentencing
on Friday and although he could be heard grousing about the Federal
Reserve Board, the Trilateral Commission and international
corporations, he would not comment on the sentences given his two
associates.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, several Republic of Texas supporters
disparaged the court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw history repeated,'' said Louise Grady of Alvin. ``I mean
what happened before World War II, with Nazi Germany and Italy.
Heil Hitler, that's what I saw in there. There's no justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total fraud,'' added Sam Pyka of Edna. ``We ain't got
no court system left. You can't get a fair trial ... It's like the
monetary system...''

COMMENTARY: THE WHITE PANTHERS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reasonable boomers can always disagree on exactly when the '60s
died _ was it the day the Beatles' ``Revolution'' popped up in a
Nike TV ad? _ but there will be no dispute about when the '60s were
embalmed. It's happening this weekend on NBC, which has turned the
decade into a sweeps-month mini-series that, however earnest,
suggests what ``Hair'' might look like as a Disney theme-park
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   You can actually see far more of the '60s, in all their idealism
and over-the-top rage, by looking at their legacy in the now-waning
'90s _ our most contentious decade since. The best of the '60s has
been permanently absorbed into the body politic, from the
principles of the civil rights movement to the skepticism with
which many Americans view ill-defined military action. The worst of
the '60s is also still with us, but, in a bizarre ideological role
reversal, many of the left's most egregious excesses of 30 years
ago have been co-opted by the right in the '90s, even as Bill
Clinton sometimes appropriates the conservatism of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for pure hatred of government and the
``elites'' that run it _ the anger aimed at Robert McNamara and the
rest of the Ivy-League-educated Vietnam policy architects of the
'60s _ look only as far as the anti-establishment barking of Tom
DeLay, Bob Barr and other warriors of the Contract With America
Congress that shut down the government during Newt Gingrich's
short-lived ``revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find the kind of holier-than-thou scorn that '60s
protesters once heaped on what they saw as the immoral ``silent
majority'' who supported the Vietnam War, you can find it, too, on
the right; the ``death of outrage'' amen corner apocalyptically
decries the immorality and vulgarity of the current American
majority who refuse to support the prosecution of the president.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find a '90s music-and-pantheism be-in to rival
Woodstock, seek out the Promise Keepers.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Unabomber, whose cryptic polemics
ranged from vaguely leftist to completely nuts, almost all the
mad-dog radical violence of the '90s also comes from the right.
Weathermen-style '60s terrorism is the model for the Oklahoma City
bombing, the Atlanta Olympics park bombing, the bombing of abortion
clinics and the murdering of doctors who perform abortions. ``Off
the pigs'' anti-law-enforcement rhetoric is also now a conservative
staple, whether it's the NRA's Waco-inspired campaign to brand
federal agents as ``jackbooted government thugs'' or Robert Bork's
call for elected officials to ``simply refuse to comply'' with
Supreme Court decisions they find reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Bork's latent flirtation with civil disobedience evokes
nostalgia for the delight with which Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and
the rest of the Chicago 7 so memorably taunted Judge Julius
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives aren't above trashing military leaders of William
Westmoreland rank, either _ witness the efforts of Gary Bauer and
others to impugn the integrity of Colin Powell when the general
toyed with running for president in '96. Nor, like '60s draft
resisters, do they believe in the glory of Vietnam combat. Steve
Forbes, George W. Bush, Dan Quayle, Rush Limbaugh and Lamar
Alexander, among other soldiers of the right, let others fight the
war while they helped themselves to deferments or cushy stateside
stints in the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite William Bennett's boast that he once dated Janis Joplin,
the radical rightists of the '90s do not mimic their leftist models
of the '60s in drugs and rock-and-roll _ though they do seem to
pore over the sexual passages of the Starr report as their
predecessors once did ``Tropic of Cancer'' and the Kama Sutra.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, generally, do they emulate '60s radicals in championing the
poor and demonizing the rich. But this, too, may soon change.
Chatting with Larry King to promote his much-awaited new
presidential campaign in January, Dan Quayle talked up the plight
of unemployed steelworkers and the hungry while knocking the ``real
rich'' and ``fat cats,'' whom he defined as corporate officers who
collect stock options and don't work with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed that Quayle would push ``power to the
people,'' much as Marxist rebels of sometimes similarly affluent
origins did on campus three decades ago? As they might say in the
mini-series, maybe he's just on a bad trip.

   ATLANTA _ AirTran will provide flights between Gulfport/Biloxi,
Miss., and six Southeastern cities, including Atlanta, in a
marketing pact with a new gambling resort.
</P>
<P>
   Twice-daily Atlanta-Gulfport flights start March 15, the carrier
said Friday. Travelers can buy air-only tickets through AirTran or
a travel agent, or a package from Beau Rivage Resort, which opens
March 16. Fares weren't announced.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran spokeswoman Cara Maruskin said the carrier will use four
to six of its 49 planes for the Gulfport operation. She said
schedules on some existing routes may be trimmed to make more
aircraft available.
</P>
<P>
   One byproduct of the deal, however, could be new
Atlanta-Nashville flights this spring. AirTran doesn't currently
serve Nashville, one of the five other destinations from Gulfport
under terms of the Beau Rivage deal.
</P>
<P>
   Once Nashville is part of its route system, Maruskin said, the
airline probably will start Atlanta-Nashville service as well.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran didn't disclose financial terms of the Beau Rivage pact.
``It's mutually beneficial,'' Maruskin said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first deal of its type. Nevada-based Reno Air in
1996 flew from Gulfport to Atlanta and two other cities under a
guaranteed-profit deal with the region's tourism authority, but it
has dropped the service. Only Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a
commuter affiliate of Delta Air Lines, has Atlanta-Gulfport
service.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and businesses in Gulfport have long sought to boost
air service to attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, Fla.-based AirTran has spent the past 18 months
building its Atlanta hub and trying to woo business travelers.
Maruskin said that strategy will continue in Atlanta, but added the
Gulfport service, aimed at a different clientele, was ``an
opportunity for productive use of the assets involved.''
</P>
<P>
   She said AirTran agreed to assign new Boeing 717s to the
Gulfport routes by early 2000. That could slow the replacement rate
of older DC-9s in AirTran's Atlanta-based fleet.

 &HT;    AGL Resources sees decline in net income
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AGL Resources Inc., parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co.,
reported Friday that losses in a wholesale gas marketing venture
were largely responsible for a 38 percent decline in net income for
the first fiscal quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The results were reported following an annual shareholders
meeting at Cobb Galleria Centre. Walter M. Higgins, president and
chief executive, faced an angry investor who demanded he resign
because of furor over Atlanta Gas Light Co. rates that resulted in
high gas bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened on my watch, and it is an intolerable mistake.
There's no sidestepping that,'' Higgins said in the latest in a
series of public apologies by the company. Higgins said much of his
compensation is based on the company's performance and that
directors could well ``fire me or cut my pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins received more than $1.4 million in compensation for the
eight months he was on the job during the 1998 fiscal year,
including a one-time $750,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light and the Public Service Commission reached a
settlement that led to a new rate structure and refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members said they retain confidence in Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be the last hiccup,'' said D. Raymond Riddle,
retired chairman of National Service Industries, who credited the
CEO for leading the utility into a deregulated market. ``He's
plowing new ground.''
</P>
<P>
   AGL reported net income for the first fiscal quarter ended Dec.
31 totaled $15.9 million, or 28 cents a share, down from $25.7
million, or 45 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue was $323.9
million, down from $399.1 million. The company attribued the drop
in revenue to warmer weather.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the ``primary factor'' for the decline in
earnings was a net loss of $4.1 million, or 11 cents a share, from
its 35 percent stake in Sonat Marketing Co., a joint wholesale gas
marketing venture operated by Birmingham, Ala.-based Sonat.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the company was ``very disappointed'' with losses
from the venture, which he said were due primarily to nonrecurring
charges taken to reconcile gas transactions thrown out of whack by
the weather and market conditions. Warm weather also affected the
venture's profitability, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said AGL is re-evaluating the venture. But excluding the
losses, he said, AGL's income met expectations for the quarter with
earnings of 39 cents per share. Analysts had expected 38 cents per
share, according to First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins told shareholders Atlanta Gas Light lost $3 million on
the sale of gas in Georgia during the quarter, despite customers'
accusactions of price-gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Scaturro of Acworth, who identified himself as a
shareholder for 30 years, told Higgins during a question-and-answer
session that the utility had slipped from standing as ``one of the
most respected'' companies to ``one of the most despised'' during
his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to be responsible for it,'' Scaturro said. ``I
think you folks should go.''
</P>
<P>
   AGL's stock, which closed at $19, off 37 1/2 cents, is down
nearly 18 percent year to date.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said his future is up to the board. ``But I don't think
they hired me to, at the first sign that something's wrong, to
throw in my hat.

 &HT;    '99 Tahoe an off-road warrior
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If bigger really is better _ and there's a segment of
the market that agrees with that theory _ when the goal is going
off-road, then the '99 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 is a certified winner.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the 4,500-pound Tahoe Z71 measurements: More than 16
feet long with a 117.5-inch wheelbase and almost 6 feet tall with a
width to match (76.8 inches). That puts the driver and occupants up
where the view is virtually unobstructed by other vehicles and, in
fact, means the waist-high headlamps of the Z71 glare directly at
the rearview mirrors of vehicles in front.
</P>
<P>
   But to drive the Z71 is to understand why it's a favorite of
serious off-roaders. It's got a minimum of 7 inches of ground
clearance and plenty of low-speed power. While it has some body
lean, like all Tahoes, the Z71 has the heft to retain its stability
in just about all situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Z71 is a paved-road warrior, too, with a four-wheel-drive
system that changes from low to high and into two-wheel-drive mode
with the push of dash-mounted buttons. The best part of this is an
automatic setting that permits the system to monitor traction and
automatically divert power to the wheels with the most grip.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the new Z71 version going isn't akin to the
give-it-gas-and-wait characteristic of some past and current
full-size sport-utilities, either. A serious-duty 6.5-liter diesel
engine is available, but the standard _ and only _ gasoline
powerplant is GMC's 5.7-liter V-8. It summons 255 horsepower at
4,600 engine rpm with its maximum of 330 pounds-feet of torque
coming on at a mere 2,800 rpm. It can easily tow up to about 6,500
pounds and has a load capacity of about 1,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy/GMC Tahoe certainly isn't aimed at a niche market _
sport-utility sales continue to boom _ and it appeals to a segment
that also may consider the slightly longer sibling Suburban, the
cushier Lincoln Navigator or imports. And don't forget Lincoln
isn't the only upscale marque involved _ Cadillac, Lexus and
Infiniti are in on the sport-utility act.
</P>
<P>
   As time spent on metro area expressways and even in the city
proved, the Tahoe is a go-anywhere vehicle. But it can make
two-lane roads and parking spaces seem small, gulps gas, and the
steering wheel requires constant attention. The steering's a bit
shy of feel, and there was a slight but definite tendency to wander
in the test vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The ride on pavement is good, though, because of the heavy-duty
suspension's ability to soak up irregularities and outright bumps.
The Tahoe Z71 is too serious about off-road work and hauling cargo
as well as people to be mistaken for a luxury sport-utility, but
standard creature comforts are there.
</P>
<P>
   The big, comfortable seats can be done in leather and given
power adjustments, the basically good stereo can add a CD player,
and power windows and locks and keyless entry also add appeal. Nice
little touches include a rear-view mirror with compass, good drink
holders on the dash, center console and rear fold-down armrest, and
plenty of storage/cargo spaces. But the really strong point of the
Tahoes and the off-road-oriented Z71 remains size and strength _
and both features are better than good.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 four-wheel drive,
four-door sport-utility vehicle
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $37,637 (base: $32,300)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: reduced-force dual front air bags, power
anti-lock brakes with front discs and rear drums, side-impact
beams, height-adjustable shoulder belts at outboard positions,
daytime running lights
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 5.7 liter V-8 engine (255 horsepower), four-speed
automatic overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle include: rear air conditioning, leather
high-back reclining heated seats, upgraded stereo with CD/cassette
players, off-road suspension, graphite brush guards, heavy-duty
trailering package, 245/75R16 all-terrain tires
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 12 mpg regular unleaded city, 16 mpg highway

MANDELA: PROGRESS MADE, BUT SOUTH AFRICA STILL SICK FROM
APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ President Nelson Mandela gave his
last state of the nation speech to Parliament Friday, highlighting
the successes of South Africa's first post-apartheid government and
calling for the nation's blacks and whites to stop ``slaughtering''
each other with their ``words'' and ``attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute speech, Mandela, whose term expires this year,
touched on issues ranging from the number of citizens who now have
clean water and electricity to the country's need for a
``reconstruction and development program'' for the soul. He also
acknowledged the growing perception here that racial tensions are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   While he chastised both blacks and whites for their attitudes,
some of his rebukes were clearly aimed more at whites _ the group
more likely to travel abroad and disparage the new government or
question its poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We slaughter one another in the stereotypes and mistrust that
linger in our heads,'' he said, ``and the words of hate we spew
from our lips. We slaughter one another in the responses that some
of us give to efforts aimed at bettering the lives of the poor. We
slaughter one another and our country by the manner in which we
exaggerate our weaknesses to the wider world, heroes of the gab who
astound their foreign associates by their self-flagellation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This must come to an end,'' Mandela said. ``For indeed, those
who thrive on hatred destroy their own capacity to make a positive
contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mandela also took aim at the whole of society, saying that
five years after the country elected its first black president
there was still much to be done in remaking its soul. South Africa,
he said, was still sick from more than four decades under apartheid
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite clearly there is something wrong with a society where
freedom is interpreted to mean that teachers or students get to
school drunk; warders chase away management and appoint their own
friends to lead institutions; striking workers resort to violence
and destruction of property; business people lavish money in court
cases simply to delay implementation of legislation they do not
like; and tax evasion turns individuals into heroes of dinner-table
talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something drastic needs to be done about this,'' Mandela
continued. ``South African society _ in its schools and
universities, in the workplace, in the sports, in professional work
and all areas of social interaction _ needs to infuse itself with a
measure of discipline, a work ethic and responsibility for the
actions we undertake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's speech came as the country is gearing up for national
elections and his skills as a politician were apparent as he took
careful note of his government's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a moment for the country to take stock of how
far it had come and to enjoy the performance of a man who is
beloved by South Africans of all races.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the 80-year-old Mandela, who has always said he
would not run for a second term, proved that he had not lost his
touch for making an audience laugh.
</P>
<P>
   As he stopped for water after about an hour, he urged everyone
to give him credit for his impressive performance so far. ``Men of
80,'' he said, ``start coughing after uttering the first
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   And he used the speech to announce that the government would be
increasing the amount given to old-age pensioners by 20 rands, or
about $3.30 a month, an announcement he said he was very happy
about.
</P>
<P>
   He described how, at a recent economic conference in Davos,
Switzerland, he had warned that soon he would be out of a job, an
old man standing by the side of the road with a big sign saying:
``Unemployed! No money! A new wife! A big family!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with these 20 rands,'' Mandela said. ``I may not stand on
the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Mandela inventoried housing starts, health
programs, school feeding programs and a host of new legislation. He
assured the crime-weary public that there were signs of hope: the
country was full of initiatives, some of which were working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me reiterate,'' he said. ``The battle against crime has
been joined and we have no doubts at all who the victors will be.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite a high unemployment rate, he pointed out that the
economy had not been damaged by the world economic crisis, proof,
he said, that the country's ``fundamentals'' were in good order.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Mandela's opening of Parliament speeches were
rarely criticized much by opposition leaders. But this year, most
of them sought to score points in the campaign, saying Mandela had
been sent in to gloss over the government's problems.
</P>
<P>
   They also criticized him for not announcing any new programs to
combat crime and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Africans had hoped that Mandela would announce a date
for the holding of the elections this year, which are expected
before July. In his prepared text he said that the elections would
be between May 18 and 27. But in making the speech, he skipped the
relevant paragraph, apparently because of several lawsuits on
election procedures that are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who spent 27 years in prison for his efforts to
topple South Africa's former white supremacist government urged
South Africans to vote and to work hard not to succumb to
``arm-chair whining.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The long walk is not yet over,'' Mandela said. ``The prize of
a better life has yet to be won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation has been laid. The building is in progress.
With a new generation of leaders and a people that rolls up its
sleeves in partnerships for change, we can and shall build the
country of our dreams.''

   HUSSEIN ADVISORY FOR NEWS, INTERNATIONAL EDITORS:
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service is preparing an obituary in preparation for the
death of Jordan's ailing King Hussein. The obituary, written by Cox
Newspapers Middle East correspondent Larry Kaplow, will move in the
International category within minutes of the official announcement
of the king's death. The story slugged JORDAN-NOOR, which moved
Wednesday for Thursday papers, is also being updated _ for those
Cox papers that have not run the story _ to reflect the king's
death and will also move in both the International and Lifestyle
categories. Cox News Service also anticipates President Clinton
will attend the funeral of King Hussein and expects White House
correspondent Bob Deans to travel with the president.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HUSSEIN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ As they wait and pray for their
ailing king, Jordanians expect the worst. Though the royal palace
was not very forthcoming with information on King Hussein's
apparently grave condition Friday, his loyal subjects know that
their ruler -- the only one that the vast majority of whom have
known in their lifetime --will not be with them much longer. The
mood of the country and its people. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service).

death.

   CUBA-TOURISM _ HAVANA, Cuba _ Delightfully off-limits to most
Americans, I first visited communist Cuba in 1991 simply because I
wasn't supposed to. I had no idea what to expect. But it was like
traveling into a time warp. Rusty Russian Lada cars rattled
alongside 40-year-old Chevrolets. Old-fashioned pharmacies
displayed traditional glass and ceramic medicine jars. Billboards
of the bearded revolutionary hero, Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara,
dominated the roadsides. As a so-called ``forbidden zone,'' this
Pennsylvania-sized island just 90 miles off the South Florida shore
was certainly lacking _ there were few Americans and few T-shirts
to buy, few tacky souvenirs to browse, and no McDonald's. I
couldn't have been happier. On the downside, there was little to
eat, even in the best state-run restaurants, and few hotels that
could _ even with a stretch _ be labeled anything close to
luxurious. Still, I was hooked. (Emling, Cox News Service).

REDUCING MURDER CHARGES FOR IRA GANG MEMBERS COMPLICATES PEACE
EFFORT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ A special court Friday sentenced four members of an
Irish Republican Army gang to terms of 11 to 14 years for killing
an Irish detective in a robbery in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences were handed down two days after prosecutors had
dropped charges of murder, which carries a minimum 40-year term,
and let the four plead guilty to manslaughter, a decision that
complicates the Northern Ireland peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and the police indicated that their murder case had
collapsed because crucial witnesses had been intimidated and
refused to repeat in court what they had told the police.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all parties, newspaper editorials and hundreds of
callers to radio stations expressed outrage, asserting that the IRA
had, as it has in the past, threatened witnesses and effectively
thwarted the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Times said in an editorial on Thursday: ``The lesser
charge of manslaughter may suit the purpose of those who want to
buttress the Belfast Agreement. It is a disturbing and distressing
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the implication that the reduced
charge was a government concession to the IRA was preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is to debate the decision next week, although the
government has no authority to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Former Justice Minister Desmond O'Malley seemed to reflect the
mood of the country when he noted that the killers were members of
Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing, and that to describe the killing
``as anything less than murder is a travesty of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former Justice Minister, Nora Owen, said the prosecutors
should have pressed the murder case, even at the risk that it might
fail and the accused would be freed. The judges, Ms. Owen argued,
could have then imposed a manslaughter decision and sentence if the
murder case failed.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge court was set up to prevent the intimidation of
jurors in trials that involved organized crime and terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The four men sentenced Friday admitted that they had killed
Detective Sgt. Jerry McCabe in an attempt to rob a bank van in the
western town of Adare. The police said the attack was to obtain
money for the IRA, which has admitted its responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving 14-year terms were Pearse McCauley and Kevin Walsh,
both of whom could be released after 10 years. Walsh was said by
the police to have done the shooting. A sentence of 12 years was
given to Jeremiah Sheehy, and an 11-year term to Michael O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, without the testimony of the reluctant
witnesses, one of whom was jailed for contempt of court, feared
that it could not prove who pulled the trigger of the Kalashnikov
automatic rifle that fired 15 bullets into McCabe from close range.
Escorting bank trucks is standard duty for Irish police officers
and, sometimes, the army.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences stimulated a rare disagreement between Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern and the Sinn Fein leadership. The chief
negotiator for Sinn Fein, Martin McGuinness, said the four killers
should be eligible for early release in the next 15 months under
the terms of the peace agreement, which provides for the early
release of all paramilitary prisoners by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahern repeated forcefully his promise that the four would
not be released early. In interviews, he said: ``These people will
serve their sentences. I am glad to see the murderers of Jerry
McCabe convicted. Jerry McCabe was murdered, as far as I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is certain to become part of the dispute in Northern
Ireland over disarming the IRA and the full participation of Sinn
Fein in the new Northern Ireland Assembly. The assembly is trying
to enact the provisions of the peace accord approved last year to
end sectarian violence in the British province of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that the peace effort was crumbling also were provoked by
the IRA announcement on Thursday that some of its weapons had been
stolen by dissident guerrillas who oppose the cease-fire, now in
its 17th month.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the Protestant first minister of the Assembly,
insists that the IRA has to start disarming before Sinn Fein is
given ministerial positions in the Assembly. Sinn Fein insists,
accurately, that the peace agreement does not require disarmament
until May 2000.

FEDERAL AGENCY CURTAILS MENTAL ILLNESS STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ The National Institute of Mental Health has
suspended some controversial studies that seek to induce psychotic
symptoms in mentally ill patients and has begun to review all its
funding of such research, the institute director said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven E. Hyman, who left Boston more than two years ago to
head the nation's mental health research agency, also won approval
Friday for a more stringent review of proposed studies to induce
psychosis or withdraw or deny medication from mentally ill
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be funding research that will produce
harm,'' Hyman said at a meeting of the National Advisory Mental
Health Council, which unanimously approved his plan to create a new
grant review subcommittee. That panel will be composed of council
members, outside bioethicists, and people with mental illness or
their family members.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended studies used ketamine, an approved anesthetic drug
that also is abused on the streets for its hallucinogenic
properties under such names as ``Special K.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (studies) on our campus have stopped,'' Hyman said in an
interview, adding that new subjects had not been enrolled in
ketamine studies at the Bethesda-based institute for about a year.
The institute is now reviewing its funding of outside research
involving ketamine, Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine has been used in people with mental illness and in
healthy ``volunteers'' to study the biology of psychosis. In a
four-part series three months ago, The Boston Globe focused
attention on reports of harm done to some mentally ill volunteers
by studies that involved administering ketamine and other drugs or
withdrawing or denying medication for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman and other officials at the National Institute of Mental
Health have said their review of the studies began before the Globe
series. But an article two weeks ago in the journal Science cited
the ``devastating four-part series full of research horror
stories'' as having mobilized the agency to step up its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Other publications also have focused on the issue. Hyman called
some accounts sensational, but acknowledged that they highlighted a
growing public mistrust of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will chill and kill clinical research will be the loss of
public trust,'' he said in proposing the new review process.
</P>
<P>
   Institute officials said their ketamine studies had been
suspended for lack of scientific merit following a review last
month, but they denied that patients had been harmed. If study
designs are improved, that line of research could start up again,
said Clarissa Wittenberg, an institute spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said the agency is studying its options on how to proceed
with outside ketamine research it funds. Yale University, the
University of Maryland, and others are among those receiving
institute funding for ketamine studies.
</P>
<P>
   The agency could do anything from alerting outside researchers
of its concerns to suspending funding, Wittenberg said. ``We could
do a great deal,'' she said, adding that ``the message is getting
out pretty clearly on where the institute is standing on all of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute's actions have angered some psychiatric
researchers who are concerned that it will have a chilling effect
on scientific advancement, but it earned praise from people with
mental illness and their advocates. Hyman said he has received
``hate mail'' from some researchers and fan letters from advocates.
</P>
<P>
   In the journal Science two weeks ago, a number of scientists
criticized Hyman's proposal for an extra subcommittee to review
studies that induce psychosis or withdraw medications.
</P>
<P>
   But one professional organization, the American Psychiatric
Association, put its support squarely behind the new review process
Friday. In a statement, Dr. Steven M. Mirin, medical director of
the 40,000-member group, said: ``The issue is how to craft
protections for research participants so they do not unnecessarily
and inappropriately impinge on the pursuit of new treatments of
these devastating disorders. The proposals . . . meet this test.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates, however, said the institute is not doing enough.
Adil Shamoo, a University of Maryland bioethicist, welcomed the
suspension of the ketamine studies but added, ``The important
question is, are they stopped temporarily or permanently?''
</P>
<P>
   Shamoo and Vera Hassner Sharav, cofounders of the New York-based
Citizens for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and Research, have
called for a moratorium on studies that induce psychosis or
withdraw medications.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to make research more accountable, the
National Institute of Mental Health also won approval for a plan
that would, for the first time, add lay people to some of its
research review groups, known as ``study sections.'' Such groups
take the first look at grant applications and assess their merit.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the American Psychological Association
objected to the plan in remarks before the National Advisory Mental
Health Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing up for a principle and a cherished institution _
peer review,'' said Richard C. McCarty, the association's executive
director for science. Lay people who may have interests other than
assessing scientific merit may turn the process into one of ``mixed
review'' or ``political review,'' he said.

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES LEAD A VOLATILE MARKET LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The word ASTERISK in parentheses has been used three times
instead of the symbol, which is non-transmittable to many newspaper
systems.) 
(lb) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks tumbled Friday, and most of the
rest of the stock market followed in a day of volatile trading. For
the week, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 5.3
percent, its worst one-week decline since October.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices also fell as a stronger-than-expected employment
report for January confirmed that the economy is barreling ahead
and made it more likely that investors would face an increase in
interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index dropped 36.45 points Friday, or 1.51 percent,
to 2,373.62, and is off 4.85 percent in the last two days. It did
trim its worst losses in the afternoon, however, bouncing back from
a decline of 63 points, or 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rallied at the end to finish
off just 0.26 point at 9,304.24, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's index
of 500 stocks dropped 9.09 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,239.40.
The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks fell 5.07 points,
or 1.21 percent, to 412.72.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell
30/32, to 98 17/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, rose to 5.35 percent from 5.29 percent on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the decline in technology stocks were Intel, Cisco
Systems, Oracle and Dell Computer. Investors seemed to be worrying
that a new price war between Advanced Micro Devices, the world's
No. 2 chip maker, and the leader, Intel, could cut into technology
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro warned on Thursday that it might have a
first-quarter loss because it had been forced to cut prices to
compete with Intel. Its stock has dropped 19.7 percent in the last
two days and closed Friday at 16 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco fell 4 on Friday, to 101\, while Oracle dropped 2 1/8, to
56 3/16. Dell Computer, which hit a high on Tuesday of 108 5/8,
slipped to 100 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cliggott, the U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities, said that the technology sector just ``went up too far,
too fast, and this is truly a healthy consolidation.'' Even with
this week's decline, he added, the Nasdaq index is up 8.25 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   E(ASTERISK)Trade Group, the online brokerage firm whose trading
system was down for several hours on Wednesday and Thursday, had a
brief shutdown Friday, from 12:20 p.m. to 12:49 p.m. Its stock fell
as low as 45 1/16 and then rallied a little. But it still finished
the day lower, down 4 9/16, at 48 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Balint, the president of E(ASTERISK)Trade International,
said that fewer than 5 percent of its customers were affected by
the trading interruptions. She would not comment on whether
E(ASTERISK)Trade would compensate investors for any losses. But she
said that ``from a customer relationship perspective, we will try
to do what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The volatility of Internet stocks was also reflected in this
week's performance of Siebert Financial, another online brokerage
firm. A week ago Friday, its stock closed at 12 5/16. Then it
zoomed to an intraday high of 70 5/8 on Thursday. But it finished
the week on Friday at 35 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for investors and analysts lately has been figuring
out whether and when the economy might slow. As 1998 ended, many
economists were predicting that economic growth would slow this
year from the brisk 3.9 percent pace of the last two years. But in
the last several weeks, economists have been revising their
moderate growth forecasts upward as data from employment to factory
orders indicate that the economy is not slowing yet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has raised its 1999 growth forecast to about 3
percent or 3.5 percent from an estimate of 2 percent just two
months ago. And Friday's job data, which showed nonfarm payroll
jobs up 245,000, almost twice the forecast, will probably prompt
more revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the data that has come in has suggested that the economy
is more resilient than we had thought,'' said James Glassman,
senior U.S. economist for the Chase Manhattan Bank. But the bank is
sticking to its forecast of 1 percent growth for now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This unexpected economic strength may be positive for the stock
market, because it could bolster corporate earnings. In raising its
economic growth forecast, Merrill Lynch also changed its outlook
for earnings for the companies in the S&AMP;P 500, predicting 3.5
percent growth rather than a 5 percent decline. But much higher
interest rates could drag stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   For bond investors, the threat of a rate increase by the Fed is
not a positive. Continued low inflation, more good news on worker
productivity and concern about the financial fragility in the rest
of the world could keep the central bank on hold for some time,
however.
</P>
<P>
   With this week's losses, the stock market is having a more
modest beginning to 1999 than it appeared just a couple of weeks
ago. The Dow industrial average is now up 1.34 percent for the year
and the S&AMP;P 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that investors may have the same feeling. While money
is still flowing into stock mutual funds, it came in last month at
the slowest pace since 1995, according to AMG Data Services. Net
inflows totaled just under $13 billion last month. And in the first
week of February, investors withdrew $2.9 billion from equity
funds, according to AMG.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ As Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland tried
Friday to reassure naysayers that his plan to move the New England
Patriots here was not in trouble, more problems with the proposed
stadium here emerged behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a steam plant that needs to be removed from the
downtown location, authorities are now grappling with the fact that
junctions for nearly all of the city's main utility lines are under
the land there, according to people familiar with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the state, which is obliged to buy parcels from
several companies to assemble the site in time for construction by
the summer of 2000, underestimated how much money some property
owners would seek to clear out in time, those individuals say.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office, in its haste to put the $350 million deal
together in virtual secrecy, was unaware of the complexity
surrounding those issues until only recently, those sources said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, negotiations on securing the site have dragged on,
causing Rowland and team owner Robert Kraft to miss two target
dates for signing the final development agreement, a 250-page
document that lays out in detail how the stadium would get built
and when.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Rowland was silent on the specific issues that are
holding up the plan but he hinted at some of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you are on what I kindly call the death watch,''
Rowland said at an afternoon news conference that was originally
scheduled as a ceremony to sign the final agreement. ``Is this
really going to happen? Is something going to go wrong? If this
were easy this would have been done a long time ago. And we're not
going into a virgin piece of property without any problems
whatsoever or existing tenants. But I will share with you that the
discussions with CTG have been very fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   CTG Resources Inc., which owns the steam plant that heats and
cools many of Hartford's buildings, has been negotiating with a
quasi-public power facility to provide energy to that section of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But those talks have been stalled, forcing Rowland to hire an
outside mediator to help both sides find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich Gray, who's my representative, has had a lot of
discussions with the parties involved and I think you're going to
see some significant progress on that issue in the next few
weeks,'' Rowland said. ``CTG does want to leave that site. You saw
them all at the various signings, the bill signing, the MOU
signing.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday _ in the same room where Kraft and Rowland signed their
preliminary agreement last November, surrounded by executives from
the steam plant and crowds of other project supporters -- there was
no one standing behind either man.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's wife Myra was off to the side along with a couple of
spokesmen and other aides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite somber appearances, Kraft said he still believes the
deal will go through, although he sidestepped a question near end
of the news conference about whether he would sign the agreement
even if the steam plant and other issues remained outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I know, as of today, there's no doubt in my mind
that this will happen,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the development agreement would be released and
signed next week, atlhough he did not specify a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are changes, movements, issues that arise between now
and 2001, by mutual agreement, we can make those changes,'' Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he hinted that some of the problems with the location along
the Connecticut River would not be ironed out before the document
is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development agreement...is not contingent upon the site
and all the other information being completed right now,'' the
governor said, ``In other words, we do not have to have at this
moment the complete proposal, where the plant is going to go and
how it's going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plant cannot be moved or the state cannot afford to
compensate all the private land owners or move the water and gas
lines beneath the land, ``then Robert Kraft and John Rowland sit
down and make whatever changes need to take place,'' the governor
added.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland declined to ``play the what-if game'' and name
alternative sites, if any exist. ``It's going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The major stumbling block appears to be CTG, which has to remove
its headquarters and plant. But Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance
Co. and The Travelers have some parking lots on the land, which
will have to be replaced if employees are going to have a place for
their vehicles after the $1 billion Adriaen's Landing project --
which encompasses the stadium -- is built.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rowland did not return several calls. And a
spokesman for the Patriots declined to comment.

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky was stung enough to object to the
prosecutor's use of the word ``salacious'' in her deposition for
President Clinton's impeachment trial. But otherwise she showed the
bravura demeanor that comes of being one of the most practiced
criminal investigation witnesses in the annals of presidential
history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Can you call it something else?'' she countered with a
question of her own when the prosecutor, Rep. Ed Bryant, asked
about ``so-called salacious'' occasions of the president's
misbehavior with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this is _ this is my relationship,'' Ms. Lewinsky
declared, firmly defending her own memory of events against the
tidal wave of lurid curiosity that has loomed across the year of
scandal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you like to call it?'' Bryant asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first encounter with the president,'' Ms. Lewinsky
noted, ``so I don't really see it as my first salacious _ that's
not what this was.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony made public on Friday from her Feb. 1 trial
deposition, Ms. Lewinsky gave further convincing evidence not so
much about the impeachment charges as about her own strengths as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope for bombshell testimony harbored by the House
Republican prosecutors dissipated across the 17-page deposition
text unveiled in the Congressional Record as Ms. Lewinsky displayed
her witness talents to defuse, amuse and, Bryant later complained
to the Senate, to confuse him, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more and more like one of the characters in the classic
movie, `Witness for the Prosecution,' '' he rather sadly told the
Senate on Thursday, comparing Ms. Lewinsky with the guileful
Marlene Dietrich character who made a noir art of testifying on the
silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   With care and calm, levity and conviction, Ms. Lewinsky appeared
to hold her own against Bryant for all his years of criminal court
practice. After a year of cross-country commuting as a witness, she
seemed to offer more irony than confusion when, asked routinely if
she lived in California, she replied, ``I'm not sure exactly where
I'm living right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was early in the deposition that Bryant, a Tennessee
Republican, chosen in the hope that he and his gentle twang might
establish rapport, haltingly sought to question Ms. Lewinsky about
presidential misbehavior. He fumbled at the outset. ``OK, um, tell
me how you, um, began _ I guess the _ the _ we're going to talk
about a relationship with the president,'' Bryant tried.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, Ms. Lewinsky referred him to the voluminous record
already existing about all that from her score of earlier sessions
of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there something more specific?'' she replied, one of many
times she questioned the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated as he sought fresh ground, Bryant observed, ``We're
obviously going to have to talk about, uh, some things for eight
hours here, or else we can go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds good to me,'' Ms. Lewinsky shot back, drawing a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   As she testified, she spoke clearly in behalf of herself _
``Monica Samille Lewinsky'' _ and no one else, rebuffing Bryant's
attempt to have her flatly contradict the president's insistence
that the two were never actually alone together. She rephrased the
question with a certain flair: ``If you ask me, `Monica, were you
alone with the president?' I will say yes, but I'm not comfortable
characterizing what someone else says.''
</P>
<P>
   She often used plain language during her deposition, admitting
that she was ``scared'' at being subpoenaed in the Paula Jones
suit, that she cried when she was banished from the White House and
that she was touched by the president's giving her a hat pin. ``It
was the first gift he gave me,'' she said. ``It was a thoughtful
gift. It was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was hardly awash in emotion when asked whether she still
harbored ``feelings'' for Clinton. She offered a calibrated answer.
``I have mixed feelings,'' she noted, carefully drawing a
distinction between the president and the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume you think he's a very intelligent man?'' came the
question, and her answer drew laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's an intelligent president.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, she exhibited a Clintonian way with the meaning of
words, as when questioned about her affadavit defending the
president in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant: ``Were portions of it false?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``Incomplete and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   A go-getter's quality was implicit throughout, particularly when
she described mastering the handicap of holding only a pink
intern's pass limited to surrounding buildings and not the White
House itself: she had a friend with the requisite blue pass first
escort her closer to the Oval Office. Of the job search effort when
she aimed to move to New York, she said she was a ``pest,'' not a
conspirator against justice.
</P>
<P>
   She breezily defined what ``a vanilla story'' is _ a concocted,
self-protecting version of reality. She laughed in recalling an
early meeting with a lawyer as the long court bout first erupted,
``I asked if I could sue Paula Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   And she was unapologetic about her storied loquaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Lewinsky, did you tell a number of people in varying
details about your relationship with the president?'' Bryant asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catherine Allday Davis, Neysa Deman Erbland, Natalie Ungvari,
Ashley Raines, Linda Tripp, Dr. Kathy Estep, Dr. Irene Kassorla,
Andy Bleiler, my mom, my aunt,'' she quickly replied.
</P>
<P>
   Then she interrogated the prosecutor again: ``Who else has been
subpoenaed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you mention Dale Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Young. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky had to pause when asked about the telephone call
from the president informing her she was on the witness list for
the Paula Jones lawsuit that first signaled trouble ahead. Bryant
inquired if the president said anything about how he felt that she
was being targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it broke his heart,'' she responded. After that
answer, Ms. Lewinsky asked, ``Can I take a break, please? I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the session, the practiced witness could not resist bits
of lawyering as when she responded to a question by reminding
Bryant he must first lay a foundation. ``I haven't said anything
about that meeting yet,'' she politely instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant genially apologized further along for a complex question.
``I'm getting good,'' he said to light laughter. ``I'm making my
own objections now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky instantly topped him, ``Um, we sustain those.''

 &HT;    8 more hospitals move under Emory umbrella
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eight more hospitals in metro Atlanta will soon sport
the high-profile Emory name.
</P>
<P>
   The name-changes follow the closing this week of a joint venture
agreement between nonprofit Emory Healthcare and for-profit
Columbia/HCA Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, first announced in November, moves eight Columbia
hospitals and five surgery centers into a for-profit organization,
called EHCA. Emory will oversee the medical care in those
facilities, while Columbia will run day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from the joint venture will be split between the two
organizations. It's likely, though, Columbia would get a slightly
higher percentage. EHCA will be governed by a board represented
equally by Emory and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the metrowide marketing will be under the Emory
Healthcare banner, Charles Keaton, a Columbia executive who will be
EHCA's chief executive, said Friday. That system would now offer
comprehensive services and geographic distribution, which can
attract both patients and managed-care plans looking for broad
hospital networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever you go in Atlanta, there should be an Emory facility
near you,'' Keaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Johns, CEO of Emory Healthcare, will be chairman of
the board of EHCA, a limited liability corporation that will lease
the 13 facilities from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The new partnership sets up a strong head-to-head competition
with Promina Health System for patients.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture culminates an on-again, off-again courtship
between Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia and Emory that began five
years ago. It survived an immediate culture clash between the
hyper-aggressiveness of Columbia, under former CEO Richard Scott,
and the entrenched, academic institution of Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, though, has recently changed leadership and downsized
while contending with a federal investigation into possible
Medicare billing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For Columbia, ``there's a great deal to be gained with the Emory
name,'' Keaton said.
</P>
<P>
   For Emory, the deal expands its reach toward many suburban
patients looking for hospitals nearer their homes. Current Emory
facilities, such as Emory University Hospital and Emory's 18
outpatient centers, will remain separately run by Emory Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia hospitals involved are Cartersville Medical Center
in Cartersville; Dunwoody Medical Center in Dunwoody; Eastside
Medical Center in Snellville; Metropolitan Hospital in Atlanta;
Northlake Regional Medical Center in Tucker; Parkway Medical Center
in Lithia Springs; Peachtree Regional Hospital in Newnan; and West
Paces Medical Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   NAME-CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting an agreement between Emory Healthcare and
Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the eight metro Atlanta hospitals affected
by name changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cartersville Medical Center
</P>
<P>
   _ Dunwoody Medical Center
</P>
<P>
   _ Eastside Medical Center
</P>
<P>
   _ Metropolitan Hospital
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Nike, Reebok step out of Super Show
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd., two of the
biggest names in the sporting goods world, have pulled out of next
week's Super Show, saying they can't justify the millions of
dollars they spend to be part of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, the No. 1 shoe company in the world, controls more than 40
percent of the U.S. athletic shoe market. Reebok is the No. 2 U.S.
sports shoe maker.
</P>
<P>
   One sports marketing expert said the real reason behind Nike and
Reebok's departure might boil down to ego and image: The Super
Show's growth has eroded the two companies' dominance at the show.
</P>
<P>
   The show, at the Georgia World Congress Center, opens Friday to
more than 100,000 buyers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day show is the largest n the world, featuring more
than 400 categories of products in two million square feet of
space. It draws buyers from notable chains such as Norcross-based
The Sport Shoe to mom-and-pop stores.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which is closed to the public, brings to town
celebrity athletes who make paid appearances for exhibitors that
want to attract buyers to their displays. Last year's show featured
basketball stars Rebecca Lobo and Sheryl Swoopes, NASCAR driver
Richard Petty, volleyball great Karch Kiraly and Olympic gold-medal
swimmer Amy Van Dyken.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been held in Atlanta since its inception in 1986.
Producers stunned Atlanta officials last year by announcing the
event would move to Las Vegas after the Year 2000 show because it
has outgrown the space.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the trade group that owns the Super Show insisted
Friday it is as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with Nike and Reebok out, it's still the largest sporting
goods show in the world,'' said John Riddle, president of the
Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. ``There's always some
turnover in a major show.''
</P>
<P>
   Riddle conceded that other exhibitors _ ``no one else of major
significance'' _ have pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Nike and Reebok said Friday their decision to leave the show is
part of a new strategy to get more out of their marketing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok said it spent ``in the seven figures'' to be part of the
show; Nike declined to say how much it spent on its booth, but SGMA
spokesman Mike May said it spent about $3 million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Nike and Reebok may have been the main attraction, it's
(Super Show) still a multiring circus,'' said John Bevilaqua of
Creative Marketing Strategies Inc., a marketing communications firm
in Atlanta that specializes in sports marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike is a huge company that always like to run its own show.
They don't like sharing. They're big enough so they don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, it's not cheap. Nike, Reebok and others spend a large
amount of money. The question is partly ego and image, but it's
also sales-driven. Can you generate enough revenue to justify your
presence at the Super Show?''
</P>
<P>
   Stoughton, Mass.-based Reebok decided last fall to leave the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we could have a far more productive dialogue with
those customers in settings other than the Super Show,'' Reebok
spokesman Dave Fogelson said. ``We're really looking to go to
venues we control and manage, where retailers can get our undivided
attention and we can get their undivided attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Show's extensive hype of athletes also ``got to be
overdone,'' Fogelson said. ``You had long lines for autographs, but
it wasn't really doing anything for our business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show played a key role in generating a lot of the
excitement that surrounded the sporting good industry over the last
10 years. But things have slowed down. We need to be a lot smarter
about how we communicate with retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike, which has been an exhibitor since 1986, informed Super
Show officials last summer that it wouldn't return, citing, among
other things, economic problems in Asia, where it had seen an
increase in sales and orders in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nike Chairman Phil Knight's invitation-only presentation on the
show's opening day was a must-attend. And its stable of big-name
stars made it tops on buyers' must-see lists.
</P>
<P>
   Nike also has been rethinking its marketing strategy, Nike
spokeswoman Kathryn Reith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been discovering in recent years that the way our sales
calendar works, we've pretty much sold to many of the buyers that
come to the show (by the time of the show),'' she said. ``We spent
a fairly significant amount of money to create the displays at
Super Show, which, given the current economic climate in our
industry, we couldn't justify at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing tastes and declining sales aggravated the problem, she
said. And the once-hot demand for men's basketball shoes (Nike
sells a Air Agresse Force for $145) has cooled.
</P>
<P>
   The company laid off about 450 people in the United States in
March because of the slump in sales and the problems in Asia.

DEATH ROW INMATE, NOW BELIEVED INNOCENT, IS FREED AFTER 16 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis.)  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In an extraordinary move, prosecutors here arranged
for the release of a man who spent 16 years on death row and came
within a breath of being executed for a double murder it now
appears he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Porter wore a half-stunned, half-exultant smile as he
walked out of prison Friday. Gone were the prison jumpsuit and the
handcuffs. Gone, too, was the hard, flattened look of a man who has
been condemned to die.
</P>
<P>
   And the first thing he did was to make a beeline for the people
whose effort, it seems, has saved his life: five journalism
students at Northwestern University and their professor, who
investigated the case and found evidence that led another man to
confess to the murders this week. Porter bearhugged each one of
them in turn, scooping them up until their feet swung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels marvelous to be outside!'' Porter exulted. ``I'm
free!''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asked a judge to release Porter, 43, after reviewing
evidence that he may not have killed a young couple in a park on
the South Side of Chicago in the summer of 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's conviction was not overturned Friday and he is
technically out on bond, because prosecutors said they needed a few
more weeks to investigate. But David Erickson, first assistant in
the Cook County state's attorney's office, said that after spending
the last 36 hours interviewing old witnesses and examining new
evidence, ``we thought it was appropriate for us to recommend that
Porter be released on his own recognizance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the system could have allowed an apparently innocent
man to be on death row for years, Erickson said he wished he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can give you an answer,'' he said. ``I've
never seen anything like this, and I imagine you've never seen
anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Chicago, people were incredulous, especially over
accusations that the police investigation was sloppy or that police
might have intimidated an influential witness into naming Porter as
the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that they have seen things like this before. If
Porter is exonerated, it will be the 10th time since Illinois
reinstated the death penalty in 1977 that a death row inmate has
been freed because he turned out to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   In one case four years ago, two men convicted of raping and
murdering a 10-year-old girl in suburban DuPage County were
released after an investigator admitted he had falsely testified
about evidence that was central to the case. Three prosecutors and
four sheriff's deputies have been charged with conspiracy, perjury
and obstruction of justice in that case.
</P>
<P>
   In another case three years ago, four men _ two of them on death
row _ were freed after 18 years in jail when it was found that they
did not commit a gang rape and double murder in suburban Ford
Heights. The Northwestern professor, David Protess, and another
group of his journalism students played a leading role in that
case, too, getting another man to confess to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Porter case has spawned outraged calls for a moratorium on
executions until the state's capital punishment system is
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has gone terribly, chillingly wrong here, and
innocent people have almost paid with their lives,'' The Chicago
Tribune said in an editorial Friday, noting that only Florida has
had more innocent people removed from death row.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Why didn't the police or the defense lawyers do a better
investigation?'' the editorial asked. ``Was the only witness
intimidated by police into lying so Porter could be framed? How
could this case come so horrifyingly close to the point that an
innocent man would be put to death? Does Illinois want to answer
these questions before an innocent person dies, or after that
happens?''
</P>
<P>
   David Urbanek, a spokesman for Gov. George Ryan, said the
governor did not support a moratorium on executions. He conceded
that the Porter case suggested there were problems and ``we should
see if we need to fine-tune the system in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case also showed that ``the system worked,'' Urbanek
said. ``The process did work. Sure it took 17 years, but it also
took 17 years for that journalism professor to sic his kids on that
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a matter of luck that Protess' class got the
case at all. It only happened because, two days before Porter was
to be executed last September, his lawyers won a stay while a court
considered a motion that Porter, with an I.Q. of 51, was not
competent enough to be put to death. After that, Protess, who each
semester assigns his class murder cases to re-investigate, gave his
students the case and they snapped into action.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Protess and a private investigator, the
students discovered, among other things, that Porter was
right-handed, while a witness had said the man who shot Jerry
Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, fired with his left hand. They
interviewed the lead prosecution witness, who said he was pressured
in hours of police questioning to implicate Porter. They tracked
down relatives of another man, Alstory Simon, who said that Simon
had committed the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, faced with the incriminating statements of his
estranged wife, Simon, a 48-year-old laborer who now lives in
Milwaukee, confessed in a videotaped interview with the private
investigator that he had done the shooting in an argument over a
drug debt.
</P>
<P>
   Simon has not been arrested or questioned, but Erickson said
prosecutors were talking with his lawyer. The lawyer, Jack Rimland,
said that if an arrest warrant was issued, Simon would turn himself
in.
</P>
<P>
   Although Erickson was hard-pressed to explain what had gone
wrong, he said that so far the investigation, which has included an
interview with the lead witness who changed his story, did not
suggest police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you have here is police work that was done the
way that police work was normally done in the 1980s,'' Erickson
said. ``This was not one of those
let's-just-go-get-witnesses-and-get-them-to-support-our-story kind
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter said he felt as if he had been railroaded, but he seemed
to be more interested in relishing his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I'm going to get those years back,'' he said.
``I'm just thankful to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a White Sox cap over his dreadlocks, he headed to his
mother's South Side apartment and sat beaming on the couch,
anticipating a meal of steak and french fries, while relatives and
neighbors flooded in to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   Protess and his students were there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to see him at a metal table with handcuffs and
prison scruffs,'' said one student, Tom McCann, 21. ``It's another
to see him in regular clothes, happy as he can be with his family
again. My head is just spinning.''

WILLIAM C. BROWN, 82; PIONEER IN MICROWAVE TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   William C. Brown of Waltham, Mass., a pioneer in microwave power
transmission whose work had implications on the kitchen counter and
on the surface of the moon, died of cancer Wednesday in his home.
He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Brown was a researcher at Raytheon Co. for 44 years. His
work in the transmission of signals led to the first efficient
transmission of large amounts of electric power though space. His
work also led to the development of the microwave oven and new
forms of communication with spacecraft during lunar landings.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Brown was director of Raytheon's magnetron development
laboratory, where he played a leading role in the development of
the magnetron tube, which generates microwaves for the microwave
oven, and the development of the crossed-field amplifier tube, or
amplitron, which is used in radar systems and enabled
communications with the lunar lander during NASA's Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   He was also generally credited with the concept that led to the
development of the widely used rectenna, a device for the
simultaneous capture of a microwave beam and its conversion back
into direct current power.
</P>
<P>
   He held 50 patents and was the author of nearly 100 scientific
articles.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Iowa. He graduated from Iowa State University and
earned a master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1939. He joined Raytheon the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Brown retired from Raytheon in 1984, but continued his
research in his own laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Marjorie (Griswold); four daughters, Linda
of Massachusetts, Donna Salisbury of Washington, Beth Logan of
Tennessee and Barbara of Kenya; and five grandchildren.

TEXAS OFFICIAL SAYS PRISONS MEET JUDGE'S REQUIREMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A day after Texas penitentiaries were described
as among the nation's most horrific, a state official testified
Friday that the prison system fully complies with a 1992 federal
court order governing mental-health care for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   And two Texas prison units have passed a national group's
inspection with flying colors, becoming the first in the state to
win prestigious accreditation of the American Correctional
Association, an inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat testimony before senior U.S. District Judge William
Wayne Justice was aimed at offsetting the claims of inmates and
their hired experts that Texas prisons fail to properly treat
mentally-ill prisoners and routinely violate their civil rights
with a variety of unconstitutional prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Suzanne Ducate, director of mental health services for the
University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, which provides
medical care to inmates, said the state meets Justice's 1992
requirements. The official said Texas gives inmates full access to
mental-health care; enforces work limitations for ailing inmates;
and won accreditation for all three mental-health units from the
National Council for Correctional Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   Ducate said the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which also
contracts with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center for
medical services, has developed sufficient policies and procedures
to assure high-quality care for the state's 140,000 inmates. She
said there's also an intense effort to find qualified health-care
personnel and train security officers to identify mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ducate said the state's conversion in 1994-96 to a managed care
system for inmates has produced ``a greater emphasis on wellness,''
with patients being treated as early as possible for their
ailments. And while she acknowledged that the high cost of
medication is an ever-present concern, the psychiatrist said the
state does make use of cutting edge anti-psychotic drugs and also
is in the forefront of tele-psychiatry _ which uses closed-circuit
televisions to link far-flung inmates and prison doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel as if you're in the same room as the patient,'' said
Ducate, who from her home can treat inmates more than 500 miles
away in Fort Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   The official said an elaborate system of checks and balances is
in place to assure proper treatment, though problems persist. One
female inmate recently died as a result of improper psychiatric
care, and scrutiny of the treating doctor's actions led to his
firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that the care was definitely substandard,'' Ducate
said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that one of the system's problems is inmates' refusal
to consent to transfer to prison mental-health units from regular
units. Consequently, inmates with various mental illnesses
sometimes languish in solitary-confinement cells and exhibit the
kind of bizarre behavior that inmates' experts testified about
previously.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, obviously intrigued about why inmates in solitary
confinement would smear themselves with their own feces, urinate on
their cell floors, mutilate themselves and exhibit other strange
behavior, pressed Ducate for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said some of the actions could be signs of bonafide
mental illness, warranting their housing in mental-health units.
But she noted that other federal-court rulings guarantee inmates
the right to refuse psychiatric treatment. Furthermore, some of the
obnoxious behavior may be reasonable responses to confinement;
calculated to win attention or designed to gain a new housing
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does work in many instances,'' Ducate said, adding, ``these
are very difficult people to treat.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, curious about the doctor's opinion on whether
long-term solitary confinement was ``conducive to mental health,''
got this reply: ``I would have to say `no.''' But Ducate added that
one of the saddest things about her job is being unable to convince
some troubled inmates to transfer from solitary confinement to
in-patient psychiatric units.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor took issue with an inmate expert's claim that
numerous solitary-confinement prisoners visited in a 1998
inspection displayed true mental illness. She said her own team's
examination of the inmates found only one in need of a transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to insure no one is under-treated or misdiagnosed,''
Ducate emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, an Illinois-based consultant who conducts
inspections for the American Correctional Association said he was
pleasantly surprised by the conditions he saw in the Eastham and
Robertson units, which won accreditation last month. He admitted he
wasn't anxious to visit the units because he had heard from other
professionals that Texas prisons had ``significant problems,'' and
that Texas officials ``actively opposed the ACA (accreditation)
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the units scored 100 on all mandatory categories, including
use-of-force issues, and reached the 95 score required for
non-mandatory standards, the inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Robertson (near Abilene), I was very pleased with
what I saw,'' said consultant David Sandahl. ``I was equally
impressed at Eastham (near Lovelady) because that's an old joint.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by inmates' lawyers, however, Sandahl conceded
that the three-day inspections were in some ways superficial and
dependent on case files offered by prison officials. Justice, too,
suggested that such an inspection could be like those in the
military, when everyone knows it's coming and have time to prepare
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandahl said that doesn't make the inspections meaningless.
He said they help officials set goals, pull staff together, and in
Texas' case, caused some inmates to say they hoped other units will
seek accreditation because of the changes the process prompted.
</P>
<P>
   Justice plans to take testimony on behalf of inmates and the
state through next week before deciding whether to retain his
oversight over the prison system. Attorney General John Cornyn is
pressing for him to relinquish the case, citing prison officials'
claims that they meet Justice's voluminous requirements.

   Digging Into Berkshire Turns Up a Best Seller &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber's pioneering research report on Berkshire Hathaway,
Warren E. Buffett's celebrated holding company, is proving to be a
literary hit rivaling the chairman's own annual letter to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an initial order of 10,000 copies, triple the usual run,
supplies are running short, and a second printing is expected,
probably in a matter of weeks, according to Alice D. Schroeder, the
author.
</P>
<P>
   She is the first analyst on Wall Street to bring an insurance
perspective to the study of Berkshire, which has often been
regarded _ especially before its acquisition last year of General
Re _ as little more than a shrewdly assembled stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schroeder, who began researching Berkshire last summer, was
subsequently asked by Buffett, who was impressed with her approach,
to be his designated analyst. In the fall he invited her to Omaha,
where Berkshire is based, to provide access to managers who could
help her put the wealth of publicly available information on
Berkshire into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber could not say how much of the demand for copies of
Ms. Schroeder's 54-page report was from outsiders, but many
investors clearly think enough of it to pay $540 for it, or $10 a
page, a not unheard-of cost for superior Wall Street work. Paine
Webber customers get copies free.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire's A shares soared $11,500 during the first three
trading days last week, closing on Wednesday at $76,500, before
retreating to $71,600 on Friday. This was still well short of the
intrinsic value of between $91,000 and $97,000 that Ms. Schroeder
assigned to the stock in her report.
</P>
<P>
   As for Buffett's own next publishing effort, this year's
Berkshire annual report is to be mailed in mid-March. It contains
``a few surprises'' about this year's shareholder meeting, to be
held May 3, according to a Berkshire spokeswoman. On-line access to
Buffett's latest thinking, at www.berkshirehathaway.com, is to be
available on March 13.

   Another Billion, Another Bid? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first time around, in 1984, Ross Perot sold Electronic Data
Systems to General Motors for $2.55 billion and then turned to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Perot planned to sell a stake in his newer computer
services firm, the Perot Systems Corp., to investors. But after the
market's sharp August selloff, he delayed, telling employees, ``If
you and I decided to go fishing, and there was a hurricane that
day, what would we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, he finally went fishing. The company sold 6.5
million shares, a 7.7 percent stake, for $16 each in an initial
public offering. At Friday's close of $66, the shares had climbed
high enough to place the value of the whole company at $5.6
billion. Perot and his family hold almost 38 percent of the shares,
worth $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And will these proceeds help finance yet another presidential
bid? On Friday, the only hint he offered was that he is looking
within company ranks for someone to succeed him as chief executive
of Perot Systems.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the broad market indexes hardly budged last
week, shares of a group of lesser-known companies, including J.B.
Oxford Holdings and Siebert Financial, were moonshots. Traders
watched the stocks double or more in the course of a day on no news
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   What or who was behind the moves? The ``what'' is the Internet.
Siebert Financial, a discount brokerage firm in New York, and J.B.
Oxford, a rival in Los Angeles, got hot because they are both on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert ran from $19.125 on Monday to $49.50 on Wednesday, then
dropped back to $35.125 at week's end. J.B. Oxford, which is, by
the way, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for possible market manipulation, closed on Wednesday at
$12 and on Thursday made a high of $25.75 before ending the week at
$11.75.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting is the ``who'' behind the activity. It seems to
be ``Merlin,'' a man posting stock picks in an Internet chat room
called trading-places.net.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of cyberspace, Merlin is a Scotsman named Chris Rea, 45;
he is pictured on the Web site aboard a yacht. Rea said on Friday
that he founded Trading Places last September. It is a Web site for
day traders, the histrionic types who furiously buy and sell stocks
through the day. He calls the company a ``facilitator of trader
training and trader communications on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than six months, Rea said, he has drawn 817 members to
his site who pay $279 a month to get instruction in day trading and
access to Merlin's stock picks.
</P>
<P>
   But Rea's reach also extends to thousands of people who learn of
his picks indirectly, from friends or other traders. Net watchers
say that helps explains the violent moves in stocks he pushes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened on Friday, Rea said, he recommended
Omega Research, a Miami maker of financial analysis software. The
stock was at $5.25. ``Within half an hour, it ran to $10,'' he
said. Never mind that the stock fell back to $7.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're promoting IMON,'' Rea added on Friday morning.
That's the ticker symbol for Imaginon Inc., a small software maker
in Greer, S.C. ``We made it rock,'' Rea said. The stock rose 25
percent that day.
</P>
<P>
   On-line investing is rife with dubious characters, Rea said; by
contrast, he added, ``we see ourselves as being the white knight in
this industry.'' Still, one member of his site who is a
professional trader says that the enthusiastic Rea rarely tells
people when to sell _ a problem, given that the stocks inevitably
fall after their spikes.
</P>
<P>
   Rea declined to discuss his background, other than to say that
he was a trader for years in London, moved to Spain and then came
to the United States 10 years ago. Five years ago, he was in the
business of designing and producing mailers for car dealerships. He
is not a registered broker.
</P>
<P>
   As essentially a publisher of financial information, he is
generally exempt from regulation. Only if he were found to be
buying ahead of his customers or taking money from the companies
whose shares he recommends would he be subject to regulators'
wrath.
</P>
<P>
   He says he does neither. And indeed, Trading Places is filled
with effusive testimonials to Merlin's magic.
</P>
<P>
   So this is the way we live now. Thousands of people from all
over the nation buy stocks on the advice of a stranger known only
by his alias and a blurry picture. Strange days. Strange days,
indeed. &QL;

HEDGE FUND REDEMPTIONS APPEAR LIGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Washington, Tenn., England)  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Though predictions of heavy withdrawals were rampant, investors
are believed to have removed about 5 percent of their assets from
hedge funds in a roller-coaster 1998, according to several
companies that track the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Precise figures are hard to come by because the industry is not
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is thus not
required to report numbers. But three leading companies, each of
which tracks a different group of hedge funds, differ only slightly
on the overall annual results.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are investment vehicles for wealthy individuals that
have the flexibility to sell short _ betting that certain assets
prices will decline _ to borrow to magnify returns and to use other
strategies not available to mutual funds. The industry is thought
to have about $300 billion under management, small in comparison to
the $5.5 trillion in mutual fund assets.
</P>
<P>
   Managed Account Reports is still collecting 1998 numbers for the
roughly $100 billion in the hedge funds it tracks, but Lois B.
Peltz, managing editor of the MAR/Hedge newsletter, said the funds
had a net increase of at least 1.5 percent for the year. Tass
Management, a company based in London that monitors funds whose
assets under management total more than $100 billion, and Van Hedge
Fund Advisors International in Nashville, Tenn., which tracks hedge
funds with a total of $140 billion under management, put net
redemptions at about 5 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   What makes tracking the industry so tough is that some funds _
including Long-Term Capital Management LP, which nearly collapsed
last year and had to be rescued by 14 Wall Street banks and
brokerage firms _ do not make their numbers available to any
tracking service. Even when Long-Term Capital was doing well, it
released performance data only to investors. It was not alone. One
fund manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, thinks
hundreds of smaller funds did badly last year, never reported their
performance to a tracking service and are now ``off the radar
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the demise of those funds could translate into
hundreds of millions of dollars in withdrawals that do show up in
any industry measurements.
</P>
<P>
   But enough funds do report figures to show that withdrawals were
low compared with expectations last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer, people expected withdrawals of as much as 30
percent,'' said George P. Van, who heads of Van Hedge Fund
Advisors. Still, by the time the year was out and the stock market
had recovered, many investors who had said they would pull out
their money had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, Long-Term's problems overshadowed everybody's
consciousness,'' Van said. ``In Europe it was worse because the
chairman of the Union Bank of Switzerland, a sacrosanct
institution, was dismissed. That really shook up investors.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  He was referring to the resignation of Mathis Cabiallavetta,
chairman of UBS AG, after the bank took a $685 million write-off in
connection with its investment in Long-Term Capital. &UR;  &LR; UBS was
formed last year in the merger of Union Bank and the Swiss Bank
Corp..
 &UR;  &LR;  Investors were clearly frightened by problems at several funds
that had been regarded as relatively safe and where the fund
manager had a stellar track record. For example, Ellington Capital
Management, a hedge fund that traded in mortgage-backed securities,
had to liquidate much of its $1 billion in holdings last summer
because of heavy margin calls.
</P>
<P>
   Several managers of large funds saw net withdrawals. The group
run by George Soros, for example, saw its assets drop to $10.5
billion at the end of the year from $13.9 billion at the beginning,
according to MAR. Of that decline, about $800 million resulted from
redemptions, a spokesman for Soros said, and $1.5 billion was in
distributions, or money returned to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Leon G. Cooperman's Omega Advisors &UR;  &LR; saw assets in its overseas
fund fall to $1.1 billion from $1.8 billion, of which about $549
million was in asset withdrawals, according to MAR.
</P>
<P>
   But some funds did surprisingly well. For example, according to
MAR, not only did the Maverick Capital &UR;  &LR; funds run by Lee Ainslie
turn in an impressive year, up 22 percent over all, but they
attracted $329 million of new money, too. Ainslie's funds had $2.24
billion under management at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Corp., which has $1.9 billion in funds that invest in
companies that are reorganizing, said that it had attracted about
$175 million in new money.
</P>
<P>
   Why are people and institutions still putting money into hedge
funds in light of all the bad publicity? Nicola Meaden, the founder
of Tass, thinks that many hedge fund investors are seeking
diversity and move money into another fund when one fund does
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with the stock market continuing to soar, many
investors are leery of putting money into stocks at what they
consider inflated prices. Van said that concerns about the high
level of the stock market had prompted him to stay in hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some behavior surprises even hedge fund experts. For example,
market-neutral funds, which invest in stocks that they see as
undervalued and then neutralize the risk by selling short an equal
amount of stocks they see as overvalued, did poorly last year.
Nevertheless, both Ms. Peltz and Paul Roth, a partner at Shulte
Roth &AMP; Zabel, a law firm that represents 300 hedge funds, say new
money is coming into market-neutral funds. Ms. Peltz put the figure
at $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining a possible rationale behind the investment, Roth
said: ``The segment got overcrowded. And people think the strategy
may have more validity since some of the proprietary trading desks
at investment banks have stopped using that strategy. Therefore,
there may be opportunities. In other words, there is less money
chasing the deals.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the money flows, Van thinks that, ``Some investors
are getting tired of their funds being outperformed by traditional
long investors and seeing the S&AMP; P skyrocket while hedge funds have
been very conservative and underperforming the broad market.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the funds Van Hedge Fund Advisors follow, Van said that the
Van U.S. Hedge Fund Index was up 11.7 percent for investors in
1998. The average equity fund was up 10 percent, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index was up 28.6 percent with dividends
reinvested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think hedge fund managers are over all going to have to
start performing,'' Van said, ``or the redemptions will continue.''

By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It had all the ingredients of a Monty Python skit.
John Cleese, launching into his keynote speech Feb. 1 at a
conference here on improving learning and performance, donned an
orange clown wig to play Colin Cleese, the hard-nosed businessman
who was interrupting his twin brother's remarks about hare brains
and tortoise minds.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike all those Monty Python skits in which Cleese
cavorted, this one was not something completely different. It was,
in fact, Cleese trying to pass along, as only he can, a good part
of the best thinking about creativity and innovation he has come
across in the more than 25 years that he has been making management
training videos.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know the classic ``Monty Python's Flying Circus''
and ``Fawlty Towers'' television programs and films like ``A Fish
Called Wanda,'' but not his best-selling training video,
``Meetings, Bloody Meetings,'' Cleese is a founder of Video Arts
Ltd., a London-based maker of training materials. In that role, he
helped establish the format for the company's videos, which have
been used by more than 27,000 organizations, including IBM, AT&AMP;T
and General Electric. And has starred in more than 100 of the
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The particular object of Cleese's enthusiasm these days is a
book called ``Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind'' (Ecco Press, 1999) by Guy
Claxton, an academic psychologist in Britain. Indeed, Cleese's
desire to talk about the book explained his willingness to address
the roughly 4,000 people who showed up for his speech at the
Training '99 conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just occasionally I get that feeling that somebody has said
something important and that I want to kind of put it out there,''
Cleese said after rehearsing his speech last weekend and then
settling down for a discursive chat in his suite at the Four
Seasons (his favorite hotel chain, but more on that later) with the
Super Bowl playing in the background. (He was rooting for the
Atlanta Falcons. ``One of the nicest English characteristics,'' he
said, is to cheer on the underdog.)
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, he said, Claxton describes the ``hare brain'' as
logical, fast, machine-like thinking. The ``tortoise mind,'' on the
other hand, is slower, less focused, less articulate, much more
playful, almost dreamy. In his book, Claxton says the two sides
need each other to come up with not just ideas, but good ideas. He
also cites a number of studies suggesting that people should trust
their hunches more.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in business, Cleese said, is that three forces are
leaving no room for the tortoise mind _ a ``terribly dangerous''
development that stifles creativity and innovation and inevitably
leads to bad decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces, he said, are the widely held, but misguided,
beliefs that being decisive means making decisions quickly, that
fast is always better and that we should think of our minds as
being like computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone here seriously think that any of those statements
are true?'' he asked the audience Feb. 1. ``Does anyone work for an
organization that doesn't behave as though they were?'' The first
question was met with silence, the second with knowing laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese said he learned one of the most important lesson of his
years in the training business while preparing a film about
decision-making, or ``decision-taking,'' as the British often call
it. ``When there is a decision to be taken, the first question to
ask always is: When does this decision need to be made? That's when
you take the decision.'' After all, he explained, until that point,
``new information, unexpected developments and _ perish the thought
_ better ideas might occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on managers at all levels to act quickly is
enormous, he said. ``Although taking decisions very fast looks
impressive, it is in fact not only show-off behavior, but actually
a bit cowardly. It shows you'd rather give the impression of
decisiveness than wait to substantially improve your chances of
coming up with the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many businesses act as if faster is better, Cleese told
the audience, true urgency is the exception rather than the norm.
Likewise, he bemoaned the single-minded approach that many
businesses use to solve problems, which is to gather more data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, most of use today believe that a computer is of more
use to us than a wise person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tortoise mind needs the hare brain to analyze and sift
through the ideas it serves up, of course, but Cleese said that
pressures of all kinds _ deadlines, peers _ give license to the
hare brain to bully the tortoise mind. So people need to make
boundaries in time and space, like closing their door or going for
a walk, to let their tortoise mind do its meandering work.
</P>
<P>
   (This last point was made in a Monty Python sketch that Cleese
helped write: Beethoven was struggling to compose the beginning of
his Fifth Symphony, trying to get the fourth note right. The
creative moment was interrupted by his wife, who walked in pushing
a vacuum cleaner and asked if he had seen the sugar bowl.)
</P>
<P>
   The notion that there are two sides to the brain _ the logical
and the creative _ certainly sounds familiar. But that's part of
the point, said Cleese, who has long been fascinated by the
creative process. ``It's like a lot of important things people say,
reminding us of things we used to know but we've forgotten,'' he
said of Claxton's book. ``In a way I've always known this, but I've
never seen it articulated so clearly.''

 &HT;    DuPont to dump mine project in Okefenokee Swamp
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOLKSTON, Ga. _ The DuPont Co. signed an agreement with
environmental groups Friday promising to drop its plans to open a
titanium strip mine in a 38,000-acre tract next to the famed
Okefenokee Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   The company's pledge, however, is based on a looming
contingency. A special 28-member mediation committee that worked
out the ''no mining'' plan also promised to help raise as much as
$90 million to compensate DuPont and others who would have
benefitted from the mining.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont official Jerry Donnelly, who signed the agreement in the
company's behalf, said that if the money is not raised, the
chemical giant ''would have to explore all of its options.''
Whether one of those options would be to revive its mining plans,
he would not say.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, the Wilderness
Society and the National Wildlife Federation, say they are
confident the funds will be raised over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, ecologists and others fought the mining
proposal because they said it could irreparably harm the
Okefenokee, one of the world's largest remaining freshwater
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will remain opposed to mining next to the Okefenokee
forever,'' said Sam Collier of the Sierra Club, who was one of the
mediators. ''It would be very difficult now for DuPont or anyone
else to proceed with mining there.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement signed Friday also called for 10,000 acres of the
land that would have been mined to be added to the 438,000-acre
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, and permanently retire the
mineral rights on the tract DuPont had acquired for the project.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, up to $5 million of the still-to-be-raised funds
will go to Charlton County, where the proposed mining tract is
located, for economic development to compensate for the loss of
taxes and jobs that may have come from the mining. Several million
dollars more would go to build an environmental education and
research center in Folkston, the town near the entrance to the
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the money _ more than $70 million _ would go to
DuPont and two timber companies to offset their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, DuPont officials and other mediators
acknowledge that raising as much as $90 million is a daunting task.
They say they will approach state and federal governments and
private foundations for the money. A major contributor may be the
federal Land and Water Conservation Fund.
</P>
<P>
   However, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt may have put a damper
on that hope this week when he said that the buyout price may be
''greatly inflated.'' The $90 million estimate could be
substantially lower after an appraisal of the property and the
minerals that would have been mined.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt came to the Okefenokee in April 1997 to condemn DuPont's
plans, saying that a strip mine could permanently damage one of the
nation's ''great natural treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Babbitt's visit, DuPont appointed the 28-member
mediation committee _ made up of environmentalists, mining and
timber interests, local county and city officials and others _ to
work out a consensus on whether the company could proceed with its
mining project or kill the plans. The company promised to abide by
the committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was in total agreement with the settlement signed
Friday during an outdoor ceremony at the Folkston Train Depot,
where the mediation group met a dozen times during the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're signing it in an effort to support this process, but we
recognize that there are funding issues that are going to have to
be hashed out,'' said Rob Leebern, chief of staff for Rep. Saxby
Chambliss (R-Ga.), whose district includes Charlton County.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Mining Association abstained from signing, citing
its general opposition to retirement of mining rights.

CHICAGO: so clearly.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cleese says he has long been drawn to the dynamics of
organizations and business as fodder for humor. In the early 1970s,
for example, during his Python years, he was co-author of a skit
about a charity whose good works involved putting things on top of
other things. (According to Cleese, one of the charity's officials
makes an appeal for more donations by saying, ``There is still much
work to be done.'')
</P>
<P>
   And the Fawlty Towers series found its inspiration in the
British attitude to providing service, which Cleese describes as
this: `` `If there weren't all these customers, we could run this
place properly.''' His take on bad service has also informed many
Video Arts tapes, which the company describes as ``seriously
funny,'' often showing the right and wrong way to do things.
</P>
<P>
   In one tape, Cleese plays an impatient repairman who is quizzing
a customer about a noisy appliance. ``Well, what kind of noise?''
he asks. ``A rasping noise, a metallic whanging din, a pululating
wheeze, an intermittent nonrythmic banging?''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Cleese is friendly and candid, and appears to relish
kicking around ideas and noodling over big-picture questions. He
often uses literary allusions, and sprinkles in words like
``adumbrate,'' not to impress but to get across a precise image.
Though his hair is graying, and a sore back would prevent him these
days from re-creating his famous ``Ministry of Silly Walks'' skit,
he shows a youthful enthusiasm for everything from a workaday
Falcons pass reception to bizarre stories that he clearly enjoys
retelling.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese has been spending a lot of time with his tortoise mind
lately. He is planning to retire at the end of the year, when he
turns 60. He will not stop working, mind you; rather, he has been
arranging his affairs in recent years so that making money will no
longer be a factor in deciding which interests he will pursue (and
he is still committed to working several days a year for Video
Arts).
</P>
<P>
   So in between providing encouragement to the hapless Falcons,
Cleese appeared quite happy to share his thoughts last weekend on
everything from hotel service (yes, yes, that's coming soon) to
management and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese, who received a law degree from Cambridge University
about six years before helping form the Python troupe, is quick to
say he is no expert on management; he is much more likely to peruse
the psychology and philosophy sections of a bookstore than the
business section. But he has grown steadily more interested in the
field since he first started doing training films with Anthony Jay,
an executive with the BBC who conceived of the ``Yes, Minister''
television series.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese said Jay grew interested in the training field after
seeing some films by the British army that used humor to get across
points about safety, among other things. Cleese, who was already a
Python member by this time, said he was so impressed with the turn
of Jay's mind that he would have followed him into any venture.
Cleese said he had no experience that qualified him for the job,
but that he brought an open mind to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Their early efforts focused mostly on techniques of retail
sales. ``It was extraordinarily interesting to sit down with
someone and have them spill the beans about how you're supposed to
do it,'' Cleese recalled. ``You've been on the end of the process
hundreds of times, and then, forever after, you go into the shops
and you know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   He also became interested in the dynamics of meetings. ``I've
had the misfortune to sit through many Python meetings, which are
probably at the very bottom of the efficient-meeting scale, or at
least they used to be,'' he said, adding that the surviving troupe
members (Graham Chapman died in 1989) occasionally get together to
discuss reuniting for a run of shows. The main problem, he said,
was the constant revisiting of decisions that had already been
made: ``There was no sense of progress. It was just chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   While doing research for a video on conducting job interviews,
he learned the importance of asking applicants the kind of
difficult questions that many people avoid for fear of appearing
confrontational. When he is interviewing people to work for him _
on a movie set or as one of the personal assistants he calls his
``vice bosses'' _ Cleese said he is particularly interested in
whether the person has an appreciation of his strengths and
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for a kind of self-awareness in people,'' he said.
``And if I sense it's not there, then I begin to lose interest in
whatever their qualifications are. I don't want to work with
someone who is a very efficient robot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese said that as a manager, he is always delegating. ``I give
people a great deal of authority, and it has a great deal to do
with the fact that I can't stand detail,'' he explained. ``I'm
fundamentally lazy, so the more things operate without me, the
happier I am. My motivation is a base one, which is to reduce my
workload.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Life and How to Survive It,'' (Norton, 1994),
written with Robin Skynner, his former group therapist, Cleese
concludes that great leaders make themselves dispensable by
creating organizations that basically function without them. That,
of course, is not the model typically found in American business,
where corporate publicity machines often create the sense that the
chief executive is the main reason for a company's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I see ego being manifested, it worries me,'' Cleese
said. ``I'm all for people having a great vision, but does anyone
else in the corporation have a great vision?''
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite business books is ``In Search of
Excellence,'' the 1982 best seller by Thomas J. Peters and Robert
H. Waterman, because, Cleese said, it is really a book about what
motivates people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give people authority, and you treat them with real
dignity, and you listen to them and ask them how things could be
done better, I think that money becomes secondary,'' he said. ``But
once you get a stock market like the American stock market, then
the company is immediately put into a context in which it's very
hard for it to behave like that.''

CHICAGO: like that.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About eight years ago, he started grouping companies into two
broad categories _ those that seem to operate with confidence and
those that run on fear. A few years ago, he guessed that about half
of all large companies fit into each category. Today, he figures
that about 95 percent of companies run on fear.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with a company _ one that has asked him to give a
presentation to its employees or to make a commercial, for instance
_ it usually takes him about three phone calls to determine which
kind of company it is. A telltale sign, he said, is that in
fear-based companies, it is almost always impossible to tell who is
responsible for making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   He says he admires the Four Seasons hotel chain for the care it
takes in hiring its staff, particularly those on the concierge
desk. The workers never give off the sense that anything is a
bother, he said, and they seem to really enjoy helping. ``I find
that strangely touching,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, his experiences in hotels have provided some
wonderful stories. He says he always has to remind himself to put
the ``Do Not Disturb'' sign on his door or otherwise face an
endless procession of people knocking, delivering luggage and
asking to turn down the bed. One time, he said, there was a knock,
despite the sign hanging on the handle. He opened the door. ``Is
this supposed to be out here?'' the hotel staffer asked, pointing
at the sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of line you can't write,'' Cleese said.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, he recalled, he arrived with Alan Coren, a
former editor of Punch, the weekly British magazine of satire,
cartoons and reviews, on a snowy December night at a hotel in
eastern Scotland. A doorman, not inclined to help with the luggage,
demanded, ``Have you booked?'' The next day, they learned they were
the only ones in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hotel, Coren was in the bathroom when he heard the
door to his room open and his breakfast tray being set down. The
female staff member then opened the door to the bathroom, saying
(imagine one of Cleese's high-pitched Python voices here), ``Ooh, I
wondered where you were,'' and then left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a particular kind of insanity on the east coast of
Scotland that is very special, very delicate,'' Cleese said.
</P>
<P>
   But he finds the insanity he sees so often in the business world
these days less endearing. ``I think there is huge amount of
anxiety out there and not so many people enjoying themselves,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese is intent on remaining among those who do enjoy
themselves. His post-retirement possibilities, he said, include
trying to jump-start the interest of teen-agers in the world around
them, and writing more books.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find alarming is the lack of curiosity,'' he said.
``The challenge of trying to really interest kids and move them
onto things that have traditionally been thought interesting and
worthwhile is something I'd like to have a crack at.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of other things he would like to do, too, but he
is taking some tortoise time to decide precisely what his next
steps will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I don't know where I go now,'' he said. ``If you
try to plan with your hare brain, you'll think along the lines of
what you've done before. The only way that you find a slightly new
direction at this kind of juncture is to create a space and see
what flows into it.''

DRIVING A MORTGAGE WHILE IN PAJAMAS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Mass., Kan.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never before had William Ikley enjoyed much leverage when
applying for a loan, especially a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Ikley, 36, a butcher who lives in Eldersburg,
Md., had a firm deal just one business day after logging on to the
new Web site of Priceline.com. And he _ not a lender _ was in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real easy experience,'' he said. ``There wasn't
any pressure, doing it from home.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he applied while in his pajamas. And he expects to have
a check in hand Monday, 10 days after initiating the
name-your-price mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   This new program might not be such a smooth process for
everyone. Ikley needed only a small mortgage, a $5,000, five-year
home equity loan. He was knowledgeable enough to do without the
guidance provided by mortgage brokers, who stand to lose business
to this probably less-expensive electronic middleman.
</P>
<P>
   And as Ikley learned, Priceline's lenders are not exactly giving
money away. He will be paying 8.17 percent rather than the 6.9
percent he had optimistically proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his transaction represents another stage in the evolution
of what Priceline calls buyer-driven commerce, which harnesses the
Internet's speed and vast scope.
</P>
<P>
   The Tower Group, an information technology consulting firm in
Needham, Mass., estimates that by 2001, 10 percent of first
mortgages in a $1 trillion-a-year market will involve the Internet.
Many Web sites and institutions already match borrowers and
lenders, but Priceline's is the first program that lets the
consumer initiate the terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the customer more in control,'' said Richard S.
Braddock, a former senior executive at Citicorp who is now chairman
of Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage process, conducted in partnership with Lendingtree,
an on-line loan originator, is fairly straightforward. A loan
seeker can apply to finance a particular house, condominium or
co-op or to qualify before choosing a property.
</P>
<P>
   The borrower visits www.priceline.com and specifies a type of
financing (like 15- or 30-year, fixed rate or adjustable), an
interest rate, the points he or she is willing to pay and a desired
closing date. A monthly payment may also be proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The applicant also supplies income and other information that a
lender can use to evaluate creditworthiness. A $200 deposit is
charged to a credit card. Any response from among Lendingtree's 15
lenders, including the Dime Savings Bank of New York, Greenpoint
Financial and the Money Store, must arrive within two business
days.
</P>
<P>
   If a lender accepts, the deal is struck and the deposit is
applied to the usual fees, like the appraisal. Or the lenders can
submit counteroffers. If the borrower rejects them, the application
dies and the $200 charge is erased. The charge is not refunded if
the customer walks away from an accepted bid.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Priceline's other businesses, its mortgage service relies
on applicants who have already done enough homework to know what
they want and what terms they can reasonably expect.
</P>
<P>
   At Priceline.com, borrowers cannot browse through an array of
rates and terms without risking a commitment. ``It doesn't really
allow for shopping,'' said James P. Punishill, an analyst at
Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other on-line services _ Web sites of individual lenders or the
dozens of so-called aggregators like E-Loan or Quicken or
Lendingtree itself _ do allow borrowers to survey the financial
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with information, though, Priceline customers will gain
great flexibility, according to Theodore Iacobuzio of the Tower
Group. They will probably save money, too, unless they can strike a
deal with, for example, a local bank that throws in a free checking
account or other services.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, for their part, are taking this new mortgage-market
refinement in stride, said A.W. Pickel III of Lenexa, Kan.,
co-chairman of the technology panel of the National Association of
Mortgage Brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a place for it,'' he said, but he contended
that he and his colleagues, many of whom have Web sites of their
own, would not suffer much because consumers need the hand-holding
that brokers provide.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline is not as free of added costs as borrowers might
think, Pickel said, because lenders must add to their rates or
points the fees they pay to Priceline but which the service does
not disclose. Mortgage brokers collect fees in similar ways.
</P>
<P>
   Though Iacobuzio thinks the on-line mortgage business has ``a
very big future,'' he said it would be many years before paperwork
disappears and transactions can be conducted electronically end to
end.

SHIFTING INVOLVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 07, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is one of the most absorbing museum exhibits I have ever
seen. Walk into ``Assignment Rescue'' and you are in Manhattan, in
a pleasant little office overooking over the Third Avenue El. It is
June 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The books on the shelves, the letters on the desk belong to a
32-year-old editor named Varian Fry. The Emergency Rescue
Committee, formed by trade unions and refugee profesors at the New
School for Social Research, are sending him to Marseilles with
$40,000 and instructions to rescue as many Jews and German refugees
as possible. France has fallen. The Vichy government has agreed to
``surrender on demand'' to the Nazis all foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Step into the next room and you are in Marseilles _ in the Hotel
Splendide. It was there on the day that he arrived that Fry met his
first German refugee _ code-name ``Beamish'' _ who over the next
six months would with Fry help 2,000 people emigrate to the United
States through Casablanca, Lisbon, and Madrid. Many were artists
and writers, Marc Chagall and Hannah Arendt among them.
</P>
<P>
   Step into the bathroom, where Fry and Beamish and their
associates ran the water to foil evesdropping secret police; to the
Cafe on the street below; to a French concentration camp; to a
trail over the Pyrenees; and finally back to the little office on
Third Avenue, to which Fry repaired to write the story of his
mission (``Surrender on Demand'') after the French finally threw
him out. It is June 1942.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the exhibit last summer in Chicago; it is back in
Washington at the Holocaust Museum now, being refurbished.
Scaled-down versions (``Small Fry'') circulate to libraries and
universities. Fry had an indifferent business career after the war;
he died in 1967, surrounded by his war-time papers.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the exhibit opened its doors in 1993 was Fry's
historic mission fully recognized. Israel honored him as a
Righteous Person, the only American ever recognized thus (Raul
Wallenberg, a Swede, being far better-known); and the State
Department formally regretted its role in forcing him to leave
France.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary thing is that Beamish is never identified in
the exhibit. He wrote a message for the opening program _ but
otherwise never intrudes, except to contribute some of the
documents he had forged.
</P>
<P>
   Why mention it now? Because, as it happens, Beamish is alive and
well, a professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton, where Albert Einstein and John Von Neumann lived and
worked. And Beamish has just published yet another book under his
own name, which happens to be Albert O. Hirschman.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``Crossing Boundaries'' (Zone Books) sheds as much
light on the events of these historic weeks in Washington as
anything else you are likely to read. Let me explain briefly the
secret that Hirschman's book has to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the greatest economist of the 20th century? John Maynard
Keynes and Joseph Schumpeter are long dead; their contributions
seem less fundamental with the passage of time. Paul Samuelson,
Milton Friedman, and Kenneth Arrow are all still producing. Each a
reasonable claim. So does Hirschman, perhaps the most subtle, least
formal, and certainly the least known of the four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossing Boundaries'' contains a fair amount of autobiography,
thanks to a careful and lengthy interview by Carmine Donzelli and
two collaborators. Hirschman was born in 1915 in Berlin to a
middle-class family of Jewish origin; he was baptized a Protestant,
as was common among emancipated German Jews in those years. When
the Nazis came to power in 1933, he moved to Paris and studied
economics, finance, and accounting at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes
Commericiales.
</P>
<P>
   Two years in Paris, one in London, three months at the
Republican front in the Spanish civil war, a year and a half in
Trieste _ until hounded out by Mussolini's racial laws. He joined
the French Army when war broke out with Germany in 1939. His work
with Fry enabled gim to leave Marseilles for Berkeley in December
1940, to work on political economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschman joined the American Army in 1943, and went to Italy
for the office of Strategic Services. After the war he moved to the
Federal Reserve Board, to work on the Marshall Plan. His book ``The
Strategy of Economic Development'' won him fame. For a time he
advised the government of Columbia, then taught at Yale, Columbia,
and for many years at Harvard, before moving to the Institute in
Princeton in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1970, Hirschman published a seies of small books
that have made him a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in
economics. ``Exit, Voice and Loyalty'' examined the alternatives
available to any dissatisfied customer/citizen: quit the
organization or give voice to the complaint. ``The Passions and the
Interests'' in 1977 examined the political arguments for and
against capitalism in its early years, a task that ``Rival Views of
Market Processes and Other Essays'' in 1986 followed up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, ``The Rhetoric of Reaction'' identified various
arguments that have been deployed over the years against market
reforms: it won't work, it will have an effect opposite from that
intended. ``A Propensity for Self-Subversion'' in 1995 noted the
tendecy of those arguments to turn back upon themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``Shifting Involvments: Private Interest and Public
Acction'' in 1982 that spelled out most clearly the vision of
political economy that makes Hirschman truly unique. Most social
scientists assert that there must be some optimal allocation
between government involvement in the private sphere, a golden mean
toward which citizens are forever striving.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hirschman argues for a pendulum effect. Modern
societies are inclined to oscillate ``between periods of intense
preoccupation with public issues and almost total concentration on
individual improvement and private welfare goals,'' he wrote,
though there was nothing mechanical or precise about the process.
Instead, he cited the poet Blake: in order to know how much is
``enough,'' it is necessary to know what is ``too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The force that made Hirschman's cycle go was disappointment:
disappointment with programs of public action (for instance, the
New Deal) gave way to periods of enthusiasm for private consumption
(the Reagan revolution, for example), which in turn contained the
seeds of their own reversal. No book I know offers deeper insight
onto the political currents of the last century or so.
</P>
<P>
   So what news does ``Crossing Boundaries'' now contain? Its
centerpiece is an essay called ``Melding the Public and Private
Spheres: Taking Commensality Seriously.'' In it, Hirschman seeks to
blur somewhat the sharp distinction that he himself drew in
``Shifting Involvements.'' There are some goods that seem to be
wholly private that actually have important collective dimensions,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such as? Such as meals, says Hirschman. The way that meals
mediate between two very different spheres _ those of the purely
selfish individual and the social collective _ can illuminate a
realm in which a great deal of society's business gets done. This
is the realm in which ``commensality'' matters _ the regularity and
simultaneity of the meal, the fact that some are included and
others excluded, the habit of joining together in a common purpose
in which consumption is regulated by custom.
</P>
<P>
   The same considerations apply to elections; indeed, Hirschman
ventures that Greek democracy may have had its origins in the
custom of the banquet in fifth century Athens. Conviviality might
be the more colloquial term for this dimension of life, Hirschman
writes, but commensality derives from mensa _ eating together
around a common table.
</P>
<P>
   Are we in for a period of heightened interest in commensality,
instead of a more classical turn away from the pleasures of private
consumption that a mechanical application of the ``Shifting
Involvements'' model would lead us to expect. Perhaps. A renewed
emphasis on families, schools, neighborhoods, and states could
absorb some of the bitterness that has been lavished on issues of
national taxing and spending in recent years. In any event,
Hirschman cannot resist the temptation to to modify the position he
had once so clearly staked out.
</P>
<P>
   But then such self-subverision is nothing but vintage Hirschman.
Among his many mottos is a line of the German poet Holderin that
applies equally to Marseilles in 1940 as to Washington in 1999:
Where there is danger, there is also deliverance.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Stuck in rush-hour traffic at an approach to
one of the bridges over the Bosporus on a recent evening, a taxi
driver cursed the government for not building a third bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two isn't enough for a city of 10 million people,'' he fumed.
``We not only need a third bridge, but also a fourth and a fifth.
Then traffic will run smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The government may soon seek to oblige that taxi driver and many
others who believe that Istanbul urgently needs at least one more
Bosporus crossing. But reported plans for a new bridge have set off
an outpouring of civic protest that mirrors the battles over urban
renewal and highway construction which broke out in many American
cities in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Bridging the Bosporus, the narrow waterway that bisects Istanbul
and separates Europe from Asia, is an ancient dream. The first to
succeed in doing it was Emperor Darius I of Persia, who created a
temporary bridge of boats during a military campaign in 512 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The two modern suspension bridges, one completed in 1973 and the
other in 1988, carry a total of 1.1 million vehicles each day. Many
of the drivers are residents going from one part of Istanbul to
another, but there are also many trucks and cars making long trips
between points in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Protest is centered in the waterfront neighborhood of
Arnavutkoy, which has evidently been chosen as the European
terminus for the bridge. Residents say it would all but destroy
their community.
</P>
<P>
   They have banded together to hold meetings, put pressure on
politicians, and print leaflets. They even pledge to chain
themselves to construction equipment if nothing else works.
</P>
<P>
   Civic protest movements like this one are new in Turkey, where
the power of the state has always been strong and all but
unquestioned. One of the first emerged two years ago in the farm
town of Bergama after a foreign-owned consortium announced plans to
dig a gold mine that residents feared would harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, civic protests have delayed the construction of
power plants in several parts of the country. But the movement in
Arnavutkoy may be the first directed against a major public works
project.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty that protesters face is that no plans for the
bridge have been officially announced. What information is
available has come from leaks and random comments by public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The agency that designs projects like these, the Highway
Directorate, is based in Ankara and operates outside the control of
the Transport Ministry. It was established in the 1950s with the
help of Americans influenced by Robert Moses and other planners
whose style was visionary and dictatorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Turkey, planning big projects like this is always done
behind closed doors,'' said Korhan Gumus, chairman of the Human
Settlements Association, a coalition of architects and other
specialists that is organizing opposition to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guiding principle is that ordinary people can't see the
big picture and don't know what's good for the city or the country,
so decisions have to be made for them. We have even internalized
this approach and tend to accept it as the only possible way of
governing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the bridge say it will do little to ease
traffic congestion because the congestion is caused by poor access
roads rather than insufficient capacity on the bridges. They are
pushing for a rail tunnel under the Bosporus instead.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry about increased air pollution and damage to the
esthetics of the Bosporus, whose beauty has inspired countless
artists and poets. But the most intense protests come from
Arnavutkoy.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries Arnavutkoy was a multiethnic village where Greeks
predominated. Most of the Greeks left under pressure in the 1950s
and '60s, but the village retains the feeling of a self-contained
community.
</P>
<P>
   Along the narrow streets that wind among wooden Ottoman houses
are almost everything one needs to live: fruit and vegetable
vendors, butchers, cobblers, fishmongers, barbers, cafes and
restaurants, a toy store, a hardware store and even a billiard
parlor. Many shops display signs opposing the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This village is a very special place, and it allows us to live
a special kind of life, a life on the streets where people know and
trust each other,'' said Ozden Danisman, an engineer who lives in a
traditional old home overlooking the Bosporus. ``These days we
don't sleep and we don't eat. We just work against the bridge.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The secrecy in which the Highway Directorate works, coupled with
the uncertainty created by changing governments in Ankara, has made
people in Arnavutkoy uncertain whom they are fighting against. No
one has publicly defended the project or even officially confirmed
that it is under active consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents have obtained what they say are maps showing the
exact path the bridge and access roads are to take. Arnavutkoy is
awash in rumors and plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first idea was to block the bridge by filing lawsuits, but
now we see that it is basically a political battle,'' said Caglar
Keyder, a sociology professor who is active in the protest
movement. ``We won't be able to stop it in court, but if we get
enough people on our side, maybe we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, which seeks to portray itself
as a defender of ordinary citizens against the political
establishment, has joined opponents of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third bridge will not ease our traffic problem,'' Mayor Ali
Mufit Gurtuna of Istanbul, who is a member of Virtue, asserted
recently. ``On the contrary, it will cause irreparable damage to
Istanbul.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than rejoice at Gurtuna's support, some in Arnavutkoy
worry that it will lead secular politicians, who detest Virtue and
fear its agenda, to back the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a patron, someone on the city council or some
big-shot politician, to make our case,'' lamented Nadir Turkguc,
who runs a small photo shop in Arnavutkoy. ``I'm afraid that our
voices won't be heard and that politics will crush us in the end.''

ECONOMIC VIEW: WHY DID BRAZIL BURN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 7) 
(bl) 
By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ When Russia's troubles seemed about to send
Wall Street and the world over a cliff last fall, President Clinton
announced a new strategy in the war against economic contagion.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would the International Monetary Fund and Washington
wait for countries to get into deep trouble before coming to their
aid. Instead, they would act ahead of disaster, stepping in with
precautionary loans for fundamentally healthy economies. Brazil
would provide the first test of the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded extremely sensible. Clinton's aides compared the
strategy to a grand immunization program. Others conjured up images
of alert firefighters spraying water on the roof of an intact house
in a burning neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely three months later, the IMF's $42 billion preventive
package for Brazil _ including a $5 billion commitment from the
Treasury _ looks like another failed effort to stop the global
economic crisis. Why did the $42 billion defensive line crumble so
fast? And, assuming Brazil is not the last domino to fall, what do
the events there portend for the coming year?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brazilian experience raises as a question whether it is
feasible for the IMF to act in a preventative mode,'' said Jeffrey
Shafer, a former Treasury undersecretary for international affairs
and an architect of the 1995 Mexico bailout. ``Perhaps all they can
be is an ambulance corps.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the failure was a bet that turned bad. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, signed on
to the deal because they were relatively confident that the
government of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had the
clout to execute the economic changes it promised in return for the
aid. ``These are all probabilistic decisions,'' Rubin said
recently. ``You make the best decisions you can based on the
information you have at the time. You can't judge these things by
how they turned out, post facto.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Rubin places his bets the way he did during a 26-year
career on Wall Street, with the understanding that a certain
percentage will go bad.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington operates on different rules, and already there is
sniping on Capitol Hill that Rubin placed too much confidence in
Cardoso, much as the Treasury bet too readily last summer that
President Boris Yeltsin would execute economic changes in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Both bets went wrong for essentially the same reason. Rubin and
Summers negotiated with their counterparts, but the Russian Duma,
and then the Brazilian Congress, failed to deliver. The budget cuts
and other austerity measures were just too hard for politicians to
swallow. It was the classic clash between the demands of the
markets and the demands of populist politics.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the workings of the Brazilian Congress and the
Russian Duma are as different as the February weather in Brasilia
and Moscow. But no doubt it was the experience of being seared in
both legislatures that led Rubin, in a speech to the World Economic
Forum in Davos, to say that when it comes to saving nations from
economic implosion, ``I have come to believe that the ultimate key
is not economics or finance, but politics _ the art of developing
support for strong policy, especially for the hard decisions that
involve present sacrifice for future benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with precautionary programs like the one the
Treasury and the IMF tried in Brazil is that they can relieve the
pressure on politicians to make those hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Rubin hoped that the announcement of the huge
package would give Cardoso the breathing room to bring a reluctant
and famously free-spending Congress into line. It had the opposite
effect. With the $42 billion package in place, Congress concluded
that the economy was insulated from disaster, even if it dragged
its feet on unpopular votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we took the heat off the Brazilians just when
they needed to get energized,'' one senior administration official
said recently. The only benefit, others in the administration say,
is that the meltdown was postponed until January _ when it did less
damage to the rest of the world than it might have in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazil experience, though, is worth remembering when judging
some of the other ideas floating around about how to stabilize the
world financial system. One is to ``prequalify'' countries for aid
in the event of a crisis. The country in question would demonstrate
to the IMF that it practiced safe economics _ no wild spending, a
minimum of crony capitalism and corruption, real oversight of its
banking system. In return, the IMF would promise to come to its aid
if the markets ever staged a run on the country.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, though, if the country fell off the wagon?
Announcing that its government no longer qualified for protection
would be the equivalent of throwing the nation to the sharks. Even
without such a declaration, investors would sniff any failure to
act, and race for the exits. Just ask Cardoso, who will now spend
the rest of the year trying to rebuild the confidence he lost by
waiting too long.

ORTHODOX JEWS FEEL PRESSURES FROM A CHANGING WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For many people, the depth of religious divisions
among Jews was captured this week in the image of Orthodox yeshiva
students screaming insults at American Reform rabbis who were
praying, with men and women together, at the Western Wall in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   That image, however dramatic, misses some other deep divisions
existing not between Orthodox and non-Orthodox expressions of
Judaism, but in the heart of Orthodoxy itself.
</P>
<P>
   These divisions, which have potentially far-reaching
consequences for Judaism and resemble parallel conflicts in other
religious traditions, will draw anywhere from 500 to 1,000
participants to the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York for an
international conference next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Orthodoxy Encounters a Changing World,'' the Feb. 14-15
conference is the work of Edah (Hebrew for ``community''), a
relatively new and immediately controversial group. The ``changing
world'' of the title is the world of women's rights and Middle East
peace negotiations, but it is even more specifically the changing
world of Orthodox Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   That world has always had its internal camps. Outsiders are
vaguely aware that Hasidic Jews constitute a distinct group within
the Orthodox, and are in turn split into various differing
allegiances, Lubavitchers and Satmars and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important division has probably been between the
``modern Orthodox,'' as they have termed themselves, who believe
that a strict observance of Jewish law is compatible with an
extensive involvement in the social, intellectual and professional
life of contemporary America, and a more separatist, inward strand
of Orthodoxy that rejects modernity in a much more sweeping fashion
as incompatible with Jewish values.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups split sharply in their attitudes toward secular
education. The modern Orthodox have valued the study of Western
science, literature and art, and have enthusiastically entered the
professions. Yeshiva University has been their flagship institution
in attempting this synthesis between modern culture and traditional
observance.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists, now labeled ultra-Orthodox by critics or, more
neutrally, ``haredim'' (``those who tremble'' in fear of the Lord),
have always rejected such secular pursuits as distractions. Most
secular schooling should be limited to what is needed for young
people to support a family and devote themselves wholeheartedly to
religious study and practice.
</P>
<P>
   So what about this bifurcated Orthodox world has changed?
Primarily, three things.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Orthodox have increasingly felt the pressure of
demands for new roles for women not simply in organizational
leadership but in areas of religious life where any
reinterpretation of Jewish law is sure to be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox leaders of all stripes have always insisted that the
Reform and Conservative movements (to which the vast majority of
American Jews adhere) are deviations from authentic Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   But recent developments _ the Conservative and Reform ordination
of women rabbis, for instance, or the Reform movement's new
acceptance of intermarriage and homosexuality, or the effort of
both movements to get a legal foothold in Israel's religious life _
have turned the border between Orthodox and non-Orthodox into a
virtual free-fire zone. Anyone daring to reach across it, as some
modern Orthodox have done, is in grave peril.
</P>
<P>
   Third, and most important, the separatists or ``haredim'' have
increasingly become the dominant force in Orthodoxy. The causes and
consequences of this ``turn to the right,'' as it has often been
called, are brilliantly sketched by Jack Wertheimer, a professor of
American Jewish history and the provost at Jewish Theological
Seminary, in the February issue of Commentary magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Young people from modern Orthodox backgrounds, for example, now
often spend a year or two in Israel, pursuing religious studies in
settings where haredi influence is strong. Orthodox day schools,
summer camps and youth programs are disproportionately staffed by
haredi educators who choose that calling over secular professions.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences include a shift in authority from
practical-minded congregational rabbis to the virtuoso Talmudic
scholars who head haredi yeshivas and who favor an escalating
standard of ritual stringency. In a recent interview, Rabbi Saul
Berman, director of Edah, spoke of a growing tendency for these
leaders to ``micromanage the religious lives of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern Orthodox, in sum, are on the defensive. Some of their
most esteemed figures are regularly having their religious
credentials called into question. Indeed, Wertheimer uses terms
like ``castigated,'' ``vilified'' and ``muzzled'' for the treatment
meted out to these rabbis and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   And the modern Orthodox themselves, Berman said, often have ``a
sense that the haredim really represent true Orthodoxy and modern
Orthodoxy is a movement of convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the conference will send a different message: ``that it
is really possible to relate to modernity in a relatively open
fashion while maintaining a passionate commitment to Torah.''
</P>
<P>
   He would consider the gathering a success if, on issues like
attitudes toward the non-Orthodox, women's roles in Orthodox
Judaism, and rabbinic authority over individuals' spiritual lives,
there were simply a recognition of ``a greater degree of legitimate
diversity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even within modern Orthodoxy, however, this initiative has
stirred fierce reactions. In the latest issue of The Jewish Week,
Rabbi Moshe Tendler, a leading figure in the rabbinical seminary of
Yeshiva University, denounced Edah as ``outside the pale of
Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a separatist perspective, Rabbi Avi Shafran,
director of public affairs at Agudath Israel, was comparatively
detached. Modern Judaism's attempt to be in the contemporary world
and yet be strictly faithful to traditional Judaism had merely
reflected the economic insecurity of Orthodox Jews decades ago,
Shafran argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edah pines for those days,'' he said. ``It is trying to make a
compromise born of necessity into a high ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Edah's conference addresses a perennial choice facing any
religious group that is ``encountering a changing world'': build
bridges or patrol borders. There is a time and a place for both, of
course, and only wisdom instructs one in where and when and how.

HERE'S A QUESTION TO ASK 10 OF YOUR CO-WORKERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It practically leaps off the page: ``Percentage of Americans who
have had sex in the office: 40.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is, in the February issue of Smart Money, one of a
group of statistical tidbits about ``True Love'' reported without
further explanation in the magazine's Status Report feature. Can it
possibly be true that 4 of every 10 people have had sex on desks,
on conference tables, in cubicles, by the water cooler? And who's
counting?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the statistic came not from a survey or
scientific study, but from a guess by a sex therapist interviewed
in The Los Angeles Times last November. Dr. Lee Blackwell, who had
been co-director of the UCLA Human Sexuality Clinic, was quoted in
the newspaper article as estimating that ``up to 40 percent of
American adults have had sexual encounters at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached last week by phone, Blackwell tried to dispel any whiff
of definitiveness about his estimate. ``I'm very uncomfortable with
it,'' he said. ``They have taken something that was a conversation
I had with a reporter and turned it into some kind of scientific
fact. That's misrepresenting what it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, Smart Money left out the ``up to'' part
of the quotation; for another, he said he was talking about any
kind of sexual encounter, not just intercourse. Even then, most
encounters are not between co-workers, he added: ``I'm talking
about when someone's girlfriend comes to the office and they fool
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money's response? ``We stand by the number,'' a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for how Blackwell arrived at 40 percent, he said it was based
on ``what people told me when they come into the office in a very
honest setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have done actual surveys on the subject _ and the results
have varied widely. Each February, Harlequin Enterprises, the
prolific publisher of romance novels, issues surveys conducted by
Roper Starch on various heartstring subjects. The latest puts the
number of adults who ``admit to making whoopee at work'' at just 9
percent. (Twelve percent said they had surprised others in the
act.)
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite pole is a 1994 survey commissioned by Men's
Health magazine, in which 56 percent of respondents said they had
had sex at work.
</P>
<P>
   As Jerry Seinfeld used to ask, who (italics)are(end italics)
these people?

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Stock, a salesman at Jennifer Leather
Furniture in Manhattan, is trying to convince us that an armchair
is worth every penny of the $1,799 on its price tag. He caresses
the soft hide, describes the exotic oils massaged into its grain
and suggests that I recline on its plump cushions. Fiddling
nervously with his gold tie, he ramps up his sales pitch every time
I prepare to move on.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea what he is up against.
</P>
<P>
   My companion is Jacques Werth, who, after 40 years in the
selling business, reckons that he has gone on calls with 312 top
sales representatives in 23 different industries. No mere student
of salesmanship, Werth is a self-styled theorist on the subject _
and, needless to say, a consultant. With nothing particular in mind
to buy, I have asked him to come along to appraise the help as I
browse big-ticket items, things priced at $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Stock is not going to rank with the great ones in
Werth's eyes. Werth lights on a chair similar to the one that has
caught my fancy, but considerably cheaper. ``There is $450 more
leather in the other chair?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, generally,'' Stock replies, looking suddenly young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's more durable,'' I suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stretch fabric from each of the chairs over a drum and
beat them, this one would definitely last longer,'' Stock says,
gesturing to the more expensive item.
</P>
<P>
   Werth raises an eyebrow, but Stock continues. ``Pull the
corners,'' he says, ``You can really feel the difference in quality
there.''
</P>
<P>
   I murmur our thanks as we head out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call if you have any questions,'' Stock yells, undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the sidewalk, Werth shakes his head sorrowfully, as if he
had just witnessed an accident that could have been avoided. But
his criticisms are not what you might expect. He does not blame
Stock for angling hard, but for trying at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the sight of us, he should have been able to tell there
was maybe a 5 percent chance we'd buy,'' Werth explained. ``With a
few questions, he could have determined we weren't ready _ and then
spent his time doing something productive, like paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached later, Stock had a defense for his performance: He
thought Werth and I were spies from Jennifer Convertibles, the
owner of the store, and rude ones at that. ``Normally, I would have
been even more up,'' he said. ``I would have gone even more all
out.''
</P>
<P>
   More, however, is less in Werth's universe. At 62, he has
distilled a lifetime's worth of vending wisdom into a philosophy
that he calls ``High Probability Selling.'' (That's also the name
of his book, published by Abba Publishing.)
</P>
<P>
   His thesis is simple: Sell to people who want what you have.
Figure out who those people are by asking them. Ask as many
questions as you need to see if they are good prospects. Be
radically honest. Do not fudge in order to pique people's interest.
If there is no obvious match, cut them loose _ quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds absurdly obvious, until you consider that the 12
million Americans involved in direct sales are usually told just
the opposite _ that, with enough skill and persistence, anyone can
be persuaded to buy anything. P.T. Barnum, perhaps the most famous
salesman of all, summarized this view of human nature: ``There is a
sucker born every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Werth does not look the part of a rebel against time-honored
wisdom. His deep-set blue eyes sink into dark circles; his thinning
silver hair is brushed neatly to the side. His speech, which
betrays his roots in working-class Queens, never rises above a
conversational tone.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, he resembles a reduced-scale version of the
barrel-chested actor Brian Dennehy, who, coincidentally, is
starring in a 50th-anniversary Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's
classic ``Death of a Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Werth is no Willy Loman. After leaving New York Community
College (now New York Technical College) in Brooklyn at age 19, he
took a job selling forklifts and worked himself up to the top spot
in the company's sales force. Eventually, he made a career of
taking over failing businesses. Over the years, he says, he has
rescued 10 firms, from an Italian sports-car dealership to a plant
that manufactures machines used to make silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   The thread connecting these varied projects, he said, was
re-educating and reinvigorating the sales forces with his
no-pressure, to-the-point methodology. Now a millionaire, he works
primarily as a consultant helping troubled companies _ and as an
evangelist, trying to convert others to his system.
</P>
<P>
   At each step along the way, Werth has made time to follow
whatever top salesmen and saleswomen he could find as they went
about their work.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they knew it or not, he said, the bulk of these
successful sellers used similar strategies. They sought out a great
deal of information about buyers and built long-term, intimate
relationships. As a result, they were able to know their customers'
needs and fulfill them. Just as important, they could also discern
who had no need for their products.
</P>
<P>
   The best salesman Werth has ever seen, he said, is David Grob,
whom he called the sales champion of the semiconductor equipment
industry. Werth describes with reverence the day he followed Grob,
who worked for him at the time, to Motorola for a first call on a
new product manager.
</P>
<P>
   Grob started by asking the new manager questions _ where he had
come from, what jobs he had held, to whom he would be reporting.
When the product manager said that his own boss was about to be
replaced, Grob told him that the replacement would be coming from
Motorola's Philippines operation.
</P>
<P>
   The product manager was surprised and impressed, and he asked
Grob if he knew the man. ``Of course,'' said Grob, who then
described the client's boss-to-be in great detail. Later, Werth
learned that Grob kept in-depth organizational charts of the
company _ indeed, that he came close to knowing as much about the
power structure at Motorola as the people who worked there did.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed from his home in Phoenix, Grob, now an independent
sales representative, confirmed Werth's interpretation of his work,
saying it was important to know the internal chain of command in
client companies, from ``operator to vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Werth argued, most salesmen spend a lot of wasted
time looking for an ``in'' at a company _ that is, for anyone who
will take an interest in the product. But such people, he said, are
usually just looking for an education about what's offered and are
seldom ready to buy from the sales representative making the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, sales agents end up trying to be aggressive, wily
and deceptive enough to force a sale on a party not yet ready to do
business. Werth pointed to a help-wanted ad in a newspaper seeking
``an elbow-throwing, hard-hitting applicant,'' saying it was
typical of the mentality of most sellers' bosses. They think sales
are made when someone is trying hard, he said, rather than when
someone is offering a desired product.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Certainly, self-help books and trainers emphasize secret tips
and clever strategies for making sales. One popular book,
``Guerrilla Selling: Unconventional Weapons and Tactics for
Increasing Your Sales'' (Houghton Mifflin, $13), teaches ways to
sneak into organizations _ going in the back door carrying
doughnuts, for example _ to make contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Another best seller, ``How to Master the Art of Selling,'' by
Tom Hopkins (Warner Books, $14.99), offers all sorts of tricks for
finding sales prospects. The book suggests visiting new businesses
and telling the proprietors you want to get acquainted so you can
refer customers to them. Of course, you drop off your card and hope
they will pass business back your way.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins also favors linguistic devices _ ending statements with
phrases like ``isn't it?'' and ``don't we?'' _ because they are
incremental ways to get a prospect to say ``yes'' to a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is unfamiliar with Werth's approach, but he expressed
skepticism that focusing on a narrow field of high-probability
customers could be a winning strategy. To become a successful
real-estate salesman, Hopkins said, ``I couldn't wait on my butt
until people came to me; I had to go out and knock on doors.'' He
said his skill was his ability to ``create a need for my product
through good presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Werth does not deny that persistence or even old-fashioned
arm-twisting sometimes works. By his own precise calculus, 16
percent of the top sales agents he has evaluated were able to
succeed by being ``slick, glib, deceitful con artists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Werth thinks that such success comes at a terrible price:
The people doing the selling are miserable. Think of the
success-obsessed but self-loathing real-estate hustlers in David
Mamet's ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' a play that Werth praises for its
verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   In the instructional seminars he runs, Werth is reminded
constantly of how people in sales can be full of self-loathing and
doubt. When he asks how they feel when they are making sales,
typical responses are ``like a supplicant'' and ``vulnerable.''
Asked how they feel when they fail to close deals, they say
``resentful'' or ``like a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Such findings of unhappiness have plenty of anecdotal
corroboration. ``The Force,'' a 1994 book by David Dorsey (Fawcett
Books, $12.50), followed the top copier salesmen for Xerox and
found that even those making six-figure incomes had become walking
wounded from the stress of making quotas. One top producer took a
chain saw to the family Christmas tree; another tossed a frozen
turkey down a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of both the seller and the buyer, it
would seem that Werth's techniques would make selling a more
pleasant experience. In theory, Werth's salesman is just the guy
you want to deal with _ someone who offers only as much information
as you want and only about products in which you are truly
interested.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, of course, this approach takes some adjusting to.
During our shopping trip, Werth followed me into the luxury ABC
Carpet and Home store on lower Broadway. We were immediately
approached by Tevfik Askin, an almond-eyed clerk from Turkey. He
started amiably enough but very soon seemed to grow bored and
uncommunicative.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: Do these carpets need to be special-cleaned?
</P>
<P>
   Askin: Depends on the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: Let's say orange juice; my son dribbles a lot of that.
</P>
<P>
   Askin, shrugging: It depends on the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: OK. How about a wool carpet?
</P>
<P>
   Askin: Depends which one; they are all different. Do you have
one in mind? If not, you should try the rack.
</P>
<P>
   Then Askin was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he would explain that while he is willing to work with
everyone, ``some people are like blanks, and you send them to the
racks so that they get some idea where to start.'' After that, he
said, he works with the customer _ and has sometimes made sales
even to people starting with almost no sense of what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   At the point of contact, however, I was unimpressed. I offered
Werth my assessment: ``Not very knowledgeable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, contradicting me because he had recognized a
high-probability salesman at work. ``He knows this stuff, but he
knows we're not ready to buy. There is a lot of floor traffic here,
and he would rather get a better prospect. He's good.''

HOUSE MANAGERS PREPARE TO SHOW LEWINSKY VIDEOTAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As senators wrangled over how to end the
impeachment trial of President Clinton next week, House managers
prepared to show video excerpts in the Senate of Monica Lewinsky
and two others being questioned about their role in the
sex-and-lies scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of the videotaped depositions taken this week of
Lewinsky, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal, were released Friday in anticipation of
Saturday's six-hour presentation of evidence by House managers and
White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   While the interrogations unearthed no bombshells, House members
are expected to use pieces of the videotape to underscore their
allegations that the president perjured himself and obstructed
justice in covering up his affair with Lewinsky, a former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   While it appears that the Senate does not have the votes to
convict the president, the playing of the videotape of Lewinsky
presents the last chance for the House managers to sway lawmakers
and to persuade a public that has been skeptical of their pursuit
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time the Senate and the people of America are
going to get a chance to meet Monica Lewinsky the person, not
Monica Lewinsky as she has been described by lawyers and
spinmeisters,'' said House manager Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   House managers, who function as the prosecutors in the Senate
impeachment trial, are expected to focus on the obstruction of
justice charge, pointing out in particular evidence that Clinton
urged Lewinsky to hide gifts he gave her.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Lewinsky repeated her contention that
Clinton's secretary Betty Currie initiated the call to suggest the
former intern turn over the gifts to her.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lewinsky video may help prosecutors hammer home some
of their arguments, it also could bolster the White House
contention that the president never urged the young woman to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during the questioning, Lewinsky repeated that the
president never instructed her what to say in an affidavit she
submitted to Paula Jones' lawyers. In that affidavit, part of
preparations for Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against
Clinton, Lewinsky denied having sex with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The former intern also said she had her own reasons for trying
to avoid testifying about her affair with Clinton in the Paula
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I thought it was nobody's business. Second of
all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula Jones or her
case,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony also revealed how legally savvy the former White
House intern has become, as she successfully dodged several
questions posed by Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., that could have
incriminated the president.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Bryant asked Lewinsky if she believed the president
lied when he denied touching her in a sexual manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel comfortable characterizing whether what he
said was truthful or not truthful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also challenged Bryant when he referred to her moments
with the president as ``salacious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call it something else? This is my relationship,'' she
told the House members, adding she preferred ``encounter'' to
describe her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's testimony also is expected to provide both sides with
ammunition. Prosecutors are expected to focus on the lawyer's
extensive efforts to get Lewinsky a job in New York. But White
House attorneys will likely seize on Jordan's denial that he ever
instructed Lewinsky to destroy notes to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was asked by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., about whether
he had discussed what to do with the notes with Lewinsky during a
breakfast meeting after she had been subpoenaed by Jones'
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan replied, ``Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal
friend, but I am not a fool, and the notion that I would suggest to
anybody that they destroy anything just defies anything that I know
about myself. So the notion that I said to her, go home and destroy
notes is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the prospect of watching Lewinsky on video has injected
some sizzle in the trial, most lawmakers were already looking
beyond the presentation to figure out how to end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally accepted that the Senate will not be able to
muster the two-thirds votes to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is now whether the Senate should rebuke the president
for his actions in the form of a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been pushing such a resolution while many
Republicans remain skeptical about endorsing censure of the
president that is not explicitly provided for in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said that the Constitution merely
provides for the ouster of the president, not some other kind of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get into the habit of having one party, controlling
Congress, censure the president of another party, there is no end
to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have
been trying to draft a censure resolution that can garner
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that the failure to remove this president
... not be misunderstood as a vindication of his behavior,'' said
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, said she
would consider supporting a censure resolution if it addressed the
allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said the senators should send a message that ``there
is not a new standard in this country for criminal justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison continued to lobby to open to the public the senators
concluding deliberations in the trial, expected to take place next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, 67 senators, two-thirds of the body, would
have to approve opening up the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is so important for the American people to see what
the reasoning, what the thought process, what the points of law
were on which we made this very historic decision,'' said
Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed about 60 senators were willing to open up
the proceeding, although there remained significant resistance
among Hutchison's GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents fear that opening the final statements would only
encourage the senators to play to the television cameras rather
than deliver sober assessments of the case.
</P>
<P>
   However, several senators, referring to the increasing
unpopularity of the impeachment effort, said that by opening up the
process, the lawmakers might regain the public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can begin by allowing the American people to see this
terrible, unseemly episode in our nation's history end on a note of
rational and thoughtful debate,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that the trial, now in its fifth week, has taken its
toll on the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Only partly joking, Specter, at a press conference with a number
of his colleagues, told reporters, ``We are all sick as a matter of
medical fact. And we all understand the cause of the sickness. It's
called the impeachment trial.''

ROYAL FAMILY, NATION AWAIT DEMISE OF BELOVED KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ The nation waited anxiously and his family
prayed by his side as King Hussein lay on his deathbed Friday night
at a military hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   The king, who was rushed home after last-ditch cancer treatments
failed in the United States, was on life support after his liver
and kidney had failed, one palace source said.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old monarch left Minnesota's famed Mayo Clinic on
Thursday after his body rejected treatments intended to fight off
his lymphatic cancer. A royal statement said that at the king's own
``persistent wish,'' he was returning to his homeland where he has
ruled for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   The royal family balanced its grief at the patriach's impending
death with the responsibilities of power. Members were meeting late
into the night to finalize the plans for the succession of Crown
Prince Abdullah, the palace source added, and beginning
preparations for a funeral that will bring heads of state from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who is expected to be among those at his
funeral, called him ``a wonderful human being, a champion of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As a cold rain swept the streets of Amman Friday, the people of
Jordan _ construction workers in coffee shops, underemployed
college graduates at an Internet cafe, and families gathered around
television sets _ also struggled with sorrow for their beloved
leader and apprehension for the future. Eighty percent of the
nation knows no other ruler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a king of peace. And now we can only pray for him,''
said Hussein Mohammed Alba, 56, who strained to see television
updates on Hussein through a fog of smoke from cigarettes and water
pipes at the Zahara Cafe in Amman's gritty downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the father of us all, and it is very difficult and very
sad to imagine life without him,'' said Alba, who like some 60
percent of Jordan's 4 million people hails from a family of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe, with framed photographs of four generations of
Hussein's ruling clan above the cash register, was packed with
brick layers and truck drivers who sipped small black cups of
coffee as they watched a television set mounted into a wall. Most
seemed deeply saddened, but resigned that the king's long battle
with cancer was in its final stage.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe and the crowded, rain-soaked streets outside
represented a cross-section of Jordan and because of Jordan's large
immigrant population, the entire Arab world. There were Palestinian
taxi drivers, an Egyptian agricultural worker, Iraqi women peddling
vegetables, and a Sudanese construction worker, and all of them
expressed one unified response to the grim news about Hussein's
health: The region and the world will sorely miss his unique
presence as a peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the Arab world is here in this cafe,'' said cafe owner
Hosni Suliman, 66. ``Not all of them agree with everything the king
has done. But I can tell you all of them are very sad. He was a
great man. Generous and courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   His clientele stared at the archival footage of Hussein
broadcast by Jordanian TV. And along the street, in shoe stores and
candy shops and groceries, shop owners and customers were glued to
radios.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Jordanians told touching stories of their own
personal contact with the king, reiterated the tales of his courage
as a peacemaker, and remembered his unforgettable generosity. He
was known to personally pay for medical treatment of poor people or
help a struggling family find a house.
</P>
<P>
   Muein Amin, 40, sat with his 70-year-old father and two of his
teenage sons warming their hands around a kerosene heater in the
family's shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   Amin told of the time the king, upon his return home after
winning his first bout with cancer in 1994, granted an amnesty to
Jordanians for outstanding parking tickets. The amnesty saved Amin
$200.
</P>
<P>
   But he remembered even more vividly the time he was able to
shake the king's hand during Ramadan in 1997 at the Al Husseini
Mosque just up the street from his store. On that day a woman was
crying in front of the mosque with a sick child in her arms. She
pleaded to the king for help, and Hussein not only stopped to
listen but waited with her on the street while his security guards
arranged for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget that day as long as I live,'' said Amin.
``Today we went back to the mosque and we prayed for the king, we
prayed that God will greet him in paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   On the more upscale side of Amman, on one of the modern
capital's many broad avenues lined with neon signs for American
fast food chains and trendy clothing boutiques, 23-year-old Ehab
Okush was tracking the news of the king's condition.
</P>
<P>
   With a college degree in computer programming and a $300-a-month

 &HT;    $20,000 signing bonus for teachers reflects tight market, health
economy
 &HT;    By Diane Loupe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin White showed up at a major Southern university
Friday with applications and $20,000 signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the money won't go to talented running backs or computer
programmers. White was at Emory University looking for teachers _
good teachers, willing to go to urban schools in Massachusetts and
teach for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonus, which the Massachusetts Department of
Education intends to hand out to 50 first-year teachers, has become
the talk of the teaching world. Bonus recipients get $8,000 the
first year and $4,000 in each of three subsequent years. They also
are eligible for $1,500 a year to help pay off college loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts recruiter arrived more than an hour late for a
career fair Friday at Emory, but Grace Hagood was waiting for him,
ready to hand him a resume and to tout her upcoming master's degree
in teaching from Agnes Scott College and her undergraduate degree
from Wellesley _ a Massachusetts college, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Hagood said the bonus was nice, but ``no teacher gets into the
profession for the money. Massachusetts is a wonderful place.
Boston is a great place for anyone who is interested in the
academic life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts program targets college seniors, not
necessarily education majors, who are in the top 10 percent of
their graduating class, have at least a 3.5 grade point average,
rank in the top tenth percentile of a nationally recognized exam or
are nominated by the dean of their school. The state also will
consider mid-career professionals based on their work experience.
</P>
<P>
   White returns to Atlanta on Feb. 16 to recruit at Spelman
College. The application deadline is March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Relocating for the bonus money might not necessarily be a great
deal. In addition to higher cost of living considerations, the
average first-year salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree in
Georgia is $29,883, compared with $27,000 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' bonus is among a growing number of incentives
schools are using to recruit good teachers in a strong economy and
tight teacher's market. Dallas schools paid $1,500 signing bonuses
to 900 new teachers hired last fall. New teachers in Baltimore can
receive $5,000 toward closing costs on a home in the city and
$1,200 for relocation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Department of Education officials were unimpressed by
the Massachusetts offer. ``Under the Constitution of the state of
Georgia, gratuities are not allowed,'' said Pat Sandor, department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some prospective teachers at the Emory job fair said the bonus
wouldn't interest them. They spent their time talking to recruiters
from Atlanta, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Rockdale and other Georgia school
systems. ``I was born in Atlanta, my whole family is here, and this
is where I'm staying,'' said master's student Jennifer Dye. ``But I
wish Georgia would offer us a $20,000 bonus. That would be a
plus.''

SENATORS STILL SEEK WORDS TO USE IN CLINTON REBUKE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 7) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton's impeachment trial draws to a
finish, unresolved questions threaten to prolong the scandal well
beyond the end of the week, when the Senate is expected to acquit
him of perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   While the president still faces the possibility of criminal
charges over his cover-up of an extramarital affair, the most
pressing issue is whether Republicans and Democrats in the Senate
will find a way, once the trial ends, to rebuke the president for
his misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to go away if we're going to go
right into censure,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``We're
going to be dealing with this for another few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled Monday to hear closing arguments from
the House prosecutors and the president's defense team. On Tuesday,
senators begin deliberations, which the rules say can last up to 25
hours and be held behind closed doors. Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., has said the Senate will vote on the two articles of
impeachment no later than Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a desire among Republican and Democratic senators
for something other than an outright acquittal of Clinton, loyalty
to their political party, concerns over precedent, and worry about
their place in history are threatening negotiations on how to
reprimand the president for the nation's yearlong ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the censure talks is a concern, particularly among
Democrats, that any resolution adopted by the Senate not provide
more grist for the criminal investigation of Clinton being run by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Twice since the opening of Clinton's trial in early January,
Americans have been reminded that Starr still has Clinton in his
sights. A month ago, he secured an indictment against a woman whose
testimony did not jibe with other accounts of events surrounding
the president's encounter with Kathleen Willey. A week ago, unnamed
Starr associates leaked a story that the special prosecutor was
considering whether to indict the president on criminal charges
similar to those outlined in the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the first Senate Democrat to
condemn Clinton publicly for his affair and cover-up, said any
censure resolution should deal with the Monica Lewinsky matter and
Clinton's behavior toward the courts in trying to conceal the
relationship. ``I feel strongly that we should not reach a finding
that says he ... committed a particular crime,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, appointed in 1994 to investigate Clinton's business
dealings in Arkansas, won permission almost 13 months ago to expand
his inquiry to include allegations that the president and others
conspired to cover up the Lewinsky affair. This segment of Starr's
investigation led to a report to Congress in September outlining
impeachable offenses, which prompted the House _ in a party-line
vote _ to indict the Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's trial began the first week of January, the 55
Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate have danced at the edge
of the partisan void into which the House fell during hearings and
debate last fall on impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Democratic efforts to bring the trial to a quick
end were thwarted by the Republican majority, which consistently
voted to give House prosecutors leeway, with some limits, to
present a case that grew weaker at each turn.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers were fighting to establish legitimacy in two
respects, said Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the College of
William and Mary. ``The first is short term; they want the senators
present at the trial to consider seriously their claims'' against
the president, Gerhardt said. ``The second thing is they are
playing to history. They want historians later to be able to look
back and see that the record here is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   And that has become the prosecutor's mantra, since day one in
the trial, behind summoning witnesses. It never got more than a
lukewarm reception from Republican senators and gained outright
hostility from Democrats. The Republicans' desire to see, hear and
weigh live testimony was tempered by their concern that the Senate
would become the forum for a salacious spectacle featuring the
president's former sexual playmate.
</P>
<P>
   When the critical votes were cast Thursday on the House
prosecutors' motion to have Lewinsky tell her story in person to
the Senate, caution outweighed curiosity as 25 Republicans sided
with the Democrats, who have stood united during the trial, to
reject the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always the chance that (summoning Lewinsky to
testify before the Senate) would create a spectacle,'' said Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala. ``I didn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With that vote, a pattern of party-line votes on procedural
matters was broken, and the senators signaled that it was time to
draw the trial to a close. The bipartisan vote also telegraphed
what had become clear in three other test votes during the
five-week trial, that there were not enough votes to convict the
president on either of the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a significant vote,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
``Here was the star witness (Lewinsky) and the Senate decides we
don't even want to call her. Everybody is looking for an exit
door.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of relief was palpable, even among Republicans, that
the trial had entered its final phase as polls found that public
opinion of the Senate had dropped dramatically as a result of the
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are trying to maintain a cheerful and responsible
attitude,'' Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar said with a broad grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has to twist my arm to get out of this,'' said Sen.
Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sounding the death knell for the House case for
removing Clinton, Thursday's vote also underscored the differences
between the House, where the hearings and debate over impeachment
last fall buzzed with partisanship, and the Senate, where rancor
historically has yielded to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, read Thursday's vote
as ``an encouraging sign that (Republicans and Democrats in the
Senate) may come together on some motion to censure (the president)
and reach some final disposition on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the
country don't want the president removed but don't want him to have
any sense of exoneration,'' Nunn said. ``A strongly worded
(censure) resolution with bipartisan support can put this into the
right historical context, which would be a strong condemnation of
the president's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, is working with two Democratic
senators, Dianne Feinstein of California and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York, to draft a censure resolution with language
tough enough to draw Republican support and not so harsh that it
drives away Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very strong majority of both parties that does not
want to see this president get off scot-free,'' Bennett said. ``If
we can just find the right set of words for people to come
together, I think there are 80 votes or more for censure.''

MAIR, KJUS TO RENEW DOWNHILL RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Austrian Hermann ``The Herminator'' Maier and
Norway's Lasse Kjus bring their rivalry to the Birds of Prey
downhill course Saturday in the World Alpine Ski Championships as
new snow softens and slows the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The new course, built for this off-year answer to Olympic
competition, is steep and cranky, rivaling the best European
courses and facilitating speeds up to 80 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Maier leads an Austrian team that has dominated the World Cup
circuit this year as no other team in the last half-century. The
Austrians lead the Nations Cup with 8,929 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Birds of Prey course was built two years ago at the
Vail-owned Beaver Creek resort _ about 10 minutes west of Vail _
after criticism of the Centennial downhill course used 10 years ago
when the Alpine worlds were also held at Vail.
</P>
<P>
   The course is 1 1/5 miles long with a vertical drop of 2,484
feet and jumps giving skiers up to 150 feet of air time.
</P>
<P>
   The course starts at a headwall called The Brink, where, says
Maier, ``the bottom drops out,'' making for the longest sustained
pitch of any World Cup course. Skiers maintain this pitch for up to
30 seconds, trying to negotiate a couple of tight turns but staying
in their tuck. Any deficit of .3 seconds at this section takes a
skier out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed zone comes later at Pumphouse, a straightaway on
which skiers accelerate to their maximum before a combination left
sweep and sharp right. Ease up here and the race is over.
</P>
<P>
   Race fans in the 2,500-seat finish area stadium get to watch a
series of three jumps _ Golden Eagle, Harrier, and Red Tail, where
skiers can also lose speed if they get too much air and cannot hold
their tuck.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the women's downhill will be run, with US skier Megen
Gerety fresh off her best result _ ninth _ last week at Kitzbuehel,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg captured the women's combined title
Friday with a blistering second slalom run.
</P>
<P>
   Wiberg, collecting her fourth career world championship gold
medal, stood fifth entering the last of three races. Combined times
for the one downhill and two slalom runs determined the combined
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Wiberg, .69 seconds off the pace after the first slalom run, was
clocked in 42.68 seconds on an aggressive second run. Four
subsequent racers couldn't overtake her. Her aggregate time was 3
minutes 8.52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's Renate Goetschl, who won the downhill and maintained
her lead despite only the seventh-fastest run in the first slalom
heat, could manage only a 43.52 time in the second run, during
which she nearly fell. She settled for the silver medal in 3:08.67.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze went to France's Florence Masnada in 3:08.97.

FUTURE OF INDIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM RIDES ON MEANS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To many, Russell Means is the emblem of the American
Indian, storming Plymouth Rock, leading the Sioux uprising at
Wounded Knee, running alongside Daniel Day Lewis in ``The Last of
the Mohicans,'' and giving voice to Pocahontas's Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   As the first leader of the American Indian Movement, he
championed Indian sovereignty and self-determination, turning his
trial after the Wounded Knee uprising into a forum for righting the
wrongs of whites against indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   But if Russell Means once embodied Indian sovereignty, now, it
seems, he is bent on destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   With a dramatic trial of the Navajo Supreme Court to take place
at Harvard Law School Saturday, Indian country is watching in
horror at the prospect that the man who has come to symbolize the
American Indian will argue that Indians do not have the right to
police crime on their own lands.
</P>
<P>
   With Means threatening to take his case to the US Supreme Court,
the trial is reverberating across native lands where Indians are
struggling with increased violent crime and questions of who
controls lands that, more and more, aren't home to just Indians but
to intermingling, intermarrying populations.
</P>
<P>
   Means, an Oglala Sioux, was arrested in 1997 at his home in the
Navajo nation in Arizona for threatening and assaulting his
father-in-law and another Navajo man.
</P>
<P>
   He is being tried in the Navajo Supreme Court, according to a
1991 law under which Congress gave Indian tribes the right to
prosecute non-member Indians. But Means and his lawyer argue that
Congress didn't have the authority to do that. The US Supreme Court
has already ruled that Indians can't prosecute non-Indians. To
allow prosecution because he is Indian, Means claims, discriminates
against him because he is not, say, white or black.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Supreme Court, in existence since 1959 and put under
Navajo common law in 1985, is conducting its trials at universities
across the country to curry credibility for the Indian justice
system with the American public. The court selected this case to
bring to Harvard because of the expected significance of the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   If Means and his lawyers pursue the issue to the US Supreme
Court, as they say they intend, Indian-law specialists say it could
become a defining case for questions about the legitimacy of the
Indian justice system and the powers that Congress has given to
American Indians. And with a conservative court, the Navajo fear
that they are almost certain to see those rights erode.
</P>
<P>
   That the nascent Navajo court system will hold trial in the
nation's oldest and most establishment law school is perhaps the
least of the curious twists in the Means case.
</P>
<P>
   The crowning irony is that it is Russell Means accusing the
Indians of racism. While many Indians still hold him as a hero, his
most recent fight has made many see him as a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Navajo country, a lot of people believe in prophecy and
events coming together, synchronicity, and they think there is
something of that going on here,'' said Robert Williams, a
University of Arizona law professor who is a visiting professor at
Harvard this semester. ``With the irony of it all, it's as if the
Creator is sending a message. That the best known Indian advocate
could have his name on the case which undermines the protection of
Indian rights _ from an Indian perspective, all the signs are for
something horrible to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the American Indian Movement he founded has recently
proclaimed that it is ``distancing'' itself from Means.
</P>
<P>
   Means himself won't be at the Ames Courtroom at Harvard when
three Navajo justices sit in their black robes to hear his case. An
announcement on his Web page, under his picture with long braids
and turquoise and silver jewelery, says he is in Ecuador fighting
for the rights of indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   Means' case began with a complaint filed on Dec. 28, 1997,
charging him with threatening and assaulting the two men. But the
facts of the alleged assaults aren't the matter in dispute. At
issue in the Navajo Supreme Court is whether it has the power to
decide the case.
</P>
<P>
   Indian-law specialists say the US Supreme Court expanded the
power of Indian courts from the 1950s to the 1970s. There are now
150 Indian trial courts in the United States, the Navajo the
largest of them, hearing 70,000 cases a year, about 55 percent of
those criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But the US courts began restricting the power of Indian criminal
prosecutions in 1979 when it ruled that Indian courts could not
prosecute non-Indians. In 1990, the court ruled further that Indian
tribal courts could not prosecute Indians who were not members of
the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Congress passed a law reversing that decision. And
the lawyer who won the Supreme Court case, John Trebon, began
looking for a case with which he could challenge Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell Means,'' Trebon said Friday, ``is that case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo say because Means had lived on their nation for a
long time when he allegedly assaulted the two men _ he has since
married another woman and moved to Southern California _ he
consented to Navajo custom, becoming what is known as
(itals)hadane(unitals), which loosely translated means a kind of
common law Navajo.
</P>
<P>
   Trebon argues this is a ``legal fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would non-member Indians be inherently members, and not
non-Indians, if they both have the same consent relationships? It's
just because of race that we (as whites) can't be subjected to
Indian jurisdiction but non-members can. That just doesn't
compute.''
</P>
<P>
   Trebon says the federal government should be prosecuting crimes
by non-member Indians, as they do with whites.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue this is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a couple of hundreds of miles from the nearest sizeable
town. When we're dealing with the level of crime we are, are we
expected to send for someone there? It creates a problem of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, some say, increased intermarrying and movement
among Indian nations argues for increased Indian jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory has been that if two bad white men had a shootout,
the sheriff comes in and takes care of it,'' says Bobo Dean, a
lawyer who specializes in Indian law in Washington, D.C. ``That was
probably in some cases a good thing. But it presupposed the absurd
notion that if two white people had a shootout in the middle of an
Indian town, that it didn't involve the Indians who had to duck and
get away. That basic princple was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much movement back and forth that just as it
undermines Indian law to have white people immune from tribal law,
it undermines it to have non-members be immune.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in
several months.
</P>
<P>
   To Chief Justice Robert Yazzie, the issue is broader than the
Means case, and broader even than jurisdictional issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that works against us as a nation is ignorance,
indifference, and arrogance,'' he said. ``There's not been a
recognition or respect for Indian tribal courts, and again that's
out of arrogance and indifference. We have all the foundations to
run a fair system, and we think that should be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of the Navajo court, he said, is to restore
relationships that have ``fallen to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more respect is restored to a disrupted relationship,'' he
said, ``the better chance there is to restore stability in
individuals, in families, in communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Navajo doubt there can be any restoring the
relationships between them and Russell Means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a valid court, and certainly when I discussed
that with Russell Means, he clearly, out of respect for the Navajo
nation, wanted to take this issue to them,'' Trebon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why people would think it's an irony,'' he added.
``I run into people who know Russell and have a great deal of
respect for him, he's a colorful figure who creates controversy
everywhere he goes. He's a native American, he has lots of respect
for the institutions and processes. I don't think him bringing this
action undermines that belief whatsoever.''

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ As Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland tried
Friday to reassure naysayers that his plan to move the New England
Patriots here was not in trouble, more problems with the proposed
stadium here emerged behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a steam plant that needs to be removed from the
downtown location, authorities are now grappling with the fact that
junctions for nearly all of the city's main utility lines are under
the land there, according to people familiar with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the state, which is obliged to buy parcels from
several companies to assemble the site in time for construction by
the summer of 2000, underestimated how much money some property
owners would seek to clear out in time, those individuals say.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office, in its haste to put the $350 million deal
together in virtual secrecy, was unaware of the complexity
surrounding those issues until only recently, those sources said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, negotiations on securing the site have dragged on,
causing Rowland and team owner Robert Kraft to miss two target
dates for signing the final development agreement, a 250-page
document that lays out in detail how the stadium would get built
and when.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Rowland was silent on the specific issues that are
holding up the plan but he hinted at some of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you are on what I kindly call the death watch,''
Rowland said at an afternoon news conference that was originally
scheduled as a ceremony to sign the final agreement. ``Is this
really going to happen? Is something going to go wrong? If this
were easy this would have been done a long time ago. And we're not
going into a virgin piece of property without any problems
whatsoever or existing tenants. But I will share with you that the
discussions with CTG have been very fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   CTG Resources Inc., which owns the steam plant that heats and
cools many of Hartford's buildings, has been negotiating with a
quasi-public power facility to provide energy to that section of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But those talks have been stalled, forcing Rowland to hire an
outside mediator to help both sides find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich Gray, who's my representative, has had a lot of
discussions with the parties involved and I think you're going to
see some significant progress on that issue in the next few
weeks,'' Rowland said. ``CTG does want to leave that site. You saw
them all at the various signings, the bill signing, the MOU
signing.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday _ in the same room where Kraft and Rowland signed their
preliminary agreement last November, surrounded by executives from
the steam plant and crowds of other project supporters -- there was
no one standing behind either man.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's wife Myra was off to the side along with a couple of
spokesmen and other aides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite somber appearances, Kraft said he still believes the
deal will go through, although he sidestepped a question near end
of the news conference about whether he would sign the agreement
even if the steam plant and other issues remained outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I know, as of today, there's no doubt in my mind
that this will happen,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the development agreement would be released and
signed next week, atlhough he did not specify a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are changes, movements, issues that arise between now
and 2001, by mutual agreement, we can make those changes,'' Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he hinted that some of the problems with the location along
the Connecticut River would not be ironed out before the document
is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development agreement...is not contingent upon the site
and all the other information being completed right now,'' the
governor said, ``In other words, we do not have to have at this
moment the complete proposal, where the plant is going to go and
how it's going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plant cannot be moved or the state cannot afford to
compensate all the private land owners or move the water and gas
lines beneath the land, ``then Robert Kraft and John Rowland sit
down and make whatever changes need to take place,'' the governor
added.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland declined to ``play the what-if game'' and name
alternative sites, if any exist. ``It's going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The major stumbling block appears to be CTG, which has to remove
its headquarters and plant. But Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance
Co. and The Travelers have some parking lots on the land, which
will have to be replaced if employees are going to have a place for
their vehicles after the $1 billion Adriaen's Landing project --
which encompasses the stadium -- is built.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rowland did not return several calls. And a
spokesman for the Patriots declined to comment.

UNIVERSITY SEEKS TO AVOID ENTANGLEMENT IN LEWIS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- A lawyer for Northeastern University pleaded
with a judge Friday to keep them out of the bitter malpractice
lawsuit filed by the widow of the late Boston Celtics captain
Reggie Lewis against Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge, Jr., the cardiologist
who last treated the former Celtics captain before he died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Jones told Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thayer
Fremont-Smith the school should not be forced to hand over the
report of the investigation into the school's athletic program that
was triggered by Lewis' death -- and the allegation that Lewis was
using cocaine while in college.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Northeastern is willing to give information to
Mudge's attorneys, but must be certain disclosures are kept
confidential because only part of the report relates to Lewis. He
said only two copies of the blue ribbon commission's report exist
and both are kept under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern and Dailey had been negotiating over access to the
commission's records, but talks bogged down over the question of
confidentialty, which prompted Northeastern to seek judicial
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made his plea to the judge after Mudge's lead attorney,
William J. Dailey, Jr., accused the school of ``stonewalling'' his
efforts to clarify the memory of Dr. Job Fuchs, who has emerged as
a key player in the three-year-old litigation. In 1987, Fuchs
conducted drug testing on the school's basketball team and
discovered that two players tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs reportedly told other Northeastern officials Lewis was one
of those two players and also reportedly told the commission the
same thing. However, Fuchs, now in his 80s, has given contradictory
accounts of what he told officials.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Dailey said Fuchs got a mysterious telephone call
during which a tape of his testimony before the commission was
played for him. Dailey said he needs to examine Northeastern's
records for clarification.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said no one connected with Northeastern made the
telephone call. He also said he is the only one person connected to
the school who has spoken with Fuchs.
</P>
<P>
   At Dailey's request, Fremont-Smith allowed Daley to depose
Vincent J. Lembo, the school's general counsel about the telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told reporters the school is not engaged in a ``coverup''
about drug use by athletes at the school. ``There is no evidence,
and there will be no evidence, of a coverup,'' he said. The
school's concern is the need to keep confidential any inquiry it
conducts into its own programs.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Donna Harris-Lewis' attorney, Robert G.
Harley read a brief statement from his client. ``Reggie never used
cocaine. His only addictions were his family and basketball,''
Harris-Lewis said. ``They are only dragging up these lies to
distract from the fact that Reggie died from negligent medical
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith took Northeastern's request under advisement.

SENATORS APPROACH COMMON GROUND IN TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators from both parties, in bursts of apparent
comity, showed signs Friday of finding common ground in President
Clinton's impeachment trial _ including whether to open
deliberations to the public and whether to censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   On one front, two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein of
California and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, met privately
to work out details of a censure proposal that might be acceptable
to Republicans _ and continued talking with Republican Senators
John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Robert F. Bennett of Utah about
how to reach that goal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a bipartisan group joined forces on opening
the deliberations. Ten senators, from both sides of the aisle, said
they believed an agreement might soon be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we are very close,'' said Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison, a Republican from Texas, after a series of bipartisan
discussions about open deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this gives us hope that not only is there light at the
end of the impeachment tunnel, but that it will end in a less
partisan way and under the bright lights of the sun, not in a
closed session,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat from
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The comments followed votes a day earlier in which senators were
more willing than ever before during the impeachment trial to cross
party lines. Republicans were split on whether to call Monica S.
Lewinsky as a live witness, with 30 of the 55 GOP senators voting
in favor. Democrats divided on the question of presenting only
transcripts _ not videotapes _ of the witness depositions, with 25
of the 45 Democrats supporting the motion.
</P>
<P>
   A motion to open deliberations will require a two-thirds
majority, or 67 votes, to pass. That will require a bipartisan
shift from the last time such a vote was taken _ and the support of
Republicans other than the few who appear to be leading the charge.
</P>
<P>
   When senators voted Jan. 25 whether to open the deliberations on
a motion to dismiss the case, it was defeated 57-43, largely along
party lines. Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Hutchison of Texas
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ three of the GOP champions of
opening deliberations to public view _ were the only Republicans
who supported the earlier motion.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, however, the effort had picked up further GOP
support. Republican Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Richard G.
Lugar of Indiana _ who voted for closed proceedings on Jan. 25 _
both supported the ``sunshine'' motion, urging their party members
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as we define our roles as elected public officials,
accountability is always up there at the top,'' Hagel said. ``The
American people deserve to know, as we work our way through this
trial to the end...that this process has been conducted with
dignity, fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle said he believed they
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we will open it. I'm hoping there will be a
bipartisan recommendation that we will open it,'' said Daschle. ``I
suspect that when the vote is taken, it will be open.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators are likely to begin deliberations next Tuesday, after
closing arguments from both sides, and a final vote on the articles
of impeachment could come as soon as Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A second question _ whether to introduce a censure resolution _
appeared somewhat closer to becoming a reality Friday as well.
Despite strong opposition from several Republicans, as well as
noncommittal remarks from some Democrats, senators said they
believed a censure resolution might be fully drafted by the middle
of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle had hoped to have a written proposal on censure by
Friday. But according to its chief architects, Feinstein and
Moynihan, the plan needs to earn further GOP support behind the
scenes before it could withstand public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you do (release it) it gets torn all apart,''
Feinstein said earlier this week on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
``It's important to me that we have an opportunity to talk to
people on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Waterman, a spokesman for Moynihan, said, ``There's no
sense in coming out with something today when the vote may not be
for another week. The motion would hopefully appeal to as large a
number of senators as possible. To do that is going to require some
delicate negotiations on language, on tone, and on the effects of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations appeared to be in full swing Friday. Members
of a Democratic task force created to study censure were holding
informal negotiations with Republicans, floating various structures
and shapes a censure resolution could take.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said the ``goal in crafting this resolution is two-fold _
to firmly reprimand the president if he is not convicted for his
reckless behavior, and to conclude the trial on a note of
bipartisanship and consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said trying to
reach that goal ``hasn't been easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dianne (Feinstein) Friday...and I think she is in
her 17th draft,'' he said.

CONSERVATIVES WAITING FOR BUSH TO FULFILL HIS SOCIAL PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: For release Sunday, Feb. 7) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush has gained national notice
by pushing a ``moral and spiritual'' agenda in this year's
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   But many Texas social and religious conservative political
leaders say Bush's agenda puts him in the position of Casey at the
bat _ Bush has one final chance to score with social conservatives
before leaping into the major leagues of presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised social conservatives in his 1994 campaign that he
would pass legislation requiring parents to be notified before
their minor daughter can get an abortion. Bush has not yet
fulfilled that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart is in the right place on most social issues,'' said
Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life in Dallas. ``But
it's important for him to come through this session.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be his third time at bat,'' Price said. ``It's
important that he not strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives are suspicious that Bush's actions don't
live up to his words about issues dear to them.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Eagle Forum President Cathie Adams said Bush has a
reputation for getting things done in a bipartisan legislature, so
she said some conservatives are skeptical about how hard Bush
pushed for parental notification in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's social conservative agenda for this session includes
parental notification, creation of a pilot program to test private
school vouchers, and passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act to restrict government infringement on religious practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his third legislative session. I'm glad he's joining
our team,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is officially still only mulling a race for
president, Bush's likely opponents are already trying to portray
him as ``Conservative Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, billionaire Steve Forbes, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander and former Vice President Dan Quayle have all
ridiculed Bush's catch phrase ``compassionate conservatism'' as
evidence of his lack of commitment to a strong conservative
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Karen Hughes said any perception that Bush is on
shaky ground with social conservatives in Texas is just wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush received 97 percent of the Republican primary
vote, which includes a lot of social conservatives. (That) speaks
to the fact that Governor Bush is very popular with social
conservatives. They are a part of his base,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Texas social conservative leaders said Bush is popular
with average activists. But the state's leadership is leery of him,
particularly because of recent acrimony between his administration
and social conservatives on the State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Parro of Dallas, executive director of the National
Republican Coalition for Life, said Bush has courted social
conservatives in Texas and is popular with grassroots people
because ``his rhetoric has been attractive.'' But she said the
state's social conservative leaders are skeptical of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas the perception is that he is very well-liked.
Underneath that, there are many who have concerns,'' Parro said.
``There are people who think he is personable and charming, and
people who are waiting to see where he is going to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Anderson, executive director of the Christian Coalition of
Texas, said the 200,000 members of his organization would offer a
variety of opinions of Bush if polled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could range from glowing compliments to frustration over a
lack of accomplishments,'' Anderson said. ``A lot of the
perceptions of him in social conservative circles are going to
depend on what he does over the next few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Social conservative leaders in Texas offered a laundry list of
Bush's perceived failures and sins against their movement.
</P>
<P>
   _ As part of his prepresidential campaign maneuvering, Bush
recently met with New Jersey lawmakers allied with Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman, and this week New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will be
an overnight guest at the Governor's Mansion. Whitman and Giuliani
are both viewed as abortion-rights politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush does not fit into the box the liberal
Republicans are putting him in, he ought to say so, or face the
likelihood of alienating the core conservative base of the
Republican Party,'' said the Jan. 11 newsletter of Parro's
Republican National Coalition for Life.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes noted that anti-abortion presidential candidates Forbes
and Alexander both have visited the Governor's Mansion recently.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush last year appointed Dee Coates of Houston to the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct. In the early 1990s, Coates led the
movement to have the anti-abortion plank removed from the Texas
Republican Party platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope at the same time they (critics) have complimented
the governor for the appointment of a very strong pro-life advocate
to head the department of health, Reyn Archer,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, Bush became ``the first governor ever to name a
public site after an abortionist'' when he signed a law naming the
Harris County portion of Texas 35 in honor of prominent civic
leader and physician John B. Coleman. Coleman, who died in 1994,
had been a long-time target of anti-abortion protestors because he
had run an abortion clinic and performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that highway was renamed under legislation by local
lawmakers that Texas governors always ceremonially sign.
</P>
<P>
   _ In his 1994 campaign, Bush promised to abolish the regulatory
functions of the Texas Education Agency, but many social
conservatives argue the agency is now stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to abolish the TEA's regulatory authority. The
exact opposite has happened,'' said Stephanie Cecil of Burleson,
education chairman of the Texas Eagle Forum. ``That was
read-my-lips No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Forum leaders also say Bush's administration has adopted
portions of President Clinton's Goals 2000 and School-To-Work
programs designed to match students' education to workforce needs.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim the additional summer reading programs Bush is
proposing as part of his plan to end the social promotion of
failing students is just an expansion of the education bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign promises seem to be a moving target,'' Cecil said.
``There's a lot of doubt in my mind that he believes what he says.
... George Bush promises, but does he deliver?''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush has delivered. The staff size of the TEA has
been cut from 1,144 to 834, she said, and Texas obtained special
status so it could take the federal Goals 2000 money without
strings attached. She said $29 million of that money has been used
for phonics-based reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Education Commissioner Mike Moses also has reduced
state requirements on local districts and teachers by cutting
paperwork and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But without doubt, the biggest split between Bush and Texas'
social conservative leaders occurred over education issues and the
battle between social conservatives on the State Board of Education
and the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   The rancor began in 1995 and worsened in 1997 as Bush approved
lawmakers' decisions to strip the board of a good deal of the
authority it once had, particularly in the area of textbook
selection. The board's social conservatives also fought with Bush
over federal ties to Texas public education.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition's Anderson said a lot of the opinions
among social conservative leaders about Bush were formed by this
conflict between his administration and the conservative members of
the State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said some of the blame for the conflict probably rests
with both sides, but he said they are also concerned that ``we have
not seen a TEA that has been dramatically scaled back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambert, a Republican national committeeman and president of
the Texas Home School coalition, said social conservative leaders
have been genuinely troubled by Bush on education issues, but he
said that should be washed away if the governor passes his parental
notification, pilot vouchers and the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act this session.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he passes all that, I don't think anybody could question
his social conservative credentials,'' Lambert said. ``If he comes
out of the legislative session adopting his plan, the problems
we've had with him on education won't hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said Bush receives some unfair criticism in social
conservative circles for the past failures of the parental
notification legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said the blame should rest with Democratic House Speaker
Pete Laney, not Bush. Lambert said Laney assigned the bill to an
unfriendly committee to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth, R-Burleson, said Bush worked hard
behind the scenes in 1994 on the parental notification legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a Governor Bush problem. This was a House
leadership problem,'' Wohlgemuth said.
</P>
<P>
   Laney last week said no one should blame him if a bill gets
stuck in a legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor can work those committees just like anybody
else,'' Laney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Coalition for Life's Parro said passage
of this agenda would help Bush, but she said he is far from selling
social conservatives on himself as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he ran for president, there would be many, many things he
could do _ just as President Clinton has done to promote the
culture of death _ Governor Bush could promote the culture of
life,'' Parro said. ``We haven't seen any indication that would be
on the top of his list or even on his list at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But some social conservative leaders say it is too early to
count him out of the presidential contest because of conflicts that
have occurred in Texas. The Eagle Forum's Adams said social
conservatives should not automatically drift to conservatives Gary
Bauer or Forbes just because they like their rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Bauer's got great rhetoric, but he's never been elected
to anything and put to the test. The same is true of Forbes,''
Adams said.

STEADFAST LEWINSKY REPEATS GRAND JURY TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In every word she spoke, Monica S. Lewinsky was
guided by a singular purpose in her videotaped deposition with
House impeachment managers: She would break no new ground in
President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've intended for my testimony to be consistent with my grand
jury testimony,'' the former White House intern insisted in the
final minutes of the four-hour session, according to a transcript
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So it went, as Lewinsky stymied Clinton's accusers with a
striking mix of winsome resolve and tenacity, rarely straying from
her account given 22 previous times about her sexual affair with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation gets its first, videotaped glimpse Saturday of
Lewinsky discussing the scandal at Clinton's impeachment trial,
viewers will see a young woman who remains so steadfast under
questioning that her frustrated interrogator later likened her to
the chillingly deceptive star of the movie ``Witness for the
Prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The videotaped questioning of Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan
Jr. and White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal followed a similar
pattern, according to the newly released transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable political passage, the 13 House Republicans who
are pressing for Clinton's removal from office will play video
clips from all three depositions in a three-hour presentation aimed
at strengthening their case. Clinton's lawyers will have three
hours for rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Final arguments by the House managers and Clinton lawyers will
be on Monday, and after deliberations by senators, the final vote
on the articles of impeachment is expected Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our last, best chance to clearly define for history
who is telling the truth about some significant events,'' said
Representative Lindsey O. Graham, a House manager from South
Carolina. ``If they break one way under the facts, the president of
the United States has committed serious crimes. If they break
another way, maybe it is a big misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who testified she harbors ``mixed feelings'' about
Clinton, left no doubt about her loyalty to him as president. Under
questioning by Representative Ed Bryant, a House manager from
Tennessee, Lewinsky said she still admires and respects the
president and appreciates ``what he is doing for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffing every quest by Bryant for a new twist in the drama,
Lewinsky told him at one point, ``I think what you need to know is
that my grand jury testimony is truthful irrespective of whatever
those mixed feelings are.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bryant did not cite a single excerpt from Lewinsky's
deposition Thursday when he pleaded unsuccessfully for the Senate
to call Lewinsky to testify in person. Instead, Bryant invoked
``Witness for the Prosecution,'' the 1957 film in which Marlene
Dietrich fools everyone, including the defense lawyer, Charles
Laughton, in helping her husband, Tyrone Power, beat a murder rap.
</P>
<P>
   As Bryant parried with Lewinsky in the deposition, she relied on
various degrees of wit and defiance in refusing to yield on
multiple points. And Bryant ``felt more and more like one of the
characters'' in the classic movie, he told the Senate Thursday. ``I
was Charles Laughton, Ms. Lewinsky was Marlene Dietrich, and the
president was Tyrone Power,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton,
alleging that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in trying
to cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In her first deposition since the impeachment saga began last
year, Lewinsky was pressed on several disputed points, notably
whether Clinton urged her to file a false affidavit and hide gifts
they had exchanged to thwart the sexual-harassment lawsuit that
Paula Jones had filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me at all,
ever,'' Lewinsky said, according to the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also stood by her previous testimony that she decided
to hide the gifts on the initiative of Clinton's personal
secretary, Betty Currie, not on the president's direction.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lewinsky contradicted Clinton's grand jury testimony
that he told her she should give the Jones lawyers ``whatever she
had.'' Asked if Clinton had told her that, Lewinsky said, ``Not
that I remember.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Bryant she felt comfortable hiding the gifts partly
because she considered the Jones suit groundless. She testified
that when she was subpoenaed in the case, she asked her lawyer ``if
I could sue Paula Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant questioned Lewinsky several times about whether her
affidavit was false, as the House managers and the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, concluded, Lewinsky gave a response
similar to Clinton's description of his testimony in the Jones
case. The most she would admit was that the affidavit was
``incomplete and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lewinsky refused to say whether she believed
Clinton lied when he testified that he never touched her in a
sexual manner. The question is central to one element of the
perjury charge. ``I really don't feel comfortable characterizing
whether what he said was truthful or not truthful,'' Lewinsky
testified. ``I know I've testified to what I believe is true.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Lewinsky became testy with Bryant over his
characterization of her relationship with Clinton as ``salacious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call it something else?'' she said. ``I mean, this is
my relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she described herself as a ``pest'' in prodding Clinton
to help her find a job in New York after she became a potential
witness in the Jones case, Lewinsky testified the president told
her it ``broke his heart'' that her name appeared on the witness
list.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, she joked with Bryant. At one point, Bryant revised
a question early in the deposition, saying, ``I'm making my own
objections now.'' Lewinsky replied: ``We sustain those,'' prompting
a burst of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a prominent Washington lawyer who found an attorney for
Lewinsky in the Jones case and helped her search for a job in New
York, was less friendly under questioning by another House manager,
Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rebuked Hutchinson for asking him to define ``making
rain,'' which in the legal field means attracting business for
one's firm. ``I think even in Arkansas you understand what
rainmaking is,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Hutchinson asked Jordan how much he has billed his
clients, Jordan said he has charged up to $500 an hour. ``Not bad
for a Georgia boy,'' he said. ``I'm from Georgia. You've heard of
that state, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hutchinson told the Senate about the new
disclosures that Jordan made in his deposition, including that he
recalled a breakfast meeting with Lewinsky that he had previously
denied having. Lewinsky testified that Jordan told her during the
meeting to discard any drafts of letters she had written to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan acknowledged refreshing his memory of the
meeting, he adamantly denied Lewinsky's assertion. ``I'm a lawyer
and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm not a fool, and the notion that I
would suggest to anybody that they destroy anything just defies
anything that I know about myself,'' Jordan testified.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, in his often contentious deposition, reaffirmed his
previous testimony that Clinton told him in the early days of the
Lewinsky scandal that she had stalked him and that he had rebuffed
her sexual advances. But Blumenthal, a senior communications
adviser to the president, said he did not leak those allegations
about Lewinsky to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how anything came to be attributed to a White
House source,'' he said.

 &HT;    Aaron birthday bash brings out political, athletic heavyweights
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson and Gita Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twenty-five years after the biggest swing of his life,
Hank Aaron showed Friday night he can still reach the fences. What
was supposed to be a birthday party carried a whole lot farther
than that.
</P>
<P>
   An overflow black-tie crowd ranging from Cooperstown royalty to
President Bill Clinton to Motown to the grass-roots fan jammed the
ballroom at the downtown Hyatt Regency Hotel to celebrate Aaron's
65th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The night also saluted the 25th anniversary of The Hammer's
record-breaking 715th home run and recognized the establishment of
the Hank Aaron Award, which Major League Baseball will begin
presenting annually to the game's most proficient hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Henry Aaron Award, that's the top of everything else,''
said Braves owner Ted Turner. ''Finally we have something that's
worthy of your achievement, and I couldn't be more excited.''
</P>
<P>
   With the blue runway lights of Hartsfield behind him, Clinton
exited Air Force One all smiles, then sped by motorcade to join
Aaron and 1,400 of his closest friends. Dressed in a beautifully
tailored tuxedo, the president smiled for the cameras like a man
without a care in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Congressman John Lewis was the second person off the
president's plane. Greeting Clinton at the wing were Georgia
Attorney General Thurbert Baker, Agriculture Commissioner Tommy
Irvin and Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday bash might have been just the tonic the president
needed right now.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron sought to focus the occasion on his Chasing the Dream
Foundation, the 4-year-old fund he established with his wife,
Billye, to help underprivileged children. A gathering of supporters
that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, National League MVP Sammy
Sosa, heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield and Major
League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig helped commemorate the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The evening generated $1.2 million for the foundation, which
currently serves 44 young people in Atlanta. Aaron hopes to
eventually bring that total to 755 children nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just an athletic scholarship,'' said the former
Braves star. ''You have to maintain a certain grade average. But
the most important thing is, if some kid wants to chase his dream
in piano or anything else, we are able to try to help that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fund-raising, at a time when baseball has reclaimed a
major place in the nation's heart, Aaron was suddenly at center
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's everything together,'' said Selig, who was present at
both Aaron's first and last game in the majors. ''For me, this is
not only so deserving, but he's a guy I grew up with. It's so
richly deserved. It just fits. With the 25th anniversary. It's just
natural. It's an incredible story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Temptations were to perform as was Jeffrey Osborne and a
chorus of eight Chasing the Dream recipients. A parade of 16 guest
speakers were slated to give testimonials. Aaron's storied career
was reviewed and dissected through video replays. A host of former
stars were to roll out the cake.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best story was the one that went untold _ of how
one of the game's greatest stars left the game disillusioned, even
resentful of how he was treated and what has happened in Aaron's
life to lead him to philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think once Hank came to terms with himself outside baseball,
he felt good about what he accomplished in the game,'' said Hall of
Famer Frank Robinson, inducted with Aaron in 1982. ''So he wanted
to try and accomplish something outside baseball that would help
others. I think that's what he's been driving him to try to make it
better for young people, to try to help them realize those dreams,
whether it's in sports or not.''

 &HT;    NBC workers air complaints after showers
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NBC News employees who got three cold showers in
Thursday's anthrax scare sent a complaint to the city Friday.
Workers stuck on the top 15 floors of Colony Square at the same
time sent complaints to building management.
</P>
<P>
   After a letter claiming to contain anthrax spores was opened at
the NBC News office in 400 Colony Square, the bottom nine floors
were ordered evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   But the top 15 floors were told via public address system that
there was a ``problem'' in the building and workers should remain
in their offices. The elevators were disabled, and no one was told
what the ``problem'' was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated us like children,'' said Dina Ruehle, branch
manager of the Alternative Staffing Services office on the 17th
floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th floor offices of NBC, four female employees were
unhappy about having to undergo a series of showers _ first with
their clothes on, and then a shower without clothes _ all in a
decontamination trailer in the middle of Peachtree Street, followed
by a brisk scrubdown at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   NBC would not allow the women to speak to a reporter, but
Charlie Ryan, a field producer who has served as spokesman for the
bureau, said, ``We are happy with the aggressive and quick response
the city took.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, since there were so many agencies involved, there was
bound to be situations where not everyone was on the same page at
the same time ... We have forwarded some concerns we have to the
mayor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief complaint, Ryan said, was that the women ``went
through an unnecessary and uncomfortable decontamination procedure
for another half-hour at Grady.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said eight workers in the bureau were first put through the
Atlanta Fire Department's decontamination trailer showers with
their clothes on. Then they were told they would have to disrobe
entirely and go through them again before being taken to Grady
Memorial Hospital wrapped in sheets.
</P>
<P>
   But after the first four workers _ all women as the male workers
insisted the women go first _ were showered, ``the CDC informed the
fire department on the scene that it now appeared there was a 99.9
percent chance it wasn't anthrax. The unfortunate thing is that
word didn't get to Grady for another half-hour,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Winston Minor said Friday the problem was that his
hazardous materials officers were trying to comply with advice from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and demands from
Grady at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were following our normal procedures for hazardous
materials contamination'' when authorities at Grady said they would
not accept anyone from the scene who had not been put through the
bleach-and-water shower unclothed, Minor said.
</P>
<P>
   After the first four showers, CDC advised that those involved
need only go home, shower and wash their clothes. However, the four
women already taken to Grady without clothing wouldn't be let into
the hospital without first going through portable showers set up
outside.
</P>
<P>
   CDC authorities refused to comment on their procedures, and
Grady Hospital emergency directors could not be reached for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said all the women, who were evaluated and released from
Grady within hours, were feeling fine Friday.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Jay Spadafore said field tests conducted on
similar envelopes received in Washington Thursday weren't done in
Atlanta because ``we get a lot of false positives'' from them and
``we just made a decision not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it will be next week before the substance, which was put
in a secure container and flown to Washington in a FBI jet, along
with material from a similar letter received at the main post
office in Columbus on Thursday, is fully analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   He also said a letter purporting to contain anthrax that was
left in the principal's office at Chestnut Log Middle School in
Douglas County on Friday ``looks like kids wanting to get out of
school.'' Classes were not disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Upper floor employees at 24-story Colony Square were largely
resentful that building officials gave them no information or
reason for the order to stay in their offices Thursday. Not all
complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went down the staircase,'' said Sandy Smith, staffing
coordinator for Alternative Staffing. ``The elevators were shut
down for half an hour before they even made the announcement. Our
impression was that it was a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to go ahead and get out of here,'' she said. ``They
used very poor judgment, treating us the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Building officials did not return a reporter's calls Friday.

NORMAN BLUHM, 78, ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST PAINTER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Vt., Ill.) (bl) 
By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Bluhm, a prominent member of what has often been called
the ``second generation'' of Abstract Expressionist painters, died
Feb. 3 at his home in East Wallingford, Vt. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said Meyer Raphael Rubenstein, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bluhm's work from the 1950s was a broad-stroked gestural
painting that owed a debt to Abstract Expressionist pioneers like
Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, both of whom he knew. Later he
developed a distinctive style that combined abstraction with
figurative elements, painterly looseness with a delicate,
near-calligraphic line.
</P>
<P>
   The large-scale works he exhibited beginning in the 1970s were
often symmetrical compositions that packed swelling forms _
including Rubensian nudes in flesh-pink, yellow and lavender _ into
vividly colored decorative borders. The results, which suggested an
ebullient, sometimes violence-tinged eroticism, drew on a wide
range of art historical references, from Asian manuscript paintings
to stained glass windows to Surrealism. Bluhm, who had an interest
in religious imagery, Western and non-Western, named many of these
paintings after goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bluhm was born on March 28, 1921, in Chicago. As a child he
spent six years in Italy with his mother's family but returned to
Chicago, and at 16, right out of high school, he was a student of
the Bauhaus architect Mies van der Rohe at the Armour Institute of
Technology (later Illinois Institute of Technology).
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 he joined the Army Air Force, became a B-26 pilot and
flew dozens of missions over Europe and North Africa. He later said
that the war, in which his younger brother was killed and he
himself was wounded, had lasting psychological repercussions,
giving Abstract Expressionism's life-and-death ethos a personal
edge for him. It also affected the course of his career in
practical terms.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young American artists after the war, he returned to
Europe on the GI Bill, living first in Florence, then settling in
Paris, where he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Fluent in
French, he mixed easily with both Parisian artists and expatriot
contemporaries like Joan Mitchell and Sam Francis. He encountered
Giacometti and Antoine Artaud, made a brief appearance in Jean
Cocteau's film ``Orphee'' and eked out a precarious living on the
sale of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York in 1956, where he became an integral part
of the city's multilayered, ever-shifting art world. Abstract
Expressionism was still dominant. But many younger painters
championed by the poet and curator Frank O'Hara, were mixing
abstraction with figures, still life and landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Bluhm and O'Hara became friends and collaborated on a series of
26 ``poem-paintings.'' The artist also designed covers for
avant-garde literary journals and for books of poetry, including
collections by Paul Auster and Bill Berkson. A collaboration with
the poet John Yau was published in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of Pop Art in the 1960s, gestural abstraction
lost its cachet, but Bluhm continued to work with increasing
inventiveness and on an ever-larger scale. In Manhattan he showed
at Leo Castelli Gallery, Martha Jackson Gallery and Washburn, and
in Paris for many years at Galerie Stadler. His last New York
exhibition was at Ace Gallery in Soho in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He had one-person shows at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington in 1969 and 1977, and at the Everson Museum in Syracuse
in 1973. An exhibition of drawings traveled the country in 1987.
His work is in many public collections, including those of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the
Whitney Museum of American Art. A 40-year retrospective of his
paintings is to open March 7 at the Butler Institute of American
Art in Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bluhm moved to Vermont in 1986, he visited Manhattan
regularly and was a familiar sight in galleries and on the street.
An energetic man with an expansive, street-wise manner, he had a
wide knowledge of and deep enthusiasm for art and its history,
which many critics over the years found reflected in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Bluhm is survived by his wife, Cary; a daughter, Nina, of New
York, and a son, David, who lives in Paklay, Laos.

CLINTON TRIAL WITNESSES OFFER NO NEW EVIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-TEXT, IMPEACH-HUTCHINSON,
IMPEACH-DELAY, IMPEACH-MONICA) 
(fe) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; WASHINGTON _ The three witnesses called by House managers to
resuscitate the Senate's impeachment trial gave little ground this
week and offered no new evidence against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers had hoped the three witnesses that the Senate
allowed them to depose _ Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
and Sidney Blumenthal _ would add new drama and fresh evidence to
keep their case alive. But their sworn testimony, taken earlier
this week and released on Friday, shows that rather than
strengthening or clarifying the central issues in the case, the
witnesses seemed intent on saying little, if anything, that would
give the House managers additional fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaped portions of their testimony will be shown to the
Senate on Saturday, when the trial resumes, giving the public its
first image of Ms. Lewinsky as more than a disembodied voice on
tapes or a silent figure fleeing from a media pack.
</P>
<P>
   The managers failed to persuade the Senate to allow witnesses to
appear in person. After Saturday's presentations by the House
prosecutors and the White House lawyers, the trial will move to
closing arguments and could be over by late next week. The failure
of the three witnesses to provide new information was part of the
Senate's decision to skip live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, in particular, repeatedly refused opportunities to
pass judgments on the president, declining to discuss his motives
or to characterize the truthfulness of his prior testimony. While
she said she now had ``mixed feelings'' about Clinton, she would
not elaborate on what her reservations about him were and said she
admired the job he had done as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you need to know is that my grand jury testimony
is truthful irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings are,''
she responded when pressed to describe her current attitude toward
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans had hoped to make Ms. Lewinsky their star
witness, the former White House intern carefully hewed to her
earlier testimony before the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
grand jury, stating that the president had never told her to lie
and never encouraged her to file a false affidavit in the sexual
misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones. While the
prosecutors hoped the testimony would highlight a distraught and
vulnerable young woman and embarrass Clinton, she was cool, focused
and composed, frequently asking her chief questioner to sharpen or
rephrase his questions.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Washington lawyer and Clinton confidant, was deemed by
House managers to be pivotal to proving the obstruction-of-justice
charges against the president. But he too disappointed. And his
testimony conflicted with Ms. Lewinsky's when he denied telling her
to destroy copies of notes she had drafted to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have alleged that the president enlisted
Jordan to help to get a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York to buy her
silence in the Jones case. Both Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan denied that
the job help was linked to her filing an affidavit in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   On several other crucial points, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony
remained at odds with the president's. Last August, Clinton
testified that he told Ms. Lewinsky she would have to turn over
gifts he had given her to the Jones lawyers. Pressed on this point
by Rep. Ed Bryant, the Tennessee Republican who led the House
managers' questioning of the former White House intern, Ms.
Lewinsky replied that she had no recollection of the president
telling her to turn over the gifts. ``Not that I remember,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she was certain that the president's secretary, Betty
Currie, had initiated the retrieval of the gifts after they were
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. The House managers have charged
that Ms. Currie must have acted at the president's behest, but Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony did little to clarify the point.
</P>
<P>
   In the testimony Ms. Lewinsky gave at a Washington hotel on
Monday, Ms. Lewinsky told Bryant that Mrs. Currie called her about
the gifts. ``I remember her saying either I know you have something
for me or the president said you have something for me,'' Ms.
Lewinsky said. Mrs. Currie had testified previously that Ms.
Lewinsky initiated the gift retrieval and the president tesified
that he was not concerned about the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said she could have been mistaken about the time
she received a call from Mrs. Currie. In the president's defense,
Clinton's lawyers have emphasized that records of the call show it
came later than the time Ms. Lewinsky testified Mrs. Currie stopped
by to get the gifts. House managers declined to include Ms. Currie
on their witness list, fearing she would hurt rather than help
their case.
</P>
<P>
   The president also denied touching Ms. Lewinsky in a manner that
fit the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case, a key
point in the article of impeachment charging the president with
perjury. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony before Starr's grand jury
included detailed descriptions of her sexual encounters with the
president, with some activity that would have fallen within the
Jones definition of sexual relations. But when Bryant tried to
press Ms. Lewinsky on whether the president had lied, her lawyers
objected and Ms. Lewinsky responded tersely that she did not ``feel
comfortable characterizing whether what he said was truthful or not
truthful. I know I've testified to what I believe is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's largely polished and understated testimony did provide
a moment of drama when he was asked by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, another
House manager, whether he had told Ms. Lewinsky to destroy drafts
and copies of love notes she had written the president. Jordan
coldly told the Arkansas Republican, ``Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer
and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm not a fool, and the notion that I
would suggest to anybody that they destroy anything just defies
anything that I know about myself. So the notion that I said to her
go home and destroy notes is ridiculous.'' Jordan did confirm that
he had a breakfast meeting with Ms. Lewinsky on Dec. 31, 1997, at
which they discussed the notes, an encounter he did not recall in
earlier testimony before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The third witness, the White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, was
asked about a discussion he had with Clinton shortly after the
Lewinsky scandal broke in the news media. Blumenthal testified that
the president told him that he had tried to minister to a troubled
young woman and that Ms. Lewinsky had made demands on him and that
he had rebuffed her. Blumenthal repeated elements of this
conversation to Starr's grand jury, and the House managers alleged
the president was trying to influence his grand jury testimony.

</P>
<P>
   Another central episode in the obstruction of justice charges
against the president involves a phone call Clinton made to Ms.
Lewinsky in the middle of the night on Dec. 17, 1997. During the
conversation Clinton informed Ms. Lewinsky that her name was on the
witness list in the Jones case and suggested that she could file an
affidavit to avoid being deposed in the lawsuit. The House managers
contend the president encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false
affidavit denying their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But she gave them no help on this point, insisting that ``there
was no discussion of what would be in the affidavit,'' and adding,
``I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would have
to be false.''
</P>
<P>
   During one testy exchange with Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky refused to
agree with his premise that it would have been against the
president's interest for Ms. Lewinsky to file a truthful affdavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really comfortable,'' she responded. ``I mean, I can
tell you what would have been in my best interest, but I ...''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant cut her off with another question, saying, ``But you
didn't file the affidavit in your best interest, did you?`` to
which Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``Uh, actually, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   She did say during her conversation with the president about the
affdavit that she began thinking herself of denying a sexual
relationship, because they had always used ``cover stories'' to
conceal their affair. And while she said the president never told
her to lie, Bryant also asked her whether Clinton had ever
cautioned her to tell the truth. ``Not that I can recall,'' Ms.
Lewinsky responded.
</P>
<P>
   In another exchange with Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky used legalistic
language that was reminiscent of the president's grand jury
testimony. Asked if their cover stories would be misleading to the
Jones lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``They were literally true,
but they would be misleading.'' In his grand jury testimony,
Clinton said his goal in the Jones deposition was ``to be truthful,
but not particularly helpful.''

DISPUTE OVER TRAVEL DOCUMENTS MAY DELAY OPENING OF KOSOVO PEACE
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ While international dignitaries waited for the Kosovo
peace conference to begin in an elegant French chateau, the ethnic
Albanian delegates remained on the ground in Serbia, because of a
last-minute maneuver by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the talks was thrown into doubt after his
government refused to issue travel documents that would allow three
guerrilla members of the delegation to re-enter the country after
the conference, which is to begin on Saturday at Rambouillet
outside Paris. After the three were denied papers, the other ethnic
Albanian delegates refused to board the plane sent by the French
government.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats were pleading with the Serbian authorities Friday
night to back down so both sides could be in France for the opening
of the talks, which are scheduled to include an elaborate lunch and
speeches by the French and British foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute theatrics appeared to be an effort by the
Yugoslav president to show who was really in charge of the
conference, which is being convened by the United States, four
Western European nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, the 13 negotiators appointed by
Milosevic said at a news conference here Friday night that they
would refuse to sit down with members of the insurgent Kosovo
Liberation Army. The ethnic Albanians who are being denied travel
documents are part of that force.
</P>
<P>
   In talks last week with the ethnic Albanians, the chief
negotiators for the talks, Christopher M. Hill, a U.S. diplomat,
and Wolfgang Petritsch, an Austrian diplomat, went out of their way
to ensure that the guerrillas were represented on the delegation.
Other members include political leaders, academics and a newspaper
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, Mike Phillips, who works with the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Kosovo, said Friday night
that the Serbian authorities had been advised five days ago to
provide travel documents for the three men and to allow them safe
passage to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to be provided with safe passage that would allow
us to escort them out of their territory, onto the tarmac and onto
the plane and to waiver the documents to travel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, who have been fighting a yearlong insurgency
against the Serbian police and the Yugoslav Army for the
independence of Kosovo, were wary of traveling to the airport in
unarmed vehicles, Phillips said. Ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the province's population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The French government plane, a military C-130, remained in
Kosovo overnight in the hope that the dispute could be resolved,
diplomats said. Speeches by the British foreign minister, Robin
Cook, and the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, were
scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. Saturday at the conference site, 30
miles southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   A nonmilitary member of the ethnic Albanian delegation, Veton
Surroi, the publisher of the biggest selling newspaper in Kosovo,
said Friday night from Pristina that he and his colleagues had
discussed going ahead to Paris as a civilian group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided the whole delegation had to go,'' he said. The
civilians left the airport where they were waiting to board the
plane and drove back to Pristina.''
</P>
<P>
   Surroi said it seemed clear that the Serbian authorities did not
want to allow the guerrillas to leave Kosovo ``in front of their
noses.'' He added, ``It's the smaller tricks that are always the
test.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who is the military assistant to William Walker, the
American head of the OSCE monitoring operation in Kosovo, said the
Serbian authorities were not being asked to issue passports to the
guerrillas but rather to grant them travel documents that would
allow them back into Kosovo after the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips declined to give the names of the three who were
prevented from traveling. In all, the 16-member ethnic Albanian
delegation includes five soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   At their news conference, the delegation from Serbia, led by
Ratko Markovic, a Serbian deputy prime minister, and Nikola
Sainovic and Vladan Kutlesic, both Yugoslav deputy prime ministers,
stressed that the sovereignty of their country was sacrosanct and
that negotiations with ``terrorists'' were not possible.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the negotiations have set a timetable of seven
days of talks and then a final round of seven more days. If Serbia
does not agree to autonomy for Kosovo, which is now a province of
Serbia, NATO has said it will carry out air strikes against Serbian
targets. If a political settlement is achieved, several countries
have pledged troops for a NATO-led ground force to oversee it.

(ATTN: Texas) 
REP. DeLAY MAY HAVE LIED UNDER OATH IN BUSINESS LAWSUIT 
(bl) 
By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a
driving force behind the effort to impeach President Clinton on
charges of lying under oath, himself gave a deposition five years
ago that is being challenged as untruthful.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, DeLay was being sued by a former business partner
who maintained that the congressman and a third man had conspired
to cut him out of his ownership share in a Texas company, Albo Pest
Control. In the deposition, DeLay swore that he was no longer an
officer of the company and had not been for two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay had filed congressional financial disclosure forms
saying that he was actually the company's chairman during those
years.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy was reported by The Houston Press, a free
weekly, in November 1995, and The New Republic recently published
an article comparing DeLay's conduct in that lawsuit with his
criticism of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald DeNisco, a Houston lawyer who represented the plaintiff,
said in an interview Thursday that at the time, he was unaware that
DeLay's congressional filings apparently contradicted the sworn
deposition. DeNisco said he now believed that DeLay had concealed
his true role in the pest control company ``to shield himself from
damages.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he believed it hypocritical of DeLay to have so
aggressively sought Clinton's ouster over a deposition in the Paula
Jones case after having given a misleading or even false deposition
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has largely avoided public comment about the episode.
Asked about it this week, his senior aide, Michael Scanlon,
dismissed accounts of it as ``distorted and being circulated by
DeLay's political enemies.'' Scanlon said that there were reasons
why he could not respond in detail now but that ``eventually the
truth will come out.''
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of the deposition shows that DeNisco asked DeLay
whether he was still an officer or director of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so, no,'' DeLay replied.
</P>
<P>
   Asked again whether he was an officer of the company, DeLay
said, ``I don't think I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had resigned as an officer, DeLay said he had
done so orally two or three years earlier but had never reduced his
resignation to writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything formal,'' he said. ``I haven't had much to
do with the company since I got elected to Congress'' in 1984, a
decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed sum in 1994. Any
perjury charge in the case could not be brought now, given a
three-year statute of limitations in Texas. DeNisco said that had
he known of the discrepancy at the time, he would have referred the
matter to the Harris County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But John Holmes, who has been district attorney for more than 20
years, said in an interview that DeLay's words appeared to have
been equivocal enough that he would not have been prosecuted.

 &HT;    Award established in Aaron's name
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For all the home runs he hit _ all 755 of them _ Hank
Aaron would rather be remembered as a complete ball player than
just a home-run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement of an award named in his honor will help
that cause. Major League Baseball announced that the Hank Aaron
Award will go to the top hitter in each league. The announcement
starts a season-long celebration of the 25th anniversary of Aaron's
715th home run, hit on April 8, 1974 to break Babe Ruth's career
home-run record. Aaron becomes only the fourth major-league player
to have an award named for him; the others are Cy Young (honoring
pitching), Jackie Robinson (rookie of the year) and Roberto
Clemente (citizenship).
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of reminds me of my father, who passed away
recently,'' Aaron said. ``I can remember him saying, when they
built a ballpark in Mobile and named it the Hank Aaron ballpark, he
said (that) I finally got my name in lights. I'm honored.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the award will be based strictly on numbers and go to
the hitter in each league who has the most hits, home runs and runs
batted in. But beginning in 2000, the award will be chosen more
subjectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a panel of people, yet to be determined _ using the
same criteria, however _ (that) will establish who gets the Hank
Aaron Award in both leagues,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said.
``Sometimes there are some subjective things players do for their
teams in terms of hitting that sometimes statistics don't always
reveal.''
</P>
<P>
   If the award had been given this past season, Sammy Sosa would
have beaten out Mark McGwire for the National League Hank Aaron
Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an award that embodies everything,'' Selig said. ``It's
clearly the person in either league who's been the best all-around
hitter, not just the (top) power hitter. That's what makes it so
unique.''

   In addition to his 755 home runs, Aaron is first on baseball's
all-time list in RBIs (2,297), extra-base hits (1,477) and total
bases (6,856). He is second in at-bats (12,364) and runs (2,174)
and is third in hits (3,771).

   ``I saw some performances in the '50s that you had to see it to

And that's what this award will come to mean.''

 &HT;    Weariness at impeachment crosses racial lines
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Already stung by the Senate's reaction to the Rose
Garden pep rally that followed the House impeachment vote, the
White House has let it be known there will be no high-fives a week
from now when the impeachment trial is expected to end.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment process on the verge of running out of gas,
the president's defenders have taken pains to signal they won't
offend the dignity of the Senate any further if they bring the
matter to a close.
</P>
<P>
   If he could have chosen a forum conducive for celebrating his
nonremoval, however, it might have been the stage on which Bill
Clinton appeared Friday night at the Hyatt Regency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is coming to honor him, an honor Henry Aaron
deserves. It should be good for the president and healing for the
nation,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Thursday after visiting with
Gov. Roy Barnes at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad form to take too much of the spotlight at someone
else's party, and this night clearly was dedicated to Aaron, whose
full acceptance as a champion many see as overdue.
</P>
<P>
   But a president inevitably adds a political current to a
gathering, and the presence of so many notable African-Americans at
this event gave it special significance for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   From Chris Rock to Toni Morrison, much has been made of the
affinity between this president and African-American voters, who
not only have expressed their support for Clinton throughout the
Monica Lewinsky scandal but turned out heavily for Democratic
congressional candidates in November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only that Clinton grew up in an environment many
African-Americans can identify with: having an unstable family
structure but a strong, influential mother, said Sen. David Scott,
Aaron's brother-in-law. They also identify with him because they
know the feeling of being unfairly targeted by the criminal justice
system, said the Atlanta legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're the first to stand up for the president,''
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   This connection is capable of being viewed differently by
different segments of America.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping support for Clinton by African-Americans is a key
similarity _ probably the key similarity _ in the parallel some
have attempted to draw between the O.J. Simpson murder trial and
the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of comparison that will be as obvious as one
desires it to be. In the end, it sheds little light on either
trial, but it does illumine the deep cultural debate for which the
two very different cases have become a divining rod.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of so many stars from the fields of sports and
entertainment, along with and generally overshadowing the political
notables, also underscored the different way in which America
outside Washington has responded to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If African-Americans have been more outspoken in their defense
of Clinton, they have not gone against the national tide in their
distaste for impeachment. The first reports have not made clear
whether Richard Llamas, the man who got himself arrested in the
Senate gallery Thursday, is a Clinton supporter.
</P>
<P>
   But his cry to the Senate _ ``Good God almighty, take the vote
and get it over with!'' _ was as clear an expression of the
national sentiment as has been articulated, and it has a fair
chance of becoming the quote that history students a century from
now will learn when they read about this trial.

 &HT;    At long last, baseball pays due respect
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This little bash Friday night for Henry Aaron was fine
and everything, but it was 25 years too late. Then again, when it
comes to handling minorities in general and Aaron in particular,
such a time span is quite swift for those who run baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the commissioner that Atlanta night in 1974 when Aaron
surpassed Babe Ruth as the king of home runs?
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask. Well, if you must know, Bowie Kuhn was in Cleveland
speaking to the Wahoo Club.
</P>
<P>
   After Aaron officially made ``715'' more important in the record
book than ``714,'' he was huge on the talk show circuit. He also
was the honored guest of banquets everywhere. There was even that
time in 1974 when he addressed Congress on Flag Day.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball mostly was silent when it came to praising another one
of its stars darker than home plate. It had to hug Aaron in 1982
after he entered the Hall of Fame with the highest percentage of
votes of anybody not named Ty Cobb. Still, nothing back then
matched the adulation Aaron received Friday night from baseball at
the Hyatt Regency, where the game celebrated his 65th birthday and
historic homer with guests in black ties from President Clinton to
even the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner is now Bud Selig, the former owner of the
Milwaukee Brewers. After Aaron finished his 21 years with the
Braves of Milwaukee and Atlanta, Selig brought Aaron to the Brewers
for two more seasons. In fact, Selig has been a rare baseball ally
for one of the game's most abused superstars during and after his
career.
</P>
<P>
   While chasing Ruth, Aaron received an epidemic of hate mail.
Then, after he became the executive with the Braves that he remains
today, he was ridiculed by many inside and outside the game for
chastising baseball for its brutal record on hiring minorities.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments away from the Hall of Fame when Aaron got
baseball's respect. They ranged from his becoming the only active
player ever to throw out the first pitch of a World Series game, in
1973, to his token interview for the commissioner's job more than a
decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, among baseball's elite, Aaron didn't rank with
DiMaggio, Musial or the rest of its living icons.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Aaron's struggle with baseball, you must
understand that of Jackie Robinson. This became the world's first
professional sport in 1869, but it didn't remove its blinders
regarding the color of its players until Robinson joined the major
leagues in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson eventually left his superlative days on the field to
become a loud activist for civil rights. He directed much of his
wrath toward baseball for moving with cement spikes when it came to
hiring blacks to do more than hit, run, throw or catch.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, baseball waited forever before recognizing
Robinson's accomplishments with more than token gestures. He was
allowed to speak his mind on the field after throwing out the first
ball before a World Series game in Cincinnati. By then, his walk
was shaky, and he was nearly blind from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1972. That's right. It was 25 years after
Robinson's debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Now 25 years after Aaron became better than Ruth, baseball is
finally honoring Aaron in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Robinson, Aaron is healthy enough to enjoy it.

 &HT;    Award established in Aaron's name
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For all the home runs he hit _ all 755 of them _ Hank
Aaron would rather be remembered as a complete ball player than
just a home-run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement of an award named in his honor will help
that cause. Major League Baseball announced that the Hank Aaron
Award will go to the top hitter in each league. The announcement
starts a season-long celebration of the 25th anniversary of Aaron's
715th home run, hit on April 8, 1974 to break Babe Ruth's career
home-run record. Aaron becomes only the fourth major-league player
to have an award named for him; the others are Cy Young (honoring
pitching), Jackie Robinson (rookie of the year) and Roberto
Clemente (citizenship).
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of reminds me of my father, who passed away
recently,'' Aaron said. ``I can remember him saying, when they
built a ballpark in Mobile and named it the Hank Aaron ballpark, he
said (that) I finally got my name in lights. I'm honored.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the award will be based strictly on numbers and go to
the hitter in each league who has the most hits, home runs and runs
batted in. But beginning in 2000, the award will be chosen more
subjectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a panel of people, yet to be determined _ using the
same criteria, however _ (that) will establish who gets the Hank
Aaron Award in both leagues,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said.
``Sometimes there are some subjective things players do for their
teams in terms of hitting that sometimes statistics don't always
reveal.''
</P>
<P>
   If the award had been given this past season, Sammy Sosa would
have beaten out Mark McGwire for the National League Hank Aaron
Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an award that embodies everything,'' Selig said. ``It's
clearly the person in either league who's been the best all-around
hitter, not just the (top) power hitter. That's what makes it so
unique.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his 755 home runs, Aaron is first on baseball's
all-time list in RBIs (2,297), extra-base hits (1,477) and total
bases (6,856). He is second in at-bats (12,364) and runs (2,174)
and is third in hits (3,771).
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some performances in the '50s that you had to see it to
believe,'' Selig said. ``It wasn't home runs. It was just the way
he sprayed the ball all over with awesome power. He was such a
complete hitter. I've never seen anything like it, before or since.
And that's what this award will come to mean.''

FRAUDULENT DATA AGAIN FOUND IN BREAST CANCER STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill.)  (lb) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time in the history of one of the United States'
largest research programs to study treatments for breast cancer,
federal investigators are reporting that they have found fraudulent
data.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project, which is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and
includes studies of surgical procedures and chemotherapy regimens
conducted at scores of research centers around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement issued Friday by the cancer institute,
the incorrect data were all falsified deliberately by one research
nurse, in studies testing different types of chemotherapy in women
with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the data were not expected to alter the results of any
studies, because the fraud involved only three patients, one in
each of three large experiments. One study included 1,106 patients
at 98 hospitals, the second 2,697 patients at 83 sites, and the
third 2,305 patients at 198 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in two studies the false information was detected
before the results were analyzed, said Dr. Richard Ungerleider,
chief of the clinical investigations branch at the cancer
institute. In the third case, Ungerleider said, the falsification
was included in the analysis, but it involved only the incorrect
entry of a patient's date of death, seven months later than when it
actually occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have these very large randomized controlled trials,
fabrication when it's only one patient out of 1,000 can't affect
the results,'' Ungerleider said in a telephone interview. ``It's
reprehensible behavior. I'm not defending it in any way. But at
least we can be satisfied that there's no way the results of the
clinical trials are threatened in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Findings of fraud in medical studies trouble scientists and
patients who participate in the studies, because they may seem to
cast doubt on findings and on the advice given to patients. But
Ungerleider said researchers had reviewed the studies in question
and concluded that the three cases were not the tip of an iceberg
but truly were the only instances of falsification in the
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, which
has its headquarters at the University of Pittsburgh, did not
respond to telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice published on Thursday in the Federal Register, the
Office of Research Integrity (the branch of the Department of
Health and Human Services that investigates scientific fraud) said
data in three studies had been faked by Thomas Philpot, a nurse who
held the position of data manager for the national project.
</P>
<P>
   Philpot worked at two hospitals in Chicago, Rush Presbyterian
St. Luke's Medical Center and Northwestern University's MacNeal
Cancer Center. The falsifications were first identified by
researchers in the study, and confirmed later by the Office of
Research Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Dr. Dorothy Macfarlane, acting
director of the division of research investigations at the Office
of Research Integrity, said that Philpot, assigned to call patients
in the studies to find out how they were doing, reported that he
had called three patients and found them to be alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Macfarlane said Philpot had left his posts at the two
hospitals by the time the fraud was discovered. ``As far as we can
tell, he's not working on any other project at this time,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Philpot in the Chicago area were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier case of fraud in the national program came to light
in 1991, when it was discovered that a researcher had falsified
data to admit women into a study comparing two surgical procedures
for breast cancer, lumpectomy and mastectomy. But in that case, as
in the newly reported ones, researchers said that the faked data
did not jeopardize the findings of the studies.

HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT FIRM TO ACCEPT BUYOUT BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- Cohr Inc. said Friday it is opting for a bird in the
hand rather than two in the bush.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The troubled hospital equipment outsourcing firm said its board
of directors has opted to accept a $6.50 per share buyout bid from
a pair of funds that already own nearly half the company, rather
than a $7 per share offer from a third party contingent on a
thorough look at the company's books.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of funds, Three Cities Fund II LP and Three Cities
Offshore II C.V., had originally offered $5.37 per share for the
51.7 percent of the company they don't already own.
</P>
<P>
   The unnamed third party had made its offer contingent on
completing due diligence of Cohr's finances and assurances that
pending investor lawsuits against the company will be
satisfactorily addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revised Three Cities offer of $6.50 per share, by
contrast, provides for none of these contingencies and offers the
advantage of more immediate payment,'' the company said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cohr's shares were pummeled last year after the company restated
earnings downward going back more than one year. A host of investor
groups subsequently filed class-action lawsuits against the firm as
a result. Most of the suits are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Cohr shares closed up $0.6875 Friday at $6.375.

 &HT;    Weariness at impeachment crosses racial lines
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Already stung by the Senate's reaction to the Rose
Garden pep rally that followed the House impeachment vote, the
White House has let it be known there will be no high-fives a week
from now when the impeachment trial is expected to end.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment process on the verge of running out of gas,
the president's defenders have taken pains to signal they won't
offend the dignity of the Senate any further if they bring the
matter to a close.
</P>
<P>
   If he could have chosen a forum conducive for celebrating his
nonremoval, however, it might have been the stage on which Bill
Clinton appeared Friday night at the Hyatt Regency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is coming to honor him, an honor Henry Aaron
deserves. It should be good for the president and healing for the
nation,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Thursday after visiting with
Gov. Roy Barnes at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad form to take too much of the spotlight at someone
else's party, and this night clearly was dedicated to Aaron, whose
full acceptance as a champion many see as overdue.
</P>
<P>
   But a president inevitably adds a political current to a
gathering, and the presence of so many notable African-Americans at
this event gave it special significance for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   From Chris Rock to Toni Morrison, much has been made of the
affinity between this president and African-American voters, who
not only have expressed their support for Clinton throughout the
Monica Lewinsky scandal but turned out heavily for Democratic
congressional candidates in November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only that Clinton grew up in an environment many
African-Americans can identify with: having an unstable family
structure but a strong, influential mother, said Sen. David Scott,
Aaron's brother-in-law. They also identify with him because they
know the feeling of being unfairly targeted by the criminal justice
system, said the Atlanta legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're the first to stand up for the president,''
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   This connection is capable of being viewed differently by
different segments of America.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping support for Clinton by African-Americans is a key
similarity _ probably the key similarity _ in the parallel some
have attempted to draw between the O.J. Simpson murder trial and
the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of comparison that will be as obvious as one
desires it to be. In the end, it sheds little light on either
trial, but it does illumine the deep cultural debate for which the
two very different cases have become a divining rod.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of so many stars from the fields of sports and
entertainment, along with and generally overshadowing the political
notables, also underscored the different way in which America
outside Washington has responded to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If African-Americans have been more outspoken in their defense
of Clinton, they have not gone against the national tide in their
distaste for impeachment. The first reports have not made clear
whether Richard Llamas, the man who got himself arrested in the
Senate gallery Thursday, is a Clinton supporter.
</P>
<P>
   But his cry to the Senate _ ``Good God almighty, take the vote
and get it over with!'' _ was as clear an expression of the
national sentiment as has been articulated, and it has a fair
chance of becoming the quote that history students a century from
now will learn when they read about this trial.

CONFIDENTLY RIDING THE TECHNOLOGY BUBBLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are fat times for American auto makers. Adjusted for
inflation, gasoline prices are as low as they have been in decades,
and interest rates are down, too. Perhaps most important, the
economy keeps chugging along, keeping sales buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   So, many companies are awash in cash. Some money is being spent:
Ford Motor paid $6.5 billion last month to buy Volvo's auto
operations. Daimler used $33 billion worth of stock to buy
cash-rich Chrysler. But a lot of money is being held as a cushion
against the next prolonged drop in sales.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Wall Street seems to like what it sees. Maryann
N. Keller, a managing director at ING Baring Furman Selz, has been
following autos for a quarter-century. Last week, she spent some
time talking about developments in the business. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)For much of your career, Detroit has turned out
products that many consumers considered inferior to Japanese
automobiles. Now, things appear different. Is that the way you see
it?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am encouraged on two fronts. First, the relative
competitive balance between the United States and Japan is as good
as it has been in 30 years. The gap has been closed in many areas,
from quality to cost to engineering. In some areas you could say
American companies are in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   There are some very good Japanese auto makers, with Honda and
Toyota head and shoulders above the rest. But Mitsubishi and Nissan
are in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing is that American companies are beginning to
identify themselves differently. It used to be that they had to
control all areas of production. Now, they are looking at defining
what the strategic competencies they need to have really are, and
are seeing their responsibility as defining the vehicle and then
developing the brand, marketing and distributing it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is General Motors' decision to spin out Delphi
Automotive an example of this new way of thinking?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the separation of GM and Delphi is a significant
positive for GM. In the past, GM always argued that its inferior
profit margins, compared with a company like Chrysler, were a
result of the fact that GM made more of its own stuff. With the
spin-out, GM will have the chance to have a different kind of
cost-of-capital structure. Once it is finished, GM's liquidity, or
working capital, will increase by about $2.7 billion. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What do you think of Ford's acquisition of Volvo's
auto business?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As far as I'm concerned, that is an acquisition which doesn't
solve Ford's problems. Volvo preferred to be bought by Ford,
because Ford is demonstrably a very good parent. It has been very,
very careful in nurturing Jaguar, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But from a financial standpoint, Volvo won't add much to Ford's
earnings. There is nothing wrong with Volvo; in fact, it's a
company that is without a lot of problems and has real expertise in
safety engineering. So if Ford had to buy something, it is as good
an acquisition as Ford could have made. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What are Ford's problems?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ford's issues are cars in North America, and its
international operations.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, Ford derives a very high percentage of its
sales from car rental companies like Hertz. The average private
consumer loves Ford trucks. But Ford has not been able to make much
headway in heightening consumer perception of its cars. It needs to
be able to tackle this because eventually the pot of gold it has in
pickups may go away.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Ford has struggled in the 1990s and has lost
market share. It has not come up with an effective product response
to reverse that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The conventional argument for mergers is global
overcapacity. Do you buy that?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am perhaps the only person on the planet who doesn't see
massive consolidation ahead in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Excess capacity has been a problem for the last 25 years. The
fact is, auto companies will build factories whenever they feel
they can get an advantage. They did some pretty stupid things in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't think excess capacity is going away. You can't
prevent auto company managements from thinking they will have a
more strategic reason for investing in a part of the world where
they think they can do a better job than the competition. But the
U.S. market is where the bulk of the earnings come for the Germans,
for Toyota and Honda and for the American manufacturers. This is
it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you see anyone willing to acquire a Japanese
company?(end italics)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think any Japanese manufacturers will be taken over.
Japanese companies are complicated, Japanese accounting is not
transparent and a lot of losses are hidden. Japan is not going to
be an engine of growth for a while.

ALFONZO SIGNS CONTRACT WITH METS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Venezuela)  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demonstrating confidence that Edgardo Alfonzo can play second
base on a long-term basis, the New York Mets on Friday signed the
25-year-old infielder to a four-year contract worth at least $18.4
million, two months before Alfonzo officially makes the switch from
third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps us avoid the arbitration process this year and
next,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said. ``And it secures
Edgardo's skills in a Met uniform for two years of potential free
agency as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had submitted an arbitration figure of $2.5 million to
Alfonzo, who batted .278 last season with a career-high 17 home
runs and 78 RBIs. Alfonzo, who batted .315 in 1997, was asking for
$3.85 million. But neither side seemed eager to go to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year deal will guarantee him an average of $4.6
million. It could also earn Alfonzo a maximum of nearly $25 million
should he win Gold Gloves and silver slugger awards and be named an
All-Star in each of the next four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, a third baseman for most of his time in the majors, has
yet to play second base for his winter-league team in Venezuela.
His agent, Peter Greenberg, said that was because Alfonzo did not
want to supplant Carlos Hernandez, a Houston Astros prospect, from
second base. Greenberg said Alfonzo had been working out at second
before and after games. He has played some games at second in three
of his four major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, talking about shifting Alfonzo from third to second
because of the acquisition of Robin Ventura, said: ``I don't have
any concerns about it at all. Edgardo is humble and cautious in
talking about it. But I know he is comfortable in his ability to
play second base. And he has made changes of position in the minors
without any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo was not available for comment. Greenberg said he was
tending to his cows on his farm in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   With the new deal, Alfonzo can afford to be bullish on his
financial future. He will earn a base salary of $2.675 million this
season, with a $500,000 signing bonus, followed by salaries of $4
million, $5.5 million, and $5.725 million.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips would not say what the Mets' current payroll is, but he
indicated that it was above his budget in the mid-$60 million
range, although not as much as $70 million. The Mets, who have not
gone to arbitration since doing so with David Cone in 1992, still
have three potential cases pending: shortstop Rey Ordonez and
pitchers Turk Wendell and Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I still believe we're going to have at least one of them
that ends up going through the process,'' Phillips said. ``But I
don't view it as a problem.''

   According to one version of a story, Yogi Berra was once asked
whether he'd like to have his pizza cut into six or eight slices.
He figured he was pretty hungry; he asked for eight.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to stock splits, many investors seem to have
similar ideas. In anticipation of stock splits, they are bidding up
stocks by extraordinary amounts. Yet by definition, when companies
split their stocks, they create nothing in the way of new wealth,
because investors simply receive a greater number of shares at
reduced prices. The total value stays unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Pfizer, which announced on Jan. 28 that its board would
vote on a 3-for-1 stock split in April. Its stock jumped $5.625
that day, to $127.5625. Yet when Pfizer handed in
stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 19, its
stock rose just over 18 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Splits may be adding to market volatility, analysts say. Shares
of IBM slipped more than $17 on Jan. 22, when it posted
better-than-expected earnings, yet did not announce a
long-speculated stock split. Four days later, when IBM did announce
a split, its shares rose $3.625, to $185.625; the next day, they
fell more than $7 a share on profit-taking. ``Stock splits have
garnered their own momentum players,'' said Paul Cherney, an
analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. ``At one time a split might have
meant something more intrinsically fundamental about a company's
future prospects, but now splits are adding to the market
volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Among companies on the New York Stock Exchange, there were 224
splits of at least 3 for 2 last year. In January of this year,
splits set a blistering pace _a total of 35, versus 22 in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Splits used to be of some importance because brokers charged
penalties for so-called odd-lot purchases _ less than 100 shares of
a given stock. That meant that a small investor had reason to delay
buying until he could buy a round lot of 100 shares; splits thus
increased the pool of available buyers. But the odd-lot penalties
were eliminated years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A share split can be read as a vote of confidence by management,
who wouldn't authorize it if they thought the share price would
soon fall. But the issue of when to buy a splitting stock is the
subject of much research. Studies conducted last year by both
Merrill Lynch and S&AMP;P found big gains in companies' stock shortly
before a split, though they did not specifically address
performance at the time a split is announced.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P study looked at 359 New York Stock Exchange issues that
had splits of at least 2 for 1 between January 1995 and December
1997. It found that the stocks gained an average of 3.97 percent
between the 20th trading day that preceded the official split and
the day of the split. The S&AMP;P 500 stock-index averaged a 2.03
percent gain during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P study found that the companies that split their stocks
saw them grow an average of 16.2 percent in the year after the
split, while the S&AMP;P gained 28.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch study, which looked at stocks in the S&AMP;P index
that split between 1986 and 1998, found that companies outperformed
the S&AMP;P 500 by an average of 27.44 percentage points during the
year before a split, but by just 3.91 percentage points in the year
after.

ADMINISTRATION SEEKS TO END LIMITS AT SOME AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y., Neb.)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD and JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration wants to end limits on
how many planes can land in an hour at New York's Kennedy
International and La Guardia airports and Chicago's O'Hare,
according to people who have been briefed on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The change would make it easier for start-up airlines to
challenge established carriers, at a time when transportation
officials have been taking steps to increase capacity and are
looking for other ways to promote airline competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department, in a request to Congress on
Monday, will ask for legislation phasing out the rule that limits
flights at the three airports, officials said. While the department
could act itself, congressional action provides political cover and
would be less subject to court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Political brawls over similar proposals have broken out between
lawmakers barraged by noise complaints and others lobbying for more
air service. It is a particularly emotional, and local, issue.
</P>
<P>
   In his only major interview since becoming House speaker, Dennis
Hastert, whose Illinois district is near enough to O'Hare to
benefit from more service but far enough to escape most noise
problems, told The Chicago Sun-Times that he was open to adding
flights there.
</P>
<P>
   The rule limiting flights ``is a major impediment to better air
service for communities all over the country,'' said Jeffrey Shane,
an aviation lawyer who represents Access Air, a new carrier, based
in Omaha, Neb., that wants to fly its three Boeing 737s to La
Guardia. Access leases two slots from Northwest Airlines but fears
that Northwest will soon take them back for its own use.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the effect of a change would be hard to predict. At
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Allen Morrison, a
spokesman, said that the limits have forced various airlines to be
turned away but that the agency did not know how many.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union's
executive vice president, James Randall Schwitz Jr., said, ``It's
basically going to have no effect on the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The airports are near saturation levels now, he said, and ``you
can only put a certain number of airplanes in a given amount of air
space at a certain time.''
</P>
<P>
   But other aviation experts emphasized that the government was
bringing in new landing systems and other technology to increase
capacity, and that the limits on flights were too constricting.
</P>
<P>
   And Shane said that some airlines did not use all their slots
every day, or flew small planes just to maintain the slots and keep
others from getting them. Eliminating the rule, he said, would free
those slots.
</P>
<P>
   How elimination of the rule would affect the balance among
airlines is hard to predict, experts said. Samuel Buttrick, an
airline analyst at Paine Webber, said, ``Open access to
slot-controlled airports will offer entry to discount carriers, but
at the same time allow dominant carriers to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for slot controls at O'Hare, Buttrick said, United
Airlines might have squeezed out the other hub carrier, American.
</P>
<P>
   If an attempt is made to land more planes and all are delayed as
a result, experts said, that would ripple through the system, as
the airplanes would land late, take off late for their next
flights, and continue to be late all day, with passengers missing
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the congressional delegations from the New York
metropolitan region are expected to join House members from near
O'Hare, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to fight the plan in the
House. Last year, a similar coalition succeeded in killing a bill
that would have allowed more departures and arrivals at the three
airports and at National Airport, which also has restrictions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New York City leaders were lining up to oppose the proposal.
``They are crazy,'' said Claire Shulman, the Queens borough
president. ``Maybe it would lower fares a little bit. But on
balance, this will be a disaster for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is likely to win strong support from other regions,
where officials complain that high air fares are hurting the
economies of smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my colleagues downstate would want Syracuse,
Binghamton, Rochester and Buffalo to die because they couldn't
stand 10 more flights a day,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter,
D-Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, formally called the high-density rule, was
established 30 years ago but the numbers have been gradually
increased since then. The proposal to phase out the rule over five
years will be part of the administration's bill to reauthorize the
Federal Aviation Administration; the last reauthorization was for
just six months, in part because of a dispute over limits on
airport operations, and it expires on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   National Airport, across the Potomac River from Washington, is
the only other airport with such limitations; it would not be
affected by the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare, existing rules limit arrivals to 80 in any half-hour
and 155 an hour. At La Guardia, the limit is 68 an hour; at
Kennedy, the rules are in effect from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m., and the
hourly limits vary from 75 to 95. At all three airports, there are
subquotas for big airliners, commuter flights and general-aviation
planes.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are not a safety factor, according to FAA officials;
if planes are joining the approach queue faster than they are
landing, controllers tell the pilots to fly more slowly, or not to
take off. That is true for all airports, not just the four with a
rule in place.
</P>
<P>
   But in establishing who can fly into the four airports, the
Transportation Department has handed a huge advantage to
``incumbent'' carriers. Slots are bought and sold for prices up to
$3 million, according to aviation executives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Transportation Department refused to comment in
advance of the Monday announcement. But the transportation
secretary, Rodney Slater, said in a speech in New York on
Wednesday, ``In the past year, the high-density rule has come under
increasing scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an issue on which all of us must engage in the
coming legislative year,'' he said in the speech, to the Wings
Club, an aviation group.

following unsuccessful cancer treatment. Outside the hospital's
gates, men and women stood weeping in the cold, pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old king's internal organs have failed, the royal
palace said, and he was described as breathing only with the aid of
a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   The king's family decided against taking him off the
life-sustaining machine, Reuters said, quoting sources, after a
debate over the religious ethics of disconnecting the system. One
source called the king's condition a ``hopeless case.``
</P>
<P>
   Signs that had been put up around the Jordanian capital praying
for the king's recovery were quietly taken down Friday, and most
Jordanians began preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Parliament and the nation's security forces began
making arrangements for a state funeral and the installation of the
king's 37-year-old son, Abdullah, as monarch.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said that tighter security had already
been put in place to ward off any threats to the kingdom and to the
foreign heads of state who would converge in Amman for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The king's worsening condition raised questions about whether
Abdullah has the same abilities to rule Jordan that carried his
father through 46 turbulent years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Steering Jordan through difficult political times, a sagging
economy and an increasingly unpopular peace with Israel, Hussein
relied on the force of his personality to maintain popularity.
Abdullah has some of the king's personal aplomb, analysts say, but
he is untested politically.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria and Israel
predicted that Abdullah would continue his father's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the loyalty of the Jordanian armed forces, the loyalty
of the Bedouin tribes, and I believe Abdullah will have the
allegiance of the growing middle class in Jordan who have a stake
in stability and privatization and democratization,'' said Edward
Djerejian, who now serves as the director of Rice University's
James A. Baker III Institute,
</P>
<P>
   Djerejian praised Hussein as ``one of the most influential
rulers in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, a city of 1.2 million, anxious Jordanians were also
praising their king.
</P>
<P>
   Salwa Najjaj, for one, told of the time she shook the king's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein had visited her children's school and she, like a dozen
other mothers there that day, was waiting excitedly in an impromptu
receiving line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very polite, very decent,'' she recalled. ``He was
cultured and educated. You felt that he respected you, and so you
respected him. He was a very good leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Shehada Darwish, a 47-year-old jeweler, remembered the king as a
man who ``built this country from the ground up.'' He added, ``The
good of the people was always in his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were not allowed to see the king, who arrived Friday
morning from the United States on a private jet at the Queen Alia
International Airport here. Palace sources said Hussein was taken
off the plane on a stretcher. The scene, they said, was quiet,
except for the weeping of relatives, many of whom were dressed in
black.
</P>
<P>
   One source said that as Hussein, whose face was flushed, was
being carried to a waiting ambulance, he repeatedly reached out for
the hand of his U.S.-born wife, Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, including Abdullah, who was accompanied by his
wife, met the king's plane at the airport. Prince Hassan, the
king's brother who had recently been ousted as heir to the throne,
arrived at the hospital, known as the King Hussein Medical City,
shortly after the king's motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's outpouring of grief was in stark contrast to the
rain-drenched celebrations that greeted the king when he arrived
home Jan. 19, following six months of chemotherapy. Then, gaunt and
hairless, he pronounced himself ``completely cured,`` and the royal
palace said he had piloted the plane home.
</P>
<P>
   But the king's celebratory ride in an open-air motorcade
apparently caused a relapse, and the king returned to the Mayo
Clinic in Minnesota a week later for the second transplant.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, his final return home was greeted with shops closed
for the weekly Muslim holy day, and preachers in mosques directed
worshipers to pray for their king.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been with us our whole life,'' said Najjaj, one of the
millions of Jordanians who has never known another leader, as she
fought back tears. ``It's like a relative dying, like losing
something very, very dear to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they have been glued to their television sets since
news first came that the king's body had apparently rejected the
bone marrow transplant and his internal organs had stopped
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I slept two or three hours last night,'' said Hadi
Sayess, an accountant in a baseball cap eating lunch in an Amman
chili house. ``It's a bad feeling. We're losing a good leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian analysts said that, despite the king's long struggle
against cancer, the transition to Crown Prince Abdullah would be
difficult. When King Hussein ascended the throne in 1953, Jordan
was a tiny underdeveloped desert kingdom under threat from
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   ``His greatest achievement is the transition of Jordanian
society from being truly backward and undeveloped to highly
sophisticated,'' said a political scientist who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``He ensured the survival of the state at difficult
junctures.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sayess, the memory of King Hussein is much more personal.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant remembers playing soccer one day when the king
showed up out of the blue and shook everyone's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Good work,''' Sayess recalled. ``It was terrific.''

JORDANIANS STAND VIGIL AS KING HUSSEIN CLINGS TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ King Hussein, ruler of Jordan for 47 years, who
traces his ancestry from the prophet Mohammed, lay on his deathbed
Friday at a military hospital here, the end of an era for his small
desert kingdom almost at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The king, 63, arrived home Friday morning on an overnight flight
from the United States. The government said Friday night that he
was clinging to life. Palace officials discussed the prospects for
his survival in terms of hours, not days.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians stood vigil, anticipating the death of the only
leader most of them have known and the transition to a new monarchy
led by a 37-year-old career soldier few of them would have
recognized on the street a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   With no public ceremony or television cameras, the royal
family's private jet landed at the international airport here at 10
a.m., after a 12-hour flight from Rochester, Minn. Hussein, whose
doctor said he was in critical condition, was immediately flown by
helicopter to a military hospital that bears his name in the
suburbs. His wife, Queen Noor, and several of his 12 children, were
driven to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Cold rain and hail lashed this hilltop capital as the family
remained in the hospital area and Jordanians waited for official
word about the king's condition.
</P>
<P>
   The rainstorm was the second of an unusually parched winter. As
seemingly everyone in Amman noted, the last time it rained hard was
on Jan. 19, the day of the king's prior homecoming from the Mayo
Clinic. Crowds had lined the streets for a glimpse of the frail,
clean-shaven king, who stood in the freezing downpour saluting his
subjects from the open sun roof of his car.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors were said to believe that the motorcade might have
hastened the inevitable deterioration of his immune system, ravaged
by non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Wire services reported that the family had decided not to
withdraw life-support systems. Reuters said there had been some
disagreement among family members about life support, saying the
king was in a coma. The Associated Press said he had been reaching
for his wife's hand as he was carried into the hospital on a
stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a knot of his supporters stood vigil for hours in the
rain at the entrance to the King Hussein Medical Center, chanting
prayers for a recovery and couplets of praise for his good works,
their tone of bereavement betraying the belief of many that the
king had already died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king is my brother, the king is my father, the king is
Jordan!'' shouted one young man, his words echoed by other youths
in brown leather jackets, their red-checkered scarves wrapped tight
over chin and mouth in a traditional mourning gesture.
</P>
<P>
   A Jordanian reporter broke down in tears as she scribbled rapid
notes. Police officers in red berets made half-hearted attempts to
keep traffic moving as cars slowed past the hospital gate and its
oversized poster of a vibrant, smiling king.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood in most of Amman was subdued and solemn on this day
of rest and prayer. Mosques filled with the faithful, and families
gathered before television sets, awaiting an expected announcement
about the king on the daily 3 p.m. state news broadcast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the venerably tattered downtown al-Jamiya al-Arabia coffee
shop, men quietly played cards and backgammon with one eye on the
fuzzily tuned set on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Abdullah I don't know, but King Hussein is the father
of Jordan, he is the heart of Jordan,'' Naseer al-Awartne said
between drags on a table-high water pipe. ``We want to know how he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Three o'clock came and went, the regular news program
substituted without explanation by travelogues and videotaped
dramas. Two hours later broadcasters read a brief official
statement that the king was gravely ill but still receiving medical
treatment. The statement was seemingly intended to rebut news
reports that the king was ``clinically dead,'' sustained only by
emergency life support systems, and it suggested that the hour of
his announced death would be determined mainly by political and
logistical considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Abdallah Rawajfeh, an English-speaking banker who said he tuned
to the BBC every evening, voiced frustration about the lack of
information. ``It is only because I listen to foreign news
broadcasts that I was not surprised that he is dying,'' he said.
``And I know that there is concern abroad about Prince Abdullah. I
think the king has been preparing him to lead behind closed doors.
But Hassan was always the one dealing with political issues here,
and he was well aware of all the politics and problems of all the
countries in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, the king's brother, had been designated crown prince for
34 years until the king stripped him of the position a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians, after the shock of the king's abrupt return to the
Mayo Clinic two weeks ago, appeared to be adjusting to the idea of
a transition. Officials working in the palace said they believed
Hussein's death was another day or even hours away. They said their
immediate concerns were managing a mammoth state funeral as early
as Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The king is generally expected to be buried in a family plot at
the Raghadan Palace compound here.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordanians may accept the succession and their probable
new leader, they say they will find it hard to accept the loss of a
leader who was at once a major world figure and an intimate
reassuring presence in their daily lives. Demographically, Jordan
is a young country. Just one Jordanian in 10 has a memory of
another king.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is part of me, he is part of my family,'' said Rawajfeh,
who was 4 when Hussein ascended to the throne in 1952. ``We grew up
with him. He is us, and we are him.''

IRISH REJECTION PUTS BALL IN BIG TEN COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, displaying nearsightedness rare for an institution
that considers itself unique and clear thinking, has decided to
maintain its football independence. Yesterday's announcement leaves
the next major decision to the Big Ten Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Big Ten stay with 11 teams? Or will it add a 12th team
(that's what Big Ten athletic directors and football coaches want)?
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany is one of college sports' most
visionary leaders, but yesterday he kept his ideas to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not discussed what our next move might be,'' he said.
``Expansion is not closed and not open. We'll sit down and have a
discussion to see if there's enough support to pursue it again. If
it's in our best interest to ask a question or knock on a door,
I'll do it and not worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Ten decides to add a team or teams, get ready for
more Richter scale activity on the college sports scene the next
six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all known the potential for conference alignment starts
with the Big Ten,'' Western Athletic Conference commissioner Karl
Benson said. ``It's in their hands. If they hold tight, nobody
foresees another conference making a move.''
</P>
<P>
   For TCU and SMU to improve their lots in life, the best news
would be for the Big Ten to expand. That could touch off a series
of moves that could help both schools in their conference quests.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg, former deputy commissioner
with the Big Ten, said expansion is not a simple issue for his
former league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue of academic compatibility,'' he said. ``One of
the stumbling blocks has been getting a consensus on an
institution. There's also the academic compatibility issue. The Big
Ten has not been interested in bringing in a school that didn't
quite match up on the academic side.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Syracuse are the most likely candidates to join the
Big Ten. The word is that Missouri might accept a Big Ten
invitation, while Syracuse might simply talk to the Big Ten to
force the expansion hand of the nine-team Atlantic Coast
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri move to the Big Ten would touch off major movement.
Obviously, the Big 12 would have to add another team. Arkansas
would be the prime candidate. If that happened, the Southeastern
Conference would be shopping for a 12th team. Miami of Florida
would be a possibility. Think dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   A Syracuse move to the Big Ten would mean the end of the Big
East Conference _ and, ironically, could leave Notre Dame without a
home for its nonfootball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA, which met recently to discuss plans for the next
five years, might consider adding Big East schools if they became
free agents. But that would require ridding itself of teams.
Perhaps C-USA would want to add Virginia Tech and West Virginia
while saying so long to Houston and Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   What is unknown is the ripple effect of a Big Ten decision. If
the Big Ten grows to 12 _ splitting into divisions and staging a
football championship game in football _ would the ACC and the
Pacific-10 Conference feel compelled to follow suit?
</P>
<P>
   If the ACC wants to expand, it might target Syracuse, Miami,
Boston College and/or Rutgers. Miami could become a focal point for
the ACC and the SEC, if the latter loses a member (like Arkansas to
the Big 12). Think musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   However, ACC expansion might be blocked by basketball interests.
ACC tournament tickets, a precious commodity, would have to be
divided 12 ways instead of nine. And unlike other conferences, in
the ACC, basketball's voice is as loud as football's.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10, which has been closely associated with the Big Ten
through the conferences' Rose Bowl agreement, hasn't taken a firm
stance on expansion. Colorado would be a prime candidate for the
Pac-10, but finding a viable 12th school could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement could be minor, it could be major,'' Benson said.
``If the Big Ten expands, what impact does that have on the Big
East, on Conference USA, on the WAC? Would the Pac-10 react to the
Big Ten expansion to 12? A year from now, we could have an entire
new conference landscape west of the Mississippi.''

 &HT;    MindSpring cancels account of controversial anti-abortionist
 &HT;    By Frances Katz and Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Internet service provider MindSpring
pulled the plug on Carrollton subscriber Neal Horsley and his
controversial Christian Gallery Web site this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood won $107.9 million in damages
against 13 individuals and two anti-abortion groups in a trial in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley was not a defendant because his site wasn't created
until after the case was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury decided the defendants were using threatening
literature, which included wanted posters for abortion doctors,
images of dripping blood and a list of abortion doctors with those
who had been injured or killed crossed out in red. Some of those
images had been takend from a part of Horsley's site called
``Nuremberg Trials: Visualize Abortionists on Trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was not a defendant, Horsley's Web site was not
specifically targeted by the federal court, but an injunction was
filed Thursday prohibiting the defendants from using any of
Horsley's material.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley said he would not shut down his site. However, that was
before MindSpring decided to shut it down for him.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring President and Chief Operating Officer Michael McQuary
said the decision to terminate Horsley's account was made Thursday.
``We've got a department here that reviews all complaints about all
sorts of people violating our user agreements,'' he said. ``It's
the Internet equivalent of tattletaleing.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuary stressed MindSpring is not in the business of policing
its subscribers' Web sites for questionable content. ``It's only
when a situation has been brought to the abuse department's
attention that we go and look at a site,'' he said. ``If, in the
view of our abuse team, they've crossed the line, they can
terminate those accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers trying to access http://www.christiangallery.com now

</P>
<P>
   McQuary pointed to the MindSpring's information page at
http://www.mindspring.net/aboutus, which outlines the company's
appropriate use policy. ``Threats of bodily harm or destruction of
property are always prohibited,'' is one cause for MindSpring
subscribers to be terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley confirmed that MindSpring closed the site late Thursday
without warning, citing violations of the ``appropriate use
contract,'' with regard to ``threatening and harassing language.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's decision to close the site was a ``temporary
setback,'' the statement said. ``We are presently searching for a
bolder and more principled ISP to host the Nuremberg Files.''

   30-YEAR BOND YIELD SOARS AS STOCKS CONTINUE TO FALL
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose after the Labor
Department reported that the unemployment rate in January remained
unchanged from December at 4.3 percent, the lowest level in 28
years. The bond's yield climbed to 5.35 percent from 5.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology
stocks, suffered its worst one-week decline since October, dropping
5.3 percent. The Nasdaq index closed lower by 36.45 points, or 1.51
percent, to 2,373.62.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rallied at the end of the day
to drop just 0.26 point, to 9,304.24, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's

   ECONOMIC CRISIS IN BRAZIL INTENSIFIES
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's stocks, currency and bonds fell, closing out a
tumultuous week that began with hopes that a new central banker
could halt a free fall in the currency. The week ended with concern
that rising interest rates would sink the economy, causing debt to
balloon. The value of the currency, the real, fell 1 percent, to
1.82 to the dollar from 1.805.

   AIRPORT LANDING CHANGES SEEN
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to end limits on how many
planes can land per hour at Kennedy, La Guardia and O'Hare
airports, people who have been briefed on the plan said. The
change, to be proposed on Monday, would make it easier for start-up
airlines to challenge established carriers, at a time when the
Transportation Department is looking for ways to stimulate airline
competition.

</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan indicated that he
wanted the nation's central bank to buy government bonds and sell
bills to help halt a surge in long-term interest rates. Yields on
Japanese 10-year bonds tripled in the last four months as investors
braced for a flood of debt sales by the government to finance tax
cuts and public-works spending. The rising yields drove up interest
rates on a variety of things, ranging from corporate bonds to
mortgages.

PARITY NEEDED IN WOMEN'S GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is an exciting game?
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, any game that's close usually constitutes an exciting
game, right?
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the average women's college game can turn into
something where a team leads by 20 points in the first half en
route to a pull-your-hair-out 55-point heart-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, there were 100 women's college basketball games,
and 46 of those games were decided by at least 17 points; there
were two games decided by more than 60 points. Also Tuesday night,
there were 89 men's games, and only 18 of those were at least
17-point margins.
</P>
<P>
   Although the popularity of the women's game has increased
exponentially in recent years, it has done so without the benefit
of something the men's game has across the board: parity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent pool isn't as deep as it is on the men's side, and
consequently the teams aren't as competitive,'' Georgia coach Andy
Landers said. ``You see talented 12- or 13-year-old boys who
realize they are gifted, and they don't quit. With girls, they may
not stay with it. Boys see sports on TV and have something to
aspire to. Until there were pro leagues for women, girls didn't
have that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of a multitude of arguments that can be made, but
the disparity might reach something deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are more self-confident,'' SMU coach Rhonda Rompola said.
``I don't think enough young women believe that they can go to a
small program to build something and be the difference. There's no
reason why they can't, they just have to have the confidence. I
just think not enough of them do, and as a result, women's
basketball won't grow as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   As women's players have increased their skills collectively in
the past decade it hasn't translated into the best players
attending a diverse set of programs. It's just the opposite:
Tennessee, Stanford and Louisiana Tech can wait for a Parade
All-American to call them.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas an 18-year-old male might think enough of himself to
play for an unheralded basketball program, such as Larry Bird at
Indiana State or David Robinson at Navy, women's programs haven't
consistently seen that yet. There are only isolated cases, such as
Sheryl Swoopes at Texas Tech when she won the national title nearly
by herself in a captivating NCAA Tournament run in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RFor this to change\S it's going to take more individual
players who want to be part of a growing program rather than the
best players just wanting to be another player on a title team,''
Rompola said.
LONGHORNS' LUMMUS WILL SAVOR END OF CAREER
</P>
<P>
   Don't be too surprised if you see Texas senior shooting guard
Kim Lummus strolling around campus with a pensive look. She has a
little more than one month remaining on her basketball playing
career and she wants to enjoy it _ and think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a dream of mine to play here, but this isn't a
sad thing _ it's been a great four years,'' Lummus said. ``I know
this is the last time I am going to play on a certain floor, or
have preseason workouts, so you try to enjoy it more. There isn't a
minute I don't have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing as Cleburne's all-time leading scorer and having
her jersey retired there, Lummus (pronounced Loo-mis) slowly worked
up the depth chart and has become a consistent scorer and presence
for the Lady Longhorns. She averages 12.2 points and scored a
career-high 26 points with seven rebounds and five assists against
Tennessee earlier this season. Lummus ranks second in UT history
with 162 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   It's off the floor where Lummus has taken advantage of her
opportunity as a scholarship athlete. She was a Big 12 first-team
all-academic selection last season and earned a 3.5 grade-point
average last semester majoring in corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Lummus has also been involved with UT's community programs,
working with underprivileged children and speaking at elementary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have done much of this without basketball,'' Lummus
said. ``This has allowed me to become a role model.''
QUICK HITS LET'S GO, BABY
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State coach Charli Turner-Thorne and her husband, Will,
are expecting their first child to be born ... today. The Sun
Devils play today against Washington, so there is the possibility
that the coach could go into labor during the game.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the first pregnancy that people end up buying a
ticket to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband will be there and I'm ready to go if something
happens, but I'm going to keep him inside of me until Sunday,'' she
said, laughing. ``Seriously, I really think I will make it to
Monday. Either way, I have an appointment for Monday to induce
labor if it doesn't happen by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner-Thorne has coached throughout the season but was unable
to fly on Arizona State's most recent trip to northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gained that much weight, I just have the big ole'
basketball that's about ready to come out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State media relations office has had so many
requests for updates on Turner-Thorne's pregnancy that it has been
sending out e-mails and faxes to media outlets nationwide with baby
updates.
ROCKY MOUNTAIN LETDOWN
</P>
<P>
   After losing to top-ranked Tennessee for the second time this
season, No. 8 Georgia is hitting the skids.
</P>
<P>
   After the 16-point defeat to the Lady Vols, Georgia lost to
Mississippi State by four and followed that performance by
defeating South Carolina by four points.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed for 37 minutes before rallying to win in the final
three against the Southeastern Conference worst team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been up, up, up, up for every game, and subconsciously
we are tired of being up,'' Georgia coach Andy Landers said. ``The
end of January and first two weeks of February are boring in
basketball.''
ARE YOU THE NICE `60 MINUTES'?
</P>
<P>
   The crew of ``60 Minutes II'' has been on the Tennessee campus
since November preparing to do a piece on the team and coach Pat
Summitt.
</P>
<P>
   Crews have traveled with the team frequently and have had
roundtable discussions with the players and coach Summitt. Lead
reporter Vicki Mabry arrived in Knoxville, Tenn., recently from
London for the serious sit-down discussions with Summitt.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is slated to air in late February or early March
leading up the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Games to Watch TODAY
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Rutgers (18-4, 10-1) at No. 20 Boston College (18-3,
10-3), 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   With the Eagles' upset of Connecticut two weeks ago, Rutgers has
a good chance to grab the top spot in the Big East. If BC loses it
can say buh-bye to the Top 25.
TOMORROW
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Georgia (19-3, 7-3) at Kentucky (14-7, 4-5), 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a make-or-break game for the Wildcats and their
hopes for a tournament berth.
TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Louisiana Tech at No. 25 Florida International, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest reasons why Florida International joined the
Sun Belt Conference was to play games such as these. It might
regret that on Wednesday morning.
THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Auburn at No. 21 Alabama, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are in the NCAA Tournament, but this should be one of
the most well-played, not to mention athletic, games in the nation.
FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Purdue at No. 18 Penn St., 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers are two games up on the rest of the Big Ten,
but if anyone is going to defeat Purdue, this is a perfect time.

M.L. CARR BACK IN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was there Friday night, looking as if nothing had
ever changed. There was the double-breasted Joseph Abboud suit, the
mingling with fans and media, and, later, rubbing elbows with the
rich guys in the Putnam luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billionaires,'' M.L. Carr was saying. ``That's what we want,
billionaires. Not millionaires. I've gone from the bench to the
luxury boxes. Is that success or what?''
</P>
<P>
   There weren't a lot of Carr sightings at the FleetCenter last
season. By his own count, he attended three of the 41 games: one
with a client, one as a social night out, and the third to honor
former teammate Robert Parish. It was absence by design, he says
now.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he was no longer in the basketball picture, also by
design. Yet he thought it best to stay away, lest someone ask him
about Rick Pitino's team, or Pitino's style, or clothes, or shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There obviously was a need to step back,'' Carr said. ``I
didn't want to have people ask me questions about second-guessing.
Rick is a career coach. I'm not a career coach. What I did, it was
a business decision. I feel good about what I did. Now he can take
it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr was also there to see Antoine Walker. He has become even
closer to the Celtics' captain, whom he drafted out of Kentucky
after making a great trade with Dallas. (When Walker was a rookie,
his teammates saw that and nicknamed him ``Antoine Carr.'') It's
one legacy which is his and his alone, even though we'll give him a
pass for offering Walker and the Dallas pick in 1997 (which turned
into Ron Mercer) for Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   It's becoming fun to be a Celtics fan these days, but it was
anything but in Carr's two lean years as coach, especially the
second. But, he maintains, he knew what was going on, did what he
was supposed to do, expected to take the hits, and never flinched.
That still doesn't explain the ridiculous contracts given to Greg
Minor or Pervis Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   But it does explain the 15-67 record, the best statistical shot
at Tim Duncan, and, well, the Ping-Pong balls were one of the few
things he said he could not control or oversee. Dee Brown said last
week that Carr took a bullet for the organization, and Carr did
everything but show us the scar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real good about what we did,'' he said. ``It was a
tough period. What we're able to do, I don't think too many people
could have done that and taken the hits I took. I knew going in
what I was looking at. I told (owner) Paul Gaston, `Why bring in a
guy you're just going to have to fire and lose all that money? It
doesn't make sense. We don't have what we need to get where need to
be.' He said I was crazy: `You'll get killed.' Red (Auerbach) said
the same thing. I told Red, `It's because of you. You always taught
us to put the team first.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, we're now told, it was all by design, which we suspected all
along. Carr got a $1 million bonus for steering the team to that
15-67 record and then disappearing into the corporate woodwork so
Pitino could come in with the cranes and bulldozers. It was, we're
told, calculated, deliberate, even disingenuous at times, with Carr
saying he knowingly misled reporters because ``it was all a
cat-and-mouse game to me. I'd send you guys on wild goose chases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to take a lot of hits, no question,'' he
went on. ``I had never coached a high school team. Most people
would have been scared to death to do what I did. But I wasn't at
all. I'm not intimidated by anything or anyone, so I was able to do
that. I did what I thought was right for the organization to the
point where a guy like Rick could come in.''
</P>
<P>
   He said we'd see more of him this season. The FleetCenter no
longer is a basketball arena. It's a selling venue. His job is to
make money for the team by shaking down the suits, and there are
plenty in the luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The one-year hiatus from the FleetCenter is over. Carr sees no
reason to be incommunicado any longer. The team is headed in the
right direction with its ``career coach,'' and he is now content to
be a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home for me. I helped build this,'' he said. ``I'm a
Celtic. I've got two championship rings. This is my city. I chose
to stay here. I've done it here from every conceivable angle. My
father used to tell me to come back home (North Carolina) when I
retired, but on his last visit here, he said to me, `This is your
home.' He understood. I love Boston. I love the action here. This
is home. And you should never feel uncomfortable in your own
house.''

ANALYSIS: HUSSEIN'S DEATH MAY BE HARBINGER OF REGIONAL CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also JORDAN-HUSSEIN, HUSSEIN-PRINCE) 
(mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Not only will the death of King Hussein of
Jordan, the region's longest-serving leader, mark the end of an
era, but it may also herald the beginning of a traumatic changing
of the guard across the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the very durability of Arab leaders has been a
steadying force in one of the world's most volatile regions. Not
since 1982, in Saudi Arabia, has power in a major Arab country
passed from one leader to another.
</P>
<P>
   But now most Arab rulers are aging, and several are ill. In some
places the path of succession remains uncertain. And with last
month's surprise move, in which he entrusted his kingdom to his
untested eldest son, Hussein may have offered a foretaste of
struggles and intrigue to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repression doesn't work; it hasn't worked,'' the king, himself
a generally benevolent monarch, said in an interview last month
when asked what advice he would give to the next generation of Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Future handovers, he said, will feature evolution, not
turbulence. Indeed, his own last-minute machinations, though
wrenching, appear to have laid the ground for a smooth succession.
</P>
<P>
   Still, heavy-handedness remains the norm across the Arab world.
And after long years in which various aspirations and ambitions
have simmered beneath the surface, it is not at all clear what will
happen as long-serving leaders leave the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Arabs there remains no rival to Hussein's
47-year-reign, which began when Harry Truman was president.
</P>
<P>
   It outlasted coups, wars, assassination attempts and, for a
time, cancer's blight. But with its end, power will pass to his
37-year-old heir, the soon-to-be-crowned King Abdullah, who has had
little practice with political power.
</P>
<P>
   But other Arab leaders, most notably those of the Syrians and
the Palestinians, have been in place for more than a
quarter-century, and Jordan is certainly not unique in that its
leader's long tenure has allowed much pressure to build beneath
what sometimes seemed an implacable surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have hung on for a long time, and it's possible
that they'll hold on for a lot longer,'' said a Western diplomat in
the region. ``But some of them seem to be living on borrowed time,
and so much is at stake that it's all but impossible to believe
that the succession everywhere will be smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   One other Arab transition has already begun: in Saudi Arabia,
where day-to-day control of the government has passed from King
Fahd, who is 76 and has suffered several strokes, to his brother
and designated heir, Crown Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is all but certain to become the next Saudi king, but
the lesson of Jordan may be that no such thing is entirely certain.
In the surprise that made room for his son, Hussein ousted his
brother, Crown Prince Hassan, after 34 years as the presumed heir,
with a bitter letter that revealed years of suspicion and
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi crown prince, like his brother, is in his mid-70s, and
diplomats say rivalries within the royal family may make the
succession after his uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is much less clear in Syria and among the
Palestinians, whose front-line positions with Israel make their
futures crucial. Both Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president, and
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, will turn 70 this year. Both
have shown unmistakable signs of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who took power in a 1970 coup, has used government muscle
to enforce a kind of tense internal stability. But he has battled
heart problems for more than 15 years, accounting for his
often-ghostly pallor, and periodic disappearances from public view
have been seen as signs of his deteriorating health.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has in place a designated deputy, Vice President
Abdel-Karim Khaddam, but he has also been grooming a son, Bashar, a
military officer with no position within the ruling Baath party.
Syria is a secretive country in which authoritative information is
scarce, but it is also riven by long-suppressed rivalries, and
diplomats say that challenges to any succession plan are not at all
out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, the Palestinians' main leader since the 1960s, has also
shown increasing signs of failing health. His lower lip trembles
incessantly, as does his writing hand, but Palestinian officials
have denied reports that he has Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Arafat has taken pains to avoid building up a potential
successor who might also be a rival. Several of his top lieutenants
in the Palestine Liberation Organization were killed by the
Israelis during the Palestinians' long quest for a homeland, and
some surviving candidates, such as Mahmoud Abbas, who negotiated
key peace agreements with Israel, appear open to internal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential setting for instability is Iraq, where
President Saddam Hussein has ruled in title since 1979, and in
practice since 1970. Saddam, who is 61, is relatively youthful and
is not known to be ill, but he too has never designated a
successor. If American-backed efforts to topple him succeed, the
result could well be an unstable vacuum of power.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi, 56, has been in power since
a 1969 coup, and has never designated a successor. Perhaps
tellingly, he dispatched his son to Jordan late last month to meet
with Crown Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important of Arab countries where the course of
succession remains unclear is Egypt, where President Hosni Mubarak
took power in 1981 after the assassination of Anwar Sadat. Mubarak,
now 70, was vice president at the time. But though he himself was
targeted in a 1995 assassination attempt, he has never named a vice
president of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials say that, should anything happen to Mubarak,
established constitutional procedures would make for a smooth
handover, but the fact that the path is not clear has been a source
of concern to Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkable as it may seem, the only Arab governments to have
changed hands in the last 15 years have been on the region's
periphery _ in Sudan, with a 1986 coup; in Lebanon, with elections
last year; and in Qatar, where the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa
al-Thani, took power in 1995 after removing his father in a
bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
   (Iran, which is Persian, not Arab, but is nevertheless a
powerhouse in the Middle East, has seen more recent change.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was selected in 1989 to succeed Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini as the country's supreme leader, while President
Mohammed Khatami was elected to succeed Hashemi Rafsanjani.)
</P>
<P>
   The norm has been longevity. In the tiny sheikdoms and emirates
of the Persian Gulf, most leaders have ruled since independence in
the 1960s and '70s. Excluding Sheik Hamad, their average age is
more than 70. After Hussein's death, the distinction of the
region's longest-serving leader will pass to King Hassan of
Morocco. Hassan, 69, has spent 38 years on the throne, and has
groomed his son and heir Prince Sidi Mohammed for what he hopes
will be a smooth succession.

GATES AND WIFE GIVE $3.3 BILLION TO THEIR 2 FOUNDATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., N.C.) (bl) 
By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, have given
$3.3 billion to their two foundations, the president of one of the
foundations said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts bring the total assets of both foundations to nearly
$5.5 billion, putting the William H. Gates Foundation in the top 10
foundations in the United States in assets, and the Gates Learning
Foundation in the top 30, said Sara Engelhardt, president of the
Foundation Center, a nonprofit organization that tracks
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Engelhardt said that with the donations, Gates, 43, has
given away more money than any other living American
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the two Gates foundations gave away more than $150
million, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The William H. Gates Foundation, which received $2.2 billion,
focuses on world health and population issues and traditional grant
making to universities and dozens of other organizations. Grant
recipients have included Duke University, of which Ms. Gates, 34,
is an alumna; the Seattle Public Library, and the International
AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates Learning Foundation received $1.1 billion and its name
was changed from the Gates Library Foundation. It will use the
additional money to broaden its scope, which had been bringing
computers to public libraries in low income areas, to education and
take its mission overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary focus will be libraries, but we also plan to look
at new and other areas to support,'' said Patty Stonesifer,
president and chairman of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else among the top 10 foundations has a living donor,
and very few in the top 50,'' Ms. Engelhardt said ``It's very
unusual for a living philanthropist to have assets of that size go
into a foundation. Not since the time of Andrew Carnegie and John
D. Rockefeller in the early part of this century has that
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Engelhardt said that other living philanthropists who have
put their money into foundations include Walter Annenberg and
William and Flora Hewlett. The Annenberg Foundation has assets of
about $3.35 billion. The Hewlett Foundation's endowment is $1.9
billion. Ms. Engelhardt said her ranking of foundations came from
data from the 1996 and 1997 fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is the wealthiest person in the world. He owns 515 million
shares of Microsoft, a company spokesman said, so his personal
fortune varies with the stock price. Friday it would have been more
than $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The donation brings the endowment of the William H. Gates
Foundation, which is run by Gates' father, William H. Gates Sr., to
more than $4 billion. The Gates Learning Foundation's endowment is
about $1.3 billion with the new gift. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gifts were made on Jan. 29, said Ms. Stonesifer, in the form
of about 20 million shares of Microsoft stock, which closed at $171
per share that day. She did not disclose whether the shares had
been converted to cash. The senior Gates was not available for
comment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gifts were not announced, and neither Bill nor Melinda Gates
was available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts with the couple's announcement last December that
the William H. Gates Foundation would donate $100 million to a
nonprofit health organization in Seattle to find better ways to
distribute vaccines to children in developing countries. At the
time, Gates was criticized for publicizing a charitable gift when
his company was fighting government antitrust charges in U.S.
District Court in Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stonesifer said the recent gifts had nothing to do with the
continuing antitrust trial and that the quiet manner in which the
gift was made was in keeping with the Gates' long-term plans.
Except for a small part that he said he would reserve for his
family, Gates has on several occasions promised eventually to give
away nearly all of his wealth before he dies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The William H. Gates Foundation has gradually increased its
endowment, which began with about $106 million when the foundation
was founded in 1994. Since the Learning Foundation was started in
1997, its endowment has remained steady at about $250 million. In
recent years, particularly as the value of Microsoft stock has
soared, Gates has been criticized for not being more generous with
his personal wealth.To those in philanthropy circles, the latest
Gates gift signaled a tide change. ``With one stunning gesture,
Bill Gates has moved from the realm of boy genius to real mensch,''
said Harry Saal, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and a
philanthropist.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is frankly what we've been hoping to see,'' said Dorothy
Ridings, president of the Council on Foundations, an organization
for foundations and corporate giving programs, in Washington, D.C. &QL;

EDITORIAL: AFTER KING HUSSEIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East is losing its most durable ruler and most
determined peacemaker, King Hussein of Jordan, who lies near death
in a Jordanian hospital. Filling the ominous void left by his
departure may be the Middle East's most urgent challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large measure to Hussein, a just and lasting peace
between Israel and its Arab neighbors is a realistic possibility.
The king was not always on the same side of Middle East conflicts
as Israel and the United States. But the two main exceptions, his
participation in the June 1967 war against Israel and his
diplomatic support for Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, were
based on misplaced calculations of immediate Jordanian interests.
In 1967 he feared that Jordan's large Palestinian population would
revolt if he tried to stay out of the conflict. In 1991 he worried
that Jordan could be shattered economically by the air and ground
war against its largest trading partner, Iraq. Both blunders cost
Jordan dearly.
</P>
<P>
   More emblematic of Hussein's 47-year reign was his pursuit of
peace with Israel. Early on, he followed the example of his
grandfather, King Abdullah, and met secretly with Israeli leaders.
For many decades, Jordan was the only Arab country interested in a
peaceful relationship with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Egypt and then the Palestinians moved in the same
direction. But while all three now have formal peace agreements
with Israel, Hussein continued to play a special role. By his
courageous personal interventions, he captured the trust of
Israel's people.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to believe that the special friendship
between Jordan and Israel will continue under Abdullah. But at
least until the new heir consolidates his position, other Arab
leaders will have to nudge along the peace process and rescue it
from future crises.
</P>
<P>
   The logical candidate is Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak. Egypt
was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, and
Cairo enjoys good relations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
In the early phases of the Oslo peace agreement, Mubarak helped
work out arrangements between Arafat and the Israeli Prime
Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. Since Benjamin Netanyahu
was elected three years ago, a chill has crept into the
relationship between Egypt and Israel. But Egypt's fundamental
interests lie in leading the rest of the Arab world toward peace
with Israel, and Israel's lie in helping any Arab leader brave
enough to try.

TEXAS COURT RULES AGAINST LAW SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It may look like a computer disk, but in the eyes of a
federal judge in Texas it behaves too much like a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last month thought to be the first of its type in
the United States, Judge Barefoot Sanders of U.S. District Court in
Dallas found that Parsons Technology Inc., which publishes Quicken
Family Law and Quicken Family Lawyer '99, goes too far in the
assistance it provides consumers, resulting in an unauthorized
practice of law in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, which sued
Parsons, says it will now seek to ban the sale of the software in
Texas, raising First Amendment concerns. In addition, the case is
highlighting arguments about whether the committee is protecting
the public from shoddy legal practices or further alienating
consumers who have already been priced out of the market for
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Quicken software provides more than 100 different legal
forms, instructions on how to fill them out, and assistance in
tailoring the documents to the user's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, based in Berkeley, Calif., argued that it had not
engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, because there had to
be some form of contact between publisher and consumer for that to
happen. Parsons also said that interfering with the sale of the
Quicken software would be a violation of the First Amendment right
to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders found that ``Parsons, through QFL, has gone beyond
publishing a sample form book with instructions, and has ventured
into the unauthorized practice of law.'' He also found that
although there was some restriction on free speech, it was in
keeping with the state's interest in protecting ``the uninformed
and unwary from overly simplistic legal advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ticer, a lawyer for the committee, said he would move to
have the company banned from selling Quicken legal software in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Jordan, who represented Parsons, said he would offer
more information and ask the judge to reconsider his position once
the injunction was requested. If that failed, he said, he would
seek to delay sales limits during appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Software publishers said Texas was alone in its aggressive
scrutiny of legal self-help material. But the case is being watched
closely. Some software dealers say they steer clear of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also focused attention on whether the Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee is serving the people's interests. It is
responsible for enforcing the practice-of-law statute, and is made
up of six Texas lawyers and three nonlawyers, appointed by the
Supreme Court of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who buy this program cannot afford to go to
a lawyer,'' said Jane Winn, an associate professor specializing in
technology law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ``If you
take this program away from the people who are using it today, what
access do they have to information about their rights?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Walt Borges, director of Court Watch, a project in Austin that
monitors the courts, criticized the committee for promoting a
``monopoly of law'' and for operating in secret. ``Before anybody
bans a self-help product, they need to be darn sure that this will
harm the public in some way,'' he said, noting that it appeared the
committee was not acting on consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's secretive operations are already being
challenged in Texas Supreme Court by Nolo Press, which publishes a
range of self-help legal manuals.
</P>
<P>
   Ticer defended the committee's right to operate with
confidentiality, explaining that the members do their own
investigations and could be hampered if their identities were
known.
</P>
<P>
   He also countered accusations that the committee was simply
trying to protect lawyers' interests in the state. ``We don't have
an agenda,'' Ticer said. ``We just carry out the statute.''

BLAKE KNOWS HIS ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Defenseman Rob Blake has been as frustrated as
anyone during the Los Angeles Kings' struggles this season, but it
is not the captain's way to yell and scream, nor does he believe it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Blake believes that if the Kings are to mount a
late-season surge and make it into the postseason, the players will
have to find the drive within themselves, and they will have to
accept their roles on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to be different as to how they lead the
team,'' Blake said following an optional practice Friday at the
Iceoplex in North Hills. ``I'm not going to change the way I am,
yelling at people. You lead by example. I was taught by Dave Taylor
and Wayne Gretzky, the guys who were captains before me. (Vancouver
captain) Mark Messier, from what I've heard, doesn't say a lot, but
when he does, his teammates listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a difficult and important 3-2 victory Thursday night
over Chicago, the Kings (18-28-4) play host tonight to the San Jose
Sharks, who they trail by four points in the race for the final
playoff berth in the Western Conference. It will be the second game
of an NHL-record 10-game trip for San Jose, and it is a game the
Kings need badly.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said the players' focus should be on the ice, not on their
own personal situations on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying guys playing five minutes are complaining or
guys playing 30 minutes are complaining,'' Blake said. ``But
everybody has a role. (Ian Laperriere) is quite content with what
he does (killing penalties). He knows he helps the team. Matti
Norstrom, it's the same thing. We need guys to play their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodger not 100 percent: Defenseman Doug Bodger said he still
doesn't feel consistently well, more than one month since he was
smacked headfirst into the boards by a blind-side hit from
Phoenix's Dallas Drake. Bodger missed six games with a cervical
strain and Drake was suspended for four games.
</P>
<P>
   NHL vice president Colin Campbell admitted Thursday that Drake
should have received a stiffer sentence. Bodger said he has heard
that after Drake's four-game penalty was announced, Dallas' Brett
Hull and New Jersey's Dave Andreychuk both called Campbell to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hull said he called Colin and said, `Four games? That's a
joke. He could have been seriously hurt,''' Bodger said. ``I still
feel it some days. I'm not 100 percent like I was earlier in the
year. I still get a few headaches and I wake up in the morning sore
and stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodger won't have to worry about Drake when the Kings visit
Phoenix on Wednesday. Drake is sidelined with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Injured right wing Glen Murray skated for the
second consecutive day and reported no ill effects. ``It didn't
feel too bad,'' he said. ``I'd like to start practicing with the
team, next week maybe.''... Kings prospect Eric Belanger, a
21-year-old center who has been playing for Springfield in the AHL,
is in Los Angeles receiving medical care for a stress fracture in
his lower back. Belanger is expected to return to Springfield and
play again this season for the Falcons once his injury heals.

SENATE DEMOCRATS PREPARE CENSURE OF CLINTON

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A proposed resolution of censure of President
Clinton, drafted by Democratic senators, assails his misconduct as
``shameless, reckless and indefensible,'' and concludes that the
president ``gave false or misleading testimony and impeded
discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-page proposal, which is still being revised, also states
that Clinton ``deliberately misled and deceived the American
people,'' and underscores that the president ``remains subject to
criminal and civil actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate impeachment trial was in recess Friday, as the House
managers and White House lawyers prepared to present excerpts from
the videotaped witness depositions Saturday. But senators were
swapping ideas and vote projections about censure in phone calls,
in the corridors and in Capitol hideaways.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and some Republicans are circulating the proposal, a
draft copy of which was provided to The New York Times by a censure
proponent, in an effort to win majority support for a bipartisan
rebuke of the president. The measure's main sponsor, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., said the proposal had undergone about 20
drafts and was still ``a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as senators searched for a formula that was tough enough on
Clinton to attract Republican support, but not too onerous to scare
off Democrats, lawmakers debated the timing of a vote on such a
plan. Unlike some House censure proposals, Feinstein's would not
fine the president or require his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had envisioned voting on a censure resolution after
passing judgment on the two articles of impeachment, perjury and
obstruction of justice. But Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
has suggested adjourning the trial temporarily next week, voting on
censure before the two articles, and then resuming the trial.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy would lock in some Democrats, who would otherwise,
if the president were acquitted by the Senate, be less inclined to
vote for censure. But that might anger some Republicans leaning
toward censure if the tactic is perceived as a way to give
political cover for an acquittal vote.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, censure supporters are pushing for a vote before the
Senate's mid-February recess, which is set to start next weekend.
Proponents fear senators will have little appetite for censure
after a week away from Washington, and the final impeachment votes
behind them. ``It loses its punch if it comes after that,'' said
Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment trial winding down and acquittal virtually
assured, the Senate is struggling how to reprimand Clinton for his
affair with Monica Lewinsky, and let him stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats do not want to seen as condoning the president's
misconduct, even as they vote against convicting him. And
Republicans are wary that without some Senate rebuke, Clinton will
be seen as walking away from the scandal with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   A small but growing number of Republicans are backing the
Democratic plan, including Chafee and Robert Bennett of Utah.
Republicans like Richard Shelby of Alabama and Kay Bailey Hutchison
of Texas have expressed support for some kind of reprimand.
``There's a sense that the president should not be allowed to walk
away from this with any sense of vindication,'' said Bennett, who
is leading the recruitment drive for censure among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Republicans, however, oppose censure on the grounds
that the Senate does not have the constitutional authority to
punish the president, other than remove him from office. ``I don't
want anybody to use censure resolution as an excuse for not voting
the way they believe on the articles,'' said Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., who said the year-long ordeal should end with the final
up-or-down votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents, like Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, are vowing to
filibuster any censure resolution that reaches the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-backed resolution was resurgent Friday after
Senate Republicans all but abandoned their own plan to condemn the
president's misconduct within the framework of the impeachment
process, but not remove him. Democrats said the proposal was
unconstitutional, and Republicans refused to push their idea
without their support.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the Democrats' turn. Feinstein's draft largely
sidestepped the legal conclusion in the Republican ``findings of
fact'' that Clinton ``willfully provided false and misleading
testimony to a grand jury, and ``engaged in conduct to delay the
discovery and to cover up the existence of evidence and to alter
testimony related to a federal civil rights lawsuit and a U.S.
grand jury investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Bennett's request, Feinstein wrote in the following
language in one late draft to help win Republican support:
``Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United
States, gave false or misleading testimony and impeded discovery of
evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The more pointed language was aimed at persuading undecided
Republicans like Richard Lugar of Indiana, as well as Olympia Snowe
and Susan Collins, both of Maine who were authors of the findings
of fact. It was unclear Friday night whether the 20 or so Democrats
who endorsed earlier drafts would accept this new provision. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A censure resolution will pass,'' Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada,
the second-ranking Senate Democrat, flatly predicted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she had not consulted with the White House on her
draft proposal, and would not do so.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that this be the product of the Senate and
not have White House participation,'' said Feinstein, who in a
telephone interview refused to disclose any details of the plan.
``We're trying to make the strongest statement possible that the
conduct was wrongful and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, House Democrats championed a censure resolution
as an alternative to impeachment. But House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, fought to keep the resolution off the floor and, as
a result, steered many undecided Republicans toward impeachment. In
the end, the censure resolution was defeated on a procedural vote,
230-204.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democratic censure resolution borrows many ideas and
phrases from the House version. In their document, House Democrats
said Clinton ``through his actions violated the trust of the
American people and lessened their esteem for the office of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's draft resolution declares that Clinton's misconduct
``does demean the office of the president as well as the president
himself, and creates disrespect for the laws of the land.''
Clinton, the draft concludes, ``through his conduct in this matter
has violated the trust of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators said public debate and behind-the-scenes maneuvering on
censure would spill into next week, and no final decision on
language was expected until then.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol on Friday, the House managers
worked feverishly to prepare for Saturday's trial session. The
prosecutors and the White House lawyers will each have up to three
hours to make their presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and their aides were reviewing the deposition
transcripts of the three witnesses, Ms. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and
Sidney Blumenthal, and producing extensive videotaped excerpts from
those documents.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the managers, Reps. James Rogan, R-Calif., and Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., will begin by weaving videotaped images with a
narrative account, focusing first and foremost on Ms. Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to let the witnesses talk in their own words as
much as possible,'' said one House Republican aide. ``We'll start
off with a lot of Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers intend to use all but 30 minutes for their initial
presentation, the Republican aide said. The White House will then
make its case. Two other House managers, Reps. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., will use the prosecutors' final
half-hour for rebuttal.

THRIFT REPORTS LOSS ON CREDIT CARD BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- Bank Plus Corp., the parent of Fidelity Federal
Bank, reported a loss for the 1998 fiscal year due to problems in
the thrift's credit card business.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based financial services holding company lost
$56.3 &UR;  &LR; million, or $2.90 a diluted share, for the year on revenues
of $125.6 &UR;  &LR; million compared with profits of $12.7 &UR;  &LR; million (66
cents &UR;  &LR; per share) on revenues of $84.9 &UR;  &LR; million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Bank Plus made a profit of $1.1 &UR;  &LR; million
(6 cents per share) on revenues of $45.12 &UR;  &LR; million. A year ago, the
company made $1.78 &UR;  &LR; million (8 cents per share) on revenues of
$17.7 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had higher-than-expected (credit card) delinquencies and
charge-offs,'' said Neil Osborne, director of investor relations
for Bank Plus.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts were mainly held by customers with poor credit,
so-called ``subprime'' loans.
</P>
<P>
   Delinquencies rose to $75 &UR;  &LR; million by year-end from
$5.4 &UR;  &LR; million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has terminated relationships it had with two credit
card marketers who solicited these customers. But the action
resulted in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity was upset with American Direct Credit, saying the firm
didn't put up enough reserves or pay for delinquent loans more
quickly as their contract stipulated, according to filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The lawsuit was settled.
Fidelity also alleges that MMG Direct improperly solicited
accounts. The case is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Due to its problems, Bank Plus is switching strategies. It had
hoped to form an Internet bank. But a weakening of its finances
prompted it to cut costs and turn back to its thrift's roots _
single family mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Bank Plus is seeking a buyer for itself and, separately, its
credit card operations. It also adopted a stockholder rights plan
that would allow existing owners to buy more shares and thereby
thwart any hostile takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   The thrift's problems with its credit card portfolio has led to
a host of other challenges as well.
</P>
<P>
   It has had to increase its reserves for losses in these loans to
$73 &UR;  &LR; million for the year, up from $13 &UR;  &LR; million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Losses have led to a lowering of Fidelity's capital level to
``adequately capitalized'' from ``well capitalized.'' As a result,
the Office of Thrift Supervision has imposed certain restrictions
on the company that include prior regulatory approval before
increasing assets or making management changes.
</P>
<P>
   The thrift also reduced assets as well to improve its capital
ratio, which is calculated by dividing equity by total assets.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's FDIC insurance premium _ money banks and thrifts pay
to insure customer deposits _ will rise from 0.09 &UR;  &LR; percent of
deposits to 0.30 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   To improve its finances, Bank Plus has left a California Public
Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS, financial education
program. Running the program was not profitable for Bank Plus. The
CalPERS contract was transferred to an outside firm in which Bank
Plus has a minor stake.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Condon, chief executive of Bank Plus subsidiary Gateway
Investment Services, has resigned to run the CalPERS program. He
will not be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Mark K. Mason, newly appointed chief executive of Bank Plus,
will oversee Gateway.

 &HT;    King Hussein's funeral may delay trial, but airing of Lewinsky
videotape to go forward
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a new prospect of delay in President
Clinton's impeachment trial, House prosecutors will air today parts
of the videotaped testimony of Monica Lewinsky and two presidential
confidants.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 10 a.m., prosecutors will have three hours to
present the evidence they gathered in depositions this week with
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Clinton aide Sidney
Blumenthal. White House lawyers will have three hours to rebut the
prosecution's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is on track to conclude the trial Thursday or Friday,
with Clinton virtually certain to be acquitted on two impeachment
articles alleging perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the schedule probably will be revised due to the imminent
death of King Hussein of Jordan, said John Czwartacki, spokesman
for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).
</P>
<P>
   A large delegation of American leaders, including high-ranking
members of Congress, would attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Friday made public the transcripts of the three
depositions, which substantially affirm the witnesses' prior sworn
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Each side would receive three hours Monday to make closing
arguments. Then the Senate would begin final deliberations, which
could last as long as 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said that support is growing
for those deliberations to be public, reversing 131-year-old rules
that call for proceedings to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment rules are products of a bygone era, when the
Senate was a cloistered institution,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman
(D-Conn.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has not yet taken a position on the issue, having heard
good arguments on both sides, Czwartacki said. Approval by
two-thirds of the 100 senators is needed to open the proceedings.

 &HT;    Lewinsky puts best face on dealings with Clinton
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poised and confident enough to joke with her
questioner, Monica Lewinsky is more helpful than not to President
Clinton in her latest sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old former White House intern testified that she has
``mixed feelings'' about Clinton, saying that she still admires him
and the job he is doing as president.
</P>
<P>
   And when Rep. Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.) asked her about ``the first
so-called salacious occasion,'' she interrupted him, saying, ``Can
you call it something else? . . . I mean, this is my
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in her deposition released Friday, Lewinsky provoked
laughter when, asked if she considers Clinton an intelligent man,
she said, ``I think he is an intelligent president.''
</P>
<P>
   On the key question of whether the president encouraged her to
file a false affidavit denying a sexual relationship between them,
Lewinsky could not be more clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me at all,
ever,'' Lewinsky, the former White House intern, told Bryant in her
Monday deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, one of 13 House prosecutors in Clinton's impeachment
trial, persisted that perhaps the president had suggested ways she
could avoid acknowledging the relationship without committing
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky did not hedge. ``No. We never discussed perjury,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit, filed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit, is one of the critical pieces of evidence prosecutors have
used to make their case that Clinton obstructed justice by
encouraging Lewinsky to lie in the hope of escaping being called to
testify in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The public will see Lewinsky on videotape for the first time
today when prosecutors use portions of her deposition, as well as
those of Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal, to press their allegations that the president
lied under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructed justice in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, the Senate and the people of the United
States of America are going to get a chance to meet Monica Lewinsky
the person, not Monica Lewinsky as she has been described by
lawyers and `spinmeisters,' '' Rep. James Rogan (R-Calif.), a House
prosecutor, said Friday as he and his colleagues readied their
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors will find material in Lewinsky's deposition to
bolster their case. She testified, for instance, that Clinton
secretary Betty Currie called her to implement a plan to conceal
gifts Lewinsky received from Clinton, even though they had been
subpoenaed by Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any doubt in your mind that she called you to come
pick up the gifts?'' Bryant asked.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky replied, ``I don't think there is any doubt in my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie has testified that Lewinsky called her, and both Currie
and Clinton have testified that the president did not direct his
secretary to retrieve the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also can point to her re-affirmation of previous
testimony that her intimate moments with Clinton amounted to sexual
relations as defined in the Jones lawsuit. Clinton has testified
that their contact fell outside the definition.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, the Senate and the public will see a polished lawyer
who nevertheless did not hesitate to show his displeasure with some
questions from Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.), the prosecutor who
questioned him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Hutchinson quizzed Jordan about his role as a ``rain
maker,'' a lawyer who generates substantial business for his firm,
Jordan showed his impatience: ``I think even in Arkansas, you
understand what rain making is.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Jordan acted at Clinton's direction in
helping Lewinsky find a job in New York. In exchange, Lewinsky
would cooperate with Clinton against Jones' lawyers, the
prosecutors charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson wrested one concession from Jordan, getting him to
acknowledge that he breakfasted with Lewinsky at a Washington hotel
Dec. 31, 1997. Jordan had previously denied the event took place.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky contends that Jordan advised her at that breakfast to
get rid of copies of notes to Clinton that she might have at home.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers had demanded, in their subpoena to Lewinsky, that
she turn over notes she and Clinton exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan emphatically denied ever telling her to, in effect,
destroy or hide evidence. ``Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer and I'm a
loyal friend, but I'm not a fool,'' he said. Jordan added later
that ``the notion that I said to her go home and destroy notes is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, questioned on Wednesday, repeated his testimony that
Clinton confided in him in the wake of the first news reports that
mentioned Lewinsky a year ago. The president denied a relationship
with Lewinsky, insisting that he had rebuffed her sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors find Blumenthal's testimony significant because
Clinton failed to correct the story before his aide swore an oath
and repeated the false story to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal denied being the source of negative stories about
Lewinsky that Rogan and Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said came from
the White House.

JORDAN'S CROWN PRINCE CALLS HIMSELF AN EXTENSION OF HUSSEIN'S
BELIEFS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JORDAN-MIDEAST, JORDAN-ISRAEL, JORDAN-ASSESS,
JORDAN-HUSSEIN) 
(fe) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  AMMAN, Jordan _ Jordan's next government will remain committed
to peace in the Middle East and close relations with Washington but
wary of both Iran and Iraq, Crown Prince Abdullah said this week in
his first interview since he was designated successor to his
father, King Hussein. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an extension of his majesty's outlook and his majesty's
beliefs,'' said the 37-year-old brigadier general, in speech that
was British in tone but American in rhythm and vernacular. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interview with several visiting foreign reporters took place
on Thursday in Raghadan Palace, on an off-the-record basis. But
Friday night, as Hussein's death appeared imminent, the prince's
aides authorized publication of the wide-ranging conversation,
which they said was intended in part to set the record straight on
the circumstances of his selection two weeks ago to replace his
uncle as crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Crown Prince Abdullah discussed his nuanced
views of other regional diplomatic challenges; his strained
relationship with his uncle, the former Crown Prince Hassan, and
his vision of the future of the Jordanian monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest immediate internal concern, it seems, is to close
family ranks behind him as he prepares to take the throne just
weeks after his father unceremoniously deposed Hassan after 34
years as Hussein's designated successor.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah said he learned of his father's decision just
one day before it was announced publicly and the king left Jordan
for a second bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   He denied published reports that he had flown secretly to
Minnesota in the fall to complain to his father about Hassan, who
was then crown prince. All the king's 12 children visited him
during the six months he spent being treated abroad, he said, and
he had stayed for a few days at the end of September and early
October.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah said he greatly admired his uncle, Hassan; had
frequently turned to him for counsel, and was confident that his
uncle would play a senior advisory role in the new regime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an issue between two brothers,'' Prince Abdullah
said. Hussein wanted ``to have the legitimacy go back into his
line,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet shortly after the prince returned from his visit to his
father at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, he gave a rare interview to
an Arab-language weekly noting that he had been crown prince
himself until he was 3 and that there was nothing to prevent
reverting to the traditional line of succession _ the first
indication to palace-watchers here that such a change was being
contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   And in that interview, Prince Abdullah made it clear that he too
thought Hassan had recently been too much the acting king, and not
enough the loyal deputy. ``The role of a crown prince should be to
keep a low profile,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man who will be king of Jordan is a personable career
military officer with his father's quick smile and unfeigned
modesty. He shares as well his father's deep distrust of Shiite
radicalism, unfettered democracy and other perceived threats to the
stability of Jordan and the survival of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is quite unlike Hussein, he acknowledged, in the
circumstances of his ascension to the throne and in his
relationships with his peers in the region, whose fathers were in
many cases mortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Externally, he wants above all to reassure the world that the
succession in Amman will not change the foreign policy crafted so
carefully by Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's desire for a permanent peace between ``our friends in
Israel and our friends in the PNA,'' the Palestinian National
Authority, will remain its chief diplomatic priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when discussing the delicately balanced Jordanian policy
toward Iraq, Crown Prince Abdullah seemed somewhat closer to the
American position. His father supported Iraq, Jordan's neighbor and
major trading partner, when other nations were arrayed against Iraq
during the Persian Gulf War and has since been a critic of U.N.
sanctions against Saddam Hussein &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The prince said that Saddam still poses a threat to Kuwait and
that Jordan would support a ``change'' in Iraq's regime. He said he
agreed with U.S. policymakers that there ``no hope'' that Saddam
could be tamed or would voluntarily change his policies. ``We are
on the same sheet of music, so to speak,'' he said, referring to
his discussions on Iraq here last week with Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran poses a more serious destabilizing threat to the
region, he said, warning that the liberalizing forces represented
by President Mohammed Khatami remain very much a minority.
</P>
<P>
   Belying his image as a political novice, he spoke confidently
and knowledgeably of the diverse pressures facing his country and
its neighbors and used candor and charm to challenge the widespread
notion that his sudden ascension had strained relations within the
royal family.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to emphasize the practical utility to a future
monarch of his army career, which began with eight years in desert
bases ``in the middle of nowhere,'' but more recently made him the
country's chief military envoy. He is comfortable with ordinary
Jordanians, because he has lived like an ordinary Jordanian
soldier, he said. And he has developed a close circle of
professional friends in the armies of Israel, the Persian Gulf
states and the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be one indication of Prince Abdullah's world-view that he
spoke especially warmly of his friendships in other royal families
in the Arab world, and sympathetically of their desires to fight
Islamic fundamentalism and retain some of their dynastic
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them shared American educations and an American belief
in free-market economics, he noted. ``We went to the same
schools,'' said the prince, who attended prep school at Deerfield
Academy in Massachusetts and went on to study at Sandhurst, the
elite British military college. ``We ate in the same restaurants.
We like the same movies. We have a lot in common, and we have all
become very good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a wife, Princess Rania, a Palestinian, whom he married in
1993, and they have a son, Prince Hussein, and a daughter, Princess
Iman.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting himself as a modern monarch-in-waiting whose goal is
liberalize the economy and open up the political system, Prince
Abdullah demurred when asked if the dynasty might, under his reign,
subordinate its near-feudal power to a constitutionally protected
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is not something that can be done overnight,'' he
said. ``It is a learning experience. It is also a discipline.
Because we have a democracy, it doesn't mean that people can take
things into their own hands.''

NEW JERSEY IN BATTLE WITH ARMY OVER PARKING TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ In its battle with this city over unpaid
parking tickets, the U.S. military is finding that its record
keeping is not in a high state of readiness: it does not appear to
have a log of who was driving the offending cars and cannot explain
why the Army paid tickets and fines with a U.S. Treasury check to
release an impounded car.
</P>
<P>
   The battle began last spring, when the Hackensack police, tired
of Army, Air Force and Marine recruiters persistently parking
illegally, impounded seven government-owned cars that had accrued
thousand of dollars in tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Faith S. Hochberg is suing for
the return of the three cars that remain impounded, contending that
local police have no legal authority to seize federal property to
compel payment of outstanding fines.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials have said that if they could determine which
recruiters were assigned cars on the days those cars were ticketed,
they would hold the individuals responsible for the tickets. But
the Pentagon acknowledged Friday that its search for the military
recruiters-turned-scofflaws here has been frustrating because of
loose record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Guy Shields, said that apparently
no precise logs were kept at the Hackensack office on who was using
a particular car on a given day. He said the Army's Recruiting
Command has been ordered to tighten up record keeping on automobile
use at all of its stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we still have a lot of questions and not a lot
of answers,'' Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   Shields also said the Pentagon wants to know how an Army
official obtained _ apparently improperly _ a Treasury check for
$1,359 to pay tickets and fines on one of the cars that the police
had impounded.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the Pentagon ordered the Recruiting Command in Fort
Knox, Ky., to find out who issued the check and why. Shields said
it was illegal to use federal funds to pay the fines.
</P>
<P>
   Hackensack's police chief, Charles Zisa, revealed the $1,359
Treasury check on Tuesday, when he questioned why the government
later claimed it was immune from the fines.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting Friday with three Army officers from the
Recruiting Command and officials of the General Services
Administration, which owns the cars, Ms. Hochberg asked the Army to
determine how the check was issued, a spokesman, Michael Drewniak,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extremely stern, insisting that the Army take all
corrective action to insure that individual wrong-doers pay their
tickets and that no taxpayer money be wasted covering up for
them,'' Drewniak said.

CLINTON TRIAL WITNESSES OFFER NO NEW EVIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (REPEATING to correct coding)  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-TEXT, IMPEACH-HUTCHINSON,

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The three witnesses called by House managers to
resuscitate the Senate's impeachment trial gave little ground this
week and offered no new evidence against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers had hoped the three witnesses that the Senate
allowed them to depose _ Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
and Sidney Blumenthal _ would add new drama and fresh evidence to
keep their case alive. But their sworn testimony, taken earlier
this week and released on Friday, shows that rather than
strengthening or clarifying the central issues in the case, the
witnesses seemed intent on saying little, if anything, that would
give the House managers additional fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaped portions of their testimony will be shown to the
Senate on Saturday, when the trial resumes, giving the public its
first image of Ms. Lewinsky as more than a disembodied voice on
tapes or a silent figure fleeing from a media pack.
</P>
<P>
   The managers failed to persuade the Senate to allow witnesses to
appear in person. After Saturday's presentations by the House
prosecutors and the White House lawyers, the trial will move to
closing arguments and could be over by late next week. The failure
of the three witnesses to provide new information was part of the
Senate's decision to skip live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, in particular, repeatedly refused opportunities to
pass judgments on the president, declining to discuss his motives
or to characterize the truthfulness of his prior testimony. While
she said she now had ``mixed feelings'' about Clinton, she would
not elaborate on what her reservations about him were and said she
admired the job he had done as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you need to know is that my grand jury testimony
is truthful irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings are,''
she responded when pressed to describe her current attitude toward
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans had hoped to make Ms. Lewinsky their star
witness, the former White House intern carefully hewed to her
earlier testimony before the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
grand jury, stating that the president had never told her to lie
and never encouraged her to file a false affidavit in the sexual
misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones. While the
prosecutors hoped the testimony would highlight a distraught and
vulnerable young woman and embarrass Clinton, she was cool, focused
and composed, frequently asking her chief questioner to sharpen or
rephrase his questions.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Washington lawyer and Clinton confidant, was deemed by
House managers to be pivotal to proving the obstruction-of-justice
charges against the president. But he too disappointed. And his
testimony conflicted with Ms. Lewinsky's when he denied telling her
to destroy copies of notes she had drafted to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have alleged that the president enlisted
Jordan to help to get a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York to buy her
silence in the Jones case. Both Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan denied that
the job help was linked to her filing an affidavit in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   On several other crucial points, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony
remained at odds with the president's. Last August, Clinton
testified that he told Ms. Lewinsky she would have to turn over
gifts he had given her to the Jones lawyers. Pressed on this point
by Rep. Ed Bryant, the Tennessee Republican who led the House
managers' questioning of the former White House intern, Ms.
Lewinsky replied that she had no recollection of the president
telling her to turn over the gifts. ``Not that I remember,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she was certain that the president's secretary, Betty
Currie, had initiated the retrieval of the gifts after they were
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. The House managers have charged
that Ms. Currie must have acted at the president's behest, but Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony did little to clarify the point.
</P>
<P>
   In the testimony Ms. Lewinsky gave at a Washington hotel on
Monday, Ms. Lewinsky told Bryant that Mrs. Currie called her about
the gifts. ``I remember her saying either I know you have something
for me or the president said you have something for me,'' Ms.
Lewinsky said. Mrs. Currie had testified previously that Ms.
Lewinsky initiated the gift retrieval and the president tesified
that he was not concerned about the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said she could have been mistaken about the time
she received a call from Mrs. Currie. In the president's defense,
Clinton's lawyers have emphasized that records of the call show it
came later than the time Ms. Lewinsky testified Mrs. Currie stopped
by to get the gifts. House managers declined to include Ms. Currie
on their witness list, fearing she would hurt rather than help
their case.
</P>
<P>
   The president also denied touching Ms. Lewinsky in a manner that
fit the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case, a key
point in the article of impeachment charging the president with
perjury. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony before Starr's grand jury
included detailed descriptions of her sexual encounters with the
president, with some activity that would have fallen within the
Jones definition of sexual relations. But when Bryant tried to
press Ms. Lewinsky on whether the president had lied, her lawyers
objected and Ms. Lewinsky responded tersely that she did not ``feel
comfortable characterizing whether what he said was truthful or not
truthful. I know I've testified to what I believe is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's largely polished and understated testimony did provide
a moment of drama when he was asked by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, another
House manager, whether he had told Ms. Lewinsky to destroy drafts
and copies of love notes she had written the president. Jordan
coldly told the Arkansas Republican, ``Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer
and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm not a fool, and the notion that I
would suggest to anybody that they destroy anything just defies
anything that I know about myself. So the notion that I said to her
go home and destroy notes is ridiculous.'' Jordan did confirm that
he had a breakfast meeting with Ms. Lewinsky on Dec. 31, 1997, at
which they discussed the notes, an encounter he did not recall in
earlier testimony before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The third witness, the White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, was
asked about a discussion he had with Clinton shortly after the
Lewinsky scandal broke in the news media. Blumenthal testified that
the president told him that he had tried to minister to a troubled
young woman and that Ms. Lewinsky had made demands on him and that
he had rebuffed her. Blumenthal repeated elements of this
conversation to Starr's grand jury, and the House managers alleged
the president was trying to influence his grand jury testimony.

</P>
<P>
   Another central episode in the obstruction of justice charges
against the president involves a phone call Clinton made to Ms.
Lewinsky in the middle of the night on Dec. 17, 1997. During the
conversation Clinton informed Ms. Lewinsky that her name was on the
witness list in the Jones case and suggested that she could file an
affidavit to avoid being deposed in the lawsuit. The House managers
contend the president encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false
affidavit denying their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But she gave them no help on this point, insisting that ``there
was no discussion of what would be in the affidavit,'' and adding,
``I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would have
to be false.''
</P>
<P>
   During one testy exchange with Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky refused to
agree with his premise that it would have been against the
president's interest for Ms. Lewinsky to file a truthful affdavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really comfortable,'' she responded. ``I mean, I can
tell you what would have been in my best interest, but I ...''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant cut her off with another question, saying, ``But you
didn't file the affidavit in your best interest, did you?`` to
which Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``Uh, actually, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   She did say during her conversation with the president about the
affdavit that she began thinking herself of denying a sexual
relationship, because they had always used ``cover stories'' to
conceal their affair. And while she said the president never told
her to lie, Bryant also asked her whether Clinton had ever
cautioned her to tell the truth. ``Not that I can recall,'' Ms.
Lewinsky responded.
</P>
<P>
   In another exchange with Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky used legalistic
language that was reminiscent of the president's grand jury
testimony. Asked if their cover stories would be misleading to the
Jones lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``They were literally true,
but they would be misleading.'' In his grand jury testimony,
Clinton said his goal in the Jones deposition was ``to be truthful,
but not particularly helpful.''

PATAKI PAINTS HIMSELF AS PHILOSOPHICAL HEIR TO REAGAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Taking his bid for national recognition to the
Midwest, New York Gov. George Pataki sought to portray himself
Friday as a philosophical heir to Ronald Reagan. He said the
Republican Party had gone in the wrong direction, and urged
Republicans to ``reclaim those great conservative values'' invoked
by Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party must now re-embrace Ronald Reagan's
principles _principles that have won complete support and agreement
from one end of our party to the other,'' the governor said in an
address at the University of Chicago Law School here. Pataki told
his audience that the Republican Party was ``the most
intellectually and philosophically serious party,'' but warned that
it had, in recent years, drifted from its ideological touchstones.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has ``gone down some roads that it didn't
have to go down, and missed some roads it should have taken,''
Pataki said. ``Some of them have been real opportunities.'' Other
than saying that Republican leaders ``have seemed and sounded
angry,'' the governor was not specific in his speech, but in recent
weeks he has been openly critical of his party's focus on
impeachment and on contentious social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The speech by Pataki, who was sworn in to a second term last
month, marked the first of what he said would be a series of
national speeches intended to lay out his view of what the party
should be doing. Pataki's advisers have said that the governor
would like to be considered for vice president or president in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has declined to comment on his own political plans.
However, his speech here Friday _ coming after a series of
interviews and television appearances designed to drum up interest
in him _ strongly suggested that Pataki and his advisers had given
more than a little thought to how the Republican Party might
reclaim the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Pataki warmly embraced Reagan, speaking
enthusiastically about the conservative economic positions espoused
by the former president, like cutting government spending and taxes
and reducing government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of his support for abortion rights, a
position that might give him trouble among the socially
conservative Republican primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's remarks here did not draw any expressions of surprise.
But Pataki did leaven the speech with a degree of personal
reflection and introspection that was unusual for a man who has
typically confined his addresses to matters of state governance.
</P>
<P>
   What he did not do was provide any hint of whether he would try
to run for national office, either in 2000 or later. He stuck to
the stance that he has often adopted in recent months: He is
interested simply in redirecting a party that has gone astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy being governor of New York,'' he told reporters
after the 30-minute speech to the law school's chapter of the
Federalist Society, a conservative group. ``I think it's important,
though, that we have a strong and positive national message.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pataki's attempt to wrap himself in the legacy of Reagan, the
most popular Republican figure in a generation, seemed designed, in
part, to blur the differences he has with his party on many issues.
No matter how often he invokes Reagan, Pataki remains at odds with
the dominant wing of his party on social issues ranging from
abortion to gay rights. In fact, while Pataki said Friday that
government should ``lightly'' regulate family life, his views on
social issues clash with those of Reagan, who opposed abortion and
was backed by conservative Christian groups.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the governor made no mention of his contrasting
views with Reagan, choosing instead to refer to the former
president as a kind of idealized figure beloved by Republicans and
Americans of all political stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki explained how the former president had influenced him,
harkening back to the mid-1960s when he heard Reagan give a speech
on the ``conscience of his conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had a huge impact on me, my thinking, my philosophy on
government, and the views I hold dear today,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his frequent references to Reagan, Pataki spoke of
Abraham Lincoln's role in shaping his party, and he said
Republicans had erred in not becoming leaders of the civil rights
movement in the 1960s. He closed his speech with a call for party
leaders to be less contentious in their dealings with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of freedom,'' he said, ``and when you believe
in freedom you by definition accept the idea that different people
will make different choices, even ones that we may not fully
approve of.''

EDWARDS DISLOCATES KNEE, MAYBE '99 SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO AND PAT BIGOLD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Robert Edwards may be lost for the 1999 season after
undergoing surgery to repair a dislocated left knee suffered during
a flag football game on Waikiki Beach Friday, according to two
Patriots officials.
</P>
<P>
   The running ck from Georgia, who gained 1,115 yards in 1998
after being New England's first draft choice, was hurt while
defending a pass in the Rookie Beach Bowl, a five-on-five game that
is one of the preliminaries for Sunday's Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the AFC, Edwards went up with teammate Charles
Woodson of the Oakland Raiders to try to deflect a pass by Detroit
Lions quarterback Charlie Batch intended for San Francisco 49er
R.W. McQuarters.
</P>
<P>
   The dislocation was so severe that it injured an artery, and
Edwards underwent surgery at Straub Medical Center by an
NFL-approved orthopedic specialist. Further details were
unavailable, but two Patriots officials, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said Edwards's 1999 season is in jeopardy. He is
expected to spend several days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots issued a statement from coach Pete Carroll, who
said, ``We are still collecting information as to the specifics and
the extent of the injury. Obviously, we are very concerned about
Robert. We are anxious to bring him back to New England so our
doctors can evaluate him and start the rehabilitation process.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible the Patriots will have to consider again drafting
a running back in the first round in April or try for one in free
agency, where there are few of quality this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the play on which he was hurt, Edwards did not get
up, lying in the sand for several minutes at the edge of the field.
He was finally carried off, to the applause of the huge crowd that
surrounded the makeshift arena between the Hilton Hawaiian Village
resort and the US Army's Ft. DeRussy Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots strong safety Lawyer Milloy, who was not at the game,
said his mother watched it and described Edwards as being in severe
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blow this is for us,'' said Milloy. ``It's such a
freaky thing. We play a violent game, but he survived that and then
he gets hurt in the sand playing touch football. It's a shame. I
don't know how badly he's hurt, but hopefully, he can recover in
time for the season. If he can't, we have to go out and get
somebody. That's an important position. If I had to, I'd line up
back there and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no medical tent, a buffet table under a canopy
just off the field was cleared and Edwards was placed on it. He was
examined by the attending physician, James Scoggin, an orthopedist.
A New York Jets trainer was also in attendance, according to an NFL
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jumped, and when he landed, it happened,'' said Pittsburgh
Steelers running back Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala, who was on the AFC
sideline when the accident occurred. ``He and Woodson went up to
pick off the ball, but I think Woodson landed on his leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson didn't think he landed on Edwards's leg but acknowledged
that the two were going for the ball.

WHEN A MAGAZINE EDITOR GOES, EVERYBODY KNOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rumors of his imminent dismissal had been burning
white hot all over town for weeks. But Michael Caruso, editor in
chief of Details magazine, did not let on that he thought he was
about to lose his job. His ``numbers'' _ for newsstand sales and
for ad pages _ were up. Caruso even told the news media, ``My
numbers are so good, they are going to be giving me a big fat
raise.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Caruso there was no peace. The rumors kept churning. And
then on Monday, The New York Post reported that a rival magazine
editor was being considered for Caruso's job.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be right on the mark. That morning, James
Truman, the editorial director of Conde Nast, asked for Caruso's
resignation, and the rival, Mark Golin, the editor in chief of
Maxim magazine, got his job. (But Caruso got to keep the jukebox in
his office.)
</P>
<P>
   Caruso's editorial demise at Details embodied the often
ritualized proceedings that accompany a magazine editor's dismissal
in the media playground of Manhattan. It is almost operatic. First
the chorus begins to whisper. Then the bassi profundi do battle.
Finally the fat lady sings.
</P>
<P>
   As Caruso puts it, the experience of being fired from Conde Nast
was like ``being the special of the day in a restaurant with an
open kitchen _ you're fricasseed in public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, I got more attention in the last two days
than I did in the last two years at Details,'' Caruso said.
</P>
<P>
   New York is a series of small towns, and the magazine world is
about the size of a neighborhood block party, so it is virtually
impossible to fire any editor from a magazine without someone _
other than the editor in question _ hearing about it first.
</P>
<P>
   Because the industry is so small and so densely populated with
natural-born gossips, being fired in the magazine world takes on
the air of a public flogging. So it is only natural that the
potential news of an editor's dismissal ripples across the tables
at the Four Seasons faster than you can say ``Julian, a tricolore
salad, please.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three weeks in particular have been volatile in the
editorial trenches: In addition to Caruso at Details, editors at
George, Spin and Gourmet have been given pink slips.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rich history and a deep lore that accompanies the
act, and much of it involves Conde Nast. Perhaps the most dramatic
and oft-repeated example is Grace Mirabella's departure from Vogue
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   On a June evening, the gossip columnist Liz Smith appeared on
``Live at Five'' on WNBC and announced that Ms. Mirabella, the
editor in chief of Vogue, was out of a job. Ms. Mirabella and her
husband, Dr. William Cahan, happened to be watching television, and
that is how Ms. Mirabella learned that the chairman of Conde Nast,
S.I. Newhouse Jr., had replaced her with Anna Wintour, the still
reigning editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Mirabella's 1995 memoir, ``In and Out of Vogue''
(Doubleday), she wrote, ``For a magazine devoted to style, this was
not a very stylish way of telling me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the case of Elizabeth Mitchell, the executive editor of
George magazine _ that is, until Jan. 11 _ the infernolike period
lasted a week. On Jan. 6, she found out through the news media that
her boss, John F. Kennedy Jr., was shopping around for an executive
editor. She resigned a week later.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan 19, Michael Hirschorn, the editor in chief of Spin _ that
is, until Jan. 19 _ was taken by surprise when Robert Miller, the
president and chief executive of Miller Publishing Group, summoned
him to a breakfast meeting and, after fruit and coffee, gazed
meaningfully at his editor and told him it was time to ``make some
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hirschorn's case, because there was no public prelude, the
most gruesome part of being fired, he said, was the period
immediately after his last breakfast with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody calls up with professions of sympathy,'' he said,
``and then they say, `Tell me exactly how it happened.' It's sort
of like passing a car wreck. `Where was it? What were you eating?
What was the expression on his face? How disingenuous was the
encounter?'''
</P>
<P>
   When Kurt Andersen was the editor of New York magazine, rumors
circulated for months before he was fired by the executive vice
president at the time, Harry McQuillen (the magazine's owner,
Primedia, was then called K-III Communications Corp.). It was
reported that Henry Kravis, a partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP;
Co., the buyout firm that controls Primedia, was not happy with
Andersen's tenacious Wall Street coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose a day to fire him, then realized we couldn't,'' said
a Primedia executive who insisted on anonymity. ``Because we found
out it was his birthday. So we waited a week.'' (Andersen's
birthday is Aug. 22. He was fired on Aug. 29, 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   And what of the reporters who make editors into martyrs? When
they deliver the bad news to unwitting victims, do they suffer?
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kelly, a reporter at The New York Post who often beheads
his victims before their bosses do, does not suffer. ``If they get
fired from some place like Conde Nast, they're going to be fairly
well taken care of,'' he said, referring to the company's often
generous severance packages. ``It's not like it's the police beat,
and you have to tell people that someone has died.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith had a brief skirmish with her conscience, but ran with
the story about Ms. Mirabella anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have held off if I had known they didn't know,'' Ms.
Smith said. ``It's a horrible thing to learn something drastic
about yourself in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``It was a great scoop, and it did kind of go
down in history even though I didn't intend it to.''

CITING `ROAD RAGE,' JUDGE SENTENCES TYSON TO A YEAR IN PRISON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ The former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was
sentenced to a year in jail Friday for assaulting two men after a
minor traffic accident last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Montgomery County District Court Judge Stephen
P. Johnson, who called the assault ``a potentially lethal example
of road rage,'' could mean further jail time in Indiana, where
Tyson is still on probation for a 1991 rape conviction, and puts
Tyson's boxing career in jeopardy once again.
</P>
<P>
   A hushed murmur went through the packed courtroom as Johnson
handed down his sentence to a seemingly stunned Tyson, who had pled
no contest to the two charges of misdemeanor assault on Dec. 1.
Tyson's wife, Monica Turner, who had made a tearful plea during
Friday's sentencing hearing that Tyson not be sent to jail, put her
face in her hands as Johnson read the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson refused to issue bond and Tyson was led away in
handcuffs, two pair of cuffs linked together being required to
place Tyson's hands behind his back. He was taken to the Montgomery
County jail in Rockville where he was fingerprinted and processed.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 32, faced up to 10 years on each count of second degree
misdemeanor assault stemming from the incident in Gaithersburg, Md.
Johnson sentenced him to two years on each count, to run
concurrently, but suspended all but one year of jail time. He could
serve as little as six to seven months with time off for good
behavior, according to Douglas Gansler, the Montgomery County
prosecutor who pushed for jail time. Tyson also received a $2,500
fine on each count and 200 hours of community service and continued
anger-management therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has 30 days to appeal the sentence, but doing so would
open him to a jury trial where a conviction would bring a minimum
sentence of three to seven years, according to Maryland sentencing
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence came despite a plea agreement negotiated with the
original prosecutor in the case, Robert Dean, in which Dean agreed
to recommend no jail time in return for the no-contest plea.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, in his most recent comeback, Tyson knocked
out Francois Botha in the fifth round of a heavyweight bout in Las
Vegas. That came after a a 19-month layoff following the revocation
of his boxing license for biting both of Evander Holyfield's ears
during a fight on June 28, 1997. Friday, Johnson apparently imposed
another exile on Tyson. Tyson's next bout is scheduled for April 24
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson did not comment as he was led away. His lawyer, Kemp, and
his advisor, Shelly Finkel, also had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson now faces the possibility that his probation in Indiana,
where he served half of a six-year sentence, could be revoked. That
decision will be made by Marion County Superior Court Judge
Patricia Gifford, who presided over Tyson's trial and subsequent
conviction for raping a beauty pageant contestant, Desiree
Washington, in Indianapolis in 1991. His probation in that case is
set to expire in March.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said that Tyson would serve his time in Maryland first
and then go to Indiana for a hearing on the revocation of his
probation.
</P>
<P>
   George Walker, Tyson's probation officer in Indiana, could not
be reached for comment Friday night. But he has already prepared a
report to Gifford which calls for the revocation of probation if
Tyson were to receive jail time in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the possibility that Tyson's boxing license,
which he regained on Oct. 19, would be revoked again by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission. When it was given back to Tyson, Dr.
Elias Ghanem, the chairman of the commission, said it was
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kizer, a Nevada assistant attorney general, said that
Tyson's jail sentence did not automatically mean that his boxing
license would be revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal issue for us is, has he done anything to bring
discredit on the sport of boxing?'' Kizer said. ``You have to
remember that he is licensed to box through 1999. If he wants to
box in 2000, he will have to reapply before the end of the year.
Whether he gets a license to box in 2000 is solely within the
discretion of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is still incarcerated in Maryland or if he is
incarcerated in Indiana by the end of the year, then it all becomes
a moot point.''
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said Friday that he thought the sentence was fair in
light of Tyson's previous rape conviction. He said it struck a blow
against indiscriminate road rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither me or anybody else in Montgomery County asked Mr.
Tyson to get out of his car in a minor fender bender and assault
two people that he did not know,'' Gansler said. ``That is
something that he, and other defendants like him, need to think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as they did in boxing license hearings in New Jersey and
Nevada, Tyson's lawyers, led by Kemp, put a parade of witnesses on
the stand during the sentencing hearing to attest to Tyson's caring
and loving attitude and his shaky financial status. Through
testimony from Finkel, they tried to show that Tyson's boxing
career would suffer irreparable damage if he went to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's lawyers argued that his boxing license would be revoked
by Nevada and that he would not be able to box anywhere in the
United States because of reciprocal agreements between states.
Carol Crawford, an assistant prosecutor, said that Tyson would
still be able to box in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's friend Patti described how Tyson was still supporting
93-year-old Camile Ewald, the house mother at the Catskills home
where the trainer Cus D'Amato took in Tyson and Patti as youths.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Tyson choked back tears while talking about how
devastating a jail sentence would be to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is a good, kindhearted person and he doesn't
deserve one minute of time for what occurred,'' she said. ``He's
got his life together now. He had no intentions of hurting those
gentlemen or anybody else in society. I hope that everybody is
fair.''

TEXAS DEFEATS NO. 1 SOUTHERN CAL

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Facing the top-ranked team in the nation
yesterday, the Texas Longhorns were hit with the news that victory
would have to be achieved the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for the first time in 25 years, a Texas team took the
field armed with wooden bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' coach Augie Garrido said, ``it was certainly a lot
quieter during batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But it worked out rather well for the Longhorns (3-0), who
defeated defending national champion Southern California, which is
ranked No. 1 by Baseball America, 5-3, in the opener of a
three-game series at Disch-Falk Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (1-1) arrived with two sets of bats, but were unable
to use their new aluminum bats because the Pacific-10 required the
bat company, Louisville Slugger, to forward a liability release
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   The document arrived late yesterday, and the teams will use
aluminum bats for the remainder of the series _ scheduled to resume
at 1 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to invite everyone to a barbecue,'' Garrido said.
``We're having smoked Louisville Slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke about a half-dozen before the game started, and we
didn't know what the hell to do. If this continues, a lot of trees
will be cut down, and that's not a popular idea in this town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, I really like them. This is the way the game should
be played.''
</P>
<P>
   In Garrido's view, this means pitching and defense _ and the
Longhorns got both yesterday. Three Texas pitchers _ Scott Dunn,
D.J. Jones and Phil Seibel _ limited the Trojans to seven hits and
two earned runs while striking out 12.
</P>
<P>
   And in the ninth, with a man on and USC All-American Eric Munson
at the plate, Seibel induced a ground ball, and the defense turned
a double play to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will help our confidence,'' Garrido said. ``We
did a lot of good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of these came from Dunn, who gave up one earned run and
fanned eight in six innings. He caught Munson looking at a called
third strike with two on to end the second and ended a
fourth-inning threat with another called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   A triple by Tommy Nicholson launched a two-run third off USC
starter Rik Currier _ another potential All-American _ and Jeff
Ontiveros drove in two more in the fourth with a double into the
left-field corner. The final Texas run came in the sixth when Ben
Emond pushed a run-scoring single through a hole vacated by the USC
shortstop on an attempted pickoff play.

SPORTS COLUMN: TYSON NEEDS PROTECTION FROM HIMSELF

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The jail sentence was not merely punishment for the offense. It
was also an attempt to avoid more carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson has done more damage with his incisors in the ring
than he did to a couple of older motorists after a minor traffic
accident last year. He punched one man in the face and kicked
another in the groin, and they lived to settle out of court.
</P>
<P>
   They were lucky, because Tyson's fists are a lethal weapon by
definition, and so is his temper, by empirical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has been heading in this direction since he was a child in
the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. He has acknowledged mugging
neighborhood women trudging home with a few worn bills tucked into
their frayed purses, perhaps lugging all the groceries they could
afford or carry. He did not just grab the purse or the groceries
but inflicted damage upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Next time he might kill somebody, so it is necessary to give him
a rematch with the heavy doors that give an ominous clang when they
are locked tight behind a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's anger is still ticking. In his next round behind bars _
effectively, six months before parole might kick in _ perhaps he
will avail himself of the counseling and the sedatives that did not
do the job the first time.
</P>
<P>
   He has been used badly by the promoter Don King and other
mercenaries in his life, but he has also had treatment for anger
and chemical help for depression. Nothing has worked. Perhaps this
time it will.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he is a menace to society, an old-fashioned term
perhaps but totally appropriate in this case. There are no
political ramifications here. Mike Tyson is an equal-opportunity
menace.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is about boxing, by the way. Who cares if Mike
Tyson, now 32, ever fights again? It does not matter what his
physical condition might be in six months, assuming the state of
Indiana does not call him back for parole violation. The real
concern is what happens to random strangers, motorists or women who
run afoul of his random anger.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Mike Tyson's terrible state is not the fault of
boxing. Yes, this brutal business should be abolished, because
society should not be paying two human beings to injure each other.
But as ugly as it is, boxing did not create the demons that make
Tyson lose control and attempt to hurt other people.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing does, in fact, help turn some tough kids into decent
adults, although the ultimate physical damage is far too high to
justify its existence. Tyson was heading for a life of violence,
and boxing did not help him.
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes who break the law get off easy. A few are given
harsh sentences because a judge works up indignation that these
people are, you should pardon the expression, role models, and
somehow let society down. Nobody expects Mike Tyson to be a role
model, not with his long and frightening rap sheet.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible for anybody _ judges included _ to forget that
Tyson is a prominent athlete, once the heavyweight champion of the
world. Everybody knows about the chunks of ears he chewed from
Evander Holyfield in the ring. Everybody knows about the first
prison sentence, for rape.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence that Tyson received Friday was necessary to put a
dangerous and troubled human being back under the control of the
state. He was already on parole when he was riding in a car driven
by his wife, Monica, and it was hit from behind in what is normally
described as a fender-bender. Unfortunately, there is little normal
about this sad and angry man, who reacted physically to the two
men. It could have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   After the childhood muggings, he was said to have struck his
first wife. Then he was convicted of assault toward women who
spurned his advances, and he was sent to jail in Indiana for the
rape of a young woman who had foolishly gone to his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   This is all public record, part of the history that the judge in
Maryland had to consider yesterday. Beyond the legal history, there
are the recorded observations of Tyson, sullen and cynical and
withdrawn one moment, then visibly angry the next moment.
</P>
<P>
   A few people who stand to make money off Tyson criticized the
sentence Friday. They are the latest in a long line of apologists
who needed him; Mike Tyson was not getting better in their company.
Assault is frightening. Rape is hideous. The next incident could
very well be lethal. Mike Tyson badly needs help, but it must start
in a secure place.

N.Y. COLUMN: STANDING TALL ON BEHALF OF A UNION
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Compared with the Twin Towers, Carlos Guzman and
Dominick Bentivegna looked tiny as they approached the entrance of
5 World Trade Center on Thursday. They're the kind of working
stiffs New Yorkers notice vaguely, if at all _ Guzman is a janitor
at the World Trade Center while Bentivegna is a doorman on
Manhattan's Upper East Side. Bit players in the service economy,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Last week they agreed to drop a $2.4 million
lawsuit against the leadership of Local 32B-32J, the city's
maintenance workers union, on the condition that its president, Gus
Bevona, resign. Bevona, one of the nation's highest-paid labor
officials at $450,000 a year, had resisted dissident challenges in
both courts and elections. The dissidents' most recent lawsuit
accused him of misusing union funds to pay his legal and
re-election expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents, led by Guzman and Bentivegna as co-chairmen of
Members for a Better Union, had scored court victories before. They
also said they had faced harassment and intimidation from those
loyal to Bevona. At one point, Guzman lived like Yasser Arafat,
nervously sleeping in a different home every night after private
detectives hired by the union staked out his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the intifada they waged against the union they thought was
supposed to represent them has ended, and the union is being run by
a trustee. The dissident duo have gone from being little guys to
VIPs. They were entering a Trade Center building when Paul Vance, a
maintenance worker, stopped taping rain mats to the floor, looked
up and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a big shot now,'' said Vance, who hugged Guzman. ``Good
job, man! It's about time. Maybe now we can get working rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The greeting was a simple act of solidarity, a reminder that
unions can still mean something more than an automatic payroll
deduction. Guzman's expectation that his dues entitled him to his
union's respect and support prompted him to question Bevona's
salary and lavish penthouse headquarters (complete with a bank of
televisions that monitored other offices) and especially the
union's reluctance to defend its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union did nothing,'' said Guzman, 51. ``The majority of
people in this industry come from other countries. The only thing
they have is this job and they have to support a family with it.
The employers know that and abuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's decision to go after the union's leadership was not out
of character, even for a janitor who was more used to working in
empty offices. He was politicized in his native Ecuador, where a
military junta ruled the country during the early 1960s. ``When I
was 15, we were fighting dictators over there,'' he said. ``The
soldiers had guns and bullets; we just had stones to throw at them.
We'd go to City Hall and protest. Somebody would die. Then we'd go
to the cemetery and protest again. I grew up fighting injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentivegna, 38, grew up in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst looking
forward to getting a union card the way others anticipate getting
into the right club. ``All the jobs I ever had, I always wanted to
get into `The Union,''' he said. ``Any union. You'd see the papers
and you'd see how the union did this and the union did that. If you
had a problem, you'd call the union. It was larger than life. I'd
like to see that come back to 32B, that if you call the union, the
boss is going to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   He had joined Guzman in 1993 when the union did little about his
complaints that his supervisor used racial slurs against his Latino
and black colleagues. Since then, the two of them have shared a
bond that offers some hope for the city's future: an
Italian-American doorman joining forces with a Ecuadorean janitor
in a union filled with immigrants and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised to respect people,'' Bentivegna said. ``There is
no why. It's like asking why do you want to be a good person?''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman interrupted. ``It was assigned to you,'' Guzman joked.
``Like Moses. This is your calling. Free your people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentivegna continued. ``I look at everybody in this union and I
see only two things,'' he said. ``You're either good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who make the people who govern you,'' said
Guzman, who mastered this bit of practical democracy. ``If the
people don't participate, no matter who governs, you're always
going to risk an abuse of power. Without participation, nothing is
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   With it, everybody's a big shot.

FORGET NICE; FROGS NEED SOME OF COACH'S FERVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The current theory, at least in some quarters, is that Billy
Tubbs' Horned Frogs are in need of a mandatory study hall with Miss
Manners.
</P>
<P>
   I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   What they need, if they hope to cash their ticket to the NCAA
Tournament, is to somehow become the spitting image of their coach
in the second half of Western Athletic Conference play, which
begins this afternoon at 5 p.m. at Daniel Meyer Coliseum against
SMU.
</P>
<P>
   Actual drip-down-your-shirt expectorating, ala Billy, you
understand, is not required.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the drift. The Frogs need to borrow some of Tubbs'
fire and venom. They need to show some passion, within
semi-respectable limits, of course.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Miss Manners, it's time to get mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's team is a great justification for why you run up
the score,'' said Tubbs, who has been accused on more than one
occasion of drilling subdued opponents to the point of humiliation.
``We had a 12-point lead \Rlast Saturday\S night against Rice, but
we didn't make it 15, and then 18, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team doesn't have the killer instinct to go out and just
put teams away.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, is what Tubbs and the Frogs must correct if
they hope to turn a disappointing 3-4 first half of conference play
into the successful season they have envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The lead against Rice last weekend dwindled away and the Owls
eventually won, 76-69, proving what has become obvious to most TCU
observers: This Frogs' team may be 15-6, but it's not nearly as
good as last year's team was.
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lee Nailon-Mike Jones-Malcolm Johnson-led Frogs of a
year ago got a team down, that's when they went for the jugular.
</P>
<P>
   This team hasn't learned how to do that yet.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon stayed, and, on paper at least, his supporting cast looks
more than capable. But there's a missing spark somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team maybe shoots the ball better, but where we're a step
behind last year's team is defensively,'' Tubbs said. ``We've never
been as good defensively this year as we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't forced the turnovers, and we're not scoring off the
ones we get, which makes for a closer game. When we've gotten beat,
we've been in almost every game right down to the final buzzer.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing Nailon for back-to-back games against Mountain
Division-leading Nevada-Las Vegas and Tulsa _ the former for being
ejected 34 seconds into the game for fighting, the latter while
serving his one-game suspension _ certainly didn't help the Frogs,
and Tubbs' temper tantrum against the officials after the UNLV game
provided some distraction when he was forced to issue an apology to
avoid his own suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just Billy, and that's TCU basketball in the '90s.
It's the flip side of the coin that comes with all the notoriety
and positive national attention Tubbs brings to the program, which
consistently flirts with a Top 25 ranking. In the end, it's a small
price to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eventful seven games, to say the least,'' Tubbs
said. ``It's a rarity any time a conference team plays five out of
seven on the road. Even if you come out 5-2, being on the road
doesn't do you a lot of good and when you get beat, it takes a lot
out of you. I think we still do have our sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the spark we had earlier, but it will take just
a win or two to get it back. We're not sitting, going, `these guys
don't care; these guys have quit on us; these guys aren't busting
their butts.' They're doing what we ask them to do. It's not a
fractured team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just not quite the team Tubbs hopes it may yet become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it's ever clicked like I hoped it would _
and I try to stay in touch with reality _ but realistically we're
playing about as good as we can play,'' he said. ``I think we're
going to be all right. I think we have a lot of good things ahead
of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take care of our business, we'll be in the \RNCAA\S
Tournament. If we can't win games, we won't be. The conference
championship will be up for grabs in Las Vegas. If we can get our
act together and get our confidence back, I think we're a
contender.''
</P>
<P>
   That they would be contenders was never a question. But if the
Frogs can just borrow some of Billy's spunk, they have a chance to
be champions.

   HUNTLEY, Ill. _ Slapped by a raw wind whipping off the icy
cornfields, Emil Bertolini, 62, stepped across the frozen earth on
his way to see a model home at Sun City, the retirement haven
better known for Arizona sunshine than Illinois snowdrifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of sun around here,'' Bertolini, a retired
salesman and a lifelong Chicagoan, said with a laugh, glimpsing a
Midwestern sky the color of wintry despair. ``But you know,
grandchildren are a lot more interesting than the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to appeal to the majority of older people who are
unwilling to move far away from family and friends, Del Webb Corp.,
based in Arizona, is opening its first Sun City retirement
community in the Frostbelt, on the old Vern and Shirley Drundel
corn-and-soybean farm, 50 miles west and 10 degrees colder than
Chicago, a place whose very name evokes the shivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone at Del Webb had proposed putting a Sun City near
Chicago back in 1988, they would have said, `What are you, nuts?'
'' said Dave Schreiner, a general manager with the company, which
has been drawing retirees to the Sunbelt for nearly 40 years. ``But
our market research shows that far more people want to stay home
than relocate. Big numbers of people in the Chicago area do not
want to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   People in other parts of the country sometimes wonder at the
tendency of Midwesterners to prefer to stay put in a place that
gets too cold in the winter, too hot in the summer and stays flat
all year round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midwesterners seem to feel that this is where they started,
and this is where they should end up,'' said Dr. James Webster, a
professor of medicine and the head of the Buehler Center on Aging
at Northwestern University. ``And it's not the maladaption
everybody thinks, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster, a third-generation Chicagoan, said there is nothing
like a blizzard now and then, or a gust of 40-below-zero wind, to
keep the blood circulating. ``There's some evidence that you need
some stimulation to keep you moving,'' he said, acknowledging a bit
of Midwestern chauvinism. ``You go out and talk to friends out East
_ they get 2 inches of snow, they've got to close the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Midwesterners often tend to distrust paradise, holding what
Garrison Keillor calls the Dark Lutheran view that nothing should
be too pretty, too nice or too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists and gerontologists say the region's
agricultural heritage has endowed Midwesterners with a strong sense
of being tied to the land. Others are skeptical of such regional
differences, especially at a time of such mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, years of market research have convinced Del
Webb Corp. _ about $70 million is invested in the project _ that
plenty of people in the megalopolis known as Chicagoland want a
resortlike life style, but do not want to move away. Some of the
homes will be ready for occupancy by April.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Carolyn Kleen, who live in suburban Chicago, were among
the first buyers at the Sun City here. They said the reason for
their decision was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two daughters, and they live here,'' said Kleen, a
59-year-old high school art teacher whose retirement is just around
the corner. ``So many people retire and move to Arizona or Florida,
and then start missing their kids. We looked into the crystal ball
and realized we'd be very unhappy living far from the rest of the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiner, the Del Webb general manager, said some of the buyers
here are Midwesterners who live in other Sun City locations, but
want to come home.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois version of the ``Sun City brand,'' as Schreiner
calls it, will not differ markedly from the company's retirement
communities in Arizona, California, Nevada, South Carolina and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But one different amenity will be the snow plowing of driveways
and sidewalks. Otherwise, the Sun City will operate largely like
those in the Sunbelt.
</P>
<P>
   It is built around an 18-hole golf course, with man-made lakes,
streams and waterfalls. There is an indoor recreation lodge the
size of three football fields, with a swimming pool, tennis and
bocce courts. Classes and clubs will be offered, including computer
training, hiking, ballroom dancing and woodworking.
</P>
<P>
   Base prices for the houses range from $140,000 to nearly
$300,000. But upgrades could drive those costs much higher. ``It's
unlimited really,'' said Harriet Ford, a Sun City spokeswoman.
``There are close to 1,000 options.''
</P>
<P>
   To live at Sun City, at least one spouse must be, in the
vernacular here, ``age 55 or better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a 19-year-old spouse,'' Ms. Ford said, ``unless
she became pregnant, and then they would have to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Children 18 or younger can stay in a house here for not more
than three months at a time. But Ms. Ford said the Sun City ethos
is especially hospitable to visits by children and grandchildren.
In the spring, she said, the community will sponsor an Easter egg
hunt for grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Sun City officials look for an eventual population of 8,000 or
9,000, on this land farmed until recently by the Drundels, who now
live in nearby rural Hampshire, and still plant corn and beans.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Huntley, which includes Sun City, has a population
of about 4,000. The closest hospital is in Elgin, about 20 miles
away, and except for a nearby outlet mall, there are not many
places to shop. But the developers here say the relentless sprawl
of suburbia westward along Interstate 90 will soon change that.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiner described the Huntley location as ``sitting at the
edge'' of the Chicago metropolitan region. But many Chicagoans
would hardly describe this as suburban, but more like a good jump
on the drive to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not seem to bother the older people interviewed
during market testing for the new Sun City, Schreiner said. He said
people around retirement age are willing to move farther away from
a city into a rural surrounding to escape congestion and fear of
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Berneice Quagliata, 63, and her husband, Ed, a 65-year-old
retired railroad engineer, said the location of this Sun City had
one attraction that could not be matched.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hop on a train and go to Chicago, go to a concert, do
whatever you want,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everybody else who is moving to Sun City here, she
said the family considerations outweighed everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home is where your people are,'' said Mrs. Quagliata, whose
six children live in the Chicago area. ``The four seasons don't
bother us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Quagliatas have hedged their bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a little patio down in Florida,'' said Mrs.
Quagliata, as she played with a grandchild. ``Come January, that's
where we'll be until March.'' &QL;

INS ERROR IN BOOKLET COULD STOP IMMIGRANTS FROM BECOMING CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new guide that the federal government intends as a primer for
immigrants contains an error that could keep some from becoming
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
began distributing close to 700,000 copies of ``A Guide to
Naturalization'' across the nation. The new, 47-page booklet is
intended to replace a 9-year-old, lengthy volume with a new version
that gives standard, easy-to-understand information on becoming a
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But the government couldn't keep its own rules straight. The
problems center on how the book explains Selective Service rules.
</P>
<P>
   Male aliens _ both legal and illegal _ have to register with the
Selective Service when they are at least 18 but not yet 26 years
old. Aliens who should have registered but didn't can be refused
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The guide's glossary gives a summary of Selective Service rules
by stating that males must register if they are over 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, that statement in the guide is wrong, said
Henry Williams, general counsel of the Selective Service System.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration attorneys and others who work with people trying to
become citizens say the INS has become more strict recently about
enforcing Selective Service rules. Would-be citizens who think
they're following the rules might be inadvertently failing to
comply with them, and could even be denied citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to cause problems,'' said Paul Choquette, a Seattle
immigration attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants frequently run afoul of Selective Service
requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants don't speak English and may not attend secondary
schools. ``No one ever tells them it's a rule,'' Choquette said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS acknowledges an error was made, but has no plans to
recall the guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, it looks to be the case (that an error was
made),'' agreed Alison Morris, who is in charge of distribution of
the guide for the INS. She said Greg Gourley, who teaches
citizenship classes to immigrants in the Seattle area, alerted her
to the error two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   She noted, however, that the glossary also correctly says that
people must register who were permanent U.S. residents between the
ages of 18 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells people both the right thing and the wrong thing in
the same paragraph. It is, I hate to say it, just a glossary,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario is that somebody is going to be
confused, and then they'll call.''
</P>
<P>
   The glossary also contains a telephone number for the Selective
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The error will be corrected in the next printing, which should
take place in a month or so, Morris said. The computer version of
the guide on the INS web site will be corrected more quickly, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The guide was a year in development and cost close to $600,000
for the first printing.
</P>
<P>
   The INS is handing it to to groups that help immigrants and to
individual immigrants who pick up a citzenship application. The INS
says it created the guide to ``provide better and more consistent
information'' and that it expects applicants for citizenship to
read the publication.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the hope also is that the guides will be recycled
among the immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   The INS employee who was responsible for the Selective Service
language was not available Friday. But Williams, the Selective
Service general counsel, said he believes the INS did not consult
his agency about the language.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the INS has tried recently to have a closer
relationship with the Selective Service, including having meetings
with representatives of the system and putting links on the INS web
site to Selective Service.
</P>
<P>
   The error in the glossary is serious enough that Courley, the
citizenship teacher, calls the guide dangerous for immigrants to
rely on. He said he worries that some immigrants may be denied
citizenship because they follow the erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   The Selective Service's rules say people who don't register may
not be penalized if they can show their failure to sign up was
neither knowing nor willful. In addition to denying citizenship,
those who fail to register can be denied government jobs,
vocational training and student loans.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Seattle area, INS officials are requiring written
statements explaining why an immigrant didn't register, Gourley
said. Not so long ago, an oral statement sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only recently have they taken it more seriously,'' Gourley
said. ``They are really crossing the T's and dotting the I's.''
</P>
<P>
   Choquette said in the last year he has noticed that INS
examiners typically bring up Selective Service registration. Some
even ``harp on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they tell applicants for citizenship to register even if
they are too old to do so, Choquette said.

A GROWING POLITICAL CAUSE: DECRYING SUBURBAN SPRAWL

 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The word ``sprawl'' does not even appear in the
index of ``Earth in the Balance,'' Vice President Al Gore's earnest
1992 treatise on the environment. But these days that word _ which
embraces a set of creeping suburban problems from traffic
congestion to loss of open space _ has emerged as one of the
reigning buzzwords in the political lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians as diverse as Gore and Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey have made the issue a priority, and voters around the nation
have shown their concern in the most tangible way that taxpayers
can, by passing billions of dollars in bond measures to buy and
preserve undeveloped land and approving ballot measures intended to
slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl, in sum, is the new language of environmentalism. It is
seen by political strategists as perhaps the best way to engage
voters in a debate that had become more abstract over the last two
decades as regulation curbed many of the most egregious
environmental abuses, from pesticides to pollution, that had
animated suburbanites in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The new debate is being driven by some of the same concerns that
inspired the original movement, but now the length of a commuter's
daily drive is increasingly seen as an environmental issue like
chlorofluorocarbons or global warming. And political strategists
say that the voters who are most concerned about these issues _
suburban women _ are a voting group that helps decide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a period of prosperity, it's not about how much we have;
it's about how we hold our lives together,'' said Alex Castellanos,
a Republican political consultant who has worked for candidates in
states like Texas and Florida and helped spread the concept of the
soccer mom. ``So all these quality-of-life issues, from health care
to the environment, come to the fore. A lot of it is the
feminization of politics. The warrior of the suburban jungle is the
mom out there in her suburban assault vehicle, and there's no oasis
for her, no place for her to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Joe Six-Pack is not concerned about green space, he is
not the dominant force on the spectrum anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With its Teddy Roosevelt-style emphasis on conservation in the
classic sense, the fight against untrammeled sprawl finds an
equally comfortable place in Gore's emerging presidential campaign
theme of ``practical idealism'' and in the ``compassionate
conservative'' mantra of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And although
it has not emerged as a top-tier issue like education or crime in
public opinion surveys, it is steadily gaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Ventura County, just west of here, voters in November
overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative called SOAR _ for Save
Open Space and Agricultural Resources _ which will force every
propsed development that requires a zoning change to be approved
by a public referendum. Similar measures were passed in four
individual cities within the county, just one beachhead among some
200 measures worth $7 billion that passed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Whitman successfully pressed for $1 billion
in borrowing to set aside half the state's remaining 2 million
acres of open space over the next 10 years. Voters overwhelmingly
approved the measure in November.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide survey last year by the Public Policy Institute of
California found that more than a quarter of Californians saw
population growth and development as a big problem in their region
_ hardly a surprise in a state that is expected to add 18 million
more people, an entire New York state, to its current population of
more than 32 million people by the year 2025. In the San Francisco
Bay area, where Silicon Valley has fueled a boom, nearly 40 percent
of respondents saw growth as a major problem, while a third of
residents statewide saw transportation and traffic congestion as a
big problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue which, on the surface, seems like a very
policy-wonk kind of thing,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director
for the nonpartisan institute. ``But there's a lot of public
sentiment and concern about the everyday annoyance of sprawl and
growth, and the long-range problems associated with air pollution
and environmental degradation. And, after all, most Californians do
live in suburban regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how suburban is defined, so do about half of all
Americans, and the sprawl issue is increasingly seen as a way for
politicians like Gore to take the lingering elitist tinge off
environmentalism and cast it in terms readily apparent to average
voters. In its current budget proposal, the Clinton administration
is seeking more than $1 billion in new spending to help local
governments preserve open space, ease traffic congestion and
promote environmentally sensitive economic development as part of a
``livability agenda.'' And it seeks another $1 billion for a
``lands legacy initiative'' to preserve parklands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an upscale issue in the sense that if you're worried
about your basic material well-being, you don't have so much time
to be worried about your quality of life,'' said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster in Washington who said he saw increasing
interest in the issue among political clients. ``But once you pass
that threshold, even in rural areas, where family farms are
threatened by development, this is really an issue that cuts across
the board for folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting just how much steam a given issue may have in an
election, much less a presidential contest still more than a year
off, is notoriously difficult, and an economic downturn could
quickly relegate sprawl to back-burner status. But Mellman notes
that many of the congressional seats in swing districts are
centered in suburban areas, so the issue could well loom large in
local contests.

 LOS ANGELES: local contests. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Precisely because most land-use decisions are the province of
cities, counties and states, it is not entirely clear what role the
federal government may play. In announcing the administration's
initiative last month, Gore took pains to say that the government
should not act as ``beauty commissar'' but should instead provide
financial incentives _ like transportation aid _ for localities to
work together.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moe, who was chief of staff to Vice President Walter
Mondale and is now president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in Washington, said that although sprawl was often
portrayed as the natural free-market consequence of normal and
desirable growth, the reality was that government action at all
levels had effectively subsidized it for years, by actions as
simple as building federal office buildings on the outer edges of
cities instead of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``State policy is the single most important factor in trying to
deal with this issue, and there's not a one-size-fits-all
solution,'' said Moe, an author of the book ``Changing Places:
Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl'' (Henry Holt, 1998).
``Sprawl is affecting people much more directly, in terms of air
quality, visual blight, all these manifestations. It's hitting
people right in the face and they see it and know it and don't like
it. They're not quite clear what needs to be done, but they know
that the way we're doing it is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to the National Press Club in Washington, Moe
ticked off a litany of sprawl's reach: Since 1950, Pennsylvania has
lost more than 4 million acres of farmland, an area larger than
Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, while metropolitan Phoenix
now covers some 600 square miles, an area larger than Delaware. By
at least some estimates, in the next half century sprawl is
expected to consume more than 3.5 million acres of California's
Great Central Valley, the nation's greengrocer.
</P>
<P>
   If sprawl is often couched as a motherhood issue, not every
group approves of efforts to limit it. The National Association of
Home Builders has warned that it will fight any efforts to limit
new federal money for infrastructure like roads. In at least some
cases, developers have successfully co-opted anti-sprawl efforts.
In Arizona, for example, a measure narrowly passed last fall that
would set aside $20 million a year for 11 years to buy open space,
in exchange for a ban on development fees and restrictions on urban
growth.
</P>
<P>
   And Castellanos, the Republican consultant, said Gore could be
hurt by any sign that he still subscribed to a ``fairly '60s style
environmental agenda,'' and he insisted that the Republicans' most
important issue was the high taxes that forced families to work
longer hours to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to quality of life, you can either give someone
a park to go to or you can give her more time to go to the park,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Mellman, the Democratic pollster, said it would be
possible for Democrats to attack Republican candidates who seemed
too willing to allow unbridled development. But he added: ``I think
it's really an issue that unites more than it divides. It goes to
the question, Can you understand and articulate the kinds of
concerns that people have in their lives? This is an opportunity to
do that.''

MAN IS CHARGED WITH MURDERING SONS, 7 AND 3, AND MAY FACE DEATH
PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 49-year-old man was indicted on first-degree murder
charges Friday, accused of hacking and bludgeoning his two young
sons to death in Manhattan last month after his wife threatened to
take the boys back to her native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Short could face the death penalty if prosecutors decide
to seek such a punishment and he is convicted in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said that
Short's 7-year-old son, Richard, died of ``multiple chop wounds to
the head and neck,'' while his 3-year-old-son, John, died of
``blunt impacts to the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not disclose exactly how they believe Short
killed his children, but a hatchet and a crowbar were removed from
the basement of the building in the Flatiron district where the
bodies of the two boys were found on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau has four months to determine whether to seek the
death penalty for Short, who neighbors said had a history of
physically abusing his wife. The case presents Morgenthau, who has
declined to pursue the death penalty since New York reinstated
capital punishment in 1995, with a decision that could prove
politically thorny.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of some murder victims and police union officials have
bitterly criticized the district attorney, who has long opposed
capital punishment, for failing to seek the death penalty against
any defendant. Like other prosecutors across the state, Morgenthau
has declined to explain his final decisions in death penalty cases,
saying that doing so could weaken the cases and inadvertently set
legal precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau was circumspect at Friday's news conference
announcing the indictment. He declined to detail where, how or when
prosecutors believe the boys were killed, or what evidence
implicates Short.
</P>
<P>
   When asked his reaction as a father to the killings, he said,
``My reaction is that we're going to make every effort to make sure
that Short is never a free man.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas B. Lyons, Short's lawyer, appealed to Morgenthau not to
pursue the deat penalty against his client. ``I hope that
Morgenthau decides after a thorough review of the facts and the
evidence not to seek lethal injection for Ronald Short,'' Lyons
said. ``As far as I know, Short has never been convicted of any
criminal offense.''
</P>
<P>
   State law gives prosecutors wide latitude in determining whether
to seek the death penalty, allowing them to weigh the crime against
mitigating circumstances. Such circumstances can include a lack of
past criminal activity by a defendant, or weak evidence that could
make a jury hesitant to convict, given the gravity of the
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Short case contains elements that argue both for and against
seeking capital punishment, lawyers involved in previous death
penalty cases said. The grisly nature of the slayings _ an apparent
hatchet and crowbar attack on two defenseless children _ could
argue for the death penalty, these lawyers said. But the lawyers
also said that Short's lack of a criminal history could be used as
a reason for seeking a lesser sentence.
</P>
<P>
   An initial psychiatric review of Short is scheduled to be
revealed in court on March 1. Short, who is on a suicide watch in
Kings County Hospital Center, took Prozac in the past, law
enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in other death penalty cases said psychiatric
problems could make it easier for Morgenthau to decline to pursue
the death penalty.

 &HT;    No. 1 within reach as Duke visits
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As if Georgia Tech didn't already have enough problems
playing Duke today, the Blue Devils of Mike Krzyzewski have extra
incentives heading into the ACC contest at Alexander Memorial
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has been ranked second in the nation behind Connecticut
since November, but Connecticut lost to Syracuse earlier in the
week and a win over Georgia Tech could vault the Blue Devils into
the No. 1 spot. Duke (22-1, 10-0 ACC) also can take another step
toward becoming the first team to win all of its regular-season
conference games since the ACC adopted the 16-team regular-season
format in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (13-9, 4-6 ACC), on the other hand, hopes to
rebound from a disappointing 51-50 loss at home to North Carolina
State on Tuesday. But the Jackets are playing a team that they lost
to 99-58 in Durham, N.C., last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils have won 17 in a row since a two-point loss to
Cincinnati and are coming off a 95-77 home victory over No. 7
Maryland. It's difficult to find a Blue Devil weakness.
</P>
<P>
   A backcourt featuring Trajan Langdon and William Avery might be
the best in the country, and Elton Brand could be the college
player of the year. Shane Battier is a candidate for defensive
player of the year, and Chris Carrawell might be the most
underrated player in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, who played at Augusta's Westside High School,
acknowlegdes that everybody wants to be No. 1 but says that it's
not a big thing with his Duke teammates right now. ``Out on the
floor, it never crosses my mind,'' he said. ``I guess it's a
motivational factor, but it's not big. As it is, everybody comes at
us every night with everything they've got. Being No. 1 really
doesn't mean anything to us right now. Cutting down the nets at the
end of the year is what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just completed a very difficult run, with St. John's, North
Carolina, N.C. State and Maryland,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We learned
a lot about our team. There were certain game situations that will
help us down the road. We're in good shape and refreshed right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Duke has an Achilles' heel, it's that the team has no one to
back up Avery. The 6-2 sophomore says he's aware of it but it's not
a consuming worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any team who has a good point guard,'' Avery said, ``you
don't want somebody like Trajan Langdon to take away from his game
to bring the ball up and run the offense. But we can do it. Against
St. John's, I was out (on fouls), and we got the ball up the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery, who is averaging 15 points and 5.5 assists a game and
shooting 51 percent from the field, says he wanted to play in the
ACC when he was in high school in Augusta, but Tech showed interest
only during his sophomore and junior years. When he went away to
Oak Hill, Va., for his senior year, Tech stopped calling. ``I still
wanted to play in the ACC, and I think I ended up at the right
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery says he knows about the Yellow Jackets this year. ``They
have been up and down, and I know they're pretty tough at home and
they're very big. But as I said, everybody gives Duke their best
shot.''

SHOW-AND-TELL TIME IN TOYLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most famous glamour doll is hitting the big
four-oh. Luke Skywalker's ancestors are coming. And that little fur
ball with the attitude is back _ with cousins.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of theme material for this year's crop of
toys, which retailers will get their first look at on Monday when
the 96th annual American International Toy Fair gets under way in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers hope the products, which will hit store shelves later
this year, will ultimately land in millions of toy chests. Many
reflect the growing importance of technology in children's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move forward, you can expect to see many more examples
of the use of technology in toys,'' said Peter Eio, chairman of the
Toy Manufacturers of America, which sponsors the fair.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Hasbro Inc. is introducing e-mail versions of
games like Scrabble that enable players to compete by computer.
Microsoft Corp. is pushing into toyland with an expanded line of
Actimates plush toys that children can interact with. And Mattel
Inc. has several CD-ROMs that bring Barbie to life on computer as
she plays ``extreme sports'' and dances to funky music.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie is apparently in the midst of a midlife crisis. She is
sporting a butterfly tattoo, glitter press-on nails and
leopard-print swim wear and matching sunglasses. To commemorate her
age, Mattel has created a more understated collectors' version,
still with no wrinkles, that incorporates the look of the 1959
original.
</P>
<P>
   Toys based on the first of the new Star Wars films are expected
to be big sellers this year. ``Star Wars: the Phantom Menace,''
which is set in a future that predates that of the films of the
Star Wars trilogy, is scheduled to be released in May. So companies
without products tied to the movie are ``trying to launch toys
earlier in the year to sort of stay out of the way of Star Wars,''
said Cliff Annicelli, associate editor of Playthings magazine, a
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Bandai, the company behind the Power Rangers, for instance, is
already selling this year's action-figure versions of those
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies that are expected to capitalize on Star Wars are
Hasbro and Lego Group. Hasbro will introduce Star Wars action
figures and vehicles at the fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention
Center, while Lego is coming out with a new version of its
electronic Lego Mindstorms robots based on the movie's characters.
The robots, assembled in much the same way as the classic Lego
blocks, move, chirp and obey electronic commands.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is also a big theme this year, reflecting the growing
number of World Wrestling Federation and World Championship
Wrestling fans. Of course, the public-relations lift the sport has
enjoyed since Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura switched vocations has not
hurt. That is Gov. Ventura to the Minnesota electorate, which voted
him into office in November.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jakks Pacific Inc. and Toy Biz Inc. are battling it
out with competing lines of popular wrestling action figures. Jakks
has World Wrestling Federation figures, including Sweating
Superstars _ yes, they simulate perspiration _ and Toy Biz is
countering with World Championship Wrestling figures with
mechanical features.
</P>
<P>
   Also this year, companies are updating recent best sellers in
hopes of keeping youngsters interested for another year. So if you
have had it with Furby, too bad. It is back and has brought along
some relatives. Furby now comes with new fur patterns, and Tiger
Electronics, the division of Hasbro that makes the interactive
stuffed animal, is retiring the originals, which is likely to
create a greater frenzy for the remaining few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only scratched the surface with Furby,'' said Lana
Simon, a spokeswoman for Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are Furby games, accessories and even a Furby
Halloween costume. And Tiger is introducing Baby Furby, a smaller
version of the original that babbles and gurgles and fits more
easily into a backpack. One catch: At $30, Baby Furbys cost about
the same as the original, though they are nearly half the size.
</P>
<P>
   Other well-known characters have been given new features, too.
Teletubbies pals, whose names most preschoolers know as well as
their own, now have light-up tummies, while Barney, the purple
dinosaur that seems to defy extinction, has learned to play the
banjo since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, toy makers have decided that creating a stuffed animal
that simply sits there looking cute will no longer do. After all,
Tickle Me Elmo and Sing and Snore Ernie proved that plush toys with
personality sell well in what has typically been a slow-growth
category. So companies have been coming up with new ways to make
plush toys gyrate and wiggle ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This year Elmo and Ernie, which are from Mattel's Fisher-Price
unit, play the guitar and sing rock songs. And Winnie the Pooh
responds to a child's voice with songs and jokes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And once again manufacturers have created beanie everything,
from Furby Buddies to Blue's Clues miniatures. With Ty Inc.'s
wildly popular Beanie Babies continuing to capture the imaginations
_ and allowances _ of children, toy companies that make virtually
any kind of stuffed animals are making miniature bean-bag versions
to try to create their own Beanie-mania.
</P>
<P>
   Some themes, though, have begun to wane. Virtual pets, the rage
two years ago, have fizzled. That may come as a great relief to
parents and teachers who were fed up with children's preoccupation
with the plastic playmates, which required constant care lest they
die in a backpack or lunch box. Sales of virtual pets, like
Tamagotchi and Giga Pets, plunged nearly 80 percent, to $45 million
last year, according to the toy manufacturers group.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters' often fleeting fascination with the toy of the
moment is exactly the reason that the industry, despite all the new
products, is expecting only a modest improvement over last year's
stagnant results. For 1998, wholesale shipments were virtually flat
at $15.2 billion, and companies like Mattel and the retailer Toys
``R'' Us had disappointing years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In total, I think we can expect the combination of the toy and
video-game industry will grow by between 3 and 5 percent in 1999,''
said Eio of the manufacturers group, ``with much of the traditional
toy increase coming from Star Wars-related merchandise.''

 &HT;    Allen eagerly awaiting rematch with Hopkins
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For six months, Robert Allen has carried the unusual
title of ``interim champion.'' The first word or both of them will
be removed today.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta middleweight meets IBF champion Bernard Hopkins at
the Washington (D.C.) Convention Center. The bout is a rematch of
their title fight in Las Vegas in August, when referee Mills Lane
inadvertently pushed Hopkins out of the ring when he tried to
separate the two in the fourth round. Hopkins suffered an ankle
bruise and could not continue, and the fight was declared a
no-contest.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF immediately dubbed Allen the ``interim champion''
because he was ranked No. 1 in the division and Hopkins' future was
uncertain. Allen scored a first-round TKO over Abdula Ramadan in
September, before the rematch was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' Allen said. ``I feel good, better than the
last time we fought. Everything feels right. No fear, no nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins had won two out of three rounds on the cards of two out
of three judges but was having problems penetrating Allen's
defenses, and the fight appeared to be turning in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things I didn't do the last fight that I
will this time,'' Allen said. ``I've watched the tape, and I made a
million mistakes. I was lunging with some of my punches, but he
couldn't capitalize. This time I've got to double and triple my jab
more. I have one of the strongest hooks, and he hasn't felt it
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, who said he thought that Allen was doing excessive
grabbing in their first fight, said, ``I consider myself a clean
fighter. If Allen wants to get dirty, and I see the referee is
allowing it to continue, then I've got to become dirty. If he wants
to fight, let's fight.

 &HT;    Maybe this year: Wallace yet to win at Daytona, but posted
second-best speed at practice
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Last year, NASCAR fans watched Dale
Earnhardt's luck change at Daytona International Speedway when he
won his first Daytona 500 after 19 failed attempts.
</P>
<P>
   When qualifying for this year's Daytona 500 opens at 12:30 p.m.
today, veteran driver Rusty Wallace may be the best candidate to
change his fortunes in restrictor-plate racing.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 42, has only three top-five finishes in 44 career
restrictor-plate races: a fifth in the 1988 DieHard 500 at
Talladega and two fifth-place outings at Daytona last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who emerged from January testing here with the fastest
speed, had the second-fastest speed in Friday's practice sessions
at 193.878 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best testing I've ever had in my life down here in
Daytona,'' Wallace said. ``We've got a brand new car and, man, it's
been flying.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Wallace will sit on the pole of the second annual Bud
Shootout, a nonpoints race he won last year. The Shootout is a race
of 25 consecutive laps with a mandatory, two-tire pit stop
scheduled between laps 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel really good that we're on the pole,'' he said.
``We've had some really fast practice speeds down here. That's
what's got me real excited. The car is brand new and it ran great
in testing for two solid days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took it back (after testing) and the guys assured me. They
said, `This thing's gotta be quicker.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's No. 2 Ford Taurus was faster after adjustments made
between testing and Speed Weeks. After posting a top average speed
of 193.129 in testing, Wallace had the fastest lap in the morning
practice at 193.878. He followed that up with a 193.615, the
third-fastest mark in the afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
   Today's first-round qualifying determines the two drivers on the
front row, the pole and outside pole, for the Feb. 14 Daytona 500.
The other qualifiers will be determined in Thursday's Gatorade
125s, as well as 13 other drivers _ the six with the best speeds
who didn't qualify for the race and provisional starters based last
year's car-owner standings points.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott set the track qualifying mark at 210.364 mph in
1987, the year before NASCAR instituted restrictor plates, which
reduce the airflow through the carburetor to limit speeds at the
super speedways such as Daytona and Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who leads all drivers with more than 10 starts at
Daytona with a 9.12 starting average, was 19th in morning practice
at 190.937.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys went back and worked awful hard on the car and engine
and we came down here and had a pretty good first run,'' said
Earnhardt, who was eighth in points last year, his first finish
outside the top five in six years. ``We feel good about our car and
our engine combination. We're just going to go for it in
qualifying.

 &HT;    Talladega tests pay off for Marlin
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Veteran Sterling Marlin, who improved his
Winston Cup points standing by 12 spots last season in his first
year with the No. 40 Chevrolet, posted the fastest speed in
Friday's practice for the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin was one of six drivers to lap the 2.5-mile tri-oval of
Daytona International Speedway at an average speed of more than 193
mph. His average speed of 193.995 was in the afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tested here a couple of weeks ago and went to Talladega
last week,'' Marlin said. ``We worked on the car and (were faster).
Usually, what you find at Talladega transfers here. We figured we'd
be in the top two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Marlin won the first Gatorade 125 qualifying race and
started the 500 in the second row. He led laps 15 and 16 of the 500
but then broke a shock and finished 22nd. He didn't have a top-five
finish in the final 31 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here last year and struggled qualifying,'' he said.
``But we won the qualifying race, and we were leading the 500 until
we broke a shock. From then on, we kind of went in a slump and
didn't run real good and had a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac rising
</P>
<P>
   The Ford teams continued to put forth a strong showing _ Penske
teammates Rusty Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield finished second and
third in practice. Dale Jarrett and the No. 88 Ford were fourth at
193.528 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon and his No. 24 Chevrolet were fifth at 193.245 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Pontiacs also had a strong effort. Kyle Petty, looking to
rebound from last year's disappointing 30th-place finish in points,
had the sixth-highest speed at 193.108. Ernie Irvan was eighth at
192.736 in the No. 36 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Former Indy Racing League champion Tony Stewart, a rookie on the
Winston Cup circuit, was the biggest surprise, posting the
seventh-highest speed at 192.287 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, driving former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs' No.
20 Pontiac, had the fastest speed among seven rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of low-key,'' Stewart said. ``It's been kind of
surprising. This is my 20th year in racing. You work so hard to get
to this level that it's just such a relief that you're finally here
in your first weekend of your Cup career. It's made me sit back and
relax and say, `Hey, I'm finally here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot struggles
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Buckshot Jones, a graduate of the University
of Georgia and Tucker High School, struggled in preparing for his
first Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, one of the more popular drivers in his four years on the
Busch Grand National circuit, finished 49th out of 57 drivers in
afternoon practice. His average speed of 188.387 mph was fourth
among rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all right when we tested here (last month),'' Jones
said. ``Then we went back home (to team headquarters in
Spartanburg, S.C.) and changed some things. Some of those things we
did didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   After posting a speed of 188.324 mph in morning practice, Jones'
crew changed the transmission and engine, which is being supplied
by Hendrick Motorsports. Without much improvement in the afternoon
session, though, Jones has gone back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   He says the problem must be the No. 00 Pontiac's chassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be tough when we got here if we didn't
qualify well,'' he said. ``We're just not going to get a good
starting position in the 125 (qualifying race).''
</P>
<P>
   The other Georgia entry into 500 qualifying, veteran Bill
Elliott of Dawsonville in the No. 94 Ford, was 31st in afternoon
practice at 190.682 mph.
</P>
<P>
   This and that
</P>
<P>
   Dick Trickle has picked up a sponsor for the Daytona 500 in
Nations Rent, a Florida-based equipment rental company. Trickle
will attempt to qualify in the No. 13 Ford, which is owned by
Elliott and Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. ... Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas will serve as grand marshal of the
Daytona 500; Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre is grand
marshal of the Busch series' NAPA Auto Parts 300 on Feb. 13. ...
Total awards for the Busch race will be nearly $1.3 million,
eclipsing the $1.1 record of last year's Busch event during Speed

 &HT;    Tyson sentenced to year in jail for assault
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three weeks ago, Mike Tyson showed the world how much
his boxing skills had eroded, but as it turns out, that dismal
effort against Francois Botha may be the highlight of his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson now will make another comeback _ back to prison. On Friday
he was ordered to serve one year of a prison sentence stemming from
assault charges when he kicked one motorist and punched another
after a traffic accident in August in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Judge Stephen Johnson sentenced Tyson to two years in
jail on each count with one year suspended, running concurrently.
He was fined $5,000 and will serve two years' probation and perform
200 hours of community service upon release. With good behavior, he
could be released in six months.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal problems don't end there for Tyson, who was led
away in handcuffs for the first time since a 1991 rape conviction,
for which he served three years of a six-year sentence. An Indiana
court now must rule on Tyson's parole violation. He had three
months remaining at the time of the assaults, and judge Patricia
Gifford could restore all or part of the three years that Tyson did
not serve.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Evander Holyfield's attorney, said Gifford ``will be
under a lot pressure to take some action. This could have a domino
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kizer, deputy attorney general in Nevada, which restored
Tyson's boxing license after it had been revoked for twice biting
Holyfield in a fight, said Tyson's license remains good for the
calendar year but he would have to reapply in 2000. ``But he could
be in jail for four years,'' Kizer said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has fought just once in the past 19 months and seven times
in the past seven in a half years. His performance over Botha,
though a fifth-round knockout, was unimpressive, and the fight
bombed on pay-per-view. Tyson was scheduled to fight April 24 in
Las Vegas, but an opponent hadn't been set.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Showtime, which has Tyson under contract, issued a
statement saying they were ``surprised at the severity of the
sentence,'' but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, said, ``The party's over.
Jail doesn't rehabilitate anybody, so he's got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson had pleaded no contest to the assault charges and settled
out of court with the two victims. Tyson's attorneys worked out the
plea agreement with Montgomery County State Attorney Robert Dean in
exchange for no jail time. But Dean then left his position and was
replaced by Douglas Gansler, who pushed for imprisonment and
labeled Tyson a ``time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson can appeal within 30 days. If the appeal is granted, he
would stand trial on the charges. He cannot be released on bail
before Monday.

 &HT;    LPGA commissioner resigns unexpectedly
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Excited about the LPGA as it headed into the new
millennium, Ladies Professional Golf Association commissioner Jim
Ritts now will barely make it past March.
</P>
<P>
   Ritts, 45, surprisingly resigned Friday after three years as
LPGA commissioner to accept a position as chief operating officer
for Digital Entertainment Network Inc., a production and
distribution network of broadcast-quality programming for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ritts will remain at the LPGA for 45 days to handle the
transition. While seemingly more logical for the LPGA to have
replaced Ritts with a high-profile name, its board unanimously
appointed as his successor 37-year-old Ty Votaw, the organization's
vice president of business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But Cindy McCurdy of Peachtree City, the president of the LPGA
executive committee, said, ``Ty has been an integral part of the
LPGA's success under both Jim and (former commissioner) Charlie
Mechem, and he knows the LPGA better than anyone else. We could
have spent months and months looking, but I know we would not find
a better candidate than Ty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritts, whose contract had just been renewed for three more years
in December, called leaving the LPGA ``the most difficult
professional decision I have made. I had plans to be here for 10
years. However, this (Digital Entertainment) is a company that has
caught my imagination. In the end, this is an opportunity I could
not dismiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ritts, the LPGA expanded its schedule from 36 to 43
events; increased purses to $36.2 million in 1999, a 50 percent
increase in three years; pushed TV coverage from 19 events in 1994
to 33 in 1998; and established the Futures Tour as the LPGA's first
developmental tour.
</P>
<P>
   Votaw's background is in law. He was hired in 1991 as the LPGA's
general counsel.

SEEKING PEACE AND OPPORTUNITY, WEST AFRICANS FIND ANGER AND DOUBT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The violent death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
Guinean immigrant who was killed by four New York City police
officers Thursday, has profoundly disturbed the small but growing
West African community in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the West Africans have fled civil wars and repression in
the past decade, and some said Friday that the shooting made them
question the often difficult decision to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder whether leaving your troubled home was a
mistake,'' said Peter Wennah, a Liberian who runs a small grocery.
``America was supposed to be a safe haven, but if you get shot by
the police, who else can you turn to?''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was not fleeing war. Rather, friends said, he was seeking
opportunity. Guinea is a desperately poor country, where illiteracy
hovers at 80 percent and avenues for advancement are few. Diallo
was determined to get some education and help his family back home.
</P>
<P>
   West Africans have come to New York in growing numbers in recent
years, pushed by strife and poverty, lured by opportunity and an
expansion in the number of visas available to Africans. In 1990,
there were about 44,000 Africans in New York City; in 1996, there
were around 84,000. There are no exact figures on how many are from
West Africa. City planning officials estimated that as of 1996,
there were fewer than 1,000 Guineans in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Africans are spread throughout the five boroughs, with about 30
percent in Manhattan. About one-fourth are in the Bronx, where they
live in small clusters. Sidique Abubakarr Wai, the president of the
United African Congress, said he thought new immigrants were
increasingly settling in the Bronx, leading his organization to
hold its African Pride Day Parade there last May.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Diallo was mourned not as a Guinean, but as an African.
And just as the allegations that Brooklyn police officers
brutalized Abner Louima politicized the Haitian community, Diallo's
death may do the same for the African community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to say we declare war on New York City's
Finest,'' Wai said before delivering an angry demand for justice,
including a federal investigation and a jury trial. But, he said,
``the life of a black person is as valuable as the life of another
person.''
</P>
<P>
   As he condemned the police for firing 41 bullets at Diallo, Wai
also condemned them for failing to vigorously seek the murderers of
several dozen Senegalese cabdrivers who have been killed over the
past decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When crimes are committed in other communities, you could see
an avalanche of activity leading to the arrest and conviction of
those people _ very speedy thing,'' he said. ``What we are saying
here is let there be a universal application of the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger about Diallo's death was not confined to the city's
Africans. Diallo's neighbors, many of whom are not African, said
they were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-one shots _ forty-one shots,'' said Nilsa Ortiz, who
lives across the street. ``Even if he was a criminal, that's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood that Diallo and some of his compatriots settled
in is well worn, but well kept. Surrounding streets have multistory
apartment buildings, but Diallo's block, on Wheeler Avenue,
consists mostly of two-story brick duplexes, many of which have
been turned into apartments. Arches over narrow alleys connect many
of the buildings, and the neighbors _ Hispanic, African-American
and African _ say they feel connected as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows everybody,'' Ms. Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   But just one block over, on Elder Avenue, the drug dealing was
so bad that the police made it a so-called Model Block, which means
a constant police presence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elder is only a block away, residents say it might as
well be a world. There is no drug dealing on Wheeler, they say, and
they had not heard shots fired in two or three years. Until the
night of Diallo's death, when the blizzard of shots brought the
officers stationed on Elder Street running.

JIM RITTS RESIGNS AS LPGA COMMISSIONER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)  (af)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ In an unexpected move, Jim Ritts resigned
as LPGA commissioner Friday after only three years to become chief
operating officer in an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Ritts will be replaced in 45 days by Ty Votaw, 37, the tour's
vice president of business affairs. As recently as November, Ritts
was planning to remain as commissioner for at least another three
years. But Ritts said he could not pass up the opportunity to work
with Digital Entertainment, a corporation based in Santa Monica,
Calif., which delivers television-quality programming to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are in the beginning stages of a communications
revolution, and it's exciting to have an opportunity to become
involved in that,'' Ritts said from his car phone Friday, on his
way to the Orlando, Fla., airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day of mixed emotions for me,'' he said. ``I'm happy
about the opportunity, but sad to be leaving the LPGA. It was a
great experience, and I had the chance to work with some great
people. It was a difficult decision, but it's the right one for me
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone within the LPGA was caught off guard by Ritts'
decision. Dottie Pepper, one of the tour's most prominent players,
said nobody suspected that Ritts might be leaving during last
month's players meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' said Pepper, one of the tour's most outspoken
players. ``He had just gotten a contract extension. The LPGA can
keep leaks from getting out better than the Clinton
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper said Ritts still had strong support from the players, and
she said she believed that the tour would remain in good hands with
Votaw, who has been with the LPGA since 1991, working for Ritts and
the former commissioner Charlie Mechem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Jim and Charlie, they really groomed Ty for the job,''
Pepper said. ``Jim's strength was marketing and television, while
Charlie had great business savvy. I thought Jim did a pretty darn
good job. It was hard for him coming in, because he didn't know the
players, didn't know the LPGA. You're never going to please
everyone. Ask him, and he'll probably tell you that it was the
hardest job he ever had. But I believe that Ty is going to do a
fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritts, 45, made a strong impact during his tenure. Televised
events have increased from 19 events in 1994 to 33 events this
year. The tour has grown from 36 events in 1995 to 43 this year,
while this year's total purses are a record $36.2 million, a 50
percent increase from three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With young stars like Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb, and Se Ri
Pak to promote, the LPGA has the potential for more growth as it
heads into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pepper wondered if some of the tour's 43 events would
have trouble attracting enough big-name players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty is going to have to listen to the sponsors and to
players,'' Pepper said, ``because with 43 events, there's a chance
for some weak fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many companies within the golf industry are suffering
through tough economic times. Attracting strong sponsorship will
continue to be one of the tour's biggest challenges. Some of the
tour's most prominent players did not have their equipment
contracts renewed this year because corporations are making
cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to reach out to non-golf companies and
establish those relationships,'' Votaw said. ``Jim did a great job,
and I see no reason why this will not be a smooth transition. The
players know me, and my experience with the tour will be
invaluable. It's an honor to take this new position, and I'm
looking forward to the challenge. I know how tough the job is, but
I'm excited to have it.'' &QL;

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS JOIN INVESTIGATION OF POLICE KILLING OF UNARMED
IMMIGRANT 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  NEW YORK _ Federal officials joined a widening city
investigation on Friday into the killing of an unarmed West African
immigrant by four police officers who fired 41 shots in a ferocious
barrage that remained officially unexplained even as controversy
over the case spread from City Hall to the streets of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, said her office
would ``work closely'' with the Bronx district attorney, Robert T.
Johnson, in the inquiry into the shooting early on Thursday of
22-year-old Amadou Diallo by officers who confronted him at the
vestibule of his Bronx building.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. White offered no elaboration, legal experts said the
early federal intervention was highly unusual, perhaps intended as
public reassurance in an explosive case that was already drawing
comparisons to those of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant
tortured in a Brooklyn station house in 1997, and Anthony Baez, who
died in a Bronx struggle with Officer Francis X. Livoti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and the officers involved in Diallo's death were
keeping an official silence, and there were few facts to go on in a
case that had the earmarks of a tragedy and seemed to crystallize
the apprehensions of New York's minorities over aggressive police
policies.
</P>
<P>
   But an unofficial account was provided in an interview by
Stephen Worth, a lawyer who was hired through the auspices of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to represent the four officers,
all members of the Bronx Street Crimes Unit, who were searching for
a rapist when the fatal encounter occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Worth quoted the officers as saying they were driving along
Wheeler Avenue in an unmarked car when they first saw Diallo in the
vestibule of his building. He was acting ``suspiciously,'' they
said, and they thought he resembled the sketch of a rapist they
were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer did not elaborate on the suspicious behavior, but
another person familiar with the officers account _ all four gave
roughly the same story _ said Diallo appeared to be fumbling with
something as he went in the door to the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is acting strange; he fits the rapist's description in a
generic way,'' Worth said. The officers, in plain clothes, got out
of their car, he said, approached Diallo and identified themselves
as police officers. ``Despite repeated identifications and orders
to this individual to do certain things, he failed to comply,''
Worth said. He declined to say what the orders were.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his refusal to comply, Diallo exhibited
``aggressive behavior,'' which Worth refused to define. ``There may
have been a language problem in terms of his understanding their
directions,'' Worth acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the officers had drawn their guns _ each had a
16-shot 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol _ and Diallo may have
made some movement or gesture they took to be threatening, Worth
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other person familiar with the officers' account quoted them
as saying Diallo, who was carrying only a wallet and a beeper,
moved his hands and arms in a way that made the officers think he
was going for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said the officers then opened fire because they thought he
had a gun. ``The reason they are shooting him is they think he has
the gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the many shots fired, Worth, said: ``The reason they
are given this kind of firepower is to neutralize what they
perceive as a threat. While it may seem to a layman to be
excessive, it was the number required before this man stopped. All
41 shots did not hit this individual.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy on Friday found that Diallo suffered 19 gunshot
wounds _ 1 to the front of the chest, 5 to the left side, 1 to the
left back, 1 to the right arm and 11 in the legs. Internal injuries
_ ruptures of the aorta, spinal cord, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney
and intestines _ were the causes of death, Ellen Borakove, a
spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, said.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the shooting, as the victim's body was taken to a
Harlem funeral home to be washed and wrapped to be sent home to
Guinea, in West Africa, for burial, there were waves of protest and
expressions of outrage by relatives and friends of Diallo, civil
rights advocates and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want justice,'' Kyle B. Watters, a lawyer representing the
victim's family, said outside 1157 Wheeler Ave., in the Soundview
section, where Diallo was slain. ``Ultimately, we want to have
these officers prosecuted and convicted and spend the rest of their
lives in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside him, the victim's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, wept
and said, ``I'm too sad to speak.'' But the Rev. Al Sharpton,
called the killing ``the worst form of police brutality we have
ever seen or heard of. This was not a police murder, this was a
police slaughter.'' He called for a federal inquiry and spoke of
plans for a protest rally on Sunday outside the victim's building.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International USA, in a statement, said the slaying
``raises deeply troubling questions about the use of excessive
force and police brutality'' and called for an independent
commission to investigate. The Center for Constitutional Rights
urged the appointment of a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders of an organization called 100 Blacks in Law
Enforcement Who Care called for a federal investigation and
contended that the Street Crimes Unit, to which the involved
officers belong, was itself a danger to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the unit that's been given carte blanche to do as it
will to the people of the city of New York, especially the
African-American community,'' said Eric Adams, a city police
lieutenant who heads 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement. While the unit
has existed for years, he said, ``it has taken a more aggressive
stance under this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said he welcomed the
involvement of federal officials, appealed to the public for calm
and patience, at least until the facts were in. He said that the
police officers all had good records and that the victim, a street
peddler who worked on 14th Street in Manhattan, had no police
record.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Standing with Police Commissioner Howard Safir at a City Hall
news briefing, the mayor said: ``It obviously troubles both the
police commissioner and me that 41 shots were fired. We don't know
the reason for it at this point, but that is what the investigation
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting, other
than the four officers. Asked why Diallo had been approached by the
police, he said: ``There are some similarities between the
individual and the sketch we have,'' a reference to a rapist being
sought, ``but beyond that, what was in their mind, whether they
thought this was that individual, is unfair to speculate at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth
Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26, all members of a Street Crimes
Unit composed of some of the city's most agressive and decorated
officers _ were on administrative leave and had not been questioned
by investigators for their department or the Bronx district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Some law-enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that the phenomenon of several officers firing many
shots is sometimes called contagious shooting: in the confusion and
heat of what one officer believes is a deadly confrontation, the
first shots may be justified, but others join in the firing as a
kind of psychological contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was, by all accounts, a pious Muslim who had never been
in trouble with the law, worked as a street peddler and sent some
of his earnings home to his family in Guinea.

IN ISLAM, BRAIN DEATH ENDS LIFE SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Islam sanctions the use of life support to keep a patient alive
as long as there is some hope of revival, but once death is
inevitable, the faithful believe that the family should accept
God's will and not keep organs functioning artificially. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guiding principle for keeping life support machines running
comes from the Al-Bakara Chapter of the Koran, verse 159, which
reads, ``Don't throw yourself into death.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That means that under Muslim law, or Sharia, much as under
strict Christianity or Judaism, doctors are expected to fight the
best fight possible to keep King Hussein alive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person is alive and on the machine, we don't pull the
plug,'' said Dr. Maher Hathout, a cardiologist and a spokesman for
the Islamic Center of Southern California. The patient is no longer
considered alive when the brain stops functioning, he said, and
then the life support should be ended.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the rules of Sharia are to accept the judgment of
God,'' said Hathout. ``If a person is terminally ill and we all
know that according to the best medical knowledge of the time that
death is certain, we want to preserve the dignity of the person by
not making him look like he is living when in reality he is not.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hathout said that while the basic guidelines for such measures
were first drawn up by a group of religious scholars and doctors at
an Islamic medical conference in Kuwait in 1985, there has been an
ongoing debate on the issue and always will be because it is such a
freighted decision for any family to make. The religious guidelines
are not always followed in practice because some family members are
not emotionally prepared to let go, he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hathout also noted that the fact that King Hussein's Hashemite
clan claims descent from the Prophet Mohammed would have no bearing
on this decision, as the same rules apply to all the faithful.  &QL;

 &HT;    Klesko sponsors senior women
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Braves outfielder Ryan Klesko has some new
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The power-hitting Klesko has agreed to sponsor the state's only
60-and-over female softball team, the Rockdale County Gran
Slammers. The 27-year-old multimillionaire will pay for the team's
October trip to Orlando, Fla., where it will represent Georgia in
the National Senior Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine being 67 years old and you've got someone like
Klesko sponsoring you?'' asked Dot Folds, who pitches and plays
first base for the Slammers. ``We feel like celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Since qualifying for the National Senior Games last summer, the
Slammers have been planning yard sales and other fund-raisers to
pay for their Orlando trip. The entry fee alone is $120 per person,
not to mention travel and hotel expenses for the 14 players, said
Slammers manager Jackie Lunsford. The tournament happens to be at
the Braves' training complex at Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Lunsford contacted Klesko through the owner of the Conyers gym
where the 6-foot-4 baseball player works out. Klesko owns a ranch
in nearby Covington, where he spends time when he's in Atlanta. The
young star immediately took a liking to the seniors, Lunsford said.
He even carried the Slammers scrapbook with him on a recent trip to
Florida, where he owns another home.
</P>
<P>
   Folds, whose 45-year-old son bought her a softball glove for
Christmas, isn't sure why Klesko has chosen to be so generous to
the Slammers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can think of is people like little bitty kids and old
folks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cool thing is, she can ask him today. Klesko is scheduled to
visit Conyers this morning to pose for a photo with the team.

NEW WINE LABELS APPROVED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government gave the wine industry
permission Friday to use bottle labels that encourage consumers to
learn about the benefits of wine, and the door seemed open for the
makers of beer and hard liquor to seek the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms approved two statements for wine labels that had been
requested by producers.
</P>
<P>
   One statement, sought by a California vintner, reads, ``The
proud people who made this wine encourage you to consult your
family doctor about the health effects of wine consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The other, sought by the Wine Institute, a trade group, tells
buyers ``to learn the health effects of wine consumption, send for
the federal government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.'' It
then gives the address of the Agriculture Department's Center for
Nutrition Policy and Promotion: 1120 20th St. NW, Washington 20036.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department emphasized that neither statement extols
the ``benefits'' of drinking wine _ that word and other positive
descriptions having been specifically rejected in negotiations with
the industry _ and that all alcoholic beverages would continue to
carry the same health warnings that have been required for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Wine Institute in San Francisco were elated
at Friday's action, issuing a statement calling it ``a historic
regulatory breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   The new labeling ``represents a defining new chapter in the
evolution of federal policy towards wine in America,'' said John De
Luca, the institute's president and chief executive. He said the
new labeling practice would be ``an essential educational component
of our public policy mission to counter efforts in some quarters to
mischaracterize wine as a `gateway drug' and a `sin' that warrants
higher taxes, trade limitations and trade restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal dietary guidelines, compiled by the Departments of
Agriculture and Health and Human Services, list the familiar health
and social harms that alcohol can cause when used to excess or
inappropriately. But they also note that ``alcoholic beverages have
been used to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies
throughout human history.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also state that moderate drinking is associated
with a lower risk of heart disease in some people. Although the
guidelines do not mention it, some recent studies have suggested
that red wine can help keep cholesterol levels down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is essential that the consumer get more knowledge
about our product,'' said Elisabeth Holmgren, the institute's
director of research and education. She said wine-makers were
confident that responsible people who study the guidelines would
conclude that the benefits of wine _ in moderation _ outweighed
harm.
</P>
<P>
   The federal dietary guidelines do not say that one type of
alcohol is better or worse than another. As a result, a Treasury
official said, if beer-makers or producers of whiskey, gin or vodka
sought similar latitude in labeling they would have a strong
position legally and politically.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Alcoholism issued a statement calling
Friday's decision ``potentially disastrous'' and suggested that
labels should define the government's standard definition of
moderate drinking: no more than one drink a day for women, two for
men.
</P>
<P>
   In emphasizing that the labels approved Friday were neutral in
their wording, Treasury General Counsel Ed Knight said the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms can, under existing law, only
reject labels if they were false or misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of the issue was underscored by the Treasury
Department's reliance on a survey conducted by the Department of
Health and Human Services. The Treasury Department said the survey
of current wine drinkers showed that the drinking habits of most
would not be affected by the two labels.

GREENE STARTS SLOWLY, BUT SIZZLES AT END 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was only minutes after Maurice Greene had defended
his Millrose Games 60 meters title Friday night. Greene bounced
giddily about the arena floor at Madison Square Garden and then
added a personal touch. He threw white T-shirts into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Written on each T-shirt was the word ``Phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world indoor record-holder at 60 meters, won a much
anticipated race with his training partner Jon Drummond, pulling
away in the final 10 meters to finish with a time of 6.51 seconds.
Drummond finished in 6.54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get the best of starts,'' Greene said. ``I know I'm
going to be a strong runner at the end of races. But in the 60
meters, you really can't rely on the end. I got lucky and was able
to pull it off. I didn't rush anything, kept calm and let it just
all come out at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 60, another American, Inger Miller, defeated
Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas in a head-to-head race. Miller is
the daughter of Lennox Miller, who twice won the men's 60 at the
Millrose Games. It is the first father-daughter combination to win
Millrose titles. There has never been a father-son combination of
Millrose champions.
</P>
<P>
   In the unique, two-person match final, Miller held an early
lead, but Fynes closed the narrow gap in the last five meters. A
lean at the tape by Fynes made the race practically a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was timed as having crossed the finish line four
one-thousandths of a second ahead of Fynes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just intent on running through the tape,'' Miller said
of her race. ``I had no idea where she was at the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first upset of the evening, Fynes defeated Chryste
Gaines, who was second in the event last year. Fynes won her heat
with a brilliant start, easily holding off a charge by Gaines, who
was expected to challenge Miller in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Mueller of Phoenix won the women's pole vault, setting
an American indoor record by clearing 14 feet 8} inches. Mueller's
vault improved the American record by a half-inch, a record set by
Stacy Dragila at Sindelfingen, Germany, in 1998. Mueller defeated a
high-profile field for this burgeoning sport, a field that she was
not expected to dominate. In previews of the event, Mueller's name
was often the last of eight listed.
</P>
<P>
   She missed three attempts at the world indoor record of 14-11{.
The world mark is 14-11 by Emma George of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 800 meters, James Nolan of University College in
Dublin appeared to have won, but as Nolan raised his hands at the
finish line, 38-year-old Johnny Gray breezed by Nolan's right
shoulder. It was Gray's third Millrose title.
</P>
<P>
   Joetta Clark failed in her bid to win her seventh women's
800-meter Millrose title. Clark was second to Meredith Valmon, a
Brooklyn native who is ranked sixth in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's hurdles, Reggie Torian won in 7.59 seconds,
defeating Larry Wade, who was second, and Dan O'Brien, who was
third. Mark Crear, the world's top-ranked hurdler, was last.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday at Manhattan College in the Bronx, the first
world record of the 1999 indoor season was set by Dawn Ellerbee in
the women's 20-pound weight throw. She bested her own indoor record
by a quarter-inch with a throw of 75-3\.
</P>
<P>
   At the midpoint of Friday night's meet, a ceremony inducted the
first five members of the Millrose Games Hall of Fame. The
inaugural class included the miler Eamonn Coughlin, who won the
Wanamaker Mile a record seven times and set the event's record of
3:53 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted was the hurdler-sprinter Harrison Dillard, a
four-time Olympic gold medalist who won the Millrose 60-yard
hurdles for nine consecutive years. Others inducted were the 400
runner Diane Dixon, the pole vaulter Bob Richards and the high
jumper John Thomas.

COCAINE ALLEGATION COULD TRIGGER LEWIS INSURANCE PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND BENJAMIN LIPSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The explosive allegations that Reggie Lewis used
cocaine could trigger an investigation by the insurance companies
that made good on his multimillion-dollar contract to the Boston
Celtics and his widow.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, William J. Dailey, the attorney for Dr. Gilbert H.
Mudge, Jr., Lewis's chief cardiologist, said ``a significant
portion'' of the $13 million to $14 million Donna Harris-Lewis
collected soon after her husband's death ``could be contested''
because Lewis denied he used cocaine on the insurance application.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the policy, Lewis said in writing that he had
never used cocaine or any other illegal drugs. But the malpractice
lawsuit against Mudge by Harris-Lewis has unearthed allegations
that Lewis had used cocaine while he was a student at Northeastern
University in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of his death in July 1993, The Equitable Life
Assurance Society of New York, which wrote the policies, paid the
Celtics $12 million of the $17 million in coverage that had been
written on Lewis and his basketball contract. Most of the money has
been paid annually to Harris-Lewis to make good on her husband's
five-year, $16 million contract with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the policy, if any substantial
misrepresentation or fraud was uncovered, Equitable could refuse to
pay the death benefit to the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the initial payment, however, Equitable launched an
investigation to determine if Lewis or anyone else had lied about
his drug use on the insurance application.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the case said Harris-Lewis declined to
answer any questions presented her by the insurance company during
the investigation. In February 1994 Equitable ended the probe and
paid the Celtics the remaining $5 million on Lewis's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge, of Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital, says that two weeks before
his death Lewis admitted that he had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, made in written answers to interrogatories, was
contained in hundreds of pages of documents submitted in the
malpractice case brought by Harris-Lewis. While the trial,
scheduled to begin in May or June, will focus on whether Mudge and
three other doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital made mistakes
that caused Lewis's death, the allegations about Lewis's possible
use of cocaine are a central issue.
</P>
<P>
   In depositions, two Northeastern officials said they had been
told by the doctor for the school's basketball team that Lewis and
another player failed a drug test for cocaine in February 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Wayne Brown, a friend of Lewis's from Baltimore and at
Northeastern, claimed he snorted and smoked cocaine with Lewis on
several occasions, and provided him the drug for free up to 20
other times.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the only witness among about 65 who have been deposed
by attorneys on both sides who has testified that he saw Lewis use
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Such testimony probably will be admitted as evidence since it is
relevant to the case's essential issue: whether negligence by Mudge
led to Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Harris-Lewis's attorney dismissed Brown's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you search and turn over every rock, a Wayne Brown will
slither out and say anything for his 15 minutes of fame,'' Robert
G. Harley said. ``Reggie Lewis was loved and admired by everyone
who knew him. The thought that he had a drug friendship with such a
lowlife would be funny if it weren't so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorneys are certain to introduce evidence to show that
Mudge, had he known Lewis had used cocaine, would have been
convinced that Lewis's heart condition was more serious than he
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Harley said he will fight against allowing Brown _ or anyone
else who says they saw Lewis do cocaine _ to testify. But other
leading medical malpractice lawyers said such testimony is likely
to be considered important and probably will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a medically relevant fact _ and it has been shown
before that cocaine use causes heart damage _ then you can be
certain that testimony about that use will be allowed in,'' said
Andrew C. Meyer, a Boston malpractice lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Meyer and others caution that such testimony could backfire.
``Jurors could easily see it that the same doctor who cost the guy
his life is now trying to take away his good name,'' said one
experienced lawyer who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possibility that allegations of drug use, fraud, and
coverup could come to light in coming months, several people who
were close to Lewis said they do not believe it will desecrate his
legacy in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was respected for not just his basketball, but the good,
quiet things he did in the community,'' said Richard Lapchick,
director of Northeastern's Center for the Study of Sport in
Society. ``He cared for the city, and that's what people will
remember.''

AUSTRALIA TO INSPECT SYDNEY BID FOR GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The ``Saturday'' in 2nd graf is CQ.) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Despite receiving a clean bill of health
from the International Olympic Committee this week, the Sydney
Olympic bidding process is now expected to be the subject of an
official inquiry at home.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Olympics minister, Michael Knight, confirmed
Saturday that he would request the appointment of an independent
investigator to examine more than 3,000 files that relate to
Sydney's successful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is to try and clear the air once and for all,'' said
Graham Cassidy, a spokesman for Knight. ``I don't think in the
current circumstances that the IOC saying the Sydney bid is clean
is good enough, especially for the sponsors, both existing and
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said Knight would put forward a resolution on Wednesday
to the board of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic
Games. If the board endorses the resolution, as expected, the
inquiry would begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a New South Wales state government minister who was not
part of the bidding team, will recommend that the Sydney committee
appoint Tom Sheridan, a former auditor-general for South Australia,
as chief investigator. Sheridan would be assisted by private
auditors and lawyers who, Cassidy said, ``never had major
involvement with the Sydney bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan would be asked to investigate whether any IOC rules
were broken by the bidding team or if any IOC members engaged in
misconduct in the bidding process. Knight said the inquiry would be
empowered to call witnesses and that the findings would be made
public, but that the bid documents would not all be released
publicly, despite considerable pressure to do so, because of
privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of protecting innocent individuals,'' Cassidy
said. ``Thousands of innocent Australians gave time and effort to
the Sydney bid, as people from other countries have for their bids.
What these people did in terms of sucking up to IOC members at the
time was considered the right thing to do. If you look at it in the
cold, hard light of now, it might be viewed differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight also wants a three-member oversight committee to be
appointed to review the findings. He has set a deadline of March 11
for the findings to be presented to the Sydney committee. That
would allow the inquiry to be completed before the IOC meets March
16-18 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to vote on revising bidding
procedures for Olympics. Cassidy said Knight also wanted the
inquiry completed before the March 27 state elections. The
elections could sweep Knight and the Labor party to which he
belongs from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the inquiry to be credible, the report has to come down
before the election,'' Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   But John Fahey, the former New South Wales premier who was in
office when Sydney won the Games in 1993, told the newspaper The
Australian that the inquiry was a ``political stunt'' timed to
coincide with the state election.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney bid has yet to come under the same level of scrutiny
as the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, but last
month the Australian Olympic Committee president, John Coates,
released documents that showed he had made offers of nearly $70,000
in sports aid to two IOC members, Charles Mukora of Kenya and
Francis Nyangwesoa of Uganda, on the eve of the vote for the 2000
Olympics. Sydney defeated Beijing by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   The documents raised concerns about impropriety, but Coates
maintained that the inducements were within IOC rules because they
were made to national Olympic committees and not individuals.
Coates has since acknowledged that at least $10,000 was sent to a
fund controlled by Mukora, although Coates said that money was
earmarked for sports programs. Mukora resigned last month after the
IOC announced it would seek his expulsion because he had accepted
$36,000 from Salt Lake City officials for his personal benefit. The
Salt Lake City payments were made to the same fund.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that link, Jacques Rogge, the IOC vice president who is
chairman of the committee overseeing Sydney's preparations, met
with Coates and Australian Olympic officials in Switzerland this
week and said the Sydney bid had broken no IOC rules. But that
announcement has not been enough to quell concerns in Sydney, and
with the Sydney committee still about $145 million short of its
sponsorship goals, more action was deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the sponsors are kicking in with community programs
related to the Olympics in 1999, and they want to do that in the
best sort of environment,'' Cassidy said. ``They don't want
lingering doubts.''

COCAINE ALLEGATION COULD TRIGGER LEWIS INSURANCE PROBE

<P>
   BOSTON _ The explosive allegations that Reggie Lewis used
cocaine could trigger an investigation by the insurance companies
that made good on his multimillion-dollar contract to the Boston
Celtics and his widow.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, William J. Dailey, the attorney for Dr. Gilbert H.
Mudge, Jr., Lewis's chief cardiologist, said ``a significant
portion'' of the $13 million to $14 million Donna Harris-Lewis
collected soon after her husband's death ``could be contested''
because Lewis denied he used cocaine on the insurance application.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the policy, Lewis said in writing that he had
never used cocaine or any other illegal drugs. But the malpractice
lawsuit against Mudge by Harris-Lewis has unearthed allegations
that Lewis had used cocaine while he was a student at Northeastern
University in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of his death in July 1993, The Equitable Life
Assurance Society of New York, which wrote the policies, paid the
Celtics $12 million of the $17 million in coverage that had been
written on Lewis and his basketball contract. Most of the money has
been paid annually to Harris-Lewis to make good on her husband's
five-year, $16 million contract with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the policy, if any substantial
misrepresentation or fraud was uncovered, Equitable could refuse to
pay the death benefit to the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the initial payment, however, Equitable launched an
investigation to determine if Lewis or anyone else had lied about
his drug use on the insurance application.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the case said Harris-Lewis declined to
answer any questions presented her by the insurance company during
the investigation. In February 1994 Equitable ended the probe and
paid the Celtics the remaining $5 million on Lewis's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge, of Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital, says that two weeks before
his death Lewis admitted that he had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, made in written answers to interrogatories, was
contained in hundreds of pages of documents submitted in the
malpractice case brought by Harris-Lewis. While the trial,
scheduled to begin in May or June, will focus on whether Mudge and
three other doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital made mistakes
that caused Lewis's death, the allegations about Lewis's possible
use of cocaine are a central issue.
</P>
<P>
   In depositions, two Northeastern officials said they had been
told by the doctor for the school's basketball team that Lewis and
another player failed a drug test for cocaine in February 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Wayne Brown, a friend of Lewis's from Baltimore and at
Northeastern, claimed he snorted and smoked cocaine with Lewis on
several occasions, and provided him the drug for free up to 20
other times.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the only witness among about 65 who have been deposed
by attorneys on both sides who has testified that he saw Lewis use
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Such testimony probably will be admitted as evidence since it is
relevant to the case's essential issue: whether negligence by Mudge
led to Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Harris-Lewis's attorney dismissed Brown's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you search and turn over every rock, a Wayne Brown will
slither out and say anything for his 15 minutes of fame,'' Robert
G. Harley said. ``Reggie Lewis was loved and admired by everyone
who knew him. The thought that he had a drug friendship with such a
lowlife would be funny if it weren't so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorneys are certain to introduce evidence to show that
Mudge, had he known Lewis had used cocaine, would have been
convinced that Lewis's heart condition was more serious than he
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Harley said he will fight against allowing Brown _ or anyone
else who says they saw Lewis do cocaine _ to testify. But other
leading medical malpractice lawyers said such testimony is likely
to be considered important and probably will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a medically relevant fact _ and it has been shown
before that cocaine use causes heart damage _ then you can be
certain that testimony about that use will be allowed in,'' said
Andrew C. Meyer, a Boston malpractice lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Meyer and others caution that such testimony could backfire.
``Jurors could easily see it that the same doctor who cost the guy
his life is now trying to take away his good name,'' said one
experienced lawyer who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possibility that allegations of drug use, fraud, and
coverup could come to light in coming months, several people who
were close to Lewis said they do not believe it will desecrate his
legacy in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was respected for not just his basketball, but the good,
quiet things he did in the community,'' said Richard Lapchick,
director of Northeastern's Center for the Study of Sport in
Society. ``He cared for the city, and that's what people will
remember.''

STANFORD CENTER LOOKS TO BREAK OUT AGAINST UCONN
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Judging by its locker room walls, this is
not a team that needs much inspiration. There is a quotation from
Aristotle painted in the shower room, and one from another
insightful philosopher, John Wooden, in the changing room. Then,
above the door, is a plaque with a belt buckle and the simple
inscription, ``Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   The aphorisms embody Tim Young, the Cardinal's 7-foot-2-inch
senior center; the belt buckle haunts him. It honors his
grandfather, Roy Young _ also known as the Phantom of Maples
Pavilion _ a longtime Stanford fan who introduced his 6-year-old
grandson to the set shot, then, 12 years later, drove here each day
to watch him develop into an elegant-passing big man.
</P>
<P>
   When No. 4 Stanford plays top-ranked Connecticut here Saturday
afternoon, Young will be marking his first birthday without his
``Grandpa.'' He turns 23 and closes out a year of highs and lows:
he was named all-Pacific 10 center as a key ingredient of
Stanford's 1998 Final Four drive, and he learned last May that his
grandfather had a fatal heart attack while making an abalone dive.
</P>
<P>
   Then there have been this season's frustrating moments, despite
Stanford's 19-3 record. Although Young now tops Stanford's career
shot-blocking list and is second in rebounds, he has fouled out of
four games. He has drawn more double teams, watched his numbers
drop and has heard too many questions about his passion for
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can do is be a presence, on defense by blocking shots,
on offense by being aware enough to hit the open guy and taking
high-percentage shots,'' Young said. ``What I can't do is be a
player or person I'm not. It won't help our team.''
</P>
<P>
   His inside play is even more important in Saturday's game,
because Stanford needs to re-energize in its final push toward the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. While
Connecticut (19-1) is coming off a loss to Syracuse and will be
without its star, Richard Hamilton, for the second straight game,
the Cardinal has been winning in spite of its stumbling play.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has trailed at halftime 10 times this season, including
in its last four games. Wednesday, the Cardinal had to come from
behind to beat California, 57-55, despite shooting 4 of 19 in the
second half. Fairly or not, the fifth-year center Young has been
pinned as a major contributor to the team's sluggishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got plenty of passion,'' said Mike Montgomery, the
irritated Stanford coach. ``The fact that he's a good kid and not
an idiot is where people tend to not understand Tim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has asked the question, `Why do people question me,
because I want our team to win rather than the focus be on me?'
which is a perfectly legitimate question,'' Montgomery added in
defense of his center. ``He's the kind of kid who does not draw
attention to himself, and some people mistake that for lack of
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his grandfather, Young is an individual with eclectic
tastes and eccentric habits. Along with Stanford basketball and
diving, Roy Young was also a gun enthusiast and connoisseur of belt
buckles. His grandson is an English major and would-be poet who
will talk about Walt Whitman's work but won't let friends or
teammates read his own efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But where the grandfather was a gregarious sort, who chatted
with anyone in the bleachers during years of countless practices,
the grandson is a very silent type. Last year at the Final Four,
Young maintained a smile along with a great distance from the
cameras and microphones.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake not talking for not caring. After the
semifinal loss to Kentucky last March, his father, Greg, found Tim
sitting forlornly on the curb in the parking garage of the team
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The senior guard Chris Weems said to forget about Young's waning
numbers _ 9 points and 6 rebounds a game this season, down from 11
points and 8 rebounds last season. Weems said Young's understated
dignity was the foundation of the national title contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team that bumps chests and slams lockers; we're
about poise and being smart and steady on the court,'' Weems said.
</P>
<P>
   Young has endured far rougher stretches than this patch in his
career. He was redshirted for his sophomore season after a bulging
disk in his back made it nearly impossible for him to move and
prompted months of strenuous rehabilitation. He still needs to
stretch his back an hour a day and has trouble sitting for even
short periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room here, he bounced from one chair to another
stretching in between _ all the while nibbling on a bagel and
trying to avoid reporters' questions. He buys in to Aristotle's
inscribed wisdom: ``We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then
is not an act, but a habit.'' And to Wooden's: ``It's amazing how
much can be accomplished, if no one cares who gets the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Young does, however, acknowledge the belt buckle and the fact
that a big performance in a big victory would mean a lot. At the
end of the season, one Cardinal will find his name above the buckle
as the first recipient of the Roy Young award, given for toughness.
Wouldn't it be nice, he was asked, if this game put his name on the
plaque?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great celebration,'' he said. ``A really, really
great one.'' &QL;

   ABOUT-CARS-SATURN (Detroit) _ Necessity is the mother of
invention, and for the Saturn Corp. of General Motors, a rather
simple invention is generating a much-needed lift in sales of its
aging car line. After a recent test-drive of a Saturn SC2, I was
not surprised that the new coupe was doing so well. Even with the
third door, which is nearly invisible when the doors are closed,
the car has the sporty look that two-door buyers like. Yet the
third door opens new markets: Most Saturn coupe owners are single,

rear-hinged doors became known as suicide doors because passengers
in those pre-safety belt days could open the doors, which would
catch the wind from the moving car making it impossible to close
them while the car was in motion, and risked falling out of the
vehicle. The biggest difference between the suicide doors of old
and the rear-hinged access door on the three-door Saturn coupe and
some extended cab pickups is the rear doors cannot be opened unless
the front door is open. By Michelle Krebs. (Moved).

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS JOIN INVESTIGATION OF POLICE KILLING OF UNARMED
IMMIGRANT 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   with KIT R. ROANE  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  NEW YORK _ Federal officials joined a widening city
investigation on Friday into the killing of an unarmed West African
immigrant by four police officers who fired 41 shots in a ferocious
barrage that remained officially unexplained even as controversy
over the case spread from City Hall to the streets of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, said her office
would ``work closely'' with the Bronx district attorney, Robert T.
Johnson, in the inquiry into the shooting early on Thursday of
22-year-old Amadou Diallo by officers who confronted him at the
vestibule of his Bronx building.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. White offered no elaboration, legal experts said the
early federal intervention was highly unusual, perhaps intended as
public reassurance in an explosive case that was already drawing
comparisons to those of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant
tortured in a Brooklyn station house in 1997, and Anthony Baez, who
died in a Bronx struggle with Officer Francis X. Livoti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and the officers involved in Diallo's death were
keeping an official silence, and there were few facts to go on in a
case that had the earmarks of a tragedy and seemed to crystallize
the apprehensions of New York's minorities over aggressive police
policies. The victim was black and the four officers involved are
white.
</P>
<P>
   But an unofficial account was provided in an interview by
Stephen Worth, a lawyer who was hired through the auspices of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to represent the four officers,
all members of the Bronx Street Crimes Unit, who were searching for
a rapist when the fatal encounter occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Worth quoted the officers as saying they were driving along
Wheeler Avenue in an unmarked car when they first saw Diallo in the
vestibule of his building. He was acting ``suspiciously,'' they
said, and they thought he resembled the sketch of a rapist they
were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer did not elaborate on the suspicious behavior, but
another person familiar with the officers account _ all four gave
roughly the same story _ said Diallo appeared to be fumbling with
something as he went in the door to the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is acting strange; he fits the rapist's description in a
generic way,'' Worth said. The officers, in plain clothes, got out
of their car, he said, approached Diallo and identified themselves
as police officers. ``Despite repeated identifications and orders
to this individual to do certain things, he failed to comply,''
Worth said. He declined to say what the orders were.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his refusal to comply, Diallo exhibited
``aggressive behavior,'' which Worth refused to define. ``There may
have been a language problem in terms of his understanding their
directions,'' Worth acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the officers had drawn their guns _ each had a
16-shot 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol _ and Diallo may have
made some movement or gesture they took to be threatening, Worth
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other person familiar with the officers' account quoted them
as saying Diallo, who was carrying only a wallet and a beeper,
moved his hands and arms in a way that made the officers think he
was going for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said the officers then opened fire because they thought he
had a gun. ``The reason they are shooting him is they think he has
the gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the many shots fired, Worth, said: ``The reason they
are given this kind of firepower is to neutralize what they
perceive as a threat. While it may seem to a layman to be
excessive, it was the number required before this man stopped. All
41 shots did not hit this individual.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy on Friday found that Diallo suffered 19 gunshot
wounds _ 1 to the front of the chest, 5 to the left side, 1 to the
left back, 1 to the right arm and 11 in the legs. Internal injuries
_ ruptures of the aorta, spinal cord, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney
and intestines _ were the causes of death, Ellen Borakove, a
spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, said.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the shooting, as the victim's body was taken to a
Harlem funeral home to be washed and wrapped to be sent home to
Guinea, in West Africa, for burial, there were waves of protest and
expressions of outrage by relatives and friends of Diallo, civil
rights advocates and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want justice,'' Kyle B. Watters, a lawyer representing the
victim's family, said outside 1157 Wheeler Ave., in the Soundview
section, where Diallo was slain. ``Ultimately, we want to have
these officers prosecuted and convicted and spend the rest of their
lives in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside him, the victim's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, wept
and said, ``I'm too sad to speak.'' But the Rev. Al Sharpton,
called the killing ``the worst form of police brutality we have
ever seen or heard of. This was not a police murder, this was a
police slaughter.'' He called for a federal inquiry and spoke of
plans for a protest rally on Sunday outside the victim's building.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International USA, in a statement, said the slaying
``raises deeply troubling questions about the use of excessive
force and police brutality'' and called for an independent
commission to investigate. The Center for Constitutional Rights
urged the appointment of a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders of an organization called 100 Blacks in Law
Enforcement Who Care called for a federal investigation and
contended that the Street Crimes Unit, to which the involved
officers belong, was itself a danger to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the unit that's been given carte blanche to do as it
will to the people of the city of New York, especially the
African-American community,'' said Eric Adams, a city police
lieutenant who heads 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement. While the unit
has existed for years, he said, ``it has taken a more aggressive
stance under this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said he welcomed the
involvement of federal officials, appealed to the public for calm
and patience, at least until the facts were in. He said that the
police officers all had good records and that the victim, a street
peddler who worked on 14th Street in Manhattan, had no police
record.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Standing with Police Commissioner Howard Safir at a City Hall
news briefing, the mayor said: ``It obviously troubles both the
police commissioner and me that 41 shots were fired. We don't know
the reason for it at this point, but that is what the investigation
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting, other
than the four officers. Asked why Diallo had been approached by the
police, he said: ``There are some similarities between the
individual and the sketch we have,'' a reference to a rapist being
sought, ``but beyond that, what was in their mind, whether they
thought this was that individual, is unfair to speculate at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth
Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26, all members of a Street Crimes
Unit composed of some of the city's most agressive and decorated
officers _ were on administrative leave and had not been questioned
by investigators for their department or the Bronx district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Some law-enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that the phenomenon of several officers firing many
shots is sometimes called contagious shooting: in the confusion and
heat of what one officer believes is a deadly confrontation, the
first shots may be justified, but others join in the firing as a
kind of psychological contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was, by all accounts, a pious Muslim who had never been
in trouble with the law, worked as a street peddler and sent some
of his earnings home to his family in Guinea.

<P>
   &LR;  AMMAN, Jordan _ Jordan's next government will remain committed
to peace in the Middle East and close relations with Washington but
wary of both Iran and Iraq, Crown Prince Abdullah said this week in
his first interview since he was designated successor to his
father, King Hussein. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an extension of his majesty's outlook and his majesty's
beliefs,'' said the 37-year-old brigadier general, in speech that
was British in tone but American in rhythm and vernacular. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interview with several visiting foreign reporters took place
on Thursday in Raghadan Palace, on an off-the-record basis. But
Friday night, as Hussein's death appeared imminent, the prince's
aides authorized publication of the wide-ranging conversation,
which they said was intended in part to set the record straight on
the circumstances of his selection two weeks ago to replace his
uncle as crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Crown Prince Abdullah discussed his nuanced
views of other regional diplomatic challenges; his strained
relationship with his uncle, the former Crown Prince Hassan, and
his vision of the future of the Jordanian monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest immediate internal concern, it seems, is to close
family ranks behind him as he prepares to take the throne just
weeks after his father unceremoniously deposed Hassan after 34
years as Hussein's designated successor.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah said he learned of his father's decision just
one day before it was announced publicly and the king left Jordan
for a second bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   He denied published reports that he had flown secretly to
Minnesota in the fall to complain to his father about Hassan, who
was then crown prince. All the king's 12 children visited him
during the six months he spent being treated abroad, he said, and
he had stayed for a few days at the end of September and early
October.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah said he greatly admired his uncle, Hassan; had
frequently turned to him for counsel, and was confident that his
uncle would play a senior advisory role in the new regime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an issue between two brothers,'' Prince Abdullah
said. Hussein wanted ``to have the legitimacy go back into his
line,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet shortly after the prince returned from his visit to his
father at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, he gave a rare interview to
an Arab-language weekly noting that he had been crown prince
himself until he was 3 and that there was nothing to prevent
reverting to the traditional line of succession _ the first
indication to palace-watchers here that such a change was being
contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   And in the interview on Thursday, Prince Abdullah made it clear
that he too thought Hassan had recently been too much the acting
king, and not enough the loyal deputy. ``The role of a crown prince
should be to keep a low profile,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to refer to his family's dynasty, saying, &UR;  &LR; ``The
Hashemites are the unifying factor of Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what binds us together, Palestinians and Bedouins and
everyone else,'' he said, sitting next to his half brother, the
23-year-old Prince Ali, who was once seen as his father's most
likely successor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who will be king of Jordan is a personable career
military officer with his father's quick smile and unfeigned
modesty. He shares as well his father's deep distrust of Shiite
radicalism, unfettered democracy and other perceived threats to the
stability of Jordan and the survival of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is quite unlike Hussein, he acknowledged, in the
circumstances of his ascension to the throne and in his
relationships with his peers in the region, whose fathers were in
many cases mortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Externally, he wants above all to reassure the world that the
succession in Amman will not change the foreign policy crafted so
carefully by Hussein. Jordan's desire for a permanent peace between
``our friends in Israel and our friends in the PNA,'' the
Palestinian National Authority, will remain its chief diplomatic
priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when discussing the delicately balanced Jordanian policy
toward Iraq, Crown Prince Abdullah seemed somewhat closer to the
American position. His father supported Iraq, Jordan's neighbor and
major trading partner, when other nations were arrayed against Iraq
during the Persian Gulf War and has since been a critic of U.N.
sanctions that has caused suffering among the Iraqi people &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The prince said that Saddam still poses a threat to Kuwait and
that Jordan would support a ``change'' in Iraq's regime. He said he
agreed with U.S. policymakers that there was ``no hope'' that
Saddam would voluntarily change his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the same sheet of music, so to speak,'' he said,
referring to his discussions on Iraq here last week with Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran poses a more serious destabilizing threat to the
region, he said, warning that the liberalizing forces represented
by President Mohammed Khatami remain very much a minority.
</P>
<P>
   Belying his image as a political novice, he spoke knowledgeably
of the diverse pressures facing his country and its neighbors and
used candor and charm to challenge the widespread notion that his
sudden ascension had strained relations within the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to emphasize the practical utility to a future
monarch of his army career, which began with eight years in desert
bases ``in the middle of nowhere,'' but more recently made him the
country's chief military envoy. He is comfortable with ordinary
Jordanians, because he has lived like an ordinary Jordanian
soldier, he said. And he has developed a close circle of
professional friends in the armies of Israel, the Persian Gulf
states and the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah spoke especially warmly of his friendships in
other royal families in the Arab world, and sympathetically of
their desires to fight Islamic fundamentalism and retain some of
their dynastic privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them shared American educations and an American belief
in free-market economics, he noted. ``We went to the same
schools,'' said the prince, who attended prep school at Deerfield
Academy in Massachusetts and went on to study at Sandhurst, the
elite British military college. ``We ate in the same restaurants.
We like the same movies. We have a lot in common, and we have all
become very good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Princess Rania, is a Palestinian whom he married in
1993, and they have a son, Prince Hussein, and a daughter, Princess
Iman.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting himself as a modern monarch-in-waiting whose goal is
liberalize the economy and open up the political system, Prince
Abdullah demurred when asked if the dynasty might, under his reign,
subordinate its near-feudal power to a constitutionally protected
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is not something that can be done overnight,'' he
said. ``It is a learning experience. It is also a discipline.
Because we have a democracy, it doesn't mean that people can take
things into their own hands.''

TIME FOR DONNA LEWIS TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years ago, the world shook when the Brinks garage in
Boston's North End was robbed of more than $1 million. It was
called the greatest heist of all time and it spawned at least two
movies and a half-dozen books.
</P>
<P>
   But in my opinion, the Brinks job was chump change compared to
the fraud revealed when Reggie Lewis collapsed and later died on
the basketball floor at Brandeis in the summer of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   There was more than $15 million at stake in that deal, and it
was the money that was at the center of the sequence of events that
will continue to unfold in a Massachusetts courtroom unless there
is a settlement in the malpractice suit brought by Reggie's widow,
Donna Harris-Lewis, against Dr. Gilbert Mudge and three associates
from Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis signed what turned out to be his last contract with
the Celtics, and the insurance policy that went with it, he was
asked on the form if he had ever used drugs. He answered no. Unless
a whole bunch of people are lying, that was a lie. And when he
lied, that was fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis, who steadfastly has maintained that her husband
never used drugs, has collected most of the $15 million due from
his contract and life insurance policies. Yet she is suing four
doctors for more, saying they were the reason he died.
</P>
<P>
   It was written into Lewis's contract that if for some reason he
could not play because of drugs, he would not get paid.
</P>
<P>
   So when he collapsed at Boston Garden during a playoff game
against the Charlotte Hornets April 29, 1993, and was taken to New
England Baptist Hospital the next day, there was $15 million at
risk if he could never play again.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of examination, 12 of Boston's finest
cardiologists concluded that Lewis had a serious heart problem and
thought cocaine use might have triggered it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the so-called Dream Team of doctors offered it as
the possible No. 1 reason for Lewis's heart troubles, the Celtics
and Harris-Lewis wanted to hear none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnold Scheller, the Celtics physician, said drugs were not
an issue, though the top cardiologists wanted to make it one.
</P>
<P>
   And Harris-Lewis saw to it that they would not continue to make
it an issue with the first of a series of strange moves on her
part.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband was getting some of the greatest medical
advice available in the world at New England Baptist, Harris-Lewis
excused herself from the room and the discussion of Reggie's
possible use of drugs. She went down the hall, into the women's
room, and pulled out a cellular telephone. She called a friend
she'd worked with at Brigham and Women's and told him she wanted to
get Reggie out of the Baptist immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Harris-Lewis personally took Reggie out of his
room, down the elevator, and out of the hospital against the wishes
of the nurse on duty. The Globe's Steve Fainaru was in the
vestibule of the hospital writing his story on the day's activities
and witnessed this whole crazy episode. Have you ever heard of
anyone going to a top-flight hospital late at night to transfer a
patient when that patient is getting advice from a team of the
greatest doctors in the world?
</P>
<P>
   It now became clearly important to Lewis's family and the
Celtics that Reggie be cleared of any charges of using drugs. A
public disclosure of drug use could forever tarnish his reputation
and could jeopardize $15 million that was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   I found it very curious that when Mudge, whom Harris-Lewis
appointed as Reggie's doctor, called for a meeting of the Celtics
doctors to get all information he possibly could for background,
those doctors didn't show. Dave Gavitt and Jan Volk, who at the
time were the Celtics' chief executive officer and general manager,
respectively, showed, but not the team doctors whom Mudge had
requested.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were in for approximately $7 million in this deal.
They had overinsured Lewis by that much. Lewis signed a deal worth
approximately $16 million over five years. The team insured the
contract for $17 million. When Lewis died, he had played two years
of the contract. Harris-Lewis would collect about $10 million from
that and more from life insurance policies. The Celtics had $7
million that went directly into their pocket.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this meeting that the Celtics made clear that Lewis
wouldn't be playing for them anymore. Harris-Lewis became upset and
told Reggie that basically, he didn't need the Celtics, he could go
play for Miami, because Reggie supposedly had told her previously
that he would like to play for the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent meeting, Harris-Lewis, according to Mudge, told
Mudge she didn't want him talking to either the Celtics or the
insurance company about Reggie.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge says in his statement filed in court this week that on
five occasions, he asked Lewis about cocaine use. The first four
times, Lewis said no. The fifth time, according to Mudge, he
admitted he had.
</P>
<P>
   This was the suspicion of the Dream Team right from the start.
Their examination of Lewis in the days after he collapsed led them
to believe that the use of cocaine caused cardiomyopathy _ or a
scarring of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis died in the early evening of July 27 at Newton-Wellesley
Hospital after shooting baskets at the Celtics' practice facility
at Brandeis University in Waltham. At approximately 9 that night,
according to depositions taken for this trial, Harris-Lewis went to
the Celtics locker room at Brandeis, unannounced, and told the
security guard she wanted to clean out her husband's locker, which
she did.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four hours after her husband was pronounced dead, she
was cleaning out his locker. Did you ever hear of anyone going to
her husband's desk at work hours after he died to clean it out?
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, Lewis was treated as a hero. There
was the televised funeral procession from Northeastern to Forest
Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, where Lewis now rests.
</P>
<P>
   Because I was the first one to raise the possibility that drugs
had contributed to Lewis's death I am constantly being asked: what
is Donna Harris-Lewis thinking about with this malpractice suit?
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea. Even if she convinces some judge or jury that
Mudge and his associates are responsible for Reggie's death, how
much more money does she need?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reggie is being dragged through the mud. His personal
life is being exposed, and as it is, Harris-Lewis sits right in
front of people being deposed and never blinks an eye, according to
witnesses, no matter what is said about her husband.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months after the Patriots were crushed in the 1986
Super Bowl by the Chicago Bears, I was sitting with John Madden at
an NFL meeting when the subject of drugs came up.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you forget, in one of the dumbest moves ever, coach Raymond
Berry came out the day following the Super Bowl, after the Globe's
Ron Borges had unearthed the details, and said at least a
half-dozen members of the Patriots had used drugs that season.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, the television analyst and former Oakland Raiders coach,
said something I will never forget: ``When it comes to drugs,
everyone lies. No one wants to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of this writer, if Lewis had told the truth from
the start and leveled with the Dream Team of doctors and Mudge, he
would have been treated accordingly and might be alive today. He
would have never played again. And he probably would not have been
paid. But he might be alive, and now Donna Harris-Lewis would not
be chasing Mudge and his associates for more money. It's time for
her to look in the mirror.

SCIENCE, NOT OUTCRY, TO DRIVE BASEBALL'S DECISION ON ANDRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials of Major League Baseball and its union shattered the
perception on Friday that they do not want to ban the dietary
supplement Mark McGwire acknowledged using last season because the
act would tarnish McGwire's home run record and detract from the
smashing success of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione, the supplement, is the subject of a study by
two Harvard doctors that is being funded by baseball and the Major
League Baseball Players Association. One of the researchers, Dr.
Benjamin Leder, said Friday that he did not expect results to be
ready for publication until after the start of the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has come under attack in the past week
from officials of the International Olympic Committee over its
failure to ban andro. McGwire especially has been singled out, with
an IOC vice president calling him ``a national hero all souped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, when baseball was initially criticized for its
position, management and union officials said they would undertake
a study to determine whether andro should be banned. As months have
gone by with no word on the study, skeptics have suggested that
officials were in no hurry to act on andro because they did not
want to do anything to taint McGwire's 70 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly tell you that has never entered into our
thinking on the subject,'' said Gene Orza, the union's No. 2
official. ``The implication is, if we had negative information on
it, we'd hold it back. The acclaim visited upon the sport would be
dampened and 1999 didn't hold out as great promise as 1998 showed.
That is absolutely foreign to what has been discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Manfred, management's chief labor executive, echoed Orza's
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball's posture,'' he said, ``has been driven by a desire
to understand and have a good scientific basis for what we do as
opposed to having concern for any particular player and whether he
uses it. Our policy will not be driven by public relations but by
what the scientific information shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Orza and Manfred said that no full-scale scientific study had
been done on andro so no one really knows what it does and what
effect it has on people who take it. Andro, which is banned in the
Olympics, supposedly increases the level of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Leder, who is conducting the study with Dr. Joel Finkelstein,
said they were primarily studying ``what will happen to the
hormonal levels in men who take it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a study to determine if it helps people
athletically, is performance enhancing, builds muscle mass or acts
in any functional way,'' Leder added. ``That's not the purpose of
this study.''
</P>
<P>
   Leder declined to discuss specifics of the project, which he
said was under way, but said it involved three groups of men, two
of which would receive different doses of andro. The third would be
a control group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the results were known, Orza said, the players association
would not be concerned with records or fan attendance at games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to protect baseball players,'' he said. ``If we
found that andro is bad for you, we'd have no hesitancy in saying,
`Guys, it's dangerous for you.' But right now we don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's associate general counsel noted the existence of
some reports purporting to know the effects of andro, but he called
them fly-by-night studies that have no scientific value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be railroaded by people's positions or
their refusal to be patient while we study it,'' Orza said. ``We
don't want to be political in our judgment. Anyone who studies the
field of andro knows there is no science out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Orza was sharply critical of Richard Pound of Canada, an IOC
vice president who made the remark about McGwire's being souped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Pound has done, what all these guys have done, is just
reprehensible,'' Orza said. ``They know so little. Ask Pound what
he knows about this. Ask him what the pathway is from
androstenedione to testosterone.''
</P>
<P>
   And if baseball were to ban the supplement, Orza added, McGwire
and his feat would not be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did nothing illegal,'' Orza said. ``All he did was try to
train better.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is not the only major sport that does not
ban androstenedione. The National Basketball Association and the
National Hockey League also do not. Baseball has been singled out
because McGwire's acknowledgment that he was using andro called
attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League and the NCAA, like the Olympics,
ban the supplement.

IMMIGRANT NEWSPAPER STIRS VIOLENT PASSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twice in the last 15 years, Shafqat Chughtai founded
Urdu-language newspapers to serve Pakistani immigrants; and twice,
exhausted financially and emotionally by the effort, he shut them
down.
</P>
<P>
   When he decided two years ago to venture back into publishing,
he said it was the same old story: a desire to make his voice heard
on subjects that matter to Midwood, the struggling working-class
Brooklyn neighborhood where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   But Chughtai got more than a platform. Like many immigrant
editors who write about their neighbors and community leaders,
often in sensationalist language, he earned enemies, a fact made
vividly clear Monday night when a gang of bat-wielding men burst
into the office of his newspaper, Sada-E-Pakistan, and beat him up.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Pakistani travel-agency owner, Zakir Siddiqui, who
had been accused in Chughtai's newspaper of cheating his fellow
immigrants, has been arrested and charged with ordering the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has shaken the immigrant neighborhood because of
its violence. But few of the people who went to see Chughtai on
Friday after he returned from the hospital _ as either supporters
or critics _ expressed surprise that a lone writer on a small
newspaper in a tight-knit immigrant neighborhood could have created
such a big noise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Chughtai's supporters say they fear more trouble. ``It's
not going to be the end of the story,'' said Zhanna Kazakevich, who
works for an insurance brokerage in the same building as
Sada-E-Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where surging immigration has created a market for
at least 140 immigrant-run publications, the papers typically have
more clout than their relatively small circulation would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Their editors, most from countries where a free press is young
or undeveloped, are often celebrities in their own immigrant
communities, with wide latitude to purvey gossip as well as expose
local corruption, because few of their readers are likely to sue
them for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Chughtai, whose nickname is Sunny, came to the United States
from a village in central Pakistan 23 years ago, first working as a
bus driver and eventually saving enough money to open a driving
school. The newspaper and the driving school share a tiny cluttered
office.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, which Chughtai said has a free circulation of
10,000, loses money. He said he keeps it running out of a sense of
duty and stubbornness. ``People offer money to try to buy me out of
writing against them,'' he said. ``But I always say, you can't buy
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chughtai has written articles critical of many prominent
Pakistani immigrants in the neighborhood. One neighborhood
businessman, Mohammed Tariq, said Chughtai should not criticize his
neighbors. ``If there's a little problem, he makes it a big
issue,'' he said. ``He writes bad things and then people are not
going to go to your business and then you go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Tariq and others in the neighborhood critical of Chughtai's
practices said they condemned the violent attack that left Chughtai
with bruises, facial cuts and a broken arm. They stood in front of
the paper's offices Friday in a brisk cold wind, surrounded by a
few men holding hand-written signs that called Sada-E-Pakistan ``a
shame'' for the Pakistani people.
</P>
<P>
   About a block away, however, friends of the injured publisher
lifted him, in his wheelchair, onto a makeshift stage on the
sidewalk. They surrounded Chughtai with professionally printed
signs that read ``We condemn the action of anti-press mafia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this thicket of personal and business feuds, where being
mentioned in the local newspaper may either be cause for fury or
proof that someone is a big shot, Chughtai recently found himself
locked in battle with Siddiqui, 48, of Old Brookville, one of the
best-known Pakistani business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Siddiqui, the owner of Peak Time Travel in
Brooklyn, became the chairman of the annual Pakistani Day parade, a
post that confers great local prestige. Chughtai went on the
attack, writing that Siddiqui bought himself the job and used the
parade as a cover to bring illegal Pakistani immigrants into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also attacked Siddiqui's business practices, accusing the
travel-agency owner of knowingly selling invalid airline tickets
that left his Pakistani customers stranded at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The articles were not written in a dispassionate tone. They were
written in fiery language, according to several people fluent in
Urdu who read them.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Sadiq, a local real-estate salesman, said he spoke with
Siddiqui after the latest articles were published and found him
distraught and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a business; he was under pressure,'' recalled Sadiq,
who said he used to run the Pakistani Day parade but quit because
of the constant backbiting that came as the price of prestige. ``I
advised him not to take the wrong step. I said people write things
in the newspaper and nobody pays attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, to his supporters, Chughtai is a hero of press freedom.
``The media should be free,'' said Sarfarz Cheema, a neighborhood
businessman. Anyone who would order a journalist's beating, he
added, would ``want to make it be like in Pakistan,'' where
``nobody has the right to open his mouth.''

TROOPER ACCUSES N.J. STATE POLICE OF RACIAL PROFILING
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A 10-year veteran of the New Jersey State Police
has accused fellow state troopers of using race-based profiles to
stop black and Hispanic drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike in the
hope of making drug arrests, according to court papers filed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper, Emblez Longoria, made the allegations in a lawsuit
filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton. The suit also says that
Longoria, who is of Puerto Rican descent, has been the victim of
discrimination, including being denied positions he has repeatedly
sought. At a recent assignment, he found a pacifier nailed to his
mailbox, along with various ``derogatory and offensive
statements,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Longoria's lawyer says he is the first state trooper on active
duty who has claimed that members of the state police are involved
in racial profiling _ stopping cars for no reason other than the
occupants' race or nationality _ which is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Longoria said that he had heard about
profiling, but that he did not learn firsthand of the practice
until a tour of duty on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Longoria said in court papers, he was required to
``stop motorists clearly on the basis of race and/or perceived
nationality, so as to interdict drug trafficking, and boost his
arrest statistics.'' The filing of the suit was first reported
Friday in The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The state has consistently dismissed allegations of profiling.
The most recent furor occurred last year after an April 23 shooting
incident on the New Jersey Turnpike in which state troopers stopped
a van carrying four New York City residents: three black men and
one Hispanic man.
</P>
<P>
   The police contend that they stopped the van because it was
speeding, and that they began firing shots at the van after it went
into reverse, striking one of the troopers. Three of the men in the
van were wounded, two seriously. The occupants of the van said that
they were not speeding, and that the van went into reverse by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A special state prosecutor is still investigating the case. Last
month, the four young men helped state police investigators
recreate some aspects of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Longoria's lawsuit, Col. Carl Williams,
superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, said Friday that he
could not comment on the specifics of the lawsuit. But he insisted
that the state police did not condone the use of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have continued to maintain, it is extremely important
that state troopers and the public understand that racial profiling
_ or any form of discrimination for that matter _ is not, and will
not be, tolerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Moran, the lawyer representing Longoria, said his client
was ordered by superiors to use the tactics of racial profiling
when he began a tour of duty in 1997 on the turnpike to ``make his
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran said Longoria was concerned that he would ``not be backed
up'' if he did not follow the orders. He soon requested, and was
granted, a transfer from duty on the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Longoria's lawsuit also alleges that the state police have
discriminated against him, most recently by reassigning him to a
position at Fort Dix last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said his client had been punished for his friendship with
another state trooper, Sgt. Vincent Bellaran, who won a racial
harassment verdict against the state police in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Moran also represented Bellaran and two other state troopers who
have brought discrimination suits against the New Jersey State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   David Ironman, a Staten Island lawyer who, along with Johnnie
Cochran, represents two of the young men injured in the April 23
shooting incident, said the latest lawsuit was further proof that
the troopers routinely engaged in profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, as our investigation has indicated, that it is a
pattern and a practice that is encouraged,'' Ironman said. ``I am
sure the New Jersey authorities will deny once again that it
occurs, but this is one of their own troopers, alleging it in his
complaint.''

AS CALIPARI FRETS, NETS ARE UPBEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New Jersey Nets begin a new season Saturday night,
and many observers have anointed them contenders to win the Eastern
Conference title. Others have called the uptempo, sharp-witted team
the most refreshing, entertaining act in the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, as coach John Calipari prepared for the opener
against the Atlanta Hawks at the Georgia Dome, he did not seem like
the sanguine coach of a team on the cusp of something big.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Calipari looked weary and apprehensive. Injuries will
do that. Two of Calipari's top seven players, the starting guard
Kerry Kittles (bruised right knee) and center Rony Seikaly (left
ankle), are sidelined for at least the next week or two. Chris
Gatling, the high-scoring sixth man, did not practice Friday
because of a sore left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   While Gatling said he would play Saturday, he was listed as
questionable. Calipari is hoping to get a quarter of play out of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really make us thin on the front line if he's not
able to play,'' Calipari said. ``I hope he can give us a few
minutes. It'd be nice to say, `Just get in there for 10 minutes and
hold the fort down,' because our other option is going to be Brian
Evans.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that is not enough to dampen his spirits, Calipari has to
worry about Sam Cassell, his starting point guard, who has been
bothered by back spasms for a week. Cassell will play against
Atlanta, but for how long and with how much gusto remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Nets still have proven backups in Jim McIlvaine,
Scott Burrell and Eric Murdock, Calipari, who held a practice with
only seven players Wednesday and eight Thursday, is dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little worried,'' he said. ``I'm just not sure where we
are. I just hope every other team is in the exact same boat we are
in. If you say to me, `Boy, you guys are really ready to get out of
the gate,' I'm saying, `No, we're not.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Calipari has talked about the possibility of the Nets
losing their first four games, he need only think back to last
season to rekindle his optimism. With both Kittles and Keith Van
Horn out, the Nets won four of their first five games, including
victories over Indiana and Miami. And though injuries continued to
decimate their lineup, the Nets went on to earn their first playoff
berth in three years.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, while Calipari frets, his players refuse to get
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in good spirits because we've always been a deep
team,'' Van Horn said. ``Regardless of the injuries we have, I feel
confident with the guys that we're putting on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, ouchy back and all, is typically assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Keith today that me and him have to hold the fort down
until Kerry gets ready to play,'' said Cassell, who averaged 19.6
points to Van Horn's 19.7 last season. ``Gatling is questionable,
too. But my firepower and Keith's firepower is enough to carry us
through.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Kittles, Cassell's backcourt mate will be
Lucious Harris, a sixth-year veteran beginning his second season
with the Nets. Harris, who will be making his 36th career start and
first for the Nets, averaged 3.8 points in 13.4 minutes last
season. His strength is his jump shot, and he also takes the ball
strong to the basket in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him to do what he did for us last year, which was pick
up the pace of the game,'' Calipari said. ``He has to make open
shots. If he's not making open shots, it's a different ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris will have to play his optimum game to stay with Atlanta's
Steve Smith, one of the best shooting guards in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who averaged 21 points in three games _ one victory _
against the Nets last season, leads a Hawks starting five that is
among the league's finest.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Smith, point guard Mookie Blaylock, forwards Alan
Henderson and LaPhonso Ellis, and center Dikembe Mutombo, the
Hawks, who also improved their bench, might be as good as anyone in
the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, who played host to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday
and will visit the Nets on Sunday, can cry foul against the
league's schedule-makers for giving them three games in the
season's first three days. But Calipari would certainly cover his
ears, saying that if anyone has a reason to complain it is him.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   JAYSON WILLIAMS' scheduled appearance on Friday's ``Good Morning
America'' was canceled because of the illness of KING HUSSEIN. At
12:30 a.m., Williams was informed of the decision. ``They said they
think I'm a little too funny to be on the show,'' Williams said. &QL;

ASSAULT SENDS TYSON TO JAIL FOR UP TO A YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ It ended like it began for Mike Tyson _ in
poverty and in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The former heavyweight boxing champion lost his fight for
freedom Friday when he was sentenced to up to a year in prison on
two counts of misdemeanor assault stemming from an altercation with
two motorists following a minor three-car accident last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stephen Johnson imposed the sentence after a nearly
three-hour hearing, during which Tyson's attorneys claimed he is
bankrupt and would be unable to resume his boxing career ``if given
even one day of jail time.'' Johnson remanded Tyson, who pleaded no
contest to the charges, to the Montgomery County Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was given two concurrent two-year sentences, with all but
one year suspended. He also was fined $5,000 and placed on two
years' probation after completing his sentence _ which could be in
six months if he gets time off for good beahvior. But he also may
face additional jail time for violating parole in Indiana, where he
served 3 1/2 years of a six-year sentence for a 1991 rape
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   His probation in Indiana does not end until next month. Judge
Patricia Gifford, who is now on the Indiana Supreme Court but still
has jurisdiction over his case, could force him to complete some or
all of the remainder of that sentence.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Friday's ruling, Tyson will be required to
perform 400 hours of community service upon his release, and
Johnson gave him 30 days to appeal the sentence. He will be held
without bond until a bail hearing next week.
</P>
<P>
   There was an audible gasp from nearly all of the 190 spectators
who packed Courtroom 1 of the Montgomery County Courthouse when
Johnson came back following defense attorney Paul Kemp's 42-minute
closing argument and said Tyson, who was convicted of
purse-snatching as a 12-year-old, ``repeatedly speaks and acts
compulsively and violently, especially when not under supervision.
Unfortunately, this court cannot look into Mike Tyson's soul, and
so we have two conflicting views of this defendant . . . but
reviewing his prior conviction of a crime of violence _ rape _ and
a juvenile record of theft and violence and the fact he lashed out
at two people unknown to him in ways that were assaultive . . . the
court sees this as a tragic example of potentially lethal road
rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then asked Tyson to stand and in a clear voice sentenced
him for his actions in the aftermath of the accident in
Gaithersburg Aug. 31. On that day, a car driven by his wife, Dr.
Monica Turner, in which Tyson was a passenger was struck in the
rear in a chain-reaction collision that did minor damage. Tyson
kicked one motorist and punched another in the ensuing
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's broad shoulders slumped but he did not utter a word as
Johnson announced his verdict. His wife leaned forward and put her
face in her hands in obvious shock, tears rolling down her cheeks.
Tyson never turned to look at her or his lawyers, instead staring
straight at Johnson until four sheriff's deputies handcuffed him
and led him away.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Turner had told the judge in a quivering voice, ``My
husband is a good-hearted person. He does not deserve even one
minute in jail. He had no intention of hurting these gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was mute throughout the hearing but handed Johnson a
letter that the judge read aloud in which the boxer stated, ``Jail
would mean I lose everything. Please be fair with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler, who took
office last month, surprised Tyson's legal team a week ago when he
said he would press for jail time despite a plea agreement
negotiated by his predecessor that Tyson believed prevented that.
The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, also asked
Johnson that Tyson not be given jail time after both settled civil
claims against him for reported six-figure sums.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler rejected that agreement as well as the plea of Tyson's
attorneys that at 32, he effectively would have his career ended if
given jail time because his license to box might well be suspended
in Nevada only months after it was reinstated. Tyson first lost
that license for twice biting Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28,
1997, and he did not fight again until Jan. 16, when he returned
from a 19-month layoff to earn more than $10 million for knocking
out Francois Botha in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that payday, Tyson's attorneys said Friday he remains in
deep debt. Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager, said it would take
``three to four fights for him to be solvent again,'' stating that
he owed the IRS more than $14 million prior to the Botha fight,
ex-trainer Kevin Rooney $8 million (of which he paid off $2 million
from the Botha fight purse), and assorted other creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp called Tyson's other properties ``a real estate nightmare''
and argued that ``if he gets jail time of even one day, he's done
(in boxing).'' He also contended that Tyson's violent reaction to
the minor accident was a result of the extreme financial pressures
he was under and his refusal at the time to take an antidepressant,
Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has recently been regularly seeing a psychiatrist and
taking his medication when not training.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's plea of nolo contendre meant he neither protested the
charges nor admitted guilt but instead allowed the court to go
forward with sentencing. Such a plea is normally made only when a
deal is securely in place.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, members of Tyson's coterie of advisers,
business partners, and friends all seemed stunned. Finkel and
Showtime TV executive Jay Larkin, who only recently persuaded his
company to advance Tyson more than $13 million against future
earnings to pay off past IRS debts, both refused to comment. But
one member of Team Tyson who demanded anonymity characterized Tyson
as ``a trophy for the state of Maryland.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson did not contest hitting 50-year-old Harding in the mouth
and kicking 62-year-old Saucedo in the groin following the
accident, and he had to be restrained by both his bodyguards and
his wife from inflicting further damage.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson chooses to appeal, Johnson's sentence will be erased
and he will start over with a jury trial but would face a possible
three- to seven-year jail term and a conviction on his record if he
loses. That might more adversely effect his situation in Indiana.
Although Tyson could begin serving his one-year jail term soon if
he does not appeal, it would not be accompanied by a conviction on
his record because of the nolo plea.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson seemed especially bothered by the fact that after
minimal provocation, Tyson attacked two welterweight-sized,
middle-aged men whom he had never met. Gansler cited the same facts
when asked if he was bothered that his decision to pursue jail time
for Tyson even when the victims were opposed to it might
effectively end his boxing career and return him to the poverty he
had known as a child growing up in one of Brooklyn's harshest
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Tyson gets paid to assault people he does know or who at
least agree to be assaulted,'' Gansler said. ``Neither me or
anybody else in Montgomery County asked Mr. Tyson to get out of his
car and assault and attack two people. They weren't even two people
he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will say he got off light. Some will say it was
too harsh. I believe it was fair. This restores confidence in our
judicial system that a man with his record of propensity for
violence gets this kind of sentence.''

EDITORIAL: CHELSEA CLINTON'S PRIVACY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   It was Teddy Roosevelt, that exuberant personality, who first
threw open the door to life at the White House. His children all
became celebrities of the age. It was Woodrow Wilson who slammed
the door, threatening to shun any reporter who wrote about his
daughters. The door stayed shut, guarded by fathers like Harry
Truman, until the Kennedy children became symbols of a youthful
presidency, objects of public adoration, and then of heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson daughters, the Nixon daughters, Amy Carter all had
painful public moments. But no one knows the pain of life in the
White House better than Chelsea Clinton, and few first families
have been more protective than her parents. For six years,
reporters have largely honored their request to respect Chelsea's
privacy. In that time, she has matured into a poised young woman.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, as well, the White House has put her on
display at politically opportune moments and in structured
situations. She has traveled with the first lady, sat with her at
the Democratic National Convention in 1996 and attended church at
awkward moments with her father, and was the physical link between
her parents, holding their hands as they left for Martha's Vineyard
after his admission of a relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   This brief review of the coverage of Chelsea Clinton is useful
in assessing the flap over a People magazine cover story on her.
Her parents' reaction of ``profound sadness'' seems overwrought
when compared with the respectful, almost puffy tone of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear, no doubt, is that the floodgates will be opened now.
We doubt that the mainstream press will abandon the current policy
of restraint. That policy has produced generally appropriate
reporting of Ms. Clinton's public activities and allows for
journalistic interest in the personal and family dynamics of a
White House gripped by crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case during Watergate and, perhaps to a lesser
extent, in the current scandal. The People story, like much of the
magazine's fare, was opportunistic but soft. It will not cause
responsible newspapers and broadcasters to start snooping into
Chelsea Clinton's private life.

JOHNSON UPSET WITH NHRA TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Twenty four hours didn't do anything to change
the mind of Warren Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The defending and four-time Pro Stock champion was still upset
Friday with the NHRA Technical Department, who on Thursday forced
Johnson to modify the rear quarter-panels to adhere to NHRA rules.
This is what happens when you're dealing with the ineptness of the
NHRA, said Johnson, who grabbed the No. 1 position with a
Winternationals record 6.926-second pass at 200.20 mph during
Friday's qualifying session. They can't determine what a race car
is supposed to look like. I don't know if I set the Winternationals
record for the hammer throw, but I was certainly practicing for it.
</P>
<P>
   People have picked on my cars for 25 years. If you've got to
change it to race, you've got to change it. At the same time, if I
have jump through the hoops, I think everyone else should too.
</P>
<P>
   Busy driver: Frank Pedregon, the eldest of the drag racing
Pedregon brothers, is going to be very busy this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon, the driver of the Penthouse Magazine Nitro Funny Car
owned by Jim Dunn, is also driving in the Federal Mogul Dragster
class for Team In-N-Out Burger.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between (the two cars) is that the funny
car is about 50 mph faster, said Pedregon, who won two national
events in the Nitro Funny Car class last season. I personally don't
notice the difference in speed. Both cars run on nitro, both have
the same clutch systems and both have the same fuel systems. On the
track, both cars seem to pull the same.
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon had originally planned to drive the In-N-Out dragster
for the entire season, but was recently named to drive the
Penthouse Pontiac Firebird when Kelly Magrath had a recurring eye
injury.

<P>
   This is the only event that he will drive the dragster in
national event competition.
</P>
<P>
   Not competing: Tommy Hammonds, who turned some heads while
driving a limited Pro Stock schedule last season, is not competing
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Timberwolves forward resigned with the NBA team
and is preparing for the revamped NBA season. He is expected to
begin his limited NHRA schedule at the Mopar Nationals in
Englishtown, N.J. in May.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still physically able to go out and play (NBA basketball),
so why not take advantage of the opportunity and the talent that
God blessed me with to go out and play, said Hammonds, who pilots a
Camaro Z28 for Team Chevrolet. When that contract (with the
Minnesota Timberwolves) is over the plan is to definitely race full
time. Up until then I will continue to race 10-12 races throughout
the summer to keep the Chevrolet name out there and hopefully win
some races.
</P>
<P>
   I think we did pretty well (in 1998), hopefully we will continue
to do well and strive to the point to where we could win a
championship in the future.

HOPKINS, ALLEN ARE FORCED TO SHADOW BOX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bernard Hopkins became a boxing footnote Friday,
even here in the nation's capital where he will defend his
International Boxing Federation middleweight title Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is here to face interim champion Robert Allen, who on
Aug. 28 was temporarily handed the title Hopkins had held on a
no-contest decision after Hopkins fell out of the ring when referee
Mills Lane pushed him violently to separate him from Allen's
clutches. Hopkins badly sprained his left ankle and could not go on
and an immediate rematch was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The much anticipated rematch comes at the Washington Convention
Center with Hopkins (34-2-1, 26 KOs, 1 NC) again considered the
champion now that he is healthy. But the actions of another area
resident have overshadowed this fight and everything in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was sentenced Friday to a
year in jail in Rockville, Md., after he pled no contest to charges
he assaulted two men following a fender bender accident in
Gaithersburg, Md., in August.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the often bombastic Hopkins could barely get a
mention of his title defense on local news broadcasts or in
Washington's two daily papers in the days leading up to Tyson's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he fights on, insisting ``this ain't gonna be no
Wrestlemania this time. I'm the best and the strongest of the three
middleweight champions. I must get Allen (23-2, 18 KOs, 1 NC) out
of there. This is going to be an aggressive, exciting, explosive
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Allen wants to get dirty and I see the referee isn't doing
his job, then I've got to become dirty. If he wants to fight, then
let's fight. What's good for the gander is good for the geeses.''
</P>
<P>
   What would be good for Hopkins and Allen is a little notoriety
but to get it, they'll have to create something special.

CELTICS RAPPED BY TORONTO IN SLUGGISH OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Raptors103Celtics92
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You expected Antoine Walker to lead the Celtics in
scoring Friday night. He did, with 21 points. You expected rookie
Paul Pierce to have a good debut. He did, with 19 points and 9
rebounds. This is what you did not expect: Raptors 103, Celtics 92.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the NBA returned from a 204-day lockout to open
the season, it could be argued that the Celtics remained asleep.
The rundown is simple, really. They made 42 percent of their shots,
were outrebounded by a ton, and made Kevin Willis and Doug Christie
look like they were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson of the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino warned that the team's first game
since April 1998 would not be easy. He also said that the Celtics'
dominance of the Raptors in the exhibition season meant nothing.
But even he couldn't have envisioned that the Celtics would not be
in the game at the FleetCenter. The closest the team got to the
Raptors in the fourth quarter was 7 points. And in the final five
minutes, everyone in the building was willing to concede it was
garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was that the Celtics got a combined 12
points from their starting backcourt of Kenny Anderson and Ron
Mercer. It also didn't help that the Celtics couldn't stop Toronto.
Willis had 28 points and 16 rebounds, Christie 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   All was not hopeless after three quarters, but it was getting to
that point. That's when it was 81-70. That's also when legitimate
panic started to set in at the FleetCenter. On last season's
opening night, no one expected much from the Celtics and they
defeated the NBA champion Bulls. This season there has actually
been talk of the Celtics making the playoffs. So when they
struggled against the Raptors . . . well, you actually heard some
boos among the 18,624 fans. Toronto won 16 games in 1997-98, 20
fewer than the Celtics did. Yet the Raptors led by as many as 14
points in the third. When Christie made a 3-pointer with just over
five minutes remaining in the third, the score was 73-59.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Raptors were doing anything worth watching,
either. The performances were terrible all around. The ugliness
started in the game's first minute, when the Celtics already had
two turnovers. If not being able to handle the ball were their only
problem, the Celtics would have been OK. As you know by now, that
was not their only problem. They also couldn't shoot. They made
only 37 percent of their shots in the first quarter and scored 24
points. The Raptors were worse, making 29 percent of their shots.
They also had 24 points and, unfortunately for the Celtics, size.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has said many times that his team needs to build a
center, since it doesn't appear one will be available to draft or
sign via free agency. The tendency is for fans to look at that
statement and say, ``Yeah, but at least we have Antoine Walker,
Kenny Anderson, Ron Mercer, and Paul Pierce.'' Since all those
players are 6 feet 9 inches or shorter, they need rebounders to
help them get the ball. While all of them can rebound, they are not
known exclusively as rebounders.
</P>
<P>
   That was a problem. Because as much as the Raptors were missing
their shots, they were also outrebounding the Celtics by 10 midway
through the fourth quarter. At that point, the score was 87-80. The
Celtics needed two things: missed shots and rebounds. Let's just
say they had no problem forcing the misses.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for Celtics positives? Well, after a shaky start, Pierce
established himself as a defensive force. He had two blocked shots
during one possession and had three in the first half. He also had
five assists. Walker gave the Celtics those 21 points, but only 4
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But no one could stop the crowd from leaving in the final five
minutes. Several thousand of them began to leave then after
Christie's three made it 97-80. At the end of the game, a fan
yelled, ``Pitino! No excuse.'' Pitino has been known to engage fans
in sideline conversation, but if the coach had heard that fan's
complaint, he probably wouldn't have disagreed.

FAIR GROUNDS HAS RE-EMERGED AS PREMIER RACETRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Simulcasting has become the gasoline that powers
thoroughbred racing's engine, and nowhere is that transition better
illustrated than at hallowed Fair Grounds racetrack, which has been
running horses on this site since before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Early in its 1993 season, the old wooden grandstand burned to
the ground. In pre-simulcasting days, such a catastrophe might have
been enough to close a track for good. But Fair Grounds put on a
full-court press to resume racing in only three weeks, using a
giant tent to house its patrons. Most of the inconvenienced local
fans didn't bother to show up to watch horses run down the long
homestretch past a heap of charred and twisted ruins, but their
absence was insignificant. Out-of-town bettors looking at simulcast
TV monitors saw nothing out of the ordinary, and plunked down so
much money on the races the track had a record-breaking year.
</P>
<P>
   The records are still falling at Fair Grounds, a grizzled senior
citizen experiencing a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   A new six-level grandstand was completed two years ago. On Jan.
9, the track recorded its first $7 million handle. By the time the
current season ends March 29, daily purses are expected to approach
$250,000, compared to $95,000 for its 1991-92 season. Lone Star
Park at Grand Prairie gave away about $220,000 daily in purse money
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers D. Wayne Lukas and Frank Brothers have horses stabled
at Fair Grounds, and next month, Real Quiet and Victory Gallop are
expected to reprise their '98 Triple Crown rivalry in the New
Orleans Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this success story even more remarkable is the
realization that as recently as a decade ago, Fair Grounds was
headed downhill fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been beyond our wildest expectations,'' concedes
general manager Bryan Krantz, whose family owns the track.
</P>
<P>
   And the main impetus behind the turnaround?
</P>
<P>
   ``Simulcasting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz's office is plush, with bleached hardwood flooring, and
overlooks the paddock. But when he is behind his desk, he keeps an
eye glued to his TV set, because that's where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon Fair Grounds had its record handle, only
$368,005 was wagered at the track, where lines for the red beans
and rice and jambalaya are as long as those at the betting windows.
Over $6.5 million poured in from out of state, including New York
and Southern California. Both used Fair Grounds as a simulcasting
substitute when Aqueduct live racing was snowed out.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Fair Grounds signal has become even more
popular with bettors at Lone Star's Post Time Pavilion than Oaklawn
Park or Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround coincides almost exactly with the $14.7 million
acquisition of a 52.2 percent interest in Fair Grounds in April
1990 by Krantz's mother, Marie, who previously had assumed control
of minor-league Jefferson Downs in suburban Kenner, La., in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Krantzes already owned six off-track betting parlors in
nearby communities. With their purchase of Fair Grounds, they took
over four additional parlors within New Orleans that had belonged
to previous owner Louis Roussel.
</P>
<P>
   Their timing was fortuitious. Video poker machines at Louisiana
tracks were legalized in 1992. The interstate simulcasting
phenomenon was beginning to take off. The Krantzes closed Jefferson
Downs in November 1992, enabling all the family's parlor and poker
proceeds earmarked for purses to be used at Fair Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Krantz took a hands-on approach, personally lobbying to
get Fair Grounds included on the menus of simulcast sites around
the country, and in some cases discounting his product to get a
foot in the door. Krantz also hit the recruiting road, accompanying
director of racing Mervin Muniz in search of new stables.
</P>
<P>
   As betting increased, so did purses, to $124,683 daily in
1992-93 and $166,138 the next year. That caught the attention of
prominent owners and trainers, and as racing quality improved,
simulcast bettors wagered still more money on Fair Grounds races.
In a sport notorious for its failures, the once-struggling old
track found itself caught up in a spiral of financial success.
</P>
<P>
   And just as a good bowl of Cajun gumbo mixes numerous
ingredients, the winning Fair Grounds formula runs deeper than
simulcast dollars. Its dirt surface has long been hailed by
horsemen as one of the safest in the world, its grass course gets
frequent use, the Louisiana bayou climate is mild, and its meet
traditionally opens on Thanksgiving Day, which dovetails perfectly
with the closing of the fall season at powerful Churchill Downs in
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Fair Grounds has put it all together. Its racing
quality isn't quite as good as Gulfstream's or Santa Anita's, but
it is better than Aqueduct's, and much stronger than at rival
Oaklawn in Hot Springs, Ark., with which it competes for stables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is the purses,'' said trainer Tom Amoss, a
New Orleans native who has been racing horses there for the past
dozen years. ``It was headed down a tunnel based on poor horses and
poor purses, but now all of a sudden it's turning around.''
</P>
<P>
   Amoss credits the Krantzes decision to close Jefferson Downs and
consolidate its purse and off-track betting revenue into the Fair
Grounds as the spark that headed the track in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track surface means a lot, too,'' Amoss said. ``That comes
into play a great deal in deciding where to race your horses. You
just get fed up with being the same places and continually losing
horses because of what you feel is partially the racetrack's fault.
The fact that horses leave here and do well all over the country in
the spring and summer is an indication of how good this surface
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind dirt surface is a big reason Real Quiet and Victory
Gallop are being pointed for the March 7 New Orleans Handicap, said
Krantz. Also, boosting the purse to $500,000 last year didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   With everything else going so well, Krantz said getting that
dream matchup would almost be enough to warrant an extension of
Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say a little prayer every night for both of them,'' he said.
``If they show up here, our whole world would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   It already is.

   NEW ORLEANS _ Many racetracks boast their rich tradition. Fair
Grounds doesn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   In its first official year of racing _ 1872 _ its most famous
horse was owned by Gen. George Armstrong Custer. The horse was
Frogtown, who twice was ambushed by a filly named Hollywood. To add
insult to defeat, the general's name was misspelled as ``Custar''
in the track program.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Custer lost again, at the Battle of Little Big
Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Another horse owner of that era was Pat Garrett. His horses
didn't win many races, but he was already well-known as the man who
killed Billy the Kid. Frank James, brother of Jesse, was the
``betting commissioner'' for the largest stable at the track in
1902.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary gamblers George Smith (a k a Pittsburgh Phil), John
``Bet a Million'' Gates and ``Diamond Jim'' Brady were regulars at
turn-of-the-century Fair Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these personalities are featured in a museum located at
the track. Other tales involving famed jazz trumpeter Al Hirt,
District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. and New Orleans Saints owner
Tom Benson, as well as other colorful racetrack characters, have
been detailed in /Fair Grounds: Big Shots &AMP; Long Shots,'' a book
written last year by former New Orleans ``Times-Picayune'' sports
editor Bob Roesler.
</P>
<P>
   Fair Grounds was the first track to adopt the French pari-mutuel
system of betting used today, in which patrons compete with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims to be the first in the United States to use a
post parade, with horses walking single-file before the crowd in
program order before a race. The post parade concept ``would have
succeeded admirably,'' according to a newspaper account, ``had it
been carried out in proper spirit by the jockeys.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting gate, or an early variation of it, was born at Fair
Grounds. In the old days, horses stood behind a rope, which was
dropped to signal the beginning of a race. In 1896, Fair Grounds
tried suspending an 8-foot-tall net across the track. The net was
attached to springs, and flew up into the air when the starter
pulled a lever. A more practical gate was introduced in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous champion horses, including 1941 Triple Crown winner
Whirlaway, have raced at Fair Grounds. Champion mare Pan Zareta
died of pneumonia at the track and was buried in the infield in
1918, later to be joined by Kentucky Derby winner Black Gold, who
broke down in a race in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   And even before the seven-alarm fire that destroyed the Fair
Grounds grandstand in 1993, the track had experienced a devastating
tragedy. The grandstand also burned in 1918, but temporary
bleachers were erected in three days and the stands from the
defunct City Park racetrack across town were later reassembled at
Fair Grounds. Those remained in place until the latest blaze.

ARKANSAS GOVERNOR COMMUTES A DEATH SENTENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Citing a juror's plea, Gov. Mike Huckabee of
Arkansas announced Friday that he was commuting the death sentence
of a man scheduled to be executed in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had rather face the anger of the people than the wrath of
God,'' Huckabee said of his decision, in the case of Bobby Ray
Fretwell.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee, a Republican, is a former Baptist minister and a vocal
supporter of capital punishment. He has allowed six other men to be
executed since becoming governor in July 1996. He said Friday that
he had been moved to commute the death sentence of Fretwell,
convicted of murdering an 81-year-old farmer, after a juror who had
voted for the death sentence asked him to intercede.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the death penalty is an appropriate response
to certain crimes when properly adjudicated and administered,''
Huckabee said. But he said personal appeals by the juror, Gene E.
Stinnett, of Marshall, Ark., had ``provided sufficient doubt as to
the veracity'' of Fretwell's defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett, 70, appeared before the Arkansas Post-Prison Transfer
Board last week to urge mercy for Fretwell. Stinnett told the board
that he had voted for the death penalty out of fear that he would
be ostracized in the hometown he shared with Fretwell's victim,
Sherman Sullins, who was killed in 1984. Stinnett also faulted
Fretwell's defense counsel as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have no defense,'' Stinnett said in a telephone
interview from his home. ``The only thing I remember is that the
lawyer asked him about his childhood, and he said, `It was pretty
bad,' and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fretwell's execution was the first death sentence Huckabee has
commuted since becoming governor of Arkansas, a state in which the
death penalty enjoys wide support.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett said: ``I'm probably the most relieved man in Arkansas
other than Bobby Ray Fretwell. This has been on my conscience for
years and years and years.''

FAIR GROUNDS HAS RE-EMERGED AS PREMIER RACETRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Simulcasting has become the gasoline that powers
thoroughbred racing's engine, and nowhere is that transition better
illustrated than at hallowed Fair Grounds racetrack, which has been
running horses on this site since before the Civil War. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in its 1993 season, the old wooden grandstand burned to
the ground. In pre-simulcasting days, such a catastrophe might have
been enough to close a track for good. But Fair Grounds put on a
full-court press to resume racing in only three weeks, using a
giant tent to house its patrons. Most of the inconvenienced local
fans didn't bother to show up to watch horses run down the long
homestretch past a heap of charred and twisted ruins, but their
absence was insignificant. Out-of-town bettors looking at simulcast
TV monitors saw nothing out of the ordinary, and plunked down so
much money on the races the track had a record-breaking year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The records are still falling at Fair Grounds, a grizzled senior
citizen experiencing a rebirth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new six-level grandstand was completed two years ago. On Jan.
9, the track recorded its first $7 million handle. By the time the
current season ends March 29, daily purses are expected to approach
$250,000, compared to $95,000 for its 1991-92 season. Lone Star
Park at Grand Prairie gave away about $220,000 daily in purse money
last season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trainers D. Wayne Lukas and Frank Brothers have horses stabled
at Fair Grounds, and next month, Real Quiet and Victory Gallop are
expected to reprise their '98 Triple Crown rivalry in the New
Orleans Handicap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What makes this success story even more remarkable is the
realization that as recently as a decade ago, Fair Grounds was
headed downhill fast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been beyond our wildest expectations,'' concedes
general manager Bryan Krantz, whose family owns the track. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the main impetus behind the turnaround? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Simulcasting,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krantz's office is plush, with bleached hardwood flooring, and
overlooks the paddock. But when he is behind his desk, he keeps an
eye glued to his TV set, because that's where the money is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon Fair Grounds had its record handle, only
$368,005 was wagered at the track, where lines for the red beans
and rice and jambalaya are as long as those at the betting windows.
Over $6.5 million poured in from out of state, including New York
and Southern California. Both used Fair Grounds as a simulcasting
substitute when Aqueduct live racing was snowed out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Fair Grounds signal has become even more
popular with bettors at Lone Star's Post Time Pavilion than Oaklawn
Park or Gulfstream Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround coincides almost exactly with the $14.7 million
acquisition of a 52.2 percent interest in Fair Grounds in April
1990 by Krantz's mother, Marie, who previously had assumed control
of minor-league Jefferson Downs in suburban Kenner, La., in 1986. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Krantzes already owned six off-track betting parlors in
nearby communities. With their purchase of Fair Grounds, they took
over four additional parlors within New Orleans that had belonged
to previous owner Louis Roussel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their timing was fortuitious. Video poker machines at Louisiana
tracks were legalized in 1992. The interstate simulcasting
phenomenon was beginning to take off. The Krantzes closed Jefferson
Downs in November 1992, enabling all the family's parlor and poker
proceeds earmarked for purses to be used at Fair Grounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Krantz took a hands-on approach, personally lobbying to
get Fair Grounds included on the menus of simulcast sites around
the country, and in some cases discounting his product to get a
foot in the door. Krantz also hit the recruiting road, accompanying
director of racing Mervin Muniz in search of new stables. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As betting increased, so did purses, to $124,683 daily in
1992-93 and $166,138 the next year. That caught the attention of
prominent owners and trainers, and as racing quality improved,
simulcast bettors wagered still more money on Fair Grounds races.
In a sport notorious for its failures, the once-struggling old
track found itself caught up in a spiral of financial success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And just as a good bowl of Cajun gumbo mixes numerous
ingredients, the winning Fair Grounds formula runs deeper than
simulcast dollars. Its dirt surface has long been hailed by
horsemen as one of the safest in the world, its grass course gets
frequent use, the Louisiana bayou climate is mild, and its meet
traditionally opens on Thanksgiving Day, which dovetails perfectly
with the closing of the fall season at powerful Churchill Downs in
Kentucky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, Fair Grounds has put it all together. Its racing
quality isn't quite as good as Gulfstream's or Santa Anita's, but
it is better than Aqueduct's, and much stronger than at rival
Oaklawn in Hot Springs, Ark., with which it competes for stables. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is the purses,'' said trainer Tom Amoss, a
New Orleans native who has been racing horses there for the past
dozen years. ``It was headed down a tunnel based on poor horses and
poor purses, but now all of a sudden it's turning around.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amoss credits the Krantzes decision to close Jefferson Downs and
consolidate its purse and off-track betting revenue into the Fair
Grounds as the spark that headed the track in the right direction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The track surface means a lot, too,'' Amoss said. ``That comes
into play a great deal in deciding where to race your horses. You
just get fed up with being the same places and continually losing
horses because of what you feel is partially the racetrack's fault.
The fact that horses leave here and do well all over the country in
the spring and summer is an indication of how good this surface
is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The kind dirt surface is a big reason Real Quiet and Victory
Gallop are being pointed for the March 7 New Orleans Handicap, said
Krantz. Also, boosting the purse to $500,000 last year didn't
hurt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With everything else going so well, Krantz said getting that
dream matchup would almost be enough to warrant an extension of
Mardi Gras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I say a little prayer every night for both of them,'' he said.
``If they show up here, our whole world would be different.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It already is. &QL;

SAYING NO TO BIG TEN, NOTRE DAME WILL REMAIN A LONER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Pa., Mich., Ill., Ohio, Wis., Minn, Iowa, Mo., N.Y.)  By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the 111 years Notre Dame has played football, it has been an
independent, resisting all overtures to join a conference. On
Friday, its board of trustees decided to keep it that way,
rejecting an approach from the tradition-laden Big Ten and
maintaining the university's national identity and its football
income.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Big Ten first asked Notre Dame if it
was interested in joining the conference, the answer was a quick
no. Last year, when the Big Ten came calling again, Notre Dame said
it would study the pluses and minuses.
</P>
<P>
   It did. But the student body opposed a change, and at recent
basketball games there were chants of ``No Big Ten.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lennon, the director of Notre Dame's alumni association,
said that 99.5 percent of its members were against a change.
University officers agreed and recommended to the 55-man board of
trustees that the status quo be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The board met Friday in London and decided that the Fighting
Irish would continue their football fighting as an independent. The
board was in London for the dedication of Marian Kennedy Fischer
Hall, the university's new academic center there.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame is one of eight independents among the 112 major
colleges that play football in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association's Division I-A. In most other sports, Notre Dame teams
compete in the Big East Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Edward A. Malloy, Notre Dame's president, said the
university's institutional identity was the deciding factor in the
decision to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Just as the Universities of Michigan or Wisconsin or
Illinois have core identities as the flagship institutions of their
states, so Notre Dame has a core identity, and at that core are
these characteristics: Catholic, private, independent. As a
Catholic university with a national constituency, we believe
independence continues to be our best way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's decision has an academic downside. Had the
university joined the Big Ten, it would have automatically become a
member of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, the academic
equivalent of the Big Ten. This consortium of Big Ten members plus
the University of Chicago shares faculties, library facilities and
research and would have helped upgrade Notre Dame's graduate
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, some Notre Dame people perceived that as a threat to
the university's traditional emphasis on undergraduate programs.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Penn State, which started playing
conference football in 1993, the Big Ten actually has 11 members:
Penn State, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Wisconsin,
Illinois, Indiana, Purdue, Minnesota, Northwestern and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern is the only private school, and all 11 have much
larger student bodies than Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame is the most glamorous team in college football, with
a history that covers Knute Rockne and Joe Montana and, if the
movies are included, Pat O'Brien and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame earns about $7 million a year from NBC in football
television rights, and as an independent it keeps all the money
from television and bowl games (the Gator Bowl on New Year's Day
brought in $1.4 million).
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten, which earned more than $30 million from last
season's bowl games, splits the money among all its members.
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Ten expands to 12 teams in two divisions, NCAA rules
will allow it to stage a football championship playoff that would
earn millions of dollars from television.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Delany, the Big Ten commissioner, said, ``We have not
discussed what the next move will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports say the Big Ten may turn to Syracuse of the Big East or
Missouri of the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Delany said Notre Dame would not be considered again, and that
was fine with Lennon of its alumni association. Before the board's
decision was announced, he said: ``Our brand name is something
special. We'd rather be one of one than one of 12.''

EDITORIAL: WHEN SPEECH BECOMES A THREAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   When a federal jury in Oregon ordered a group of anti-abortion
activists to pay $107 million in damages to two health clinics and
several doctors who perform abortions, it thrilled most law-abiding
citizens who are eager to find some way to quell the terrifying
violence against abortion providers in recent years. But the
verdict raises difficult First Amendment questions that remain
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs charged that the defendants had violated the
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and other racketeering
statutes by carrying out a campaign of threats and terror. The
threats included naming the doctors in posters and listing the
names and addresses of many doctors, including some of the
plaintiffs, on an Internet site that called abortion providers
``butchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs did not argue that the defendants' speech incited
imminent unlawful conduct, which requires a showing that the speech
would have caused immediate violence. Instead they argued that the
speech amounted to threats of harm, which are not protected speech
under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is that the defendants never issued overt threats
against the doctors. Nonetheless, the doctors had good reason to
fear. Several of the defendants have elsewhere expressed support
for ``justifiable homicide'' against abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   Three doctors featured on similar ``wanted''-style posters have
been murdered since 1993. Last October the Web site, called the
Nuremberg Files, chillingly showed Dr. Barnett Slepian's name
crossed out from its list shortly after his murder near Buffalo,
N.Y. Federal authorities considered the plaintiffs in danger when
their names appeared on a poster, and offered the doctors
round-the-clock federal marshal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment cannot be used to shield true threats of
violence. But the Supreme Court has not offered clear guidance on
what constitutes such a threat. The test adopted by the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals, whose rulings govern federal courts in
Oregon, requires proof, in light of the entire context, that a
reasonable person would foresee that the speech would be
interpreted as a serious expression of intent to harm.
</P>
<P>
   But this test has been employed only in cases where the threats
were explicit, not in a case where the threats are indirect. In the
latter situation, where intent to threaten is less clear, the
courts need to be especially sensitive to First Amendment concerns
lest they silence speech that is merely controversial and
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union in Oregon urged U.S. District
Judge Robert Jones, in the absence of explicitly threatening
language, to require proof also that the defendants intended to
place the plaintiffs in fear for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Given the facts, the plaintiffs might well have prevailed even
under that tougher standard. But Jones declined to add an intent
element. The verdict will probably be appealed, and ultimately the
Supreme Court may have to tell lower courts how to distinguish
between illegal threats and protected speech.

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the deposition of
Vernon Jordan on Tuesday in the Senate impeachment trial of
President Clinton. (The excerpts were taken from official
transcripts published in The Congressional Record.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.: Would you describe the nature of
your relationship with President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A. President Clinton has been a friend of mine since
approximately 1973, when I came to your state, Arkansas, to make a
speech as president of the National Urban League about race and
equal opportunity in our nation, and we met then and there, and our
friendship has grown and developed and matured and he is my friend
and will continue to be my friend.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And just to further elaborate on that friendship, it's my
understanding that he and his, and the First Lady, has had
Christmas Eve dinner with you and your family for a number of
years?
</P>
<P>
   A. Every year since his Presidency, the Jordan family has been
privileged to entertain the Clinton family on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And has there been any exceptions in recent years to that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Every year that he has been President, he has had, he and his
family, Christmas Eve with my family.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And have you vacationed together with the Clinton family?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I think you have seen reels of us playing golf and
having fun at Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And so you vacation together, you play golf together on a
semi-regular basis?
</P>
<P>
   A. Whenever we can. We've not been doing it recently, for
reasons that I think are probably very obvious to you, counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, explain that to me.
</P>
<P>
   A. Just what I said. For a time, I was going before the grand
jury, and under the advice of counsel and I'm sure under advice of
the President's counsel, it was thought best that we not play golf
together.
</P>
<P>
   So, from the time that I first went to the grand jury, I don't
think _ we have not played golf this year, unfortunately, together.
...
</P>
<P>
   Helping Webb Hubbell
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, going back to a complicating factor in your conversation
with Mr. Gittis and this embarrassing situation of the Lewinsky
job, the complicating fact was that you had also helped Webb
Hubbell get a job or consulting contracts with the same company; is
that _ .
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. You use the word complicated. I did not view it as a
complication. I viewed it as a, as another something that happened,
and that that caused some embarrassment to the company, and here
again, we were back for another embarrassment for the company, and
I thought I had a responsibility to say that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you explain how you helped Webb Hubbell secure a job or
a contract with Revlon?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Webb Hubbell came to me after his resignation from the
Justice Department. Webb and I got to be friends during the
transition, and Webb came to me and he said, I'm leaving the
Justice Department, or I've left the Justice Department, I'm not
sure which, and he said, I really need work.
</P>
<P>
   And I said, Webb, I will do what I can to help you.
</P>
<P>
   I called New York, made arrangements. I took Webb Hubbell to New
York. We had lunch. I took him to the headquarters of McAndrews &AMP;
Forbes at 62nd Street. I introduced him to Howard Gittis, Ronald
Perelman, and I left.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did, subsequently, Mr. Hubbell obtain consulting
contracts with Revlon?
</P>
<P>
   A. Subsequently, Mr. Hubbell was hired, as I understand it, as
outside counsel to McAndrews &AMP; Forbes, or Revlon, or some entity
within the Perelman empire.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And was that consulting contracts of about $100,000 a year?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think so, I think so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you make other contacts with other companies in which
you had friends for assistance for Webb Hubbell?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And was the effort to assist Mr. Webb Hubbell during this
time _ was it after he left the Department of Justice and prior to
the time that he pled guilty to criminal charges?
</P>
<P>
   A. That is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And at the time you assisted Webb Hubbell by securing a job
with Revlon for him, was he a potential adverse witness to the
President in the ongoing investigation by the independent counsel?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know whether he was an adverse witness or not. What
he was, was my friend who had just resigned from the Justice
Department, and he was out of work, and he asked for help, and I
happily helped him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you know at the time that he was a potential witness
in the investigation by the O.I.C.?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know whether I knew whether he was a potential
witness or not. I simply responded to Webb Hubbell who was a friend
in trouble and needing work.
</P>
<P>
   A Meeting With Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. Jordan, let me go back to that meeting on Dec. 11. I
believe we were discussing that. My question would be: How did the
meeting on Dec. 11, 1997, with Ms. Lewinsky come about?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ms. Lewinsky called my office and asked if she could come to
see me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And was that preceded by a call from Betty Currie?
</P>
<P>
   A. At some point in time, Betty Currie had called me, and Ms.
Lewinsky followed up on that call, and she came to my office, and
we had a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Ms. Lewinsky called, set up a meeting, and at some point sent
you a resume, I believe.
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe so. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. All right. Now, you mentioned that she had sent you a _ I
guess some people refer to it, a wish list, or a list of jobs that
she _ .
</P>
<P>
   A. Not jobs _ companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Companies that she would be interested in seeking employment
with.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you looked at that, and you determined that you wanted to
go with your own list of friends and companies that you had better
contacts with.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm sure, Congressman, that you too have been in this
business, and you do know that you can only call people that you
know or feel comfortable in calling.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Absolutely. No question about it. And let me just comment and
ask your response to this, but many times I will be listed as a
reference, and they can take that to any company. You might be
listed as a reference and the name Vernon Jordan would be a good
reference anywhere, would it not?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would hope so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And so, even though it was a company that you might not have
the best contact with, you could have been helpful in that regard?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And that is exactly the point, that you looked at getting Ms.
Lewinsky a job as an assignment rather than just something that you
were going to be a reference for.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know whether I looked upon it as an assignment.
Getting jobs for people is not unusual for me, so I don't view it
as an assignment. I just view it as something that is part of what
I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're acting in behalf of the President when you are trying
to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of the job
search?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, going back, going to your meeting that we're talking
about on Dec. 11, prior to the meeting did you make any calls to
prospective employers in behalf of Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so. I think not. I think I wanted to see her
before I made any calls.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And so if they were not before, after you met with her, you
made some calls on Dec. 11?
</P>
<P>
   A. I, I believe that's correct. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. And during this meeting (on Dec. 19), did she in fact show
you the subpoena that she had received in the Jones litigation?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm sure she showed me the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And the subpoena that was presented to you asked her to give
a deposition, is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A. As I recollect.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. But did it also ask Ms. Lewinsky or direct her to produce
certain documents and tangible objects?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think, if I'm correct in my recollection, it asked that she
produce gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Gifts, and some of those gifts were specifically enumerated.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember that. I do remember gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you discuss any of the items requested under the
subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did not. What I said to her was that she needed counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, just to help you in reference to your previous grand
jury testimony of March 3, '98, and if you would like to refer to
that, page 121, but I believe it was your testimony that you asked
her if there had been any gifts after you looked at the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   A. I may have done that, and if I, if that's in my testimony, I
stand by it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did she, from your conversation with her, did you
determine that in your opinion, there was a fascination on her part
with the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. No question about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And I think you previously described it that she had a
``thing'' for the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Thing,'' yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you make any specific inquiry as to the nature of the
relationship that she had with the President?
</P>
<P>
   Nature of Relationship
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. At some point during that conversation, I asked her
directly if she had had sexual relationships with the President.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And is this not an extraordinary question to ask a
24-year-old intern, whether she had sexual relations with the
President of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not if you see _ not if you had witnessed her emotional state
and this thing, as I say. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And her emotional state and what she expressed to you about
her feelings for the President, is what prompted you to ask that
question?
</P>
<P>
   A. That, plus the question of whether or not the President at
the end of his term would leave the First Lady. And that was
alarming and stunning to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And she related that question to you in that meeting on Dec.
19?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, going back to the question in which you asked her if she
had had a sexual relationship with the President; what was her
response?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And I'm sure that that was not an idle question on your part,
and I presume that you needed to know the answer for some purpose.
</P>
<P>
   A. I wanted to know the answer based on what I had seen in her
expression; obviously, based on the fact that this was a subpoena
about her relationship with the President.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And so you felt like you needed to know the answer to that
question to determine how you were going to handle the situation?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I thought it was a factual data that I needed to know,
and I asked the question. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, would you describe your conversation with the President
(on the evening of Dec. 19)?
</P>
<P>
   A. We were upstairs, uh, in the White House. Mrs. Jordan _ we
came in by way of the Southwest Gate into the Diplomatic Entrance _
we left the car there. I took the elevator up to the residence, and
Mrs. Jordan went and visited at the party. And the President was
already upstairs, I had ascertained that from the usher, and I went
up, and I raised with him the whole question of Monica Lewinsky and
asked him directly if he had had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky, and the President said, ``No, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. All right. Now, during that conversation, did you tell the
President again that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, we had established that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. All right. And did you tell him that you were concerned about
her fascination?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you describe her as being emotional in your meeting
that day?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you relate to the President that Ms. Lewinsky asked
about whether he was going to leave the First Lady at the end of
the term?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And as _ and then, you concluded that with the question as to
whether he had had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. And he said he had not, and I was satisfied; end of
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   `An Extraordinary Question'
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, once again, just as I asked the question in reference to
Ms. Lewinsky, it appears to me that this is an extraordinary
question to ask the President of the United States. What led you to
ask this question to the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, first of all, I'm asking the question of my friend who
happens to be the President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you expect your friend, the President of the United
States, to give you a truthful answer?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you rely upon the President's answer in your decision to
continue your efforts to seek Ms. Lewinsky a job?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believed him, and I continued to do what I had been asked
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, my question was more did you rely upon the President's
answer in your decision to continue your efforts to seek Ms.
Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   A. I did not rely on his answer. I was going to pursue the job
in any event. But I got the answer to the question that I had asked
Ms. Lewinsky earlier from her, and I got the answer from him that
night as to the sexual relationships, and he said no.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It would appear to me that there's two options. One, you
asked the question in terms of idle conversation, and that does not
seem logical in view of the fact that you made a point to go and
visit the President about this alone.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I never said that; I never talked about options. I told
you I went to ask him that question.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, was it idle conversation, or was there a purpose in you
asking him that question?
</P>
<P>
   A. It obviously, Congressman, was not idle conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. All right.
</P>
<P>
   A. For him nor for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There was a purpose in it _ and would you describe it as
being important, the question that you asked to him?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wanted to satisfy myself, based on my visit with her, that
there had been no sexual relationships, and he said no, as she had
said no.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And why was it important to you to satisfy yourself on that
particular point?
</P>
<P>
   A. I had seen this young lady, and I had seen her reaction, uh,
and it raised a presumption, uh, and I wanted to satisfy myself, as
I had done with her, that there had been no sexual relationship
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you had _
</P>
<P>
   A. And I did satisfy myself.

EDITORIAL: MERGING MOMA AND PS 1  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   From the subway platform near the PS 1 Center for Contemporary
Art in Queens, Manhattan looks like the superstructure of a titanic
ocean liner heading slowly out to sea. In comparison, the buildings
around PS 1, like PS 1 itself, gave a human scale that feels, to
most visitors, inviting. The enormous logo painted on the side of
PS 1 has the same effect. It seems to say ``You are here,'' as if
to calm the worries of visitors from the foreign ship known as
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the reasons to celebrate the merger, announced Monday, of
the Museum of Modern Art and PS 1, the best reason is that PS 1
will now attract the attention it deserves. Yes, PS 1 will benefit
financially from MOMA's clout in the art world and among donors,
and MOMA will unquestionably benefit by reattaching itself to the
world of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Merging with PS 1 brings MOMA much-needed space, even as it
begins its planned expansion. The details of that expansion
suggested what this merger confirms, that MOMA is enjoying a period
of enlightened leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But the real beneficiary of this merger will be members of the
art-going public who have not yet visited PS 1, which was, in fact,
a public school until 1976. The rooms are among the finest
exhibition spaces in New York city. Perhaps because of its
architectural origins as a school, PS 1 has an informality and a
familiarity that offset the austerity of MOMA's galleries. The
wooden floors creak, and the warm brick almost resonates with the
forgotten voices of schoolchildren. It is less a museum than a
place where art lives, and by merging with it _ and bringing its
director, Alanna Heiss, into MOMA's fold _ the Museum of Modern Art
has enriched itself and all art lovers. &QL;

   When Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., started questioning Monica
Lewinsky for her deposition in President Clinton's impeachment
trial on Monday, he greeted her and then added that he ``wanted to
just gather a few of our friends here to have this deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say, ``We do have quite a number of people
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those with official roles were the senators presiding over
the deposition of Ms. Lewinsky: Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition of Vernon Jordan on Tuesday, the presiding
senators were Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and John Edwards, D-N.C., presided
at the deposition of Sidney Blumenthal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bryant, the House managers questioning the
witnesses were Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., for Jordan, and James
Rogan, R-Calif., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., for Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Also present were Thomas Griffith, legal counsel for the Senate,
and David Schippers, Republican counsel for the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Four White House lawyers were present, including Nicole Seligman
and Cheryl Mills during the deposition of Ms. Lewinsky. David
Kendall, a White House lawyer, attended the deposition of Jordan,
while Lanny Breuer filled a similar role during the questioning of
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   There were also lawyers for those giving the depositions, among
them Plato Cacheris and William Burton for Ms. Lewinsky. Jordan was
represented by William Hundley, while William McDaniel Jr. was the
lawyer for Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   All the depositions, whether at the Mayflower Hotel in
Washington or in the Senate attic, called for a large number of
support personnel like court reporters, videographers and the
sergeant-at-arms, who announced that there was lunch outside the
hearing room for Jordan's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were all the sessions a routine back-and-forth of question
and answer. At one point in the questioning of Blumenthal, Edwards
asked Blumenthal's lawyer somewhat incredulously whether he was
objecting to a question that had already been asked and answered.
</P>
<P>
   And when Jordan's session was interrupted for 25 minutes by a
power blackout, he resumed his testimony by saying, ``Let me say
parenthetically here that our side had nothing to do with the power
outage _ as desirable as that may have been.''

DETROIT DECIDES ART IS REALLY TRASH AND STARTS THROWING IT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ For more than a decade, Detroiters argued over whether
the Heidelberg Project, a world-famous square block of street art,
was truly art or simply trash. By sundown Friday, there was little
room left for debate. The city government had bulldozed most of it
and hauled it away in dozens of dump trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, visitors came from all over the world to gape at
the Heidelberg Project, created by Tyree Guyton, a renowned street
artist who, starting in 1986, spray-painted polka dots, crosses and
numbers on mostly abandoned houses along Heidelberg Street, in an
inner-city neighborhood scarred by crime and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With help from local children and some older residents, Guyton
covered the outer walls and roof of one red-brick house with broken
toy cars, electric fans and campaign posters. A gray clapboard
house was decorated with large plastic numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Dolls were nailed to a third house, making it a ``doll house.''
</P>
<P>
   Several trees were bedecked with stuffed animals and banged-up
bicycles, while another was adorned with shoes and so became a
``shoe tree.'' In the vacant lots between houses, Guyton assembled
dozens of old vacuum cleaners and other debris of a consumer
society.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of four privately owned houses whose owners
have allowed the decorations, Detroit is now clearing away all of
Guyton's work, among it heavily festooned but abandoned houses on
which taxes have not been paid in many years.
</P>
<P>
   The bulldozers started work on Thursday afternoon, an hour after
a judge lifted a restraining order that Guyton had obtained, and
continued loading a long line of dump trucks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The farther people lived from the Heidelberg Project, the more
they seemed to like it. Its most passionate admirers tended to be
Europeans, who frequently were found driving up and down the street
staring at the painted car hoods leaning against trees or the
hubcaps nailed to branches. Guyton has been preparing in recent
weeks for an exhibition of his work this summer in Bucharest,
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   But many local residents did not like the project, deeming it a
gaudy eyesore that seemed to spread to more abandoned houses and
vacant lots every year.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that Guyton, having grown up in a house on
Heidelberg Street, which he subsequently decorated with big polka
dots in every color, moved away instead of continuing to live amid
his creation.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Beverly, 80, who has lived around the corner from
Heidelberg Street for half a century, said the thousands of
worn-out shoes sitting in piles by the road had particularly
bothered her. ``When you've been without proper shoes, it just
reminds you of where you've come from,'' said Beverly, who raised
five children after her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   Minjon Harris, a 17-year-old high school student, was delighted
to see a line of dump trucks as she walked home from school this
afternoon. She said she had long worried that muggers or rapists
might lurk in the cheerfully painted but abandoned houses, and she
blamed the piles of debris for the neighborhood's many rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to worry about huge rats running out at you,'' she
said, a sky-blue knapsack on her back. ``They look like huge
cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith H. West, Detroit's interim public health director, said
the city had never found any breeding of vermin or insects on the
site but had worried that the debris could become infested.
</P>
<P>
   Guyton, wearing a gray parka covered with a kaleidoscopic smear
of paints in every hue, predicted that the Heidelberg Project,
though reduced to just four houses and truckload after truckload of
trash, would not soon be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have seen the art, he said, ``it will always be
the same.''

MORTON MITOSKY, CANNY BROADWAY LAWYER ,  DIES AT 91 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Conn.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morton J. Mitosky, a Broadway lawyer and colorful
backstage fixture who outlived nearly everyone of his own era, died
Friday at Cabrini Hospital Hospice. He was 91 and lived in Ventnor,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Mitosky, an adviser to Broadway investors, had a
behind-the-scenes part in scores of productions.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, business associate and, finally, conservator for David
Merrick, the producer, he turned into a busy and consistently
prosperous investor in the New York theater. He used his own and
his friends' and associates' money for the stage and became a
millionaire himself in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Most Broadway shows lose money for their investors, but
Mitosky's long experience shortened the odds.
</P>

LILI ST. CYR, BURLESQUE STAR , DIES AT 80 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Canada)  By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lili St. Cyr, the tall, blond beauty who left almost nothing to
the imagination when she stepped dripping wet out of her signature
onstage bubble bath, died on Jan. 29 at her apartment in Hollywood.
She was 80.
</P>
<P>
   In a field that began when a Syrian beauty who called herself
Little Egypt danced her way into legend at the 1893 Chicago World's
Fair, Miss St. Cyr was a master of elegant invention.
</P>
<P>
   Her well-choreographed acts included portrayals of famous
seductresses, few of whom could hold a candle to Miss St. Cyr.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who welcomed the attentions of well-heeled stage door
Johnnies, she had dalliances with the likes of Orson Welles and
Victor Mature, but it was her romances with comparatively obscure
businessmen that kept her in jewels, furs and lavish hotel
accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as Miss St. Cyr once put it: ``Sex is currency. What's
the use of being beautiful if you can't profit from it?''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, her six husbands included a waiter, a dancer, a
sometime actor and the restaurateur Armando Orsini, who got his
start with financing from Miss St. Cyr.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Minneapolis whose name was originally Willis Marie
Van Schaack, Miss St. Cyr moved to Pasadena, Calif., when she was
7, dropped out of school after the ninth grade and was working as a
waitress at a Chinese restaurant when she got her start as a
showgirl. It didn't take her long to realize that the big money in
burlesque lay in nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the name St. Cyr after reading about the French
military academy, she made her first splash at the Gayety Theater
in Montreal in 1944 and remained a regional phenomenon for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   She got her big break in Hollywood in 1951 when she was charged
with indecent exposure during a bubble bath performance at Ciro's
nightclub. By the time she beat the charge in court, the publicity
had made her a headliner and led to series of low-budget movies,
among them ``The Son of Sinbad'' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   Although she once made as much as $7,000 a week, drug use marred
her later years, her money ran out and she was supported by friends
and the occasional sale of her photographs.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister, Rosemary Minsky of Los Angeles.

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the deposition of
Monica Lewinsky on Monday in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ED BRYANT: During this time that you were at the Department of
Defense at the Pentagon, uh, how, how was it working out about you
being transferred back to the White House? How was the job
situation coming?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I waited until after the election and then spoke with
the President about it on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what would he say in response?
</P>
<P>
   A. Various things; ``I'm working on it,'' usually.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In July, uh, particularly around the, the 3d and 4th of July,
there, there, you wrote the President a letter, I think.
</P>
<P>
   A. Which year?
</P>
<P>
   Q. July of '90__ it would have been '97 that you wrote the
President a letter expressing some frustrations about the job
situation in terms of, is that, uh, can you tell us about that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I had had a, well, I guess I was, I know I've testified
about this, I mean, in the grand jury, but I was feeling at that
point that I was getting the runaround on being brought back to the
White House. So I sent a letter to the President that was probably
the harshest I had sent.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you get a response?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A. Um, Betty called me and told me to come to the White House
the next morning, on July 4, at 9 A.M.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what happened when you__ I assume you went to the White
House on July 4. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A. I know I, I, do you have a specific question? I know I
testified, I mean, extensively about this whole day, that whole__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, in regards to__ Let's start with the job.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I started crying. We were in the back office and, um,
and when the subject matter came up, the President was upset with
me and then I began to cry. So__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he encourage you about you coming back? Did he make a
promise or commitment to you that he would make sure you came back
to work at the White House?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know that he reaffirmed his promise or commitment. I
remember leaving that day thinking that, as usual, he was going to
work on it and had a renewed sense of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he comment on your letter, the tone of your letter?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did he say?
</P>
<P>
   A. He was upset with me and told me it was illegal to threaten
the President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you intend the letter to be interpreted that way?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you explain why you wrote the letter to him about
reminding him that you were a good girl and you left the White
House? Did you have that type of conversation?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. That's what made me start to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you, uh, did you ever explain to him that you didn't
intend to threaten him?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the intent of the letter?
</P>
<P>
   A. First, I felt the letter was going to him as a man and not as
President of the United States. Um, second, I think I could see how
he could interpret it as a threat, but my intention was to sort of
remind him that I had been waiting patiently and what I considered
was being a good girl, about having been transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And the threat we're talking about here would not have been
interpreted as a threat to do physical injury or bodily injury to
him. It was to expose your relationship to the__ To your parents.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, in__ At some point in October of that year, 1997, did
your job focus change?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And how was that? What were you doing?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, it really changed on Oct. 6, 1997, as a result of a
conversation with Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Uh, in that, as I understand, you sort of got secondhand
information that you were probably never going back to work at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you didn't feel it was necessary to go back to the
President and perhaps confront the President and say, why am I not
coming back, I want to come back?'
</P>
<P>
   A. I mean, I had a discussion with the President, but I had made
a decision from that based on that information, and I guess my, my
experience of it coming up on a year from the election, having not
been brought back, that it probably wasn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you, you did call the President about that time and then,
but the focus had been changed toward perhaps a job in another
location.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes and no. I didn't call him, but I, um.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You called Betty.
</P>
<P>
   A. But we did have a discussion about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You called Betty Currie, his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K., and then through her, he contacted you and you had a
discussion?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what did you tell him at that time about the job?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe I testified to that, so that my testimony is
probably more accurate. The gist of it was, um, that I wanted to
move to New York and that I was accepting I wasn't going to be able
to come back to the White House, and I asked for his help.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you bring up Vernon Jordan's name as perhaps somebody
that could help you?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's possible it was in that conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the President's comments back to you about your
deciding to go to New York?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember his exact comments. He was accepting of the
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In regards to your, your, uh, decision to search for a job in
New York, in your comments to the President, did he ever tell you
that that was good, that perhaps the Jones lawyers could not easily
find you in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm sorry. I don't, I, I__
</P>
<P>
   PLATO CACHERIS: Excuse me again, Mr. Bryant. That's a compound
question. He could, she could answer it was good, and then she
could answer maybe the Jones lawyer couldn't get her, but I think
you'd want an answer to each question.
</P>
<P>
   BRYANT: O.K. Let me ask it this way. There has been some
reference to that fact throughout the proceedings, and I recall
seeing something somewhere in your, your testimony that you said it
or he said it. Do you recall anything being said about you going to
Washington, to New York and that the effect of that might be that
you would be more difficult to find?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe that might have been mentioned briefly on the 28th
of December, but not as a reason to go to New York, but as a
possible outcome of being there. Does that, does that make sense?
</P>
<P>
   Q. It does.
</P>
<P>
   A. O.K. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Job Search &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Prior to going to the meeting with Vernon Jordan, did you
tell the President that you had a meeting with Mr. Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so. I don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you carry any documents or any papers with you to the
meeting with Mr. Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were those?
</P>
<P>
   A. My resume and a list of public relations firms in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did Mr. Jordan ask you why you were there?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what did you say?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was hoping to move to New York and that he could assist me
in securing a job there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he ask you why you wanted to leave Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what was your answer?
</P>
<P>
   A. I gave him the vanilla story of, um, that I _ I think I _ I
don't remember exactly what I said. I, I believe I've testified to
this. I think it was something about wanting to get out of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The vanilla story. You mean sort of an innocuous set of
reasons, not really the true reasons you wanted to leave?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what were the true reasons you wanted to leave?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because I couldn't go back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did__ Did you think Mr. Jordan accepted__ Did you think he
would accept that vanilla story, or did you feel like he understood
the real story?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I felt he accepted it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. What, what happened with respect to the job search, uh,
through there, through Thanksgiving? Was there anything? I mean, I
know he__ You said he was out of town, but did anything, to your
knowledge, occur? Could you see any results up to Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
   A. From my meeting with Mr. Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you contact Betty Currie after you received no response
from Mr. Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did she page you? I think you were in Los Angeles at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. What, what did she tell you as a result of that
telephone call?
</P>
<P>
   A. She asked me to place a call to Mr. Jordan, which I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And this would have been, again, around Nov. 26, shortly,
well, around Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And I assume you found Mr. Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what did he tell you?
</P>
<P>
   A. That he was working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he tell you to call him back?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you indeed call him back?
</P>
<P>
   A. I didn't actually get ahold of him; he was out of town that
day. I think it was Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you try to meet with the President during this time?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you do that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was a pest. I sent a note to Ms. Currie and asked her to
pass it along to the President, requesting that I meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you successful in having a meeting as a result of those
efforts?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know if it was a result of those efforts, but yes, I
ended up having a meeting with the President.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And when would that have been; what day?
</P>
<P>
   A. On the 6th of December 1997. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was that during the time that you exchanged, exchanged some
of the Christmas presents with him?
</P>
<P>
   A. In, in the meeting?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I gave him my Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you discuss the job search with him also at that time?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe I mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you tell him that, uh, your job search with Mr. Jordan
was not going well?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know if I used those words. I don't, I don't remember
exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If your grand jury testimony said yes, I mean, words to that
effect, that would, you could have used those words if they're in
your grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   A. If my grand jury testimony says that, if that's what I said
in my grand jury testimony, then I accept that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to trick you.
</P>
<P>
   A. O.K.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he make any comment to you about what he might do to aid
in your job search at that time, if you recall?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think he, I think he said, oh, let me see about it, let me
see what I can do, his usual.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did, uh, did the President say anything to you at that time
about your name appearing on a witness list in the Paula Jones
case?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you later learn that your name had appeared on such a
list?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you later learn that that witness list had been faxed
to the White House, to the President's lawyers on Dec. 5?
</P>
<P>
   A. Much later, as in last year. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. All right. Let's go forward another week or so to Dec.
11 and a lunch that you had with Vernon Jordan, I believe, in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did, how was that meeting set up?
</P>
<P>
   A. Through his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you instigate that, or did he call through his secretary?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the purpose of that meeting?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, it was to discuss my job situation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what, what__ How was that discussed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, Mr. Jordan gave me a list of three names and suggested
that I contact these people in a letter that I should cc him on,
and that's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he ask you to copy him on the letters that you sent out?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. During this meeting, did he make any comments about your
status as a friend of the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What, what did he say?
</P>
<P>
   A. In one of his remarks, he said something about me being a
friend of the President.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you respond?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How?
</P>
<P>
   A. I said that I didn't, uh__ I think I__ My grand jury
testimony, I know I talked about this, so it's probably more
accurate. My memory right now is I said something about, uh, seeing
him more as, uh, a man than as a President, and I treated him
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you express your frustration to Mr. Jordan with, uh, with
the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. I expressed that sometimes I had frustrations with him, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what was his response to you about, uh, after you talked
about the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, he sort of jokingly said to me, you know what your
problem is, and don't deny it, you're in love with him. But it was
a sort of lighthearted nature.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you, did you have a response to that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I probably blushed or giggled or something.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you still have feelings for the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. I have mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What, uh, maybe you could tell us a little bit more about
what those mixed feelings are.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think what you need to know is that my grand jury testimony
is truthful irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings are in my
testimony today. Feelings for President &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know in your grand jury you mentioned some of your feelings
that you felt after he spoke publicly about the relationship, but
let me ask you more about the positive: You said there were mixed
feelings. What about, do you still, uh, respect the President,
still admire the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you still appreciate what he is doing for this country as
the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sometime back in December of 1997, in the morning of Dec. 17,
did you receive a call from the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the purpose of that call? What did you talk about?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was threefold: First, to tell me that Ms. Currie's brother
had been killed in a car accident; second, to tell me that my name
was on a witness list for the Paula Jones case, and thirdly, he
mentioned the Christmas present he had for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This telephone call was somewhere in the early morning hours
of 2 o'clock to 2:30.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did it surprise you that he called you so late?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was this your first notice of your name being on the Paula
Jones witness list?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I realize he, he commented about some other things, but I do
want to focus on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   A. O.K.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he say anything to you about how he felt concerning this
witness list?
</P>
<P>
   A. He said it broke his heart that, well, that my name was on
the witness list. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. What other discussion did you have in regard to the fact that
your name was on the list? You were scared; he was disappointed, or
it broke his heart. What other discussion did you have?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, I believe he said that, uh, and these are not necessarily
direct quotes, but to the best of my memory, that he said something
about that, uh, just because my name was on the list didn't
necessarily mean I'd be subpoenaed; and at some point, I asked him
what I should do if I received a subpoena. He said I should, uh, I
should let Ms. Currie know. Uh. Filing an Affidavit Q. Did he say
anything about an affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did he say?
</P>
<P>
   A. He said that, uh, that I could possibly file an affidavit if
I were subpoenaed, that I could possibly file an affidavit maybe to
avoid being deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did he tell you you would avoid being deposed by filing
an affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think he did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You just accepted that statement?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Nodding head.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yes?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, yes. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you__ Uh, strike that. Did he make any representation to
you about what you could say in that affidavit or__
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did you understand you would be saying in that affidavit
to avoid testifying?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, I believe I've testified to this in the grand jury. To
the best of my recollection, it was, uh __ to my mind came __ it
was a range of things. I mean, it could either be, uh, something
innocuous or could go as far as having to deny the relationship.
Not being a lawyer nor having gone to law school, I thought it
could be anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he at that point suggest one version or the other
version?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I didn't even mention that, so there, there wasn't a
further discussion. There was no discussion of what would be in an
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you say, uh, it would be __ it could have been something
where the relationship was denied, what was your thinking at that
point?
</P>
<P>
   A. I__ I__ I think I don't understand what you're asking me. I'm
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, based on prior relations with the President, the
concocted stories and those things like that, did this come to
mind? Was there some discussion about that, or did it come to your
mind about these stories, the cover stories?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not in connection with the __ not in connection with the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would _ _ was there any discussion of how you would
accomplish preparing or filing an affidavit at that point?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why__ why didn't you want to testify? Why would not you__ Why
would you have wanted to avoid testifying?
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, I thought it was nobody's business. Second of
all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula Jones or her
case. And__ I guess those two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The night of the phone call, he's suggesting you could file
an affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of filing a false
affidavit with the court?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would
have to be false, so, no, probably not. I don't__ I don't remember
having any thoughts like that, so I imagine I would remember
something like that, and I don't, but__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you know what an affidavit was?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Of course, you're talking at that time by telephone to the
President, and he's__ And he is a lawyer, and he taught law school.
I don't know. Did you know that? Did you know he was a lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   A. I__ I think I knew it, but it wasn't something that was
present in my, in my thoughts, as in he's a lawyer, he's telling
me, you know, something.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the, did the President ever tell you, caution you, that
you had to tell the truth in an affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not that I recall.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It would have been against his interest in that lawsuit for
you to have told the truth, would it not?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not really comfortable__ I mean, I can tell you what
would have been in my best interest, but I__
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you didn't file the affidavit for your best interest, did
you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, actually, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. To avoid testifying.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But had you testified truthfully, you would have had no _
certainly, no legal implications _ it may have been embarrassing,
but you would have not had any legal problems, would you?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's true.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you discuss anything else that night in terms of__ I
would draw your attention to the cover stories. I have alluded to
that earlier, but, uh, did you talk about a cover story that night?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what was said?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, I believe that, uh, the President said something__ You
can always say you were coming to see Betty or bringing me papers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think you've testified that you're sure he said that that
night. You are sure he said that that night?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, was that in connection with the affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't believe so, no. . . .
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, you have testified in the grand jury. I think your closing
comment was that no one ever asked you to lie, but yet in that very
conversation of Dec. 17, 1997, when the President told you that you
were on the witness list, he also suggested that you could sign an
affidavit and use misleading cover stories. Isn't that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, well, I__ I guess in my mind, I separate necessarily
signing affidavit and using misleading cover stories. So, does__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, those two__
</P>
<P>
   A. Those three events occurred, but they don't__ They weren't
linked for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But they were in the same conversation, were they not?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, they were. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let me shift gears just a minute and ask you about__ And I'm
going to be delicate about this because I'm conscious of people
here in the room and my, my own personal concerns, but I want to
refer you to the first so-called salacious occasion, and I'm not
going to get into the details. I'm not__
</P>
<P>
   A. Can__ Can we__ Can you call it something else?
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K.
</P>
<P>
   A. I mean, this is__ This is my relationship__
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would you like to call it?
</P>
<P>
   A. So, I mean, is__
</P>
<P>
   Q. This is the__ or this was__
</P>
<P>
   A. It was my first encounter with the President, so I don't
really see it as my first salacious__ That's not what this was.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, that's kind of been the word that's been picked up all
around. So__
</P>
<P>
   A. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's stay on this first__
</P>
<P>
   A. Encounter, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Encounter, O.K.
</P>
<P>
   A. O.K.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So we all know what we're talking about. You had several of
these encounters, perhaps 10 or 11 of these encounters; is that
right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. Now, with regard to the first one on Nov. 15, 1995, you
have testified to a set of facts where the President actually
touched you in certain areas _ is that right? _ and that's__ That's
where I want to go. That's as far as I want to go with that
question.
</P>
<P>
   CACHERIS If that's as far as it goes, we will not object. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, in the, in later testimony before the grand jury, you
were given a definition, and in fact it was the same definition
that was used in the Paula Jones lawsuit, of sexual relations. Do
you recall the__
</P>
<P>
   A. So I've read.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   A. I was not shown that definition.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you were asked a question that incorporated that
definition.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not prior to this whole, not prior to the Independent Counsel
getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But, no, it was the Independent Counsels themselves who asked
you this question?
</P>
<P>
   A. Right. Oh, so you're, you're saying in the grand jury, I was
shown a definition of__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Right.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that's correct. Nature of Encounters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you admitted in that answer to that question that the
conduct that you were involved in, the encounter of Nov. 15, 1995,
fit within that definition of sexual relations?
</P>
<P>
   A. The second encounter of that evening did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Right.
</P>
<P>
   And were there other similar encounters later on with the
President, not that day, but other occasions that would have
likewise fit into that definition of sexual relations in the Paula
Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. And, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There was more than one occasion where that occurred?
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So, if the President testifies that he did not, he was not
guilty of having a sexual relationship under the Paula Jones
definition even, then that testimony is not truthful, is it?
</P>
<P>
   CACHERIS Objection. She should not be called upon to testify
what was in the mind of another person. She's testifying to the
facts, and she has given the facts.
</P>
<P>
   BRYANT I would ask that she answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   SEN. DeWINE Go ahead. . . .
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY Don't feel comfortable characterizing whether what
he said was truthful or not truthful. I know I've testified to what
I believe is true.
</P>
<P>
   BRYANT Well, truth is not a wandering standard.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well__
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would hope not. But you have testified, as I've told you,
that what you and he did together on Nov. 15, 1995 fit that
definition of the Paula Jones, and you've indicated that there were
other occasions that likewise__
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Q. That that occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But now the President has indicated as a part of his specific
defense __ he has filed an answer with this Senate denying that
this occurred, that he did these actions.
</P>
<P>
   A. I know. I'm not trying to be difficult, but there is a
portion of that definition that says, you know, with intent, and I
don't feel comfortable characterizing what someone else's intent
was.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you that I, my memory of this relationship and what I
remember happened fell within that definition.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to, I don't know if there's another way to phrase
that, but I'm just not comfortable commenting on someone else's
intent or state of mind or what they thought. . . .
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what did you do after you accepted service of the
subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   A. I started crying.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he just give it to you and walk away, or did he give you
any kind of explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I made a stink. I think I was trying to hope that he
would convey to the Paula Jones attorneys that I didn't know why
they were doing this, and this is ridiculous, and he said something
or another, there is a check here for witness fee. And I said I
don't want their stinking money, and so__
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did you do after, after you got through the emotional
part?
</P>
<P>
   A. I went to a pay phone, and I called Mr. Jordan. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you ask Mr. Jordan to call the President and advise him
of the subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think so, yes. I asked him to inform the President. I don't
know if it was through telephone or not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you did that because the President had asked you to make
sure you let Betty know that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, sure. With Betty not being in the office, I couldn't,
there wasn't anyone else that I could call to get through to him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did Mr. Jordan say to you when he might see the President
next?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe he said he would see him that evening at a holiday
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did Mr. Jordan during that meeting make an inquiry about the
nature of the relationship between you and the President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was that inquiry?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember the exact wording of the questions, but
there were two questions, and I think they were something like, did
you have sex with the President or did he _ and if _ or did he ask
for it or some__ Something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you__ What did you suspect at that point with these
questions from Mr. Jordan in terms of did he know or not know about
this?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I wasn't really sure. I mean, two things. I think there
is, I know I've testified to this, that there was another component
to all of this being Linda Tripp and her, what she might have led
me to believe or led me to think and how that might have
characterized how I was perceiving the situation.
</P>
<P>
   I, I sort of felt that I didn't know if he was asking me as what
are you going to say because I, I don't know the answer to these
questions, or he was asking me as, I know the answer to these
questions and what are you going to say. So, either way, for me,
the answer was no and no.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And that's just what I wanted to ask you, you did answer no
to both of those, but__
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As you explained, you didn't mention this directly, but you
mentioned in some of your earlier testimony about it, that this was
kind of a wink and, you thought this might be a wink-and-nod
conversation, where he really knew what was going on, but__
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think that's what I just said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Concern Over Gifts
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's go back now and resume where we were before the lunch
break. We were talking about the December visit to the White House
and the conversation with the President. You had discussed__ Well,
I think we're to the point where perhaps you__ Or I'll ask you to
bring up your discussion with the President about the subpoena and
the request for production.
</P>
<P>
   A. Um, part way into my meeting with the President, I brought up
the concern I had as to how I would have been put__ how I might
have been alerted or__ not alerted, but how I was put on the
witness list and how I might have been alerted to the Paula Jones
attorneys, and that that was__ I was sort of concerned about that.
So I discussed that a little, and then I said, um, that I was
concerned about the hatpin. And to the best of my memory, he said
that that had concerned him as well, and__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could he have said that bothered him?
</P>
<P>
   A. He, he could have. I, I mean, I don't, I know that sometimes
in the, in my grand jury testimony, they've put quotations around
things when I'm attributing statements to other people, and I
didn't necessarily mean that those were direct quotes. That was the
gist of what I remembered him saying. So, concern, bothered, it
doesn't__ . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. But the pattern that you had had with the President to
conceal this relationship, it was never a question that, for
instance, that given day that he gave you gifts that you were not
going to surrender those to the Jones attorneys because that
would__
</P>
<P>
   A. In my mind, there was never a question, no.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Did the President ever tell you to turn over the gifts?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not that I remember. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you later that day receive a call from Betty Currie?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tell us about that.
</P>
<P>
   A. I received a call from, from Betty, and to the best of my
memory, she said something like I understand you have something for
me or I know, I know I've testified to saying that, that I remember
her saying either I know you have something for me or the President
said you have something for me. And to me, it's a, she said, I
mean, this is not a direct quote, but the gist of the conversation
was that she was going to go visit her mom in the hospital and
she'd stop by and get whatever it was.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you question Ms. Currie or ask her, what are you talking
about or what do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because I assumed that it meant the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did, did you have other telephone calls with her that day?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. What was the purpose of those conversations?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe I spoke with her a little later to find out when
she was coming, and I think that I might have spoken with her again
when she was either leaving her house or outside or right there, to
let me know to come out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do__ At that time, did you have the caller identification?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On your telephone?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you at least on one occasion see her cell phone
number on your caller-ID that day?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I did. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. And was she, was Mrs. Currie coming by your place on her way
to visit her mother in the hospital? Do you know that?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's what I remember her saying.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you prepared, and you bought a gift for her mother?
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. Do you know what kind of time frame this covered? First
of all, it was the same day, Dec. 28, 1997?
</P>
<P>
   A. Seven, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you know what kind of time frame it covered?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it was afternoon. I know I've testified to around 2
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could it have been later?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Worry About Tripp &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let me direct your attention to your meeting with Vernon
Jordan on Dec. 31, 1997. Was that to go back and talk about the job
again?
</P>
<P>
   A. Little bit, but the, the, for me, the point of that meeting
was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't returning my
phone calls, and so I felt that I needed to devise some way, that
somehow__ to kind of cushion the shock of what would happen if
Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship, since I
had never disclosed that to the President. So that was sort of my
intention in meeting with Mr. Jordan, was hoping that I could give
a little information and that would get passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This was at a meeting for breakfast at the Park Hyatt Hotel?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were just the two of you present?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you discuss other things, other than Linda Tripp and your
job search?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think we talked about what each of us were doing New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Specifically about some notes that you had at your apartment?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Um, well, I mean, that really was in relation to discussing
Linda Tripp. So__
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. And the Jones lawyers, too. Was that right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Um, I, I don't know that I discussed the Jones lawyers. If
I've testified that I discussed the Jones lawyers, then I did,
but__
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. Well, tell us about the notes.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the__ sort of the, I don't know what to call it, but
the story that I gave to Mr. Jordan was that I was trying to sort
of alert to him that, gee, maybe Linda Tripp might be saying these
things about me having a relationship with the President, and right
now, I'm explaining this to you. These aren't the words that I used
or how I said it to him, and that, you know, maybe she had seen
drafts of notes, trying to obviously give an excuse as to how Linda
Tripp could possibly know about my relationship with the President
without me having been the one to have told her. So that's what I
said to him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what was his response?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it was something like go home and make sure__ oh,
something about a__ I think he asked me if they were notes from the
President to me, and I said no. I know I've testified to this. I
stand by that testimony, and I'm just recalling it, that I said no,
they were draft notes or notes that I sent to the President, and
then I believe he said something like, well, go home and make sure
they're not there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what did you do when you went home?
</P>
<P>
   A. I went home and I searched through some of my papers, and,
and the drafts of notes I found, I sort of, I got rid of some of
the notes that day. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did, did the subject of the affidavit come up with the
President?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, towards the end of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And how did__ tell us how that occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe I asked him if he wanted to see a copy of it, and
he said no.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, I mean, how did you introduce that into the subject,
into the conversation?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't really remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he ask you, well, how's the affidavit coming or__
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you told him that you had one being prepared, or
something?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I said, I think I said, you know, I'm going to sign
an affidavit, or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he ask you what are you going to say?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And this is the time when he said something about 15 other
affidavits?
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And tell us as best as you can recall what, how that, how
that part of the conversation went.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that was the, sort of the other half of his sentence
as, no, you know, I don't want to see it. I don't need to__ or,
I've seen 15 others.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little flippant.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has
indicated that he thought he had, might have had a way that he
could have you, get you to file a__ basically a true affidavit, but
yet still skirt these issues enough that you wouldn't be called as
a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this time?
</P>
<P>
   A. He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me at all,
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But, I mean, he didn't make an offer that, you know, here's
what you can do, or let me send you over something that can maybe
keep you from committing perjury?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. We never discussed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On__ Well, how did that conversation end? Did you talk about
anything else?
</P>
<P>
   A. I said goodbye very abruptly. . . .
</P>
<P>
   BY BRYANT:
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K.. Have you had an opportunity to review the draft of your
affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. What, do you have any comment or response?
</P>
<P>
   A. I received it. I made the suggested changes, and I believe I
spoke with Mr. Jordan about the changes I wanted to make.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he have any comment on your proposed changes?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think he said the part about Lewis and Clark College was
irrelevant. I'd have to see the__ I don't believe it's in the final
copy in the affidavit, so__ But I could be mistaken. Role of
Jordan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At this point, of course, you had a lawyer, Mr. Carter, who
was representing your interest. Mr. Jordan was, I'm not sure if he,
how you would characterize him, but would it, would it be that you
view Mr. Jordan as, in many ways, the President__ If Mr. Jordan
knew it, the President knew it, or something of that nature?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I testified to something similar to that. I felt
that, I guess, that Mr. Jordan might have had the President's best
interest at heart and my best interest at heart, so that that was
sort of maybe a, some sort of a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think, to some extent, what you, what you had said was
getting Mr. Jordan's approval was basically the same thing as
getting the President's approval. Would you agree with that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah. I believe that, yes, I believe that's how I testified
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The fact that you assume that Mr. Jordan was in contact with
the President, and I believe the evidence would support that
through his own testimony that he had talked to the President about
the signed affidavit and that he had kept the President updated on
the subpoena issue and the job search__
</P>
<P>
   A. Sir, I'm not sure that I knew he was having contact with the
President about this. I, I think what I said was that I felt that
it was getting his approval. It didn't necessarily mean that I felt
he was going to get a direct approval from the President.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry to interrupt you.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Oh, that's fine. At any time you need to clarify a point,
please, please feel free to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Did, did, did you have any indication from Mr. Jordan that he,
when he discussed the signed affidavit with the President, they
were discussing some of the contents of the affidavit? Did you
have__
</P>
<P>
   A. Before I signed it or__
</P>
<P>
   Q. No, during the drafting stage.
</P>
<P>
   A. No, absolutely not, either/or. I didn't. No, I did not. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. I wanted to ask you, I talked to you a little bit about the
President today and your feelings today that persist that you think
he's a good President, and I assume you think he's a very
intelligent man?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think he's an intelligent President.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. Thank goodness, this is confidential; otherwise, that
might be the quote of the day. I know we won't see that in the
paper, will we? Referring to Jan. 18, 1998, the President had a
conversation with Betty Currie, and he made five statements to her.
One was that I was never really alone with Monica; right?' That's
one. That's not true, is it, that I was never alone with__
</P>
<P>
   A. Sir, I was not present for that conversation. I don't feel
comfortable__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let me ask you, though__ I realize none of us were there, but
that statement, I was never really alone with Monica; right?__ that
was not, he was alone with you on many occasions, was he not?
</P>
<P>
   A. I, I'm not trying to be difficult, but I feel very
uncomfortable making judgments on what someone else's statement
when they're defining things however they want to define it. So if
you, if you ask me, Monica, were you alone with the President, I
will say yes, but I'm not comfortable characterizing what someone
else says__
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the deposition of
Sidney Blumenthal on Wednesday in the Senate impeachment trial of
President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   JAMES E. ROGAN: When you met with the president, did you relate
to him a conversation you had with the first lady earlier that day
((Jan. 21, 1998.))?
</P>
<P>
   A. I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did you tell the president the first lady told you
earlier that day?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe that I told him that the first lady had called me
earlier in the day, and, in the light of the story in The Post, had
told me that the president had helped troubled people in the past
and that he had done it many times and that he was a compassionate
person and that he helped people also out of his religious
conviction and that this was part of, part of his nature. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. And just getting us back on track, a few moments ago, I think
you, you shared with us that the first lady said that the president
helped troubled people and he had done it many times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you remember testifying before the grand jury on that
subject, saying that the first lady said he has done this dozens,
if not hundreds, of times with people?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. With troubled people?
</P>
<P>
   A. I recall that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. After you related the conversation that you had with the
first lady to the president, what do you remember saying to the
president next about the subject of Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I recall telling him that I understood he felt that
way, and that he did help people, but that he should stop trying to
help troubled people personally; that troubled people are troubled
and that they can get you in a lot of messes and that you had to
cut yourself off from it, and you just had to do it. That's what I
recall saying to him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you also remember in that conversation saying to him, you
really need to not do that at this point, that you can't get near
anybody who is even remotely crazy, you're president?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I think that was a little later in the conversation, but
I do recall saying that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you told the president that he should avoid contact with
troubled people, what did the president say to you in response?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm trying to remember the sequence of it. He, he said that
was very difficult for him. He said he, he felt a need to help
troubled people, and it was hard for him to, to cut himself off
from doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you remember him saying specifically: It's very difficult
for me to do that, given how I am; I want to help people?
</P>
<P>
   A. I recall, I recall that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And when the president referred to trying to help people, did
you understand him in that conversation to be referring to Monica
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it included Monica Lewinsky, but also many others.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Right, but it was your understanding that he was all, he was
specifically referring to Monica Lewinsky in that list of people
that he tried to help?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe that that was implied. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the president then relate a conversation he had with Dick
Morris to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. He did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the substance of that conversation, as the president
related it to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. He said that he had spoken to Dick Morris earlier that day,
and that Dick Morris had told him that if Nixon, Richard Nixon, had
given a nationally televised speech at the beginning of the
Watergate affair, acknowledging everything he had done wrong, he
may well have survived it, and that was the conversation that Dick
Morris, that's what Dick Morris said to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did it sound to you like the president was suggesting perhaps
he would go on television and give a national speech?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I don't know. I didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And when the president related the substance of his
conversation with Dick Morris to you, how did you respond to that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I said to the president, well, what have you done wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he reply?
</P>
<P>
   A. He did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did he say?
</P>
<P>
   A. He said, I haven't done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what did you say to that response?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I said, as I recall, that's one of the stupidest ideas
I ever heard. If you haven't done anything wrong, why would you do
that?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the president then give you his account of what happened
between him and Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. As I recall, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did the president tell you?
</P>
<P>
   A. He, uh, he spoke, uh, fairly rapidly, as I recall, at that
point and said that she had come on to him and made a demand for
sex, that he had rebuffed her, turned her down, and that she, uh,
threatened him. And, uh, he said that she said to him, uh, that she
was called the stalker by her peers and that she hated the term,
and that she would claim that they had had an affair whether they
had or they hadn't, and that she would tell people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you remember him also saying that the reason Monica
Lewinsky would tell people that is because then she wouldn't be
known by her peers as the stalker anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that's right.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you remember the president also saying that, and I'm
quoting: `I've gone down that road before. I've caused pain for a
lot of people. I'm not going to do that again'?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. He told me that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And that was in the same conversation that you had with the
president?
</P>
<P>
   A. Right, in, in that sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you describe for us the president's demeanor when he
shared this information with you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. He was, uh, very upset. I thought he was a man in
anguish. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. After you were subpoenaed to testify but before you testified
before the federal grand jury, did the president ever recant his
earlier statements to you about Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. After you were subpoenaed but before you testified before the
federal grand jury, did the president ever say that he did not want
you to mislead the grand jury with a false statement?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. We didn't have any subsequent conversation about this
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So it would be fair also to say that after you were
subpoenaed but before you testified before the federal grand jury,
the president never told you that he was not being truthful with
you in that Jan. 21 conversation about Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, he never spoke to me about that at all. ...
</P>
<P>
   LINDSEY GRAHAM: OK. I'm going to ask as direct, to-the-point
questions as I can so we all can go home. June 4, 1998, when you
testified to the grand jury, on page 49 _ I guess it's page 185 on
tab 4. ... That's where you start talking about the story that the
president told you. Knowing what you know now, do you believe the
president lied to you about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I do.

   WASHINGTON _ Following is a proposed resolution of censure by

</P>
<P>
   WHEREAS William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United

OFFICIALS UNFAZED BY POOR GRADE IN SURVEY  
 KIND WORDS _ IN PUBLIC  
 SEEKING FUNDS, TACTFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., Ala.)  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were the sort of grades that might make a
youngster fear a swift grounding, but when New York state received
a report card this week that was less than flattering, Albany
officialdom merely shrugged. So what if the only state that fared
worse was Alabama?
</P>
<P>
   The grades arrived courtesy of Governing magazine, which
published a survey that rated the performance of state governments
in five areas _ from personnel practices to information technology.
At C-minus, New York's average was among the lowest in the nation.
In financial management, the cradle of Wall Street garnered a
D-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the comments echoed evaluations of the state by other
independent monitors: too many late budgets, a ``titanic'' debt
load, poor planning and a generally haphazard management style.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, blamed the
governor's predecessors and some legislators for many of the
deficiencies cited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the problems that Governor Pataki inherited, and how
far we've come,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and a handful of other states also received C-minus
averages. Governing magazine, a monthly published by Congressional
Quarterly whose primary readership is state and local government
officials, conducted the survey with the Maxwell School of
Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. New Jersey
scored a B-minus.
</P>
<P>
   Kind Words _ in Public
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are
squabbling anew, Pataki continues to maintain that Giuliani is a
fine mayor who would make a fine candidate for the U.S. Senate in
2000. That praise has not allayed suspicion that the governor and
his associates would privately prefer that the mayor not move up
the political ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why an event later this month in an area south of
Albany could carry some interesting undertones. The Columbia County
Republican Committee is holding its annual Lincoln Day dinner, and
the guest of honor is Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican who
is also considering entering the race to succeed Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates testing the waters typically make the rounds of such
dinners. Giuliani plans to speak at events in Albany County and
elsewhere in the state over the next few months. Yet Columbia
County is not just another upstate Republican stronghold. It is the
home of the chairman of the Republican State Committee, William
Powers, and the Republican leader in the state Assembly, John Faso
_ who are close to Pataki and plan to be at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the significance of the invitation to Lazio, Martin
Tuczinski, the Columbia County Republican chairman, demurred,
saying he was interested only in helping Lazio become better known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he would be a formidable candidate,'' he said of
Lazio. ``It just so happens that in the year 2000, the Republican
Party is going to have a lot of good candidates _ Rick Lazio,
Giuliani. We have got a full plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking Funds, Tactfully
</P>
<P>
   The budget that Pataki proposed last week called for a small cut
in spending at the attorney general's office, a move that, if
adopted, might force the state's new top attorney, Eliot Spitzer,
to reduce staff or programs.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, a Democrat, has gone out of his way to avoid
antagonizing the Republican governor. And rather than taking the
proposed budget cut as a slight, he is chalking it up to the
delayed transition that occurred because the man he ousted, Dennis
Vacco, refused to concede for several weeks after a very tight
election.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's aides said he did not have time to present a budget
request to the Pataki administration, so the figures in the
proposal that the governor announced are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to believe from all our contacts with the
governor's office that the budget number is going to increase,''
said Marc Violette, a spokesman for Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Pataki's budget office, declined
to say whether the administration had made any promises. ``We are
expecting an additional request from them, and will sit down with
them to discuss the request,'' Conway said.

HILL HEATS UP WINTERNATIONALS' TOP FUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Who said nitro-burning engines can't run in
sub-70 degree weather?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Eddie Hill and Del Worsham, who despite 60-degree
cold conditions claimed the top spots in Top Fuel and Funny Car
during Friday qualifying for the 39th Winternationals.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, the 1993 Top Fuel champion, blistered the Pomona Raceway
asphalt with a phenomenal 4.535-second pass at 318.80 mph. His
elapsed time is a Winternationals event record and is the fourth
quickest in National Hot Rod Association history. Only Joe Amato
(4.523) and Gary Scelzi (4.525, 4.530) have covered the quarter
mile quicker.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to start the season, said Hill, who won this event in
1995. We had a blowover here once (in 1989), and that was a
different way to start the season. This is a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   La Mirada native Mike Dunn is second at 4.631 with Cory
McClenathan third at 4.631. Dunn is second based on his speed
advantage of 313.22 mph versus McClenathan's 307.09 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Whittier resident Robert Reehl is 10th at 5.838. Only 10 of the
23 competitors in Top Fuel and seven of the 20 in Funny Car made
full passes due to the cold conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It's really tough to run in these conditions, Hill said. We saw
a lot of smoke up there (from other teams). It was about 60
(degrees), and that's usually the cutoff. But it was so smooth that
I was surprised it ran as quick as it did. It didn't feel as good
as the number it ran.
</P>
<P>
   Del Worsham had similar feelings after recording a 4.968 pass at
291.51 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Worsham, who last qualified on the pole at a national event in
1991, was the only Funny Car team to eclipse the five-second
barrier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   I'm so excited, I can hardly speak, Worsham said. We were
concerned about the cold conditions. It shook the tires but still
went right on down. Without the tire shake, I think we could have
run a (4.84), so hopefully we can do that (today). It was tough
losing (Thursday's session). This is our home track and with our
sponsors here, we just wanted to get qualified. We feel real
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Capps, who finished second in points last season, is second
with a 5.003, while eight-time Funny Car champion John Force is
third at 5.016. Force did set a Winternationals record with a speed
of 313.73 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Covina native Randy Anderson, who is competing on a limited
budget, is 12th. Anderson spun the tires off the line and coasted
to a 12.095.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Toliver, who is driving the World Wrestling Federation car
with 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin painted on the hood, is 20th with a
23.199.
</P>
<P>
   It was a family affair in Pro Stock where defending and
four-time champion Warren Johnson and son Kurt grabbed the top two
qualifying positions. Warren Johnson set Winternationals event
records in both E.T. and speed following a pass of 6.926 at 200.20
mph. Kurt Johnson was next at 6.942 for the No. 2 position.
</P>
<P>
   Jeg Coughlin, who finished second in points last season, is
third following a run of 6.943.
</P>
<P>
   That was an ugly duckling run of the session, Warren Johnson
said. The car went to the left, shook the tires on every gear
change, moved all over the race track, and still managed to get to
the other end in one piece. We've got something to work with now.
We were aggressive on the clutch because we didn't want to burn up
the discs. We felt the track wouldn't be at its optimum today
because of the humidity.
</P>
<P>
   They (the NHRA) took by `performance advantage' away, so I had
to do something.
</P>
<P>
   Defending se champion Larry Kopp is No. 1 in Pro Stock Truck
with a pass of 7.598 at 176.88 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Covina resident Andy Manna had yet to qualify after going no
quicker then 7.867 during two sessions on Friday. He will have one
attempt to get into the 16-car field this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Stock Truck begins eliminations this afternoon with
first-round action. The remaining three rounds will be run Sunday.

GANG BOSS, IN PLEA DEAL, SAYS HE PLAYED ROLE IN 13 KILLINGS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The leader of a Bronx drug gang avoided the
possibility of a death sentence Friday by pleading guilty to
federal racketeering charges in which he admitted a role in 13
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a plea bargain, the defendant, Clarence Heatley,
47, will be sentenced to life in prison, said Mary Jo White, the
U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Sentencing is set for May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley's case was watched widely because he was one of two
defendants scheduled to face trial in U.S. District Court later
this month in what would be the first federal death penalty trial
in Manhattan in more than 40 years. The other defendant, John Cuff,
a former New York City housing police officer, still could face the
death penalty if he is convicted at the trial, which is to begin on
Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Heatley spent more than an hour responding to questions
from Judge Michael B. Mukasey about his role in the killings,
extortions, robberies and other crimes in which he was charged.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many grisly crimes recounted by an assistant U.S.
attorney, Sharon L. McCarthy, that Heatley appeared at times to be
unable to remember the name of each victim he had ordered killed,
or each accomplice he had carry out the acts.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley also shook his head vigorously at a few points as Ms.
McCarthy described the evidence against him, leaving the impression
that he disputed some of her account.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that Heatley had carried out any of the
killings himself. The victims were members of rival gangs and
associates of his own gang, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley's brother and sister, who were in court, each complained
afterward that Heatley had been unfairly forced to accept blame for
others' crimes. ``It's not fair,'' said his brother, William Mack,
51. ``A lot of the charges belong to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Heatley acknowledged to the judge that he was
pleading guilty because he was indeed guilty of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, one of his lawyers, Joel S. Cohen, said in a
telephone interview that both he and his co-counsel in the case,
David A. Ruhnke, had concluded that Heatley would have been
convicted if he had gone to trial, and faced two choices: life in
prison or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There didn't seem to be any upside to going to trial,'' Cohen
said, ``if we could be certain that he would avoid execution by
pleading guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Heatley also wanted to spare his family ``from
having to experience his execution, and he also wanted to try to be
a positive presence in the lives of his children.''
</P>
<P>
   Heatley was accused by the federal government of running a
particularly brutal drug organization that terrorized parts of the
Bronx and Manhattan for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Heatley was accused of effectively imposing death
penalties on two associates, after one of them had angered him by
committing an extortion using his name.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Ms. McCarthy, told the judge that Heatley had
ordered the two men taken to the gang's headquarters in the
basement of an apartment building in the Bronx, where he held a
mock trial and ordered both men executed. Each was strangled, Ms.
McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley did not confirm the details of the prosecutor's account
in court, but he told the judge: ``Yes, Your Honor, I did direct
them to be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Heatley also acknowledged in court that he had made a
substantial income from his drug dealing, which primarily involved
the sale of cocaine and crack cocaine from 1990 to 1996, the
authorities said.

INFUSING HOLLYWOOD SONGS WITH GLORIOUS   LIFE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never underestimate the ability of a great singer to
take a piece of flowery, high-minded schmaltz and infuse with it
with an emotional life that transforms it into something grand and
glorious. That's what Lillias White did at Carnegie Hall on
Thursday evening near the end of a concert celebrating the work of
the Hollywood song lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning and twirling notes and digging deep into her gut, the
pop-gospel singer turned ``The Way He Makes Me Feel,'' a lumbering,
oversize ballad from the score of ``Yentl,'' into a stormy dramatic
monologue rumbling with thunder. Then she did it again to ``The Way
We Were,'' the Bergmans' finest and best-known movie theme song.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's coup was the brightest spot in an evening that
opened with a leaden, hyperbolic testimonial by Harry Belafonte and
continued with performances by Freddy Cole, Maureen McGovern,
Michel Legrand and Bea Arthur that were sabotaged by terrible
acoustics. In song after song, the sound of a large orchestra led
by Mike Renzi swamped the voices of singers who were amplified in a
way that made them sound feeble and tinny. During the second half
of the concert, the sound was noticeably improved.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergmans certainly have earned a place in Hollywood musical
history by refreshing and modernizing a billowy romantic style
exemplified by the Sammy Fain-Paul Francis Webster ballad ``Love Is
a Many-Splendored Thing.'' Working with composers like Michel
Legrand and Ivan Lins, they broadened and internationalized the
style. At the same time, they infused an unrealistic fairy tale
sentimentality with healthy doses of pop psychology and sex.
</P>
<P>
   The heaving sensual imagery they pumped into their romantic
lyrics is the movie-song equivalent of the pulpy eroticism in the
novels of Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz, their artistic
equivalents in the world of popular fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergmans also specialized in writing about the problems of
long-term relationships. They were among the first Hollywood
lyricists to ask questions like, ``How Do You Keep the Music
Playing?,'' the title of one of their finest songs, which Ms.
McGovern and Legrand sang as a duet.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. White's pop-gospel effusions, the show's most powerful
moment belonged to the pop-country singer Mary Chapin Carpenter,
who degreased one of the Bergmans' best-known lyrics, ``You Don't
Bring Me Flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Arranged in a slightly countrified pop-jazz style, with all its
fat skimmed off, the song emerged as a bitter wife's bitter
accusation of neglect to a complacent husband.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bergmans responsible for creating ``everlasting
poetry,'' as Belafonte claimed in his opening remarks? No. But at
least a dozen of their songs are likely to endure as popular
standards.

GONZALEZ SATISFIED WITH MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez will earn
$8.5 million this year, a bargain compared with many of the game's
premier players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that neither distresses nor disturbs the American League's
two-time most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who received the Rangers' 1998 Player of the Year
Award during the organization's banquet last night at the Hyatt
Regency in Dallas, witnessed salaries escalate substantially this
winter for the game's free-agent elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need that,'' Gonzalez said. ``I don't need to be the
highest-paid player in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   That distinction belongs to right-hander Kevin Brown, who signed
a seven-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers in December
worth an average annual salary of $15 million. First baseman Mo
Vaughn received a six-year contract from the Anaheim Angles worth
$13.33 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets signed catcher Mike Piazza to a seven-year
contract worth $13 million annually, and left fielder Albert Belle
signed a five-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles worth $13
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez will be nowhere near the highest-paid player during the
2000 season either, should the Rangers exercise their option on his
contract for $7.5 million. Nevertheless, the 29-year-old outfielder
reiterated his satisfaction with his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers likely will attempt to discuss an extension for
Gonzalez this spring, and that would please him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to sit down and talk about the situation,'' said
Gonzalez, who does not oppose negotiations continuing through the
season. ``It won't be a distraction for me. I'll be focused. All I
want to do is to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here. It's a great place for baseball, and the fans
here are wonderful. I'd like to stay here and finish my career in
Texas.''
SELE LIKELY TO AVOID ARBITRATION
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Rangers and right-hander Aaron Sele will avoid
Thursday's scheduled arbitration hearing in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going that way, but you can never tell,'' Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``We're still talking, and I
think we've made progress.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-year contract remains the focus of negotiations, Melvin
said. Adam Katz, who represents Sele, submitted a figure of $6.25
million for the arbitration hearing. The Rangers offered $4.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement on a one-year contract almost assuredly will
produce a salary between the two figures exchanged by the parties
and make Sele the highest-paid starting pitcher in the
organization's history.
WETTELAND READY FOR SPRING
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Wetteland, who underwent arthroscopic surgery
Oct. 27 to remove a bone spur and a loose body from his right
elbow, says he will be ready for spring training when pitchers and
catchers report Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to do what everyone else is doing,'' Wetteland
said. ``I'm already doing it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland threw all four pitches _ fastball, curveball, slider
and changeup _ for 20 minutes yesterday and said it was the first
time from ``start to finish where the last fastball was cracking
like the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland said his rehabilitation went wonderfully but added
that ``it was maddening for a long time simply because I'm very
impatient when it comes to myself. There were periods where I
thought I'd never throw again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will monitor Wetteland closely during the spring and
might reduce his work to ensure his availability for Opening Day.

FREEZING A MOMENT OF BEETHOVEN AND THE PRINCE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Germany)  By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Levin played the solo part on Thursday night
at Merkin Hall in the first U.S. performance of a Beethoven score _
a seemingly authentic version of the G Major Piano Concerto with
string quintet accompaniment _ and in his introductory remarks
neatly let slip one of the paradoxes of musical restoration work.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, he said, he would embellish the written text with
ornaments and flourishes, but this time he would not do so because
he did not want to confuse or disturb the amendments Beethoven
himself made to the piano part for this chamber version, which was
created soon after the original work's first performance, at the
behest of the composer's patron Prince Lobkowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's usual practice honors what is known or suspected of
music in the classical period, that performers regularly tweaked
the scores in front of them. The reconstruction of the chamber
version of this concerto _ a reconstruction owed to the German
musicologist Hans-Werner Kuethen _ defers instead to a different
understanding of authenticity: that anything from a great
composer's hand is of value. One view sees music as always in flux
and the performance as an unrepeatable moment. The other wants to
freeze the moment _ in this case a moment in Prince Lobkowitz's
salon in 1808 _ and make it available again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Which way should we go?
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is to let Beethoven be our guide. Since he seems
not to have tried to get the arrangement published, he cannot have
thought too highly of it. Or we can just listen and decide for
ourselves. The chamber version allows players to go faster than
usual, as Levin and his colleagues in the New York Philomusica
Chamber Ensemble enjoyed doing on this occasion. It also makes the
solo part more difficult by adding detail, but less heroic because
of the domestic scale, especially if, as here, the piano is placed
behind the strings as it almost has to be for reasons of balance.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody now could hear this arrangement without having the
orchestral version as mental background, and the inevitable
comparison makes the music sound trimmed and diminished, even in a
forthright performance. Levin's remarkable strength, with no
noisiness, came from a full bass, beautifully balanced chords and a
command of the long crescendo extending through passages of
textural diversity. One would want to hear him playing the concerto
under any circumstances, but its chamber dress will remain a
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included Haydn's ``Frog'' Quartet and John
Harbison's Variations for violin, clarinet and piano. Harbison's
deft counterpoint and subtle scoring _ amazing how variously these
three instruments can combine _ were vividly brought to life by
Carmit Zori, David Krakauer and Levin. But the parts, in multiple
leaves slipping from the music stands, are obviously a publishing
disaster.

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR, PATRIOT OWNER NOT BACKING AWAY FROM STADIUM
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Faced with a growing maze of legal and
environmental hurdles, Gov. John G. Rowland and the owner of the
New England Patriots, Robert K. Kraft, insisted Friday that they
will still be able sign a football stadium deal, now three weeks
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which seemed assured when the General Assembly
overwhelmingly approved construction of a state-built stadium in
December, has been stalled by several complications that the
stadium's proponents had once dismissed as pesky details.
</P>
<P>
   The state has not been able to negotiate a deal to move a steam
plant off the site, several lawsuits have been threatened and
planners now expect the stadium's opening to be delayed for a year
or more past the target date in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most critical concerns is the environmental
contamination of the riverfront site in downtown Hartford where the
state wants to build the $375 million stadium. On Friday, the
National Football League Players Association joined critics in
warning about the extent of cancer-causing pollutants in the soil
and ground water there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they're going from artificial turf to toxic
turf,'' said Richard A. Berthelsen, the general counsel for the
association, which represents players on labor issues. ``The
problem apparently has been minimized up to this point, but we're
very concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who twice scolded reporters for being ``on the death
watch,'' said everything would work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen,'' he said. ``Let me reiterate that. It's
going to happen, in spite of the naysayers, the people that want to
take votes and have petition drives. The vote has taken place. The
commitment has been made. We're there.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Rowland's exuberance, Kraft couched his comments
with his customary reserve. ``Everything I know as of today,
there's no doubt in my mind that this will happen,'' Kraft said.
``After 40 years, our dedicated and loyal fans will have a stadium
worthy of their support. It's a great moment for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After the legislature's vote, the team and the governor's office
were to agree on and sign a final development agreement by Jan. 15.
The signing was postponed several times, and on Friday Rowland said
the agreement should be signed ``sometime next week.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it runs more than 250 pages, and that the delay was
simply a result of ``the final T's and I's being crossed and
dotted.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem appears to be Connecticut Natural Gas Co.'s
steam plant, which heats most office buildings in downtown Hartford
and could cost $100 million to move. Negotiations between the state
and the gas company's parent, CTG Resources Inc., have gone badly,
city and state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said the state or the developer must pay the
cost of moving the plant. But Rowland said that the latest talks
had been fruitful and he expected progress ``in the next several
weeks.'' John P. O'Connell, the manager of government and labor
relations for CTG Resources, said the company had no response.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft declined to answer when asked if he was willing to sign
the agreement before the steam plant problem was resolved, saying
that was the responsibility of state officials. ``I'm not competent
to speak on that issue, but I believe they have many smart people
who are dealing with it and understand it, and we hope and believe
that it's going to be solved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the same question, Rowland said: ``If we find some time in
the future that is an obstacle we can't overcome, then Robert Kraft
and John Rowland sit down and make whatever changes need to take
place. The point is, the Patriots want to be here. We want them
here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the state and the team still hope the stadium can open
in 2001, as originally planned, state officials seem resigned to a
delay of at least a year, which is allowed under the preliminary
agreement between Rowland and Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   An Environmental Protection Agency official said that even 2002
might be an ambitious target because of the huge cleanup job needed
and the large number of permits that will be required.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth A. Higgins, the director of environmental review for
the agency's New England office, said a 2002 opening is possible,
``but they're going to have to get on it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Litigation could also delay construction. Ralph Nader, the
consumer advocate, who is a Connecticut resident, said he planned
to challenge the agreement in federal and state courts, focusing on
the tax exemptions and other incentives the state has agreed to
extend to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly, a Democrat
who took office in January, said he was considering a lawsuit to
prevent the Patriots' departure, but said he had no timetable for
making a decision. ``My job is to protect the legal interests of
this state,'' he said. ``We are exploring legal options and legal
theories.''

`A LOVELY SUNDAY FOR CREVE COEUR': AS IF THE GENTLEMAN CALLER NEVER
CALLED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his declining years, as the spark of his genius
fired less frequently and less brightly, Tennessee Williams sought
inspiration in the simpler themes that had brought him his first
success as a playwright. He never really found it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur,'' a 1979 play that is
being staged by the Chain Lightning Theater, Williams traveled all
the way back to the St. Louis of the 1930s to tell a tale of deceit
and misunderstanding in a love affair that consciously or
unconsciously begs comparison to ``The Glass Menagerie.''
</P>
<P>
   The play takes place one lazy summer Sunday. Dorothea, a high
school civics teacher who is renting a room from a middle-aged
German spinster named Bodey, has yielded her virtue to the school's
principal, Ralph Ellis, in the reclining front seat of a Reo Flying
Cloud and is expecting a call from him at any moment. Bodey,
however, is preparing fried chicken and deviled eggs for a picnic
at which she hopes to further her own matchmaking between Dorothea
and her brother, a man who by all accounts has an excessive
fondness for beer, sauerkraut and cigars.
</P>
<P>
   The Creve Coeur of the title refers not only to the St. Louis
park where the picnic is to be held, but also to Dorothea's broken
heart when the call she is anticipating never comes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the play is that Williams never fully
develops his characters or builds any tension in the plot. Everyone
knows within the first few minutes that the telephone is not going
to ring for Dorothea. When Bodey tears an item from the society
section of the Sunday newspaper to keep Dorothea from seeing it,
the audience has no doubt it is an announcement of Ralph Ellis'
wedding or engagement to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of a mischief-making colleague of Dorothea's from
the high school (a snobbish art teacher) and an upstairs neighbor
of Bodey's (who speaks only German) serve only as distractions.
Dorothea keeps doing body exercises, then inexplicably lying down
to rest; Bodey is a bit deaf and has some business with a hearing
aid; the neighbor has a sudden attack of diarrhea, and there is an
offstage toilet overflow for which a mop must be fetched; the art
teacher snipes at everybody.
</P>
<P>
   What doesn't happen is an appearance onstage by Ralph Ellis to
allow Dorothea the chance to give voice to her sense of betrayal.
It would be as though Williams had written ``The Glass Menagerie''
without bringing on the Gentleman Caller. There are occasional
glimmers of the poet in some of the writing, including one
monologue on the fine art of buying chickens. But for the most part
the situation itself becomes the source of the humor.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the Chain Lightning production, which is directed by
Amy Wright, a fine actress herself, does not make a strong case for
the play. The performances are rarely above acting-class level and
are exaggerated to the point of caricature. Any sense of poignancy
in Dorothea's plight is lost in the cast's apparent efforts to turn
the play into a zany comedy. Williams didn't really write zany.
