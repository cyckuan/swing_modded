opened the scoring only two minutes after the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
But the Americans levelled the score eight minutes later on a
lapse of the Chinese defenders. The winner was net in the dying
minutes.

<HEADLINE> White House to Urge Gun Purchase Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- With the U.S. Supreme Court
having struck down a key portion of the Brady Act, one that forced
local sheriffs and police chiefs to conduct background searches on
handgun purchasers, the White House said Friday it will urge
states to continue to do them.
</P>
<P>
White House deputy press secretary Barry Toiv said President
Bill Clinton believes "strongly that if you do not get a criminal
background check, you should not get a gun," and will examine
possible new legislation to overcome the Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Barry Toiv said Clinton ordered Attorney General Janet Reno and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin to contact local law enforcement
authorities and "remind them" the Supreme Court ruling does not
prevent them from conducting their own background checks.
</P>
<P>
The Brady Law requires a mandatory waiting period before
handgun purchases to allow time for criminal background checks.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in its 5-4 decision, said the federal
government cannot force the states to administer a program to
enforce federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
The ruling left intact the waiting period, and therefore was
seen as affecting only a small number of relatively small states
that have not yet used instant computer background checks.

JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today reaffirmed Indonesia's full support for the struggle of the
Syrian people in regaining its territory from Israel.
</P>
<P>
"President Soeharto has reaffirmed Indonesia's support for the

Israel," Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said here today
following talks between Soeharto and visiting Syrian Prime
Minister Mahmoud al-Zoubi at the Merdeka Palace.

<P>
During the talks, Soeharto stressed Indonesia's position not to
open diplomatic ties with Israel.

"So long as Israel does not fully comply with UN Security
Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425, Indonesia will not consider
the possibility of opening diplomatic relations with Israel,"
Soeharto was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides discussing political affairs, the two leaders also
talked about ways to enhance the two countries' bilateral economic
and trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Greco-Cypriot Defense Pact Implemented as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister Costas
Eliades said today that the joint defense pact between Greece and
Cyprus is being implemented as planned.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony here for Greek Cypriot officers who
graduated from military academies in Greece, Eliades said that
the joint defense pact is a cooperation agreement in the
military field within a joint defense plan to tackle a common
threat.
</P>
<P>
The pact, reached in November 1993 between Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and the late Greek premier Andreas Papandreou,
provides Cyprus with sea, air and land cover from the Greek
military in the event of fresh offensives against the island.
</P>
<P>
Eliades noted that "the pact exists and is being continued as
originally planned."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the Greek Cypriot political
leadership has chosen to solve the Cyprus problem through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He called on all countries interested in a viable and
permanent solution to the Cyprus problem to "seriously take into
account the Turkish sides' stance and policy."
</P>
<P>
Eliades was referring to recent violations of Cypriot air
space by Turkish military aircraft, which the Cypriot government
has protested to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Both Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have
confirmed their participation in the U.N.-sponsored direct talks
between the two communities on the island, due to begin near New
York on July 9.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and took control of its northern
third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Rival Parties in N.Ireland Hold Talks to Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Rival Protestants and Roman
Catholics in Northern Ireland began their talks today to defuse
rising tension as "marching season" approaches.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held near the provincial capital Belfast after
suspected Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas fired a rocket on
a police patrol in Belfast late Thursday. No one was injured by
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The disputed parade organized by the pro-British Protestants
will begin on July 6 at Drumcree near Portadown, but the
anti-British Catholics say such parades are anti-Irish and
inflammatory and should be confined to Protestant zones.
</P>
<P>
The marching season climaxes on July 12 when tens of thousands
of Protestants mark the 1690 "Battle of the Boyne" victory by King
William of Orange over the Catholic King James and his Irish
forces.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Mo Mowlam said today she would "leave no
stone unturned" to prevent a repeat of bloody clashes that swept
the divided province last year during the protestants' traditional
parade season.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said in a statement that she and the participants wanted
"to find an honorable and principled accommodation on this
difficult issue."
</P>
<P>
"These proximity talks represent a genuine attempt, in good
faith, to find a way through a complex and highly emotive
problem," she added.
</P>
<P>
However, if no compromise is reached at the talks over the
Portadown parade, Mowlam and the police may be forced to ban it or
a rival "street festival" that the Catholics plan to stage in its
path.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair issued an ultimatum on
Wednesday to IRA, saying the peace talks will start in September
with or without IRA which has been barred from the multi-party
peace talks because it refused to call a cease-fire. If IRA agrees
to give up arms, it can be included in the peace negotiations that
is expected to end next May.

<HEADLINE> Last Working Day in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- With just the four days to go
before July 1 when Hong Kong returns to China, Hong Kong civil
servants had their last working day today.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants seemed to be more busy than ever in the Central
Government Office. Debbie Ho, chief information officer of the
Secretariat Press Office said, "From Saturday on, Hong Kong will
have a five-day holiday and the civil servants have to handle many
things today."
</P>
<P>
She said her colleagues were making preparations for the next
five days, not for vacationing but for lending a hand to those
arranging the Hong Kong Handover Ceremony and to those working in
the Press and Broadcast Center for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants of the Economic Branch received their new
name cards today. After July 1, the Chief Secretary's Office will
be renamed Government Headquarters of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Miss Ho said that her colleagues were very pleased to have
their new name cards on the last working day before Hong Kong's
handover.
</P>
<P>
At the reception hall of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations
Branch at Wanchai, Hong Kong Island, some staff workers were
removing the word "Royal" from the name of the Hong Kong Police.
</P>
<P>
A staff member said, "the removal has to be done today so that
after the holiday, our branch will have a new look."
</P>
<P>
At the gate of the Hong Kong Fire Services Headquarters
Building, some staff members were taking down the old logo of the
fire services and put on a new one.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hung Cheung-wing, senior information officer of the Fire
Services Department, said that the new logo is free of colonial
flavor, adding that it will be the most striking change to the
department after the handover.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the staff members of the department will be
busy preventing possible fires during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
He said that his department would try its best to ensure Hong
Kong people's safety in the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Frank Chan Fan, a senior electronics engineer with the
Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, said that all the
staff members there would be at their posts after the five-day
holiday when Hong Kong will have become the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that there will be no changes to his department except
for their name cards which bear the words "the government of the
HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
Today is also the last trading day at the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. The Hang Seng Index increased 68.77 points to close at
15,196.79, hitting an all time high.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Send Extra Troops for September Polls in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Council (NAC),
NATO's top decision-making body, today decided to "temporarily"
reinforce the NATO-led peacekeeping force (SFOR) in Bosnia to
safeguard the planned municipal elections in September.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters here that up to six
battalions would be sent to Bosnia to join the 35,000-strong
SFOR.
</P>
<P>
During an NAC meeting here today, it was decided that "no
significant changes to the size and capabilities" of SFOR would
take place until the NAC, in consultation with non-NATO SFOR
contributors, had thoroughly assessed the security situation in
Bosnia after the elections.
</P>
<P>
While the opposing parties in Bosnia remained in general
compliance with the military provisions of the Dayton peace
accord, the 16 NATO ambassadors, who constitute the NAC, together
with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, expressed "serious
concerns" about the deficiencies remaining in the overall
implementation of the peace agreement which ended the near
four-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The 16 NATO countries reaffirmed that SFOR would provide the
general security framework for the elections as well as other
direct support to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) which is overseeing the elections.
</P>
<P>
After Bosnia's municipal elections, SFOR's mission is expected
to enter the "Deterrence Phase, from the current "Stabilization
Phase", with a reduction in the number of soldiers to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
Replacing NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR) last December, SFOR
was mandated for an 18-month-long operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
So far, 36 countries have contributed to SFOR, including the 16
NATO members and 20 non-NATO countries.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Gains at 5.9 Percent Pace in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy expanded at a
quicker pace of 5.9 percent in the first three months of this
year, U.S. Commerce Department said in its final report today.
</P>
<P>
It was the fastest growth rate in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The final report on the economy growth in the first three
months represented an improvement over last month's 5.8 percent
estimate for the gross domestic product (GDP) and April's 5.6
percent figure.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the economic boom, which built on robust
growth of 3.8 percent in the final three months of last year, was
driven by consumers.
</P>
<P>
The consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of
U.S. GDP, expanded at a 5.6 percent annual rate last quarter, the
best in five years.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction and spending by businesses on new
buildings and equipment also contributed to the big jump in GDP
early this year.
</P>
<P>
And the growth came with an inflation gauge tied to the GDP
advancing at a moderate 2.7 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the economy probably won't grow this strongly
again for quite some time. They're predicting second-quarter
growth will register around a moderate 2 percent as consumers take
a breather from their spending spree of early in the year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown appears to be coming just in time to dissuade the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) from increasing short-term interest
rate to keep inflation tame.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Fed policy-makers, who increased short-term interest rate
by a quarter percentage point in March 25, will meet on early July
to decide the monetary policy in the second half of this year.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's executive body, adopted on Friday a decision to
conclude the Interim Agreements with Georgia and Armenia on behalf
of the European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom.
</P>
<P>
A Commission spokesman said that this would allow the two
Interim Agreements to enter into force within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Agreements put into force the trade-related
provisions of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreements between
the EU and these two countries, which have yet to be ratified.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Agreements formally liberalize trade in goods other
than steel, textiles and coal, offers both sides Most Favored
Nation treatment regarding tariffs and duties, and also provides
for mutual assistance in customs matters.
</P>
<P>
Georgia and Armenia commit themselves to raise protection of
intellectual property rights to European levels.
</P>
<P>
"The guarantees of the Interim Agreement will stimulate growth
in bilateral trade and is an excellent basis for the further
integration of these two countries in the global economy," EU's
Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek commented.
</P>
<P>
EU's Interim Agreements with Georgia and Armenia were signed
respectively in October and December last year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Damascus Declaration FMs' Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed welcome to
the joint statement issued Thursday by the foreign ministers
of Damascus Declaration Signatories and termed it as a "positive"
sign in relations between Iran and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA today published a statement by
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi, in which he
said the readiness and interest of the Damascus Declaration states
in improving relations with Iran could be considered as a
"positive sign."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said "such an issue would not only be in line with
expansion of cooperation among regional states, but would also be
the sole way of guaranteeing security in the sensitive region of
the Persian Gulf and of helping promote international peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting of foreign ministers of Damascus
Declaration states, which include Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
ended Thursday in Syria's Mediterranean resort of Lattakia.
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement, the foreign ministers emphasized the
sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the three Gulf
islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs in its dispute
with Iran, calling on both sides to enter into serious talks for a
peaceful solution to this issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman expressed his hope that the fading away
of certain Arab countries' optimism toward Israel would strengthen
Arab cooperation and Islamic solidarity for defending the
legitimate rights of Palestinians and liberation of the Arab
occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ongoing dispute between Iran and the UAE over
the three islands of Abu Moussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs at the
mouth of the strategic Hormuz Strait, which are claimed by both
Iran and the UAE, could be solved on the basis of the 1971
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He added that "Arab countries should strive for encouraging
the UAE to continue talks with Iran and to refrain from making
mistakes in evaluation of cooperation priorities and in spotting
the dangers which threatened the Arab world."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the three islands are inseparable parts of
Iran and any claim on their ownership could only weaken Islamic
solidarity and strengthen Israel and foreign forces in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Briefs German Media on Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Germany Lu
Qiutian stressed here today that the Chinese government will hold
on to the "one country, two systems" principle and will do its
best to guarantee stability and property of Hong Kong after its
return to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Bonn, Lu said: "The return of
Hong Kong is an event of historic importance" which will enable
the Chinese people to put an end to an over-100-year-old disgrace
and realize the long-term wish for reunification.
</P>
<P>
After giving an overview over Hong Kong's history and its
recent development, Lu expressed confidence in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government will make every effort
to preserve stability and prosperity of Hong Kong because it is
not only in the interests of Hong Kong, but also in the interests
of China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In order to carry on the successful reform and opening-up
policy, China needs Hong Kong as a bridge leading to the world.
Meanwhile Hong Kong also serves as a bridge for the world to gain
access to the huge Chinese market, Lu said, adding that Hong Kong
also needs the mainland as a market and a vast hinterland for its
stable development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador dismissed as "groundless" some
international scepticism about Hong Kong's democracy, civil rights
and press freedom after its return to the motherland, stressing
that the Chinese government will make all its efforts to practice
the policies of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, let "Hong
Kong people govern Hong Kong" and let them enjoy "a high degree of
autonomy".
</P>
<P>
"China is fully aware that the concept of allowing two
different social, political and economic systems to coexist in one
country will pose a great challenge to us," Lu said. But "the
development of the last 13 years give us the courage and
confidence that we will be able to bring it to a success," he
added.

<HEADLINE> New York Stock Market Attract More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Mutual fund investors continued
to pour money into stock funds in the U.S. this month, the Wall
Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the fund industry, which covers stock, bond
and money markets, may have already topped 4 trillion U.S. dollars
under management.
</P>
<P>
A mutual-fund trade group reported that fund investors had
shoveled 20.14 billion U.S. dollars into stock funds in May, more
than previously estimated and a jump of 28 percent from April's
total of 15.71 billion. May turned out to be the second-biggest
month this year for stock-fund sales.
</P>
<P>
The fund industry had 3.9 trillion U.S. dollars under
management at the end of May, up from 3.73 trillion U.S. dollars
in April. Given this month's inflows and the sharp rise in the
stock market, the industry may have reached the 4 trillion mark
already, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The New York stock market has grown by about 20 percent so far
this year, with the Dow Jones industrial average nearing 7,700
points this morning, compared with the 6,440 at the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid expansion of the stock market coupled with much
improved services of brokerage companies and other service
providers are the key to the fast increase of funds, according to
some fund experts.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of securities companies are investing huge
funds to install new computers and put their services onto
Internet and other forms of computer networks, making it possible
for investors to trade at home. In addition, companies providing
electronic trading also charge less service fees than the
traditional over-the-counter or telephone ordering means.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts estimated that by the year 2000, the electronic
traded funds in U.S. can reach 500 billion U.S. dollars, about
five times greater than the present standard.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, 1.5 million accounts were set up
electronically, according to a research group. They involved 111.4
billion U.S. dollars. But the number of electronic accounts is
expected to increase by 1.3 million this year, an amazing pace for
the industry, the group said.

<HEADLINE> SIB Chairman Looks Forward to New Era for Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The planned merger of banking
supervision and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) into the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB) is an "exciting
opportunity", Sir Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB said today.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the system of two-tier City regulation for
causing delays in resolving financial scandals such as the
misselling of personal pensions.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the SIB's Annual Report for 1996/97, Sir Andrew
argued that the two-tier system, which the government is to
reform, has "serious defects" and is "inherently less efficient
and effective than it could be".
</P>
<P>
The chairman welcomed the Government's decision to transfer the
functions of the SROs to an enhanced SIB, saying that the existing
two-tier system was "flawed" and had led to duplication.
</P>
<P>
Sir Andrew said the case for reforming the structure of
regulation under which SROs such as the Securities and Futures
Authority are monitored by SIB, became "overwhelming" because of
its flaws.
</P>
<P>
There has been "not just independence but hostility" among
regulatory organizations, which has made it more difficult to
clear up the pensions misselling, and co-ordinate responses to
financial failures such as that of Barings.
</P>
<P>
"Even the regulatory response to the conduct of certain UK
firms in world copper markets, which is generally seen as a
considerable success, could have been more robust under a more
cohesive structure," Sir Andrew stated.
</P>
<P>
However, Sir Andrew also said that in spite of the
inefficiencies caused by the two-tier system of regulation, over
the last five years the regulators had secured higher standards in
many areas.

<P>
LAUNDA, June 27 (Xinhua) --Angola plans to invest 10 million

issued today by the Research and Planning Department of the Angolan
Ministry of Industry.
</P>
<P>

Dollars to the bread making sector so as to resume and expand the
bread production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since June 1996, the Luanda flour mill and another two bread
bakeries with high prodcution capacity have been built up and

<HEADLINE> Iran Earns 4 billion Dollars in Oil Revenue in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh announced here today that Iran earned 4 billion
U.S. dollars by exporting oil in the first quarter of the
current Iranian calendar year starting March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted the minister as saying
that the revenue had been achieved under the circumstances that
the oil market has not been in a desirable status.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his hope that the decision of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to keep the
current production ceiling and member quotas would help improve
prices, especially in the fall and winter seasons.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC ended Vienna talks Thursday with a new freeze on its
production limits that stand at 25.03 million barrels per
day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
However, OPEC's 11 members have increased production by more
than 2 million bpd since November last year, reaching 27.05
million bpd in April this year. The oil prices dropped due to the
increase of international production and the decrease of demand.
</P>
<P>
Iran earned hard currency of 19.5 billion dollars from oil
export in the last fiscal year, registering an increase of 21.87
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the world's fourth largest oil producer and the second
largest oil exporter, is expected to generate 18.5 billion
dollars by exporting 2.5 million bpd during this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
As for the projects implemented by his ministry in the areas
of oil and gas and for renovation and expansion of the related
installations, Aqazadeh said that all the damages inflicted on
the oil and gas sectors during the eight-year war between Iran
and Iraq (1980-88) had been repaired and favorable investments
have been made in the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Vows to Cooperate with UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has vowed to continue to
cooperate with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to implement
U.N. resolutions, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who is
visiting the U.N. at present, vowed to the U.N. chief at their
meeting Thursday that Iraq will cooperate with him in the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal as well as other
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, signed last year between Iraq and the
U.N., allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over
six months on a renewable basis to raise cash for humanitarian
goods urgently needed in the country after nearly seven years of
U.N.-imposed sanctions for Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The first six-month period expired on June 7 and the deal
was extended for another six months.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Wednesday with Richard Butler, who will replace
Rolf Ekeus as executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on Iraq, Aziz expressed the hope to build good relations
with him.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.N. adopted a resolution condemning Iraq for
hindering the UNSCOM arms inspectors' missions and warned Iraq
that it will face even tougher penalties if it failed to
cooperate fully with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is not allowed to have weapons of mass destruction,
including missiles with ranges beyond 150 kilometers, after
its troops were defeated in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM accused Iraq of still hiding a considerable number
of the banned weapons, but Baghdad denied such allegations.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
this morning decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) for three months until 30
September, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Unanimously adopting Resolution 1116, the Security Council
called upon Liberian parties to implement fully all of their
agreements and commitments and urged all Liberians to participate
peacefully in their country's electoral process, scheduled to
culminate in legislative and presidential elections on July 19.
</P>
<P>
The Council stressed the importance of close coordination
between UNOMIL, the Economic Community of West African States '
Monitoring Observer Group (ECOMOG) and the joint electoral
coordination mechanism at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that free and fair elections were essential to
Liberia's peace process and that UNOMIL was mandated to verify
them, the Council reiterated that Liberia's people and leaders
bore ultimate responsibility for peace and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The UNOMIL was established in 1993 to work with ECOMOG in
implementing Liberia's early peace agreements and to observe
elections in the country. It was the first United Nations
Peace-keeping operation undertaken in cooperation with a similar
one already set up by another organization.

LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's new Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern is to meet his British counterpart Tony Blair on Thursday
in a bid to put a fresh impetus to the Northern Ireland peace
process, press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first between Ahern and Blair, will take place
against a background of mounting tension in Northern Ireland as
the start of the annual season of Protestant parades and marches
next weekend approaches.
</P>
<P>
Irish government officials were reported as saying this evening
that the meeting was agreed in a lengthy telephone conversation
between the two leaders this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, who was elected the country's new Prime Minister on
Thursday after a cliffhanger election victory, has made it clear
that ending the Northern Ireland conflict, in which 3,200 people
have died since 1969, would be the top priority of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The two governments have agreed that Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), should not be allowed to
attend the all-party peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland
unless IRA guerillas called an end to its bombing campaign against
British rule of the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called on the foreign
ministers of the Damascus Declaration states to change their
positions toward the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf told the Iraqi
News Agency Thursday that the foreign ministers of the Damascus
Declaration states, who concluded a meeting in the Syrian city
of Latakia on the same day, have repeated the "same big mistake"
which they previously committed against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and the six Gulf states signed the declaration
in 1991 after the Gulf War which was triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, in a bid to establish a new Gulf security
mechanism and strengthen the region's economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf urged the Damascus Declaration states to stop making
"false" accusations against Iraq and "seriously" consider
correcting their positions against the country.
</P>
<P>
He described as "false and groundless" the allegation by the
Latakia conference that Iraq has done acts of provocation against
 Kuwait and the neiboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, the minister said, has repatriated all Kuwaiti POWs and
others immediately after the 1991 Gulf war. And in the past few
years, it has returned all the Kuwaiti properties taken by the
Iraqis during their invasion of Kuwait, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuwaiti government insisted that Iraq still holds
about 600 Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons.

<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The extreme-right National Front
(FN) party of Jean-Marie Le Pen is known for its open racial
discrimination against African, Arab and Asian immigrants, but
this time things seem to be all screwed up.
</P>
<P>
An FN European Parliament deputy from the French Antilles today
sued an anti-FN militant for racial injury.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Antony, the Euro-deputy from the party of Le Pen, sued
Denis Lebon for racial injury inflicted upon Stephane Durbec, a
regional councillor of FN in the southeastern
Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (PACA).
</P>
<P>
Wearing a tricolor waistband, Durbec joined an FN demonstration
held on January 26 in Vitrolles in PACA to support the municipal
campaign by FN candidate Catherine Megret, who became the mayor of
Vitrolles one week later.
</P>
<P>
Lebon reportedly shouted to Durbec: ``You don't have any shame!
You are a genetic error!"
</P>
<P>
Although he admitted having uttered these words, Lebon said
that he was saying that to a black friend of his, who he said
wanted to appear as an FN supporter in order to have a tricolor
sling for himself.
</P>
<P>
The FN militants usually wear tricolor waistband, which
represents the national flag of France, in public demonstrations.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. security Council
this morning decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus for a further six months until
December 31.
</P>
<P>
By unanimously adopting Resolution 1117, the Council called on
the military authorities to refrain from any action, particularly
in th vicinity if the buffer zone, which could exacerbate
tensions.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Council stressed its supports for the
Secretary-General's mission of good office and the importance of
working with him towards an overall comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the leaders to commit themselves to the process of
negotiation, the Council stressed that full support of all
concerned was necessary for the negotiation process to produce
results.
</P>
<P>
It urged the continuation of the efforts of the United Nations
and other concerned to promote the holding of bicommunal events to
build trust and mutual respect between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed its grave concern about the excessive levels,
expansion, upgrading and modernization of the military forces and
armaments in Cyprus, and the lack of significant reduction in the
number of foreign troops in the country, which threaten to raise
tensions both on the island and in the region, and complicate
efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its position that a settlement
must be based on a state of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and
international personality and a single citizenship, with its
independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising
two politically equal communities in a bicommunal and bizonal
federation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed in the north in reaction to a coup in Nicosia by
the military government then ruling Greece. The United Nations has
since then trying to reunite the island on the agreed basis of a
bicommunal and bizonal federation.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. force now comprising 1,200 troops has been stationed in
Cyprus since i964 and patrols a buffer zone across the island.

WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will visit Poland and Romania after next month's summit of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16-member alliance will invite the first group
of former Warsaw Pact states to join. Clinton is due to attend
the summit on July 8-9 before going to Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
These visits, like the Madrid summit, are part of the
president's efforts to help build an "undivided" and "secure"
Europe in the next century, the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said it favors admitting the Czech Republic,
Poland and Hungary into NATO in the first wave of expansion. But
the Europeans upholds Romania and Slovenia should also join.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would go to Warsaw to symbolize "the historic
importance" of NATO expansion and remind it and other new members
of their alliance obligations, White House spokesman Michael
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Bucharest, the first by a U.S. president to
the Romanian capital in two decades, Clinton will make clear that
Romania is a "leading candidate for future entry" into NATO,
McCurry added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Legislation on Anti-drug Grants Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday signed legislation, making neighborhoods with successful
anti-drug programs eligible for federal matching grants of up to
100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed Congress in May with a near-unanimous
vote, was designed to extend the anti-drug war to neighborhoods
where, despite federal efforts, drug abuse has increased among
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the legislation does not mean a lessening of
law enforcement efforts to curb drug use or to stop drugs from
entering the country.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "Clearly it sends a signal that we are shifting
emphasis to recognize that we will never get a hold of this
problem unless we deal with the demand side here in America."
</P>
<P>
He said young people experimenting with drugs have to realize
that "they are playing a dangerous game and that we have to try to
do more than we have in the past to stop it."
</P>
<P>
The new law authorizes the Office of National Drug Control
Policy to rechannel existing federal drug-control funds into 143.5
million dollars in neighborhood grants over five years.
</P>
<P>
Grants would go to local communities with "sustainable and
accountable" anti-drug programs. But the efforts must involve all
sectors of a community, including families, businesses, news
media, schools, law enforcement, health care professionals and
religious leaders.

<HEADLINE> Delegates Still Deadlocked on Earth Summit Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the
19th special U.N. session on the environment and development were
still deadlocked today on a final document, sources close to the
session said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, which went until 5 a.m. today, is due to
end at midnight EDT (0400 GMT). Delegates from more than 170 U.N.
member states, including 70 heads of state and government,
attended the session, dubbed the Earth Summit.
</P>
<P>
Even a 26-point political statement, the result of several
rounds of consultations before the session began, may be thrown
out because of differences on several issues, including objectives
for increasing foreign aid, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There are still major differences on such topics as global
warming and financial targets for helping poor countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday pledged to lead his
country in reduction of greenhouse gases and contribute 1 billion
U.S. dollars over the next five years to help developing nations
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
But many environmentalists were deeply disappointed that he did
not present a specific plan to reduce the greenhouse gases as
European Union nations have done.
</P>
<P>
The EU nations have challenged the United States by proposing a
15 percent reduction in emissions below the 1990 level by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have been calling for increase of
financial assistance for developed nations in improvement of the
environment and development of economy.
</P>
<P>
Most industrial countries pledged at the 1992 Rio Summit to
increase foreign aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national
product, a goal on the U.N. agenda since 1972. But aid has fallen
to below 0.3 percent, especially in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Global Call For Elimination of Riverblindness by 2007 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the World Bank and
some other world organizations today called for the elimination of
Riverblindness throughout Africa by the year 2007 at the unveiling
of a bronze statue depicting an African adult blinded by
riverblindness being led by a child,.
</P>
<P>
The statue was unveiled by Anna-Maria Fati Paul, a Ghanaian
riverblindness survivor, and James D. Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
A declaration signed by World Bank President Wolfensohn, former
U.S. former President Jimmy Carter, leaders of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other development
partners called for strong support and "whatever action is
required" to achieve the elimination of riverblindness as a major
public health problem and socioeconomic development constraint in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The event also celebrated the 10th anniversary of the decision
taken by Merck &AMP; Co., Inc. to provide the most effective drug
against the disease, Mectizan, free of charge, to as many who need
it, for as long as it is needed, to protect against the disease.
If successful, the program could reach as many as 50 million
people within the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
Riverblindness, also known as onchocerciasis or "the lion's
stare," is a leading cause of blindness in Africa. It is caused by
a parasitic worm -- transmitted by the black fly, which lives and
reproduces for up to 14 years in the human body. Victims often
become blind by the time they have reached their mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
According to World Bank background materials, the disease is
found in sub-Saharan Africa, Yemen and parts of Central and South
America, but is most prevalent in the Savannah areas of West
Africa. It is estimated that over 100 million people remain at
risk of infection, 18 million are still heavily infected and 1
million are heavily sight impaired or blind.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, joined hands by the WHO, FAO and UNDP, launched
the Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP) in 1974 in seven West
African countries in the largest infested area in the world. Four
more countries and more than 20 donors have since joined the
program. The program consisted of weekly aerial sprayings of
larvacide along 189,000 km of rivers in a bid to destroy the black
fly larvae. In the 1980s, a drug called ivermectin or Mectizan was
found to be effective at paralyzing and expelling the infant worms
in the body and, as a result, halting the progress of the disease.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the World Bank launched a new program -- the African
Program for Onchocerciasis Control -- to expand the control to 19
African countries. The new program is modeled after the OCP and
its goal is to eliminate the disease in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The open-air square in front of
the Cultural Center at the Tsim Sha Tsui, in Kowloon, was filled
with a large crowd tonight when a 3.5-kilometer-long dragon
delineated with neon lights was lit up.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the lighting-up ceremony, Rita Fan, chairman of the
Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special

The dragon head, made by craftsmen in Foshan, Guangdong
Province, is six meters high, nine meters long and three meters
wide. The dragon, formed with two million light bulbs, bears nine
smaller dragons symbolizing Kowloon, with its head facing Victoria
Harbor at Tsim Sha Tsui and its tail at the Boundary Street.
</P>
<P>
"The dragon light designs we are watching today are different
in meaning from those we only can see during the Christmas
festivals," Fan said.

It shows the spirit in which that all Hong Kong people are
celebrating this historical event, she added.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Memories of Deng Xiaoping Cherished in Hong Kong Prior to Return (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people cherish the
memories of Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader who passed away
early this year, as the day when China resumes the exercises of
sovereignty over Hong Kong draws near.
</P>
<P>
"How I wish he could come to Hong Kong," said Ann Tse Kai, a
well-known Hong Kong figure.
"I had an opportunity to meet and talk with him," recalled Ann,
who is a vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). "I often tell
myself that it's lucky for China and the Chinese people to have
had such a great man as Deng."
</P>
<P>
He said that he felt some consolation in the release on July 1
of a picture album entitled "Deng Xiaoping and Hong Kong." Many
prominent Hong Kong figures including Ann himself, Fok Ying Tung
and Tung Chee Hwa are advisors for the album.
The picture album carries 100 precious photos that record Deng
Xiaoping's outstanding contributions to the settlement of the Hong
Kong question and his charisma in various historical events.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping remarked on many occasions: "I will pay a visit
to Hong Kong even if I have to go there in a wheelchair when China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Said Irene Wong, a business manager while hurrying to her Wan
Chai office: "I feel sad whenever it comes to my mind that Mr.
Deng Xiaoping cannot attend the grand ceremony marking Hong Kong's
return.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm glad that Deng's widow and his daughter will attend
the handover ceremony with the Chinese government delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping was a great man who has been respected by us
Hong Kong people."

Books on Deng Xiaoping and special sections in local book
stores selling color pictures of him attract many readers. "My
Father Deng Xiaoping," a biography by his daughter Deng Rong, was
once sold out in some local book stores.
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a chance to see him, but I have been told by my
teachers that Deng Xiaoping is a national hero and the pride of
the Chinese nation," said a student from Pui Kiu Middle School,
who was reading a book entitled "Deng Xiaoping on the Hong Kong
Question" in a book store attached to the Commercial Press (HK)
Ltd. in Causeway Bay.
</P>
<P>
At the subway station in Wan Chai is a giant color photo of
Deng Xiaoping. Many people stopped in front of it and looked at it
in silent respect. Deng souvenirs have been favorable items for
collection for many people.
</P>
<P>
"We Hong Kong people cherish the memories of Deng Xiaoping,"
said Ye, a cab driver, whose cab has a Deng picture hanging
behind the windshield.
</P>
<P>
Ng Hong Mun, honorary president of Hong Kong Federation of
Education Workers, recalled his two meetings with Deng Xiaoping:
the first was in June, 1982 when Deng emphasized that Hong Kong's
capitalist system will remain unchanged; the second time was in
May 1984 when Deng stressed that China will never be equivocal on
the matter of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping spoke in a decisive manner, never beating about
the bush," Ng said.
</P>
<P>
Said Yau, a district board member: "Only with the policy of
'one country, two systems' put forward by Deng Xiaoping can the
Hong Kong question be solved.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unprecedented concept which demonstrates Deng
Xiaoping's great wisdom and courage."
</P>
<P>
W.H.Choi, president of Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association
said:  "Deng Xiaoping has drawn a beautiful blueprint for Hong
Kong. Under his 'one country, two systems' principle, we can build
a new Hong Kong that enjoys sustained prosperity. I'm sure we can
live up to Deng's expectations."

<HEADLINE> Renault Sticks to Controversial Belgian Plant Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- French carmaker Renault today made
the final decision to stick to its controversial proposal to close
an assembly plant in Belgium by the end of July, rejecting union
proposals for shorter working hours or job cuts.
</P>
<P>
The decision came two weeks after the automaker, under pressure
from France's new Socialist government, named an independent team
of experts to find alternatives to closing the 3,100-man Vilvoorde
plant, which provoked a storm of political and union protest when
it was announced in February.
</P>
<P>
Renault, the country's second biggest carmaker, argued the
closure was part of a fundamental restructuring plan following the
group's 5.25 billion-franc (909.3 million U.S. dollars) loss in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Danielle Kaisergruber, head of the experts' team which studied
the Vilvoorde plant, said that reductions in working hours and
staffing "does not represent an alternative" to closing the plant,
which she said was a "structural" decision.
</P>
<P>
Renault, the world's 10th largest automaker, said it would
offer compensation to laid-off workers and maintain an undefined
"activity" in Vilvoorde which is expected to employ 400 Belgian
workers.
</P>
<P>
Some jobs would also be made available to Vilvoorde staff in
its plants in France, notably in Douai and Maubeuge near Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Louis Schweitzer, Renault's president, promised to continue
negotiations with Belgian unions on the terms of compensation, the
establishment of a working group to convert the plant into a new
enterprise, and French jobs to be given to Vilvoorde workers.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the assembly plant, first announced by
Schweitzer on February 27, triggered violent protests from the
company's 10,000 workers across Europe.
</P>
<P>
The factory is in the hometown of Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene, who had appealed to France's Socialist Premier
Lionel Jospin for a review of the closure.

Tian'anmen Square, which will hold a gala party on June 30,

</P>
<P>
Six big neon lights, 160 red lanterns, and smaller lights on
pine trees in the square give it a new appearance.
</P>
<P>
A rally will be held in Workers' Stadium on July 1. Beijing
organizers have held dress rehearsals for it.
</P>
<P>
Beijing authorities have also decided to set off fireworks on
both June 30 and July 1. After two months of preparations, 1,100
armed policemen and 142 fireworks guns are ready for the show.
</P>
<P>
There are also 100,000 red banners, 600,000 flower pots, and
lights and lanterns along Beijing's main streets.
</P>

gathered in Tian'anmen Square to look the scene over and to take
pictures.

<HEADLINE> China's Sincerity in "One Country, Two Systems" Policy is Beyond   Any Doubt: Thai Consul General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Consul-General Rathakit
Manathat said here today he is convinced that Hong Kong will
continue to develop after it return to China and that he has full
confidence in its future.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said the policy of "one
country, two systems" China has set forth will benefit not only
Hong Kong's development also the development of China's interior
area.
</P>
<P>
"We have had contacts with China for many years, and know very
clearly that the Chinese government always means what it says. I
do not doubt China's sincerity in implementing this policy and I
am sure this policy will be implemented fully," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's prospects after the return, Hong Kong and the
interior area will become an integrated market, which is expected
to provide a good opportunity for Thailand, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the continued growth in friendly ties between
Thailand and Hong Kong, he said, the Thailand-Hong Kong Trade
Association that Thailand had set up here will give scope to its
active role in Thai-Hong Kong trade, while Thailand will join Hong
Kong to edge into the market in China's interior area and benefit
from it.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 25,000 Thai people now reside in Hong Kong. Many
came with their ancestors and have their homes here. "In general,
I can say they are very happy living in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Jinghai Temple in Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu

WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations conference on the global environment
ground to a close without concrete agreements on any of the
critical issues of cutting emissions, protecting forests or
increasing aid to poor nations.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:

<HEADLINE> Tehran Suffers Serious Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Tehran said here today
that the air pollution in the Iranian capital is by far more
polluted than other cities in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi said at a two-day international
conference that the per capita carbon produced in Tehran is twice
as much as in other places in the third world.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio said that some 4,000 people die
every year due to respiratory problems caused, or exacerbated, by
pollution and another 2,000 die of cancer at the same time because
of pollutants in the air, including lead.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that 70 percent of air pollution in Tehran
caused by vehicles -- everyday there are 7 million liters of
petroleum and 1.5 million liters of gas oil consumed by 1.5
million vehicles, including buses and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi stressed in the
meeting that precise evaluation of ways to reduce air pollution in
the capital is "an absolute necessity."
</P>
<P>
"Timely tune-up of the engines, increase in the number of
buses and mini-buses, and expansion of electrical bus lines across
Tehran are ways to reduce air pollution," Habibi said.
</P>
<P>
There are now two major electrical bus lines operating in
eastern Tehran which have been established as the first step to
bring air pollution under control.
</P>
<P>
Government financing is also available to car owners who want
to convert their car's fuel from petroleum to liquid gas. The
conversion costs about 350 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government finances half of the conversion costs. Once
converted, a car's liquid gas tank can be filled as many times as
it is necessary for only 5,000 Rials, or about 1.6 U.S. dollars,
per month.
</P>
<P>
However, some 15 liquid gas filling stations established across
the city can not respond to the demands by thousands of taxi cab
drivers and private car owners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran municipality has declared this year "the
lead-free year," encouraging car owners to use the unleaded super
petroleum sold at gas stations at the same rate as regular
petroleum.

<HEADLINE> 8 Million AIDS Orphans in Sub-Saharan Africa, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations report said
more than 90 percent of the 9 million children who have lost
their mothers to AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report released Friday by joint U.N. HIV/AIDS
program, listed Uganda and Zimbabwe as some of the countries
where children orphaned by AIDS are becoming a major problem,
said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Zimbabwe estimate that by 1996 approximately 8
percent of children in Uganda are in this situation. ''In Uganda,
1,000 children every week lost one of their parents, to AIDS,''
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said, millions of children around the world are
increasingly living under the threat of HIV/AIDS epidemic, with
1,000 children becoming infected with AIDS daily.
</P>
<P>
According to figures estimated by the United Nations, one
million children under the age of 15 will be living with the
virus by the end of 1997, and AIDS may increase infant mortality
by 75 percent and under five child mortality by more than 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
''AIDS is the most recongnized disease in the world today,''
Peter Piot, Executive Director of the United Nations program on
HIV/AIDS warned.

<HEADLINE> Central China to Catch up With More Developed East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Provinces in central China are
making an effort to catch up with the more developed eastern part
of the country, and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, which began
operation early this year, has become the latest force in this
effort.
</P>
<P>
The railway, whose purpose was to speed up economic development
in central China by linking up with Hong Kong, runs along a
nine-province economic belt, whose infrastructure, natural
resources, and labor force have been made better use of, and which
have attracted investors as a result.
</P>
<P>
Twelve overseas financial organizations have opened offices in
Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and the heart of central
China. By March, the city had used a total of 4.8 billion US
dollars worth of foreign investment, which contributed more than
35 percent of the city's input in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Henan province, to the north, had 2.57 billion US dollars in
overseas investment last year, while Hunan province, to the south,
used more than 75 percent of overseas funds for infrastructure and
industrial improvements.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also begun to shift its economic
development strategy to central and western parts of the country.
From 1993 to the end of May this year, the State Development Bank
provided 224.8 billion yuan in loans to the area, accounting for
more than 60 percent of the total number of loans.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project along the Yangtze River and the
Xiaolangdi Project along the Yellow River, are helping economic
growth in central China, cultivating new economic growth areas in
machinery, electronics, and building materials.
</P>
<P>
The GDPs of Henan and Hubei now rank among the country's 10
largest, and the nine central China's provinces had 1.9 trillion
yuan in GNP last year, contributing 28 percent to the nation's
total. Their economic growth rate was 0.9 percent higher on
average than was east China's.
</P>
<P>
Economists have begun to talk about better prospects for the
area, saying they believe that central China will become as
economically active in the early 21st century as east China did in
the 1980s and early 1990s.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The first section of Metro No. 1
in Guangzhou City, capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
opened to traffic today, and is viewed as a gift from Guangzhou
for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is now China's fourth city with a subway, after
Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The first section has five stations and is 5.4 km long. The
total length of the No. 1 Line will be 18.4 km and will cost 12.7
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The subway is being built as part of the effort to ease the
increasing traffic jams in this economic and political center of
south China, with a population of over six million.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 Line will be able to handle 1.13 million passengers
a day, accounting for 10-15 percent of the city's daily urban
passenger flow.
</P>
<P>
Most of the equipment used in the metro was imported and funds
came from the German, US, British, and Japanese governments. Part
of the cost was covered by loans from international banks or
raised through real estate deals in areas along the subway.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say that the fund-raising methods may be used by
other Chinese cities that plan to build subways but are plagued by
a shortage of funds.

<HEADLINE> HK-Macao Ferry Expects New Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The three ferryboat companies
running services between Hong Kong and Macao have applied to
increase ferry fares, and their applications are expected to be
approved by the Macao Government.
</P>
<P>
The average increase of the fare is about six percent, the same
level as last year's increase. After getting approval, the ferry
companies would adopt the new price from September.
</P>
<P>
The current price of a ferry trip between Macao and Hong Kong
has doubled that of 1990, following annual price rises.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a round ferry trip between Hong Kong and Macao on
economy class costs about 300 patacas (about 38 US dollars).
Passengers have to pay higher fees on holidays and at night.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that since 1994, the number of passengers taking
ferries between Hong Kong and Macao has dropped at a rate of about
three percent year by year, partly because they have had more
options to travel to the Pearl River Delta.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said today that agents of the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israeli intelligence
service have entered northern Iraq to conduct espionage.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) said here today that some CIA and
Israeli agents have recently entered northern Iraq under the
cover of working with the Red Crescent Committees.
</P>
<P>
After their arrival, the agents began to contact with key
figures and sheikhs in the area and try to bribe them in return
for their cooperation, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the key figures and sheikhs have absolutely refused to
cooperate with those agents, confirming their affiliation to the
Iraqi central government, it added.
</P>
<P>
The situation in northern Iraq has been complicated since the
defeat of Iraq by the U.S.-led allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The region, called Kurdistan and populated by Iraqi Kurds, now
is out of the control of Baghdad and under the protection of the
U.S.-led allies.

SINGAPORE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is confident of the
future Hong Kong and the close synergy of Hong Kong and China's
inland areas will boost economic growth and development in the
Asia-Pacific, Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said in a written
interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Singapore already has significant investments in both Hong Kong
and China's inland areas, he said, noting that as of the end of
1995, Singapore's private sector investments in Hong Kong amounted
to 4.47 billion US dollars and in China's inland areas, 2.1
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, there are investments from Singapore's
Government Investment Corporation and statutory boards. These
investments in real estate in Hong Kong and China's main cities
amounted to another two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's economic ties with Hong Kong and China's inland
areas are "firmly anchored and will continue to flourish," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar also said that Singapore already enjoys a
multi-faceted relationship with Hong Kong, which becomes a Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on July 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
With China, Singapore's close ties also go beyond the economic
sphere, he said.  "We have built up and will continue to develop
a broad-based relationship with China, which includes frequent
people-to-people, as well as government-to-government exchanges,
in the fields of culture, education, human resource management,
city-planning and various aspects of civil administration."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister also expressed his confidence in that Hong
Kong will continue to prosper with the implementation of the
concept of "One country, two systems,", saying that the idea will
work because it is in the interest of both Hong Kong and China's
inland areas to make it work.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" formula "is an ingenious yet
practical and pragmatic formula for dealing with the issues left
over from history," he commented.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has given the assurance that under this
formula, the principles of a "high degree of autonomy" for Hong
Kong and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" will prevail. The
formula gives the Hong Kong people the right to continue to manage
their free-market system, including their own currency and an
independent monetary authority, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the return of Hong Kong to China "will therefore enable
Hong Kong to continue performing its role in much the same way as
it has been doing in the past".
</P>
<P>
On the economic development in Hong Kong and China's inland
areas, the minister said, Hong Kong played a major complementary
role for China's economy even before the handover.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, Hong Kong's complementary role in China's
economic growth will be even more pronounced, as countries in the
Asia-Pacific and around the world seek to capitalize on the
enormous opportunities offered by the rapidly developing Chinese
economy, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The close synergy of both will boost economic growth and
development in the Asia-Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Foreign Ministry announced on Friday that
Minister Jayakumar has been invited to attend the official
Handover Ceremony in Hong Kong. He will be attending the Handover
Ceremony and other official events on June 30 and July 1 in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Domestic Bank Assets Up Sharply in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The total assets of Kuwait's
domestic banks registered a highest monthly growth rate since 1991
of two percent in May, to reach 12 billion Dinar (about 39.6
billion U.S. dollars), a bank bulletin said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the document released by the Kuwaiti Central Bank,
the bank assets increased by 236.6 million Dinar (about 780
million U.S. dollars) in May, two percent higher than in April
when the assets stood at 11.8 billion Dinar (about 38.9 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The assets include cash balances, net foreign assets, money
supply and private sector deposits, the bulletins said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the rise was due to a 296 million Dinar (about
976 million dollars) hike in domestic Dinar deposits though
foreign currency denominated deposits dropped by an equivalent of
117 million dinar (about 387 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Money supply was up in May while total finances for Kuwaiti
imports dipped, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Kuwait Dinar remained stable against the dollar
with a fluctuation of a marginal 0.22 percent in favor of the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> China, Britain Agree on Transfer of HK Government Assets, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain signed here
today a minute on the arrangements for the transfer of the assets
and liabilities of the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
According to this Agreed Minute on the Question of the
Arrangements for the Transfer of the Assets and Liabilities of the
Hong Kong Government, the British government, in line with the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, shall transfer all assets and
liabilities of the Hong Kong government while returning Hong Kong
to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the joint declaration and the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Chinese
government has decided to authorize the HKSAR government to take
over all assets and liabilities of the Hong Kong government, other
than the Exchange Fund which is governed by a separate Agreed
Minute.
</P>
<P>
The assets and liabilities of the Hong Kong government will be
transferred to the HKSAR government on the commencement of July 1,
1997, the Minute notes.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government shall take charge of auditing these assets
and liabilities, and manage them on its own in accordance with
relevant laws of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the Minute, Zhao Jihua, senior Chinese
representative of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, said that
the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Hong Kong
government is a major component of the transfer of power in Hong
Kong, as well as a concrete action of the Chinese and British
sides to implement the joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the signing of the Minute will contribute to
the smooth transition of Hong Kong," he commented.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Governor on Financial Relations with HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong said here today that he believes Hong Kong is able to
stabilize its financial market after July 1.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in an interview with Xinhua. "China's
interior will not use the foreign currency reserves of Hong Kong
or its other assets," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He described five principles the Central Bank will follow in
financial relations with Hong Kong:
</P>
<P>
First, the renminbi (RMB), the official currency, will be
treated as foreign currency if used in Hong Kong, and the Hong
Kong dollar, as foreign currency in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Second, Hong Kong will maintain its independent system of
currency after July 1. The Hong Kong dollar will continue to be
freely convertible without foreign exchange controls. The Central
Bank supports the idea of its being pegged to the US dollar. The
RMB is convertible under the current account. The State
Administration of Foreign Exchange will control foreign exchange
in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Third, the relationship between the monetary authorities of
China's interior and Hong Kong will be relatively independent. The
Hong Kong Monetary Authority will be responsible to the government
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The
Central Bank will not take the place of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority nor will it set up branches in Hong Kong. The monetary
authorities of the inland and Hong Kong will maintain and expand
their relations of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the HKSAR government will continue to be responsible
for the management of financial agents in Hong Kong and in China's
inland areas. Hong Kong financial agents in the inland will be
regarded as foreign-funded financial agents, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong financial agents in inland areas enjoy the same
preferences as foreign financial organizations in China. Hong Kong
branches of inland's financial bodies enjoy no privileges in Hong
Kong and must abide by local laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, financial affairs between China's inland areas and Hong
Kong will be conducted according to international financial
practices. Debt and credit between banks and enterprises of the
two places will continue to be dealt with as foreign debt and
credit. Inland enterprises listed on the Hong Kong stock market
will be treated as overseas listings. These enterprises must
observe Hong Kong laws and rules.

<HEADLINE> Police Emergency Line Becoming Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The call that came in at midnight to
the emergency number "110" to ask the police for help in Jinan, in
Shandong province, saying "My sister is dying. She took a hundred
sleeping pills to commit suicide...", resulted in a life being
saved.
</P>
<P>
These emergency calls for helping people in difficulty, which
were unheard of in China just a few years ago, have spread all
over the country in a brief time. Chinese police now promise that,
"Where there is danger, difficulties, or crime, there will be
police help."
</P>
<P>
In Beijing alone there have been 15,200 calls about emergencies
or problems with violence and 9,800 for other kinds of help since
the latter half of 1996 when the service started.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the line was there to report criminal offenses. But
now the emergency line represents a reform in the Chinese security
force, after it was expanded to cover other problems.

<P>
Xue Zhenjie, director of the Public Security Ministry's
Headquarters, says: "We are supposed to take care of emergencies
or difficult and dangerous situations. But because of the lack of
social services in China we sometimes also take care of trifles,
such as helping people fix plumbing and open their doors when they
were locked out."
</P>
<P>
To make the assistance more efficient, police have been added
to street patrols. "Some 100,000 police have been assigned to
patrol 200 cities across the country," said Xue.
</P>
<P>
"The city patrols goes on round-the-clock," he noted. When a
call comes in to 110, the dispatcher will inform patrols in the
vicinity to respond.
</P>
<P>
That was why police in Jinan were able to respond within five
minutes when the woman took the overdose. She was deep in coma
when the police arrived, and a suicide note explained that she was
despondent over business failure.
</P>
<P>
The police got her to the hospital quickly enough to save her
life and looked after her there until two days later when her
brother, Guan Yanchun, who had phoned 110 after receiving a
farewell call from his sister, arrived from Baishan city in Jilin
province, in the northeast of China.
</P>
<P>
Xue explains that the police services are free and that 110
calls are also free. In big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou, there are emergency services in English available.
</P>
<P>
"We want people to bear this in mind: "Whenever you are in
trouble and have no one to turn to, dial 110!" Xue concluded.

<HEADLINE> Doohan Calls for Rain Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Reigning 500cc world champion
Michael Doohan had the Dutch Grand Prix halted after 11 of the 20
laps in Assen, the Netherlands on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Doohan, winner of five of the six races this
season, waved to race organisers that the conditions were not
suitable to carry on the race.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to keep going to complete 66 percent of the race which
would have counted full points, but I had to slow down so much on
the 11th lap that it was pointless to carry on," Doohan said.
</P>
<P>
The organisers were hoping to restart the race provided the
rain went away which would leave current second Carlos Checa of
Spain requiring a 3.73 seconds win over Doohan in the second 'leg'
to take the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Rain played havoc with the race last year forcing two 'legs'
which Doohan won beating Alex Criville, who was forced out of this
year's renewal with an injured hand following a fall in practice
on Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz left here this afternoon after winding up a three-day
visit in Lebanon, the first by a senior Saudi royalty since 1975.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince, accompanied by a 140-member entourage,
was heading by road for Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince spent a relaxed time in Beirut, during
which his only official activities were to take joint dinners
with the Lebanese leaders, but many Lebanese officials believe
that an influx of Saudi investment to Lebanon will follow the
visit.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the Saudi foreign minister Saud
al-Faisal Al-Saud, underlined his country's blessing for the
establishment of an Arab common market proposed by Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Nida Al-Watan, which is famed for its access to
foreign ministry officials, reported today that the Saudi side
informed the Lebanese it would not attend a regional economic
conference to be held in Qatar in November.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have announced that they will boycott the
regional economic summit, the fourth of its kind since four
years, due to an Israeli participation, and called for an Arab
economic summit to take its place.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Laws on Highways And Animal Epidemic Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's highest legislative body,
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, today
began to review drafts of highway and animal epidemic prevention
laws.
</P>
<P>
The two drafts were reviewed and revised by the NPC Standing
Committee during its February session and are expected to be
passed by the Standing Committee during this session.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ruiying and Li Guiying, members of the Standing
Committee, said that highway construction has developed rapidly
since the reform and opening up began and that it has played an
important role in the economy. They said they believe that a law
on highways is necessary to standardize China's highway
construction.
</P>
<P>
Participants also suggested revisions for the draft of the law
on highways before it is submitted for approval.
</P>
<P>
The majority of participants said that the draft of the law on
animal epidemic prevention is a good law and it embodies the
principle of giving priority to prevention. "It is easy to put
into operation and the articles on animal diseases and disease
control are concrete," they said.
</P>
<P>
Li Guiying predicts that the law will contribute much to animal
husbandry in China, to the development of agriculture, to the
rural economy, and to improving people's standard of living.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Paper Ordered to Pay 10 million Shillings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan High Court yesterday
ordered the local weekly newspaper " The People " to pay a record
10 million Kenyan Shillings (about 188,000 U.S. Dollars) to a
Nairobi businessman for defamation.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest award of damages for libel in Kenya's
legal history, the local daily "East African Standard" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the judgement, Justice Emmanuel O'Kubasu has said
that the freedom of press "must be exercised and enjoyed in a
responsible manner."
</P>
<P>
Careless and malicious reporting cannot be tolerated by the
law, he stressed, adding that "this court will not be slow in
awarding to those whose reputations have been dented."
</P>
<P>
Justice O'Kubasu entered judgement against the publishers
after the paper failed to enter appearance and defense within the
prescribed period.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan businessman Joshua Kulei, who is President Daniel arap
Moi's personal assistant, sued the paper over an article
published last January entitled "Asian Link in Moi's Kitchen
Cabinet".
</P>
<P>
The story read in part that "before the recent shake-up in the
government positions among those regarded as the key members of
the Kitchen Cabinet were... State House operative Joshua Kulei...
Each of these has a retinue of Asian businessmen who seek
assistance to get government contracts and other public funded
deals that require political patronage to go through..."
</P>
<P>
The paper alleged that topping the list of Asian businessmen
linked to Kulei is Pankoj Somaia who spends most of his time in
Kenya's port city Mombasa where Kulei has lucrative contracts
with the Kenya Ports Authority.
</P>
<P>
In his suit filed on February 18, Kulei said that the story
was understood to mean he was dishonest and corrupt, adding that
the allegations in the story had ruined his name and that his
family had been affected.
</P>
<P>
He had sought an order for a permanent injunction to restrain
the publishers from publishing articles which may be injurious on
him and also sought up to 23 million Shillings for defamation,
exemplary damages and costs of the suit.

<HEADLINE> HK's Return Means a Step Toward National Reunification: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to the motherland
means China takes a significant step forward in the course of the
national reunification, a senior Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), told Xinhua in a recent
interview that Hong Kong's return will have positive influence
over the transitional procedure in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old ambassador said that Hong Kong's smooth return
to the motherland shows the determination and capability of the
Chinese government and people in the course of national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
"It also sets a model for the international community in
handling disputes left over from the past," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
He said he himself experienced the bitterness in the time when
China was bullied by the imperialists and colonialists before
1949. After the birth of New China in 1949, he began his
40-year-long diplomatic career.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations between China and Britain on the Hong
Kong issue, Guo participated in the translation and making of the
final version of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
"To see the return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the
motherland, I feel very excited," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the success of the concept "one country, two
systems" in Hong Kong offers an example for Macao, and helps
increase Macao residents' confidence in realizing a stable
transition and a smooth transfer of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will also push forward the cooperation between
China and Portugal in settling all urgent issues concerning
Macao's transition as soon as possible, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, a lot of transitional affairs need to be
resolved, especially, the localization of civil service and law as
well as the use of Chinese as an official language.
</P>
<P>
"The localization of senior and middle ranking civil service,
in particular, is lagging far behind the requirements for a smooth
transfer of power," he said, adding, "The work on the transfer of
archives and government assets should be started as soon as
possible."

LUSAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has set up a unit to
collect and process labor market information, Labor and Social
Security Minister Peter Machungwa said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa said that with the increasing of the users of the

</P>
<P>
He said Zambia is the the co-ordinator of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) employment and labor sector and has
a duty of enhancing the capacity to capture and process as much
labor market information as possible in the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
No program could succeed without the involvement of main users
and that is why they are involving employers and worker
organizations to enable it to gain quality and quantity, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the workshop is to provide forum for various
labor market players and enable them exchange views on the
problems affecting the Zambian labor market.

<HEADLINE> HK Residents to Continue Enjoying Travel Freedom: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, Director
of Immigration of the Hong Kong government, today denied the rumor
that Hong Kong residents' freedom of entrance and exit will be
restricted after July 1.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the Basic Law, Hong Kong residents shall
enjoy free movement within the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), as well as the freedom to travel and to enter or
leave the region," said Ip, who will retain her current post in
the HKSAR government after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Starting from July 3, she said, the HKSAR Department of
Immigration will issue SAR passports to permanent Hong Kong
residents who are Chinese nationals and have the right of abode in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We are the sole department that has the right to issue the SAR
passport," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since it started to accept applications on June 10, the
Department of Immigration has received more than 700,000
application forms for the SAR passport designed with advanced
anti-counterfeit techniques.
</P>
<P>
"By last Thursday, many countries had announced preferential
treatment for SAR passport holders. Thirty-three of them have
decided to grant visa-free access to such holders," Ip said,
predicting that more countries and regions will announce the same
arrangements soon.
</P>
<P>
She said that Hong Kong will continue its existing visa-free
regime after July 1, and that at present, residents of over 170
countries and regions can come to Hong Kong and stay for seven
days to six months without a visa.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong was visited by 11 million foreigners, and
visas were granted to some 14,000 foreign professionals and
investors.
</P>
<P>
"These entrepreneurs, professionals and people with special
skills brought with them funds, techniques and expertise to Hong
Kong, thus benefiting Hong Kong's economic growth," said Ip,
adding that the figure has also reflected the confidence of the
international community in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that her department is now working out a new
program to make it easier for tourists and business people to
visit Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong will be in a better position to
maintain its status as an international trade, financial and
tourism center.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Warns of Military Option Against S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from west African
countries have warned to impose sanctions, and use force against
Sierra Leone military junta, if it fails to return power to
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah "within a reasonable time".
</P>
<P>
If sanctions in the form of an economic embargo did not work, force
could be used, with the agreement of heads of state of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), according to press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a 14-point communique following the one-day meeting in
Conakry, Guinea, a four-member committee comprising ministers from
Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire was designated to implement
the decisions of the meeting with the approval of the ECOWAS chairman,
Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which will also include representatives from the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) secretariat, has been empowered to
negotiate with the junta led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma on the
peaceful transfer of power to Kabbah and to report back to General
Abacha within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers called on the international community not to
recognize the military government in Sierra Leone, but to provide
emergency aid and other form of assistance to Guinea and other
neighboring countries affected by the new wave of refugees after the
May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
They also called for international support to the ECOWAS initiative
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In its reaction, the junta's spokesman, Colonel Abdul Sesay, said
it welcomed the prospects of a visit by ECOWAS delegation to Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The visit, together with the OAU secretariat, will give them
"opportunity to see things for themselves on the ground".
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, a member of ECOWAS, was not represented at the
Conakry meeting on Thursday. But the decision of the foreign ministers
of the other 15 ECOWAS countries was conveyed to Kabbah, who
reportedly welcomed the plans for his reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
The ousted president applauded the decision to restore his
government and ultimatum of two weeks within which the negotiation
with the coup leader should take place.

<HEADLINE> Bigger Inflow of Inland Fund Benefits Hong Kong's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Increases of investment in Hong
Kong from the interior areas of China will benefit Hong Kong's
economic development, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, financial secretary
of Hong Kong, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, Tsang said that after Hong Kong's return to
China, closer economic ties between the interior areas and Hong
Kong will provide more opportunities for the inflow of investment
into Hong Kong from the mainland.
"This will have no negative impact on Hong Kong's economy," he
said. "On the contrary, it will speed up economic development in
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He welcomes more inland companies to list on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange or set up branches in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that they should abide by local laws and
regulations just as investors from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Tsang, who will serve at the same post in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), spoke highly of economic development
momentum in China's interior areas, where economic growth has been
higher than in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is conducive to narrowing the gap between the two sides and
offers more opportunities for bilateral cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he is confident in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong recorded a six percent economic growth in the first
quarter of this year, he said, predicting an annualized growth
rate of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth of Hong Kong's banking and insurance sectors will be
above the average. In general, prospects in the 1997-98 period are
good, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stipulations of the Basic Law that guarantee the independent
operation of Hong Kong's economy have laid a legal foundation for
Hong Kong's sustained prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important for Hong Kong to maintain an open
industrial and commercial system, low tariffs and its status as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The future HKSAR government will continue to support
development of the private sector and provide funds for
infrastructure development and education, he said.

<HEADLINE> PRC's Central Bank Won't Interfere in HK Monetary Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong said here today that the People's Bank of China will not
interfere in the operation of the monetary market in Hong Kong
after it returns to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank is ready to provide support to
stabilize Hong Kong's currency in time of need and in response to
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's request, he added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Dai said after July 1 China's
interior and Hong Kong will come under the same sovereignty but
they will still have separate currencies and monetary systems and
each will have its own financial regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) will provide an appropriate economic and legal
environment for the maintenance of Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Hong Kong dollar shall continue to circulate
as the region's legal tender and there shall be no change in the
present system of issuing currency. Markets for foreign exchange,
gold, securities and futures will remain open, and the free flow
of capital will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that Hong Kong's foreign exchange fund will be
controlled by the HKSAR government and used mainly to regulate the
Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"After the handover, Hong Kong can keep and develop its
financial ties with foreign countries and regions under the name
of "China Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
It can join international financial organizations, sign or
continue to honor bilateral and multilateral financial agreements
and open financial representative offices in other countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to activities by international organizations that
only accept sovereign states but involve Hong Kong, the central
government will consult with HKSAR and include its personnel as
members of the Chinese delegation," said the central bank
governor." This will help consolidate Hong Kong's status as a
world financial center."

<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Airport Authority
has issued to the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China and the
Bank of East Asia licenses to operate in the new airport set to
open in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two banks will open branches in the departure hall and the
shopping center in the arrival hall, according to a spokesman for
the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China's branch will cover a floor space of 270
square meters in the departure hall in Chek Lap Kok, with an
operational period of 50 months. The Bank of East Asia's branch
will cover a floor space of 132 square meters with an operational
period of 48 months.
</P>
<P>
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited was also
granted the license to handle ATM business in the non-restricted
zone of the airport.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the banking licenses in the new
airport were originally intended to be granted to those providing
the highest bidding. But Bank of China offered the highest prices
for both licenses.
</P>
<P>
Not wishing to see service monopolized by one single bank, the
Airport Authority granted one of the two licenses to the Bank of
East Asia.

<TEXT>

<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special

maintaining law and order under the principle of "one country, two
systems", Secretary for Security Peter Lai Hing-ling said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He told a news briefing that in accordance with the Basic Law,
the Hong Kong SAR government will be responsible for the

The Hong Kong police will continue to win the faith from the
public and prepare themselves for the challenge in the years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to enjoy the autonomy and authority in
regulating the inflow and outflow of goods and people, and the
people from China's interior areas will have to enter into Hong
Kong in an orderly and appropriately administrative way, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the continued implementation of the liberal visa
regime in a bid to stabilize the metropolis' status as an

<P>
TOKYO, June (Xinhua) -- A medium-sized typhoon hit Japan's main
southern island of Kyushu this morning, triggering heavy downpours
and causing massive domestic flight cancellations, the
Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
A 44-year-old nurse in Usuki, Oita Prefecture, drowned after
she fell into a river, police said.
</P>
<P>
The season's eighth typhoon, which hit Nishisonogl Peninsula,
Nagasaki Prefecture, shortly after 9 a.m. local time, is heading
northeast at a speed of about 35 kilometers per hour and is
expected to strike Japan's largest island of Honshu.
</P>
<P>
It had sustained winds of 108 kph at its center and a central
air pressure of 975 hectopascals, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese Airlines, including Japan Airlines, All Nippon

</P>
<P>
The agency forecast that the typhoon would zap central Honshu
before leaving the Japanese archipelago on Sunday morning.

<P>
The typhoon is expected to dump between 250 to 300 millimeters
of rainfall on the Tokai region and Kinki regions and 200
millimeters on the Katon and Tohoku region.

TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- One penalty goal in injury time from
Jose da Cruz Martins gave Macau a 2-1 win over Nepal in the World
Cup Asian zone Group Four tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Martins, who's winner pushed Macau into third in the final
standings, created the penalty as he was felled by Nepal keeper
Upendra Man Singh inside the area and then coolly converted the
chance.
</P>
<P>
Nepal, who have never won a match in three qualifying rounds
for the 1986 and 1990 World Cup, opened the scoring in the 19th
minute when midfielder Deepak Amatya struck home following a
poorly cleared ball by a Macau defender.
</P>
<P>
Macau turned on the pressure in the second-half, aided by
strong winds from Typhoon Peter, and deservedly equalised in the
78th minute after Singh misread completely Che Chi-man's lobbed
pass which flew into the net.

On Friday, the bad weather prevented any play for the second

<P>
A decision on whether the gates will be opened to allow play on

Organisers have been reluctant to go ahead with the extra day's

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cities of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, the world's only two cities attacked by atomic bombs in
World War II, today protested against a U.S. plan to carry out a
subcritical nuclear experiment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a report that the United States will hold a
subcritical nuclear test in the state of Nevada to help check the
quality of nuclear weapons, the two cities urged Washington to
think twice, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that the test will be carried out despite requests by
a lot of Japanese local governments and people to suspend it, I
want to ask the U.S. again to suspend the experiment," Kyodo
quoted Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka as saying.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Washington's move, Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said,
"It is an act of treason against the international community for
the U.S. to hold such a test at this time, I want to protest
strongly against it."
</P>
<P>
On August 6, 1945, the world's first atomic bomb to be used in
warfare was dropped from U.S. aircraft on Hiroshima in western
Japan, destroying about 90 percent of the city and killing about
200,000 people. Three days later, a similar bomb was dropped on
Nagasaki in southwestern Japan, leaving some 140,000 dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government would
remain neutral in Kenya's impending general elections, Tony
Lloyd, the visiting British Minister of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, has claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Britain will not seek sides in Kenya's elections despite the
fact that we have a legitimate interest" as one of the key
investors in the eastern African country, said Lloyd Friday, the
final day of his three-day visit to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The British government firmly believed that the general
elections are for the Kenyan people alone, and need not be
interfered with by foreigners, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Britain is hoping to see free, fair and
violence-free elections in Kenya.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Narrows Current-Account Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea saw its current account
shortfall abating significantly in May largely thanks to
decreasing imports.
</P>
<P>
The statistics released by the Bank of Korea (BOK) show that
the nation's current account deficit amounted to some 1.04 billion
U.S. dollars in May, a remarkable improvement over the 1.59
billion dollar shortfall a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, the deficit narrowed from some
3.06 billion dollars in January to about 2.5 billion dollars in
February, 2.21 billion dollars in March and further to over 1.71
billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate current account shortfall came to some 10.52
billion dollars during the first five months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea registered a trade deficit of 364 million dollars
in May.
</P>
<P>
With the steadily increasing exports against the shrinking
imports, the nation's current account shortfall is expected to
reach some 11.5 billion dollars in the first half of 1997, and
stand below the BOK's forecast of 18 billion dollars for all this
year, a BOK official said.

<HEADLINE> National Treatment Wins Ground in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's decision to grant national
treatment to overseas investors two years ago has proved
successful in attracting foreign funds to help economic
development.
</P>
<P>
When China threw its doors open in the late 1970s, it tried to
woo overseas investors with a policy combining tax concessions and
necessary restrictions.
</P>
<P>
While China has made itself a powerful magnet for overseas
capital, foreign investors have, on the other hand, insisted on
enjoying what is called national treatment, which would remove
certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
National treatment provides the overseas investors with a level
playground and enables them to compete on the same footing with
domestic companies, said Mike Burns, an investor from Texas of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
As they no longer enjoy tax exemption and reduction in China,
overseas investors can recover their lost ground through benefits
in national treatment, such as the lowering of tariff rates,
removal of extra fees, and provision of easier market access, an
official of China's Ministry of Finance (MOF) said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a sort of give-and-take arrangement," said an
international investor, who asked not to be identified, in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She added that giving national treatment to overseas investors,
which means withdrawal of both favorable policy incentives and
restrictions, indicates that the Chinese market is ripening and
China now can compete internationally in terms of luring overseas
capital.

<HEADLINE> Manila Continues Offensives Against Muslim Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine troops today continued
their clearing operations in Mindanao, the southern Philippines,
in search of fleeing Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels
who were believed behind many kidnapping cases, the military said.
</P>
<P>
At early dawn today, a group of MILF rebels blocked again
several cargo trucks and passenger vehicles along a national
highway in Pagalunga town in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Noel Detoyato, spokesman for the Sixth Infantry Division
in charge of the clearing operations, said the rebels felled an
electric post to block the highway, leading to the closure of
traffic in the area.
</P>
<P>
Many commuters were stranded as the rebels held the area for
two hours before they fled, Detoyato said, adding that the
military has already advised commuters to avoid travelling at
night or early dawn.
</P>
<P>
On early Thursday morning, some 1,000 MILF rebels held hostage
about 100 bus passengers in nearby North Cotabato province, along
the same highway stretching across southern Mindanao. Around 60
hostages were freed by the military, but dozens of others remain
in captivity.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato also confirmed that an undetermined number of MILF
rebels Friday launched rocket attacks on Camp Rajamuda in Pikit
town, North Cotabato province, which was overrun by government
troops Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sporadic attacks resulted in four injuries on the
government side, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Carmen, Cotabato, a group of unidentified armed men Friday
held 60 villagers as human shields against pursuing government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said the military has strengthened defense in villages
in North Cotabato and Maguindanao to prevent further
hostage-taking incidents and retaliatory attacks against civilians
by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
As the military operations went on in Mindanao, the sixth round
of peace talks between the government and the MILF did not push
through today as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The MILF leadership decided to postpone the talks soon after
the military took Camp Rajamuda Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaffar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, said
today they will not go back in the negotiating table until the
situation in Mindanao normalized.
</P>
<P>
Jaffar reiterated his warning that the MILF will go to a
full-scale war if the military operations escalated in their other
"controlled-areas."
</P>
<P>
A total of 158 rebels, soldiers and civilians have been killed
since fighting broke out June 16 between government troops and the
MILF in central Mindanao, the military said.
</P>
<P>
The continued fighting has forced more than 60,000 residents to
flee their homes and seek refuge in temporary evacuation centers.

PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- If the world leaders succeeded in putting up an illusion of
unity for minimum cooperation in environment protection at the
1992 Rio Earth Summit, this slim facade collapsed Friday in New
York as the second Earth Summit ended in a total failure and its
participants even failed to adopt a political declaration.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has asked his cabinet ministers
to do everything to realize an "economic and monetary union" in
accordance with the deadline set by the Maastricht
treaty. However, the government confirmed Friday that France's
public deficit would stand at 3.4-3.5 percent of its gross
domestic product, higher than the 3 percent ceiling set by the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
-- France will not immediately return to the NATO integrated
military commanding structure, because the conditions set by Paris
to continue the process of its full return to NATO have not been
met, said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt
Friday.

<HEADLINE> National Treatment Wins Ground in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When China decided to give national treatment to overseas
investors two years ago, the Chinese government selected Shenzhen,
Xiamen, the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, Hainan Province and the
coastal city of Dalian, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, to
try out the program.
</P>
<P>
Official surveys show that with the policy shift some
overseas-funded enterprises have successfully expanded their sales
in China and reduced their cost in water and power consumption.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Japanese kinescope company in Shenzhen, a special
economic zone neighboring Hong Kong, is such an example. It has
pulled itself out of the red and turned itself into a leading
color tube producer in China, after the city government granted
local joint ventures national treatment and removed the ban on the
sale of their products on the home market.
</P>
<P>
Li Decheng, vice mayor of Shenzhen, said that the SEZ has
decided to open the home market even wider to products from
overseas-funded ventures.
</P>
<P>
"Those technically-advanced enterprises and joint ventures in
agriculture can sell all their products at home," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, another SEZ, which is in eastern Fujian Province, and
Hainan, China's largest SEZ, have also promulgated detailed
measures to give national treatment to overseas investors. These
measures include raising the proportion of products allowed to be
sold in China, extending the terms of operation and business scope
of overseas-funded enterprises, and permitting overseas partners
to hold larger stakes in joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
"Such experiments have proved to be highly successful and paved
the way for implementing it nationwide by the end of the century,"
said Gao Guanjiang, a research fellow with the Development
Research Center of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the five special economic zones actually used
more than 6.8 billion US dollars in overseas capital last year,
and overseas investment in Shenzhen and Zhuhai alone surged more
than 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Gao also pointed out that China's infrastructure
sector still needs to implement preferential policies and attract
sufficient overseas funds for building roads, docks and electric
power plants.
</P>
<P>
"To reduce the impact that the policy of national treatment may
exert on the inflow of foreign funds in certain sectors, we should
still combine opening the market and abolishing certain
preferential policy incentives," he added.

<HEADLINE> India's Industry Growth Registers Sharp Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial growth
plummeted to 6.7 percent in 1996-97, down from the previous year's
11.6 percent, the times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The performance was well below the official target of a double
digit growth rate for 1996-97, but it comes as no surprise to
industry watchers here because the last one month (April 1997) has
seen a lot of leading companies announcing poor financial results
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was evident in the manufacturing sector as it grew
by eight percent in 1996-97, considerably down from the previous'
growth rate of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to some analysts, the slowdown should really be
termed as a recession and is due to constraints like
infrastructural deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown seems to be continuing in the current fiscal year,
the Times of India said, quoting a government announcement.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures released on Friday, mining grew
only 1.2 percent in a "certain period under consideration" in the
current fiscal, compared to 7.4 percent during the previous
period.
</P>
<P>
Electricity grew only 3.8 percent, compared to eight percent in
the previous comparable period.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Ratify U.N. Pact on Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will ratify the U.N.
Convention banning the use of anti-personnel landmines, Kenya's
Attorney-General Amos Wako was quoted by local press reports as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government made the decision after deliberation
among President Daniel arap Moi and other top governmental
officials, Wako said Friday when attending an exhibition on the
impact of landmines.
</P>
<P>
So far Kenya is one of the few mine-free countries on the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Geoff Loane, the head of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) regional delegation, said the
ICRC intends to use Kenya as the base to spearhead its campaign
against planting of anti-personnel landmines in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC's choice of Kenya is partly due to the political
stability the country has enjoyed after independence in early
1960s, said Loane.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 120 million landmines laid worldwide while
a further 100 million are lying in warehouses waiting to be
planted, Loane said.
</P>
<P>
Of all the landmines around the world, over one third are
found in Africa, leaving some 18 countries on the continent faced
with the scourge of mines, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far 92 countries have signed the Declaration of Brussels
preparing a first-ever landmine ban treaty to be signed in
Ottawa, Canada in December, according to a report reaching here
from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, facilitated by the international landmine talks
starting in Ottawa at the end of 1996, is obliged to ban the
production, use, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel
landmines.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The service industry is expected
to continue playing a central role in Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
K. Y. Tang, a Hong Kong government economist, told a press
briefing here today that people employed in the local service
industry accounted for 80 percent of Hong Kong's total workforce
last year, from 55 percent in 1986, and that the proportion of the
industry's output value in Hong Kong's GDP rose to 84 percent in
1995, from 70 percent a decade before. Also, between 1986 and
1996, Hong Kong's export of services registered an annual growth
of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
With an accelerated shift of Hong Kong's economy from
manufacturing to services, Tang said, the service industry is
expected to play an even bigger role in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
He said new technologies have been introduced for use by the
service industry, boosting efficiency. The local service industry
covers telecommunications, trade, cargo container transport, wharf
construction, and financial services, among others.
</P>
<P>
Financial and business services such as banking, insurance and
real estate have all recorded fast growth over the past few years,
Tang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Ten Turkish military personnel
were killed in a mine explosion in southeastern Turkey on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
One sergeant, eight soldiers and one village guard aboard a
vehicle were killed when the mine planted by rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) exploded, said the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place when the military vehicle was on its
way to relieve guard between Yayvantepe village and Botas-DS 4
Pumping Station in Midyat town of Mardin province linking Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of PKK members attacked a passenger minibus
in Genc town of eastern province of Bingol the same evening,
wounding three people, according to Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has enhanced its armed attacks on the government
military targets in southeastern Turkey since some 50,000-strong
government troops intruded northern Iraq from May 14, attempting
to raid the PKK militants, who have set up their shelters in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Sources here who declined to be named said that Turkey has
withdrawn most of its troops from the cross-border military
operations in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign reportedly followed a request for help
by Mesud Barzani, leader of Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) to sweep the PKK rebels out of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military said that at least 2,500 PKK guerrillas
have been killed since the Turkish security forces crossed into
northern to wipe out the rebel group in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting an almost 13-year-old separatist
war for autonomy and over 23,000 people were killed in the
clashes in eastern and southeastern Turkey.

<P>
DHAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The smooth return of Hong Kong to
China is a great diplomatic success of the Chinese government,
which has been handling the issue very well, said Anwarul Amin,
President of Bangladesh-China People's Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Amin praised China for its
patience and foresight in settling the Hong Kong issue and said
the Chinese government set a good example for other regions to
solve disputes through dialogue and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Amin, who was a chief executive of an international bank in
Beijing for seven years in the 1980s, said that only after July 1,
Hong Kong people can become the masters of their own land.

Meanwhile, Rezaul Karim, a former Bangladeshi Ambassador to
China, told Xinhua in a separate interview that the Hong Kong's
return is a natural and inevitable outcome of the historical
trend.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been an impartible part of China and "it took
more than 150 years for restoring the lost territory to its
rightful owner," said Karim.
</P>
<P>
"The most important aspect of the transfer is that, it is not
only the return of the territory but the citizens and people of
Hong Kong back to the own people, with whom they have had the
traditional bound of unity through common race, language and
culture," said Karim.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of 'one country, two systems' is a realistic
scientific theory under the present international situation," said

"With Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland, they

who has visited China seven times.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Customs duty and sales tax
on fertilizer, veterinary drugs and plant chemicals have been
waived in Tanzania with immediate effect, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Finance Minister Daniel Yona announced the
government decision at the National Assembly on Friday, when
winding up the 1997-98 fiscal year's budget proposals and the
development plan.
</P>
<P>
Yona said the government has decided to raise customs duty on
vehicles weighing over 10-tons from 10 to 20 percent to cover the
gap left by the abolished tax.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the people should be vigilant against
smuggling of the agricultural inputs imported into Tanzania,
where lack of tax is likely to led to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
The minister said interests of the farmers have been taken
into account in the 1997/98 budget.
</P>
<P>
"Taxes on mass consumer goods including textiles, shoes, soap
have gone down, tax on heavy duty tyres are down, tax on
pharmaceuticals down, in all these farmers stand to benefit," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Minute on Transfer of HK Archives Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This signals the fulfilment of another major task related
directly to the transfer of power, through prolonged efforts made
by both the Chinese and British sides.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British Agreed Minute on the Transfer of the Hong
Kong Archives defines the nature, extent and the method of
transferring Hong Kong's foreign affairs, defense and local
affairs archives.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the minute is, beyond any doubt, a direct
contribution to the transfer of power of Hong Kong," said Zhao
Jihua, senior Chinese representative of the Chinese side of the
JLG.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to the
transfer of Hong Kong archives, since it constitutes an important
component part of the transfer of power of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Consultations between the two sides started back in 1986, and
in 1990, both sides concluded the Agreed Record of Discussions in
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group on the Question of Transfer
of Hong Kong Archives, which defined a number of major principles
concerning the transfer.
</P>
<P>
In order to implement the Agreed Minute, he noted, the two
sides continued consultations in the following year on specific
matters with regard to the transfer of the archives.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Jihua, in order to embody China's exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong, guarantee the effective
implementation of obligations of the Central government on matters
concerning foreign affairs and national defense, and ensure the
efficient administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, all archives in Hong Kong, should, in principle, be
transferred to the Chinese central government in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To date, through flexible and pragmatic work, the transfer of
the archives on foreign affairs, defense and local affairs has all
been settled as signified in the minute signed today, Zhao said.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - Hong Kong-related Data (17): Patten's "Triple Violation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 -- On October 7, 1992, Chris Patten, the
newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, delivered his first
political address at the Legislative Council, making major
alterations to Hong Kong's existing political system.
</P>
<P>
Patten's package violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration,
the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the relevant
agreements and understandings reached between the Chinese and
British governments. Hence it was called the "triple violation"
plan.
</P>
<P>
The first count of violation -- The British side undermined the
foundation of Sino-British cooperation, ignored the provisions for
consultation and cooperation in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, and made unilateral arrangement for Hong Kong's
political system concerning the smooth transition in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The second count of violation -- The Basic Law provisions on
the formation of the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region take into full consideration the need of
gradual progress in Hong Kong's political system and reflect part
of the achievements in Sino-British cooperation, such as the
"through train" arrangement for Hong Kong's legislature.
</P>
<P>
However, Patten, in an attempt to force the Chinese side to
accept his political package with a fait accompli, altered the
function groups and the voting method of the election committee
for the legislature, thus derailing the "through train".
</P>
<P>
The third count of violation -- The Chinese and British foreign
ministers, through diplomatic letters, reached explicit agreements
and understandings in principle on the convergence of the
political system before and after 1997, especially the "through
train".
</P>
<P>
The British side disrespected these agreements and
understandings, dished up a different plan, and even went so far
as to deny the binding force of the agreements and understandings.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the British side's unilateral implementation of the
"triple violation" political package was, far from what it claimed
to "accelerate the pace of democracy", actually to maintain to the
maximum extent its influence on the government of the future Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - Hong Kong-related Data (18): "Through Train" Arrangement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- "Through train" originally
refers to the express train running between Kowloon and Guangzhou,
a common means of transportation for Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
The first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) ought to be formed after China
resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, out of concern for a smooth transition
in Hong Kong, and at the suggestion of the British side agreed
that members of the last Legislative Council produced by the
British Hong Kong authorities in 1995 may become members of the
first Legislative Council of the HKSAR after going through
specified legal procedures if the composition of this last
Legislative Council is in conformity with the relevant decision of
the National People's Congress (NPC) and the relevant provisions
of the Basic Law and if its members meet certain qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Since this arrangement, which is conducive to Hong Kong's
smooth transition, resembles the Kowloon-Guangzhou express train
in some respects, it is popularly called the "through train"
arrangement or "through train".
</P>
<P>
However, because the British side unilaterally pushed ahead
with its political package and the composition of the last
Legislative Council of the British Hong Kong authorities is not in
conformity with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, the
basic conditions for implementing the "through train" arrangement
are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, members of the last Legislative Council of the
British Hong Kong authorities can not get on the "through train".

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" to Facilitate Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The concept of "one country, two
systems" is the best approach to the reunification of China, which
will also facilitate the solution of the Taiwan issue, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Alatas said the idea of
"one country, two systems" put forward by late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping is realistic and many people hoped that the idea will be a
facility of reunification for China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the return of Hong Kong to China is a historical
event and a milestone not only in the history of China and Asia
but also in the history of the world at large. He was confident
that China has the ability to keep stability and prosperity of
Hong Kong in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has played a very important role in the economic
development in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and as a member of
the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum), it will
continue to keep its status both in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that on the basis of the Joint Declaration
between China and Britain and the Basic Law, Hong Kong will
maintain its position as a free trade city and an international
economic and financial center for at least next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Considering the mutual benefits, Indonesia and other countries
of the ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are
willing to develop relations with Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the relations between Indonesia and China are very
good, especially in the economic field, since the resumption of
diplomatic ties in 1990.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Indonesia's trade with China is almost
four billion U.S. dollars and that with Hong Kong stands at two
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the third largest investor in Indonesia with a
total of more than 16 billion dollars up to 1996, he added.

</P>
<P>
The PLA troops to be stationed in the Hong Kong Special

motherland and the people have bestowed on us," an officer told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, General Liu Zhenwu, commander of
the Hong Kong SAR garrison, said that the troops have completed
all preparations for entering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an important symbol of China's sovereignty, the

<HEADLINE> Strictly Observe the Hong Kong Basic Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is China's basic state policy to introduce the "one country,
two systems" concept with regard to Hong Kong. The HKSAR Basic Law
embodies the principle of "one country, two systems" and all the
policies of the central government relating to Hong Kong. It is in
fact a legal vehicle for implementing the principle of "one
country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law was passed and promulgated by the supreme
legislative body -- the National People's Congress. It is a state
law with a universal binding force. It is also an important
component part of the legal system of China and the legal basis
for the operation of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the Basic Law strictly and in an all-round
manner means to uphold "one country" and "two systems", ensure a
high-degree of autonomy of the HKSAR, and guarantee that the
principle will remain "unchanged for fifty years".
</P>
<P>
By upholding "one country", it means to safeguard a unified
People's Republic of China, the unification and sovereignty of the
state and territorial integrity. This is the precondition for
establishing the HKSAR and for formulating the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
It is in pursuance to the provisions of Article 31 of the
Constitution of the People's Republic of China that the Central
People's Government established the HKSAR and the National
People's Congress formulated and promulgated the HK Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The government and people of the HKSAR, like the rest of the
country, are obliged to safeguard the unification, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the country. They are obliged to
safeguard security of the country.
</P>
<P>
By upholding "two systems", it means to safeguard the socialist
system that is unswervingly pursued by the main body of the
country with a 1.2 billion people and at the same time
unswervingly safeguard the provisions of the Basic Law that "the
socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist
system ans way of life of Hong Kong shall remain unchanged."

</P>
<P>
This will mark a new period of the implementation the "one
country, two systems" policy and usher in a new era in which "Hong
Kong will be governed by Hong Kong people" with a high-degree of

</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin emphasized not long ago that "to ensure
Hong Kong's smooth transfer and maintain its long-term stability
and prosperity after its return to the motherland concerns the
immediate interests of Hong Kong compatriots and the fundamental
interests of the Chinese nation as well as peace and development
in Asia and the world as a whole. We must do it well."
</P>
<P>
Jiang proposed the following in order to ensure that the job is
well done: unswervingly implement the grand concept of "one
country, two systems" advanced by Deng Xiaoping, unswervingly
implement the principle of "Hong Kong being governed by Hong
Kong people" with a high-degree of autonomy, and unswervingly
observe the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>

By upholding a high degree of autonomy for the HKSAR, it means
to safeguard the provisions of the Basic Law that the HKSAR
"enjoys executive, legislative and independent judicial power,
including that of final adjudication." It means to respect the
practice of "Hong Kong being governed by the Hong Kong people",
which means that Hong Kong should be governed by "permanent
residents of Hong Kong" and that the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall be composed of local people
with the people who love the motherland and Hong Kong as the main
body. The government may have the participation of other people
and also may appoint foreigners as advisors.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government will not interfere in the
efforts of the HKSAR to exercise administration and management
according to the provisions of the Basic Law. The Central
Government is responsible only for the foreign affairs relating to
and the defence of the HKSAR. All the affairs within the scope of
autonomy of the HKSAR will be free from interference by any
central department. There is no subordinate relationship between
central government departments and the corresponding departments
of the HKSAR government.

<P>
By upholding a high degree of autonomy for the HKSAR, it also
means to handle correctly the relations between Hong Kong and the
inland. Inland provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities
directly under central government are not allowed to interfere in
the administration of Hong Kong by the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
If they need to establish non-administrative organizations in
Hong Kong they must get the consent of the HKSAR government and
the approval of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The organizations established in Hong Kong by inland
institutions and their personnel must abide by the Basic Law and
laws of the HKSAR. Relations between the inland non-governmental
organizations and religious groups and their counterparts in Hong
Kong should be based on the principles of non-subordination,
non-interference, and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Trade and investment between Hong Kong and the inland will be
regarded as foreign trade and overseas investment. Their exchange
of financial operations is regarded as foreign financial
operations; their shipping operations are regarded as foreign
trade shipping. The exchange between Hong Kong and inland in trade
adn economic activities will basically follow the international
rules and common international practices; the disputes arising
from trade and economic activities will be handled according to
international rules.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR has definite control line of boundary. In entering Hong
Kong, people from the other parts of the country must strictly
observe the related rules and go through the prescribed approval
procedures. In seeking permanent residence in the HKSAR, all the
related requirements of the Basic Law must be met. This is also an
embodiment of the concept of "one country, two systems".

By upholding the principle that will remain unchanged for 50
years, it means to maintain the principle of "one country, two
systems" unchanged for a long time to come and ensure that the
prevailing capitalist system and way of life in Hong Kong will
remain unchanged for a long period of time to come. Change in the
system and way of life will be unfavorable to Hong Kong and to
the long-term development of the whole Chinese nation.
</P>

During his meeting with a delegation from Hong Kong and Macao
to the National Day celebrations in Beijing in 1984, Deng Xiaoping
said firmly: "Our policies will not change; no one can change
them, because these policies are correct and fruitful and have the
support of the people," and that "when we say that the policies
will remain unchanged for 50 years, we mean it. They will not
change in our generation; neither will they in the next."
</P>
<P>
The third generation of the Party leadership with Jiang Zemin
at its core is very firm in its determination to implement the
principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"To govern Hong Kong by law is an important part of our efforts
to govern China by law," said Jiang Zemin. "To uphold the
authority of the Basic Law is to uphold the authority of the legal
system of the country. This is the common duty of the Chinese
people."
</P>
<P>
The people of the whole country should make further efforts to
study the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the People's Republic of
China, acquire a thorough understanding of it, master it in an
all-round manner and abide by it consciously, and ensure a
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong by the concrete
action of strictly observing the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Firms Stand to Gain From ITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Information Technology
(IT) companies are standing to gain huge savings as the first
phase of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), concluded in
March 1997, will be implemented beginning July 1 this year, the
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore companies in the IT industry will gain an
accumulated potential tariff savings of more than 1 billion U.S.
dollars when the ITA is fully implemented in 2005, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ITA, first agreed upon at the inaugural World Trade
Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Singapore in December
last year, will liberalize global trade in five main IT sectors,
namely computers, telecommunications equipment, semiconductors,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and scientific instruments.
</P>
<P>
The IT market is estimated to be worth about 600 billion
dollars. Tariffs on IT products in most participating economies
will be completely eliminated by year 2000. However, some
developing countries have been allowed a longer time frame to
eliminate tariffs on some IT products, but in no case later than
2005.
</P>
<P>
After the Singapore WTO Ministerial Conference in December
1996, there were 29 original signatories to the ITA. The number of
ITA participants has since risen by another 15 signatories. There
are at present 44 signatories, covering more than 92 percent of
the global IT trade.
</P>
<P>
Ng Kim Neo, TDB senior director of trade policy, said,
"Singapore's participation in the ITA will provide our IT
exporters with more certainty and transparency when planning and
mapping their marketing strategies for the medium and longer
term."
</P>
<P>
The TDB said the Singapore companies are advised to contact the
TDB should they find that the ITA member countries they are
exporting to are not meeting the obligations of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The TDB will then assess the matter and act accordingly," it
said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official has refuted
recent reports by overseas media that "Wei Jingsheng was
beaten up in prison" as "lies spread by certain individuals."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua here today, a leading official from
the department of prison under the Ministry of Justice said that
the above-mentioned reports of Western media "do not tally with
the facts at all."
</P>
<P>
"At 9 a.m. on May 29 this year, when Wei Jingsheng was breaking
into the prison's warehouse without permission, an inmate who was
responsible for taking care of the warehouse tried to stop him,"
the prison official recounted.
</P>
<P>
"Wei flew into a rage, damaged the door by kicking it and beat
up the inmate," the official said, "But the inmate did not strike
back.
</P>
<P>
"The policeman on duty immediately stopped Wei's behavior and
criticized him for his serious mistake of violating the prison
rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Later Wei not only admitted his mistake but also said that he
would not make such a mistake again in the future," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
"Considering Wei Jingsheng's improved attitude toward his
mistake, the prison authorities decided not to give him any
penalty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's judicial departments protect the legal rights of
prisoners according to China's law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Wei's health in prison is in normal condition and the reports
that 'Wei was beaten up in prison' and 'Wei did not receive
medical care for his illness' are sheer fabrications by certain
individuals," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Central Bank Lowers Discount Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy's central bank has decided to
adjust its discount rate from the current level of 6.75 percent to
the new low of 6.25 percent effective from June 30.
</P>
<P>
Facilitating the 0.5 percentage point cut is the country's
increasingly steady economic growth, said Antonio Fazio, president
of the Bank of Italy, while announcing the decision.
</P>
<P>
Recent months have seen inflation being brought under control,
market demands increasing and productivity rising -- all positive
signs pointing to Italy's economic recovery, said Fazio.
</P>
<P>
The discount rate is the inter-bank rate charged by the central
bank against lendings to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Bank of Italy's decision, Prime Minister
Romano Prodi said, "This is a piece of encouraging news."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Federation of Trade Unions and other groups also
spoke highly of the decision, saying it would help boost
investment and employment in both public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was down to 1.4 percent by the end of May,
the lowest in years, said the Central Institute of Statistics.
Electricity consumption in May was 4 percent more than that in the
same period of last year, indicating increased activities in
manufacturing sectors, said the National Bureau of Electricity.
</P>
<P>
The economic upturn has been much sought after by the
government policies designed to improve economic performances for
joining the European Union's single currency system.
</P>
<P>
Lowering the discount rate is no doubt beneficial to the
economic growth and the entry into the monetary union slated for
launch in 1999, when Euro will be the currency for all Europe.
</P>
<P>
Discount rate has been high in Italy over the past two decades,
with the highest of 19 percent recorded in January 1981. It
remained over 10 percent until July 1993, but still stayed as high
as 9 percent thereafter.
</P>
<P>
It was after nine downward adjustments in a row by the central
bank that the discount rate came down to the recent 6.25 percent,
or similar to that of 22 years ago in September 1975.
</P>
<P>
However, at the current level, the rate is still higher than
that of all the other West European countries except Britain.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Heart inflammation or viral
myocarditis, which is linked to the Coxsackie virus B, has claimed
its 30th victim in Sarawak, East Malaysia, According to Health
Minister Chua Jui Meng today.
</P>
<P>
The victim, an eight-month-old boy, died today at Sibu Hospital
in the East Malaysian state, the minister told reporters after a
function here.
</P>
<P>
The victim had fever and cough for two days and the diagnosis
was acute myocarditis, cardiogenic shock and aseptic meningitis,
Chua said.
</P>
<P>
On the overall situation, Chua said as of midnight yesterday
the total number of admissions was 2,140 cases with 1,770
discharged and 370 still warded in hospitals throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
As for Sarawak, where the outbreak started on April 14 and all
the deaths occurred, the total number of admissions to date was
733 cases with 657 discharged and 76 still warded, he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question on the control of the situation, the minister
said: "When we talk about controlling the further spread of the
disease it does not mean to say that the situation is controlled.
We are putting in preventive health measures on a massive scale to
control it from spreading to the entire population as this disease
can spread very fast..."
</P>
<P>
On the Sarawak front, he said the situation presented some hope
as the graph was coming down. "However, we may continue to see
deaths coming from different areas because Sarawak is a very
large state and the children are presented late," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chua reiterated his appeal to parents to act fast by bringing
their children to hospitals once they fell ill.
</P>
<P>
On how the viral myocarditis broke out, the minister said there
have been various surmises but to date it was not yet known if it
was local or foreign in origin.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Officials Hold Secret Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of
Infrastructure Ariel Sharon and PLO Secretary General Abu Mazen
have recently held a secret meeting to discuss the stalled peace
process, reported the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place some 10 days ago at Sharon's desert
farm, south Israel and lasted for two and half hours.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen stressed the need for Sharon to meet with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. Sharon, a senior Likud
politician, has held various posts, including defense minister,
in different governments. Known for his hawkish view in the
party, the 69-year-old Likud politician has even recently called
Arafat "war criminal" and criticized other Likud leaders for
meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Netanyahu is planning to shift him to
finance portfolio in a forthcoming cabinet reshuffle and allow him
to take part in the inner cabinet meeting dealing with security
matters.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Wahab Darawshe, Member of Knesset (parliament) and leader
of the Arab Democratic Party, helped set up the secret meeting. He
said that both men described the dialog as positive and agreed to
meet again in the future.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials reportedly said that the meeting
was essential, but expressed unhappiness about a leakage of the
information. They attributed it to domestic political considerations
on the part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting happened at a time when the peace process has
broken off for more than three months since Israel began
construction of a new Jewish settlement at Har Homa in East
Jerusalem in mid-March.

said.
</P>

This week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was lower to
close at 13.69 ringgit (about 5.48 dollars) per kg against 13.83

</P>
<P>
The KLTM's price differential to the LME stood at a premium of

<HEADLINE> Chilean FM: Hong Kong's Return An Historical Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China is "a
most significant historical event," Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza told Xinhua in a written interview today.
</P>
<P>
Insulza hoped to further Chile's relations with Hong Kong and
China as a whole after the territory's return to the motherland on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt a big event in China's diplomatic endeavors," he
said, the country's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong through peaceful means is also "a significant
undertaking for the international community."
</P>
<P>
"Equally encouraging is the fact that Hong Kong's return is
proceeded with economic and social stability, which is beneficial
to China's economic growth, private businesses holding interests
in Hong Kong and local residents there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chile's membership at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum and exchanges with the South American Common Market and
other groups are a show of its willingness to "take an active part
in international economic integration," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
His country's approach is providing the best opportunity for
exporters and investors in Hong Kong to use Chile as a staging
point for exploring the huge dynamic market of the entire Latin
America, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that "Hong Kong's return to China will help Chile
strengthen its economic relations with China, which poses as the
biggest single market in the world."

<P>
MANAGUA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- After clashing with anti-riot
police Thursday, Nicaraguan students today vowed to hold more
demonstrations until the government meets their demand for keeping
the university budget intact.
</P>
<P>
Ten students and seven Sandinista deputies were injured in the
violence on Thursday afternoon after the National Assembly
approved President Arnoldo Aleman's veto on the university budget
with a reduction of 6 million U.S. dollars for public universities.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of Universities (CNU) said it will appeal
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The CNU said Aleman's veto will cause the loss of specific
projects for professional development, and the possibility of
granting scholarships to more poor students.
</P>
<P>
Student leader Julio Orozco said students will start a series
of demonstrations today, and they will not stop the protests
unless the government changes its attitude toward the universities.
</P>
<P>
National Police confirmed at a press conference this morning
that several students were detained during Thursday's
confrontation between 2,000 students and police.
</P>
<P>

SANTIAGO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chile is seeking a new agreement
with the South American Common Market (Mercosur) to secure the
country a place for political consultations within the bloc,
Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza has said.
</P>
<P>
The "El Diario" newspaper today quoted Insulza as saying that
"there were big advances" in Chile and Bolivia's entry into the
regional group's political dialogue, but "now they must be
substantiated into a specific agreement."
</P>
<P>
Insulza said Chilean President Eduado Frei will travel to
Montevideo next month and "give a very clear expression of his
political will."

Established in 1991, Mercosur, initially consisting of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, aims to intensify the
economic integrity of Latin America.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Strongly Criticizes Turkish Parliament's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has strongly criticized a
Turkish parliament's decision to renew for another six months the
presence of the U.S. and British forces on Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) today quoted a Iraqi Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying Friday that the decision made by the
Turkish parliament Thursday reflects what he called the Turkish
politicians' "deep neglect " of the real interests of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision also reflects their insistence on
practicing the policy of bringing harm to Iraq and its national
security.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman asserted that Iraq holds Turkey fully
responsible for its "harmful" policy towards the country, which
confirms Turkey's "sorrowful non-respect" for the good
neighborliness relations with other countries, international law
and the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the U.S. and British troops on Turkish
territory to patrol the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq have not
only threatened the security and sovereignty of Iraq but also that
of Turkey, stressed the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the renewal of foreign troops' presence
will help continue the "aggression" on Iraq and harms Turkey's own
interests.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq ended, the U.S., France,
Britain and Turkey built a joint air force and set up a "non-fly"
zone in northern Iraq to protect Iraqi Kurds there from attacks
by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
The zone is patrolled at present by the U.S. and British
troops which have their bases in Turkey after France withdrew its
soldiers from the joint force at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Earth Summit Ends, Difference Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nineteenth Special Session on
Sustainable Development ended here late Friday with major
differences unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, known as "Earth Summit Plus Five",
reviewed progress after the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in
1992.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, heated discussions focused on three subjects --
official development aid to the developing countries, reduction of
greenhouse gases emissions and forests protection.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries agreed in principle in Rio to increase
aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product. But it
declined from 0.35 percent to 0.27 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite severe criticism by the developing world, the West did
not make any commitment to live up to the commitment.
</P>
<P>
On the question of greenhouse gases, the United States has been
under attack right from the beginning of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
With its population accounting for only 2 percent of the
world's total, the United States produces more than 20 percent of
the greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
The European Union promised a 15 percent reduction in emissions
from the 1990 levels by 2010, with a 10 percent reduction by
2005. The United State, Canada and Japan made no commitments on
cutting the gases.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the European Union proposed to start negotiations
immediately on a binding treaty that would introduce standings for
the logging trade. But the proposal met opposition from the United
States, Brazil and India, which prefer to see existing agreements
enforced.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the diplomats attending the meeting managed to
adopt a final document, the Program for Further Implementing
Agenda 21, which "reaffirms that Agenda 21 remains the fundamental
program of action for achieving sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the achievement of sustainable
development requires the integration of its economic,
environmental and social components," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We re-commit to work together -- in the spirit of global
partnership -- to reinforce our joint efforts to meet equitably
the needs of present and future generations," it said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. General Assembly President Ismail Razali said although
there were divisions among member states over the issue, the
session is a success because it serves as wake-up call on the
environmental dangers facing the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the meeting, all the countries should work
to live up to the requirements of the Agenda 21.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Restrict U.N. Weapons Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
Tarek Aziz said here today Iraq would not guarantee U.N. weapons
inspectors unrestricted access to all sites they wish to enter.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the defying statement after the West threatened to
tighten sanctions if Iraq fails to cooperate in U.N. weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
"I can and will guarantee their access to any sites that is
within their mandate but not beyond their mandate," he told the
Cable News Network (CNN).
</P>
<P>
"All inspectors should be inspectors, not detectives. If they
act like experts, I have no problems with them. That is why I said
our problems are only with a few of them, those who are actually
detectives and not experts," said Aziz, who is at the U.N.
headquarters to attend the Earth Summit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.Security Council says that the experts have the right
to enter any sites in Iraq which they suspect may harbor banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq stresses that the inspectors must have permission to
enter sites which effects national security.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred weapons inspectors from three sites this
month. On June 21, the Security Council threatened to impose new
sanctions on Iraq.

<P>
VIENNA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Industrial Development
Organzation (UNIDO) will focus its efforts to help the world's
least developed countries, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Istvan Posta, a Hungarian diplomat who chairs the UNIDO Board

worked out at the agency's just-concluded one-week board meeting.
</P>
<P>
Special attention will be given to the industrial development
of African nations, Posta said.
</P>
<P>
The board meeting also discussed the UNIDO's budget and
provided options of a 10 percent, 20 percent or 30 percent cut,
pending the board's decision at its next meeting in September.
</P>
<P>
However, UNIDO Director-General Mauricio de Maria y Campos
complained that the agency has found it hard to fulfill its
extensive mandate with restrained financial resources.
</P>
<P>
While condemning the U.S. withdrawal from the UNIDO as a breach
of its international commitment, he hoped that Germany and Britain
would not follow the suit and would continue to support the UNIDO.
</P>
<P>
At the board meeting in September, UNIDO officials are
scheduled to discuss finding a new leader for the U.N. agency, as
Campos' term expires at the end of this year.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexico respects China's theory
of "one country, two systems," and wishes its implementation to be
successful and to permit a smooth return of Hong Kong to China,
said a senior Foreign Ministry official here today.
</P>
<P>
The idea has a great historical meaning, as it will be a sample
worldwide for the way in which two economic systems can co-exist
in one country, said Eduardo Martinez, general director for the
Pacific and Asian Affairs at the Foreign Relations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return on July 1 is a triumph of peace through a
peaceful solution, after an admirable process of negotiations
between Britain and China, Martines told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who worked from 1978 to 1981 at the Mexican Embassy
in China, said the good performance of the "one country, two
systems" formula will help bring a bigger inflow of investments
and more dynamic commercial activities in China.
</P>
<P>
There also will be an atmosphere of confidence for the
political, economic, and cultural future of Hong Kong and China as
a whole, said Martinez.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Mexico's economic ties with Hong Kong, the
diplomat said exchanges will grow at a faster pace. Annual trade
between Mexico and the region is worth 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government will send Foreign Minister Jose Angel
Gurria to be represented at the ceremony for Hong Kong's return.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebel Leader Attempts to Flee Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), is reportedly
attempting to flee to another country as he is unable to face the
ongoing Jaya Sikuru operation in northern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The leader might escape together with his family to Cambodia,
Laos or Myanmar, the newspaper The Daily News today quoted
intelligence reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
The original plan, according to the paper, was to first send
his family abroad, but this plan had failed.
</P>
<P>
Even some of his closest associates are reportedly planning to
desert the leader, but they were forcibly kept by Prabhakaran to
provide security until he escapes from the country with his
family.
</P>
<P>
A large number of LTTE cadres have been killed in the Jaya
Sikuru (Certain Victory) Operation launched by government troops
on May 14 and the LTTE rebels are said to be disillusioned that
their leader is about to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 14-year war against the government
for a separate state in the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> SAR Secretary of Health, Welfare Pledges Dedication to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- "Wishing Hong Kong people a good
health and a long life" is the will and responsibility of Fok Lo
Shiu-ching, secretary of health and welfare of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region. (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"Being public servants, we more or less have a sense of
historic mission to varying extent. We will feel contented as Hong
Kong progresses toward the good direction," she said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. K. Fok, 55, graduated from the University of Hong Kong in
1962, and became an administrative officer. To date, she has
served on more than 10 different posts over the past 35 years and
assumed her present post in 1994.
</P>
<P>
She is now in charge of the medical, welfare and hospital
divisions. The greatest advantage of this system of integrating
medical and health work and social welfare is to combine
prevention, treatment and convalescence, thus effectively
facilitating the protection of the people's health, she said.
</P>
<P>
Like other Hong Kong residents, Fok takes pride in the
sustained growth in Hong Kong's economy, which has resulted in the
effective growth of local medical and health work.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that Hong Kong leads the Southeast Asia in the
development of public health, she said the region, with a
population of 6.3 million, has 8,000 registered physicians and
7,000 physicians practising traditional Chinese medicine, she
added.
</P>
<P>
While a complete legal framework has been formed for the
Western medicine, she said that as the next step, the relevant
government departments will focus their attention on popularizing
traditional Chinese medicine, drawing up a series of supervisory
regulations and training more traditional Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, it is essential to explore new channels
to cut the rising cost of medical service brought about by the
aging of the local population.
</P>
<P>
She held that public health plays a vital role in maintaining
social stability. Therefore, she urged increased education on
health work and family sanitation so as to increase the awareness
of the residents on sanitation and health and enable their family
members to live in harmony. This is a kind of social welfare as
well as a contribution to social stability, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has more than 600,000 people at or above the age of
65, who make up one tenth of its total population. The figure is
expected to reach 800,000 in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
K. Fok pondered over a new concept in service of the elderly.
Local residents will, via education on how to keep fit, will come
to recognize the importance of enthusiastic involvement in
community life and self-study and giving scope to their
enterprising spirit in the process of slowing down the process of
the aging.
</P>
<P>
K. Fok advocates the fine traditional virtue of "respecting the
old and loving the young" and "Living in harmony" of the Chinese
nation. In spite of a host of homes set up especially for the
aged, she said, the best and most appropriate way is to let the
elderly people stay and live with their children, enjoying
themselves at their own homes.
Moreover, departments of health and social welfare, and various
societies and organization are also working for the service of the
aged, she said. And a great deal of work in the field of social
welfare needs the assistance and support of volunteers, who make
others feel the warmth of living in community.
</P>
<P>
As a career workman, K. Fok added, a female should plays the
part of a wife and the mother well at home, and he best option is
to work in close cooperation with the family members as well as
with colleagues or subordinates in office.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," she said, "My lifelong career is to serve Hong
Kong."

<HEADLINE> Annan Views Israeli Settlement Construction As "Serious" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today said Israel was still continuing its construction of
the new settlement on the occupied territory, which was "viewed as
particularly serious."
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan noted that as of
last Friday, the Israeli government has not abandoned its
construction of a new Israel settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim, south
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Politically, Annan said, the start of building at Jabal Abu
Ghneim on March 18 "represents the first move to construct an
entirely new settlement on occupied Palestinian lands since a
freeze was imposed on such activities by the previous Israeli
government in the context of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Geographically, it represents "the final link" in a chain of
settlements constructed by Israel around occupied East Jerusalem,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Demographically, the U.N. chief said, it would have a
"significant effect on further advancing the forced alternation of
the religious and ethnic composition of occupied East Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Economically, it was "expected to have damaging effects on an
already devastated Palestinian economy in the occupied
territories," Annan noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said Israel's refusal to abandon construction at
Jabal Abu Ghneim "appears to represent, in the view of the
Palestinian people, the largest single negative factor in the
breakdown of the peace process, and the formenting of unrest on
the occupied territories."
</P>
<P>
An emergency special session of the U.N. General Assembly in
April demanded the immediate cessation of construction at the
site, called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
The assembly resolution, adopted by a vote of 134 to three with
11 abstentions, also demanded a halt to all other Israeli
settlement activities and called for an end to all support for
"illegal Israeli activities" in the occupied territories.

<HEADLINE> Finance Institutions Ordered to Suspend Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai central bank and the
Finance Ministry Friday ordered 16 unhealthy finance institutions
to suspend their operations in a decisive bid to restructure the
ailing finance sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 16 finance and securities companies were ordered to suspend
their operations, including trading on the stock market, for 30
days and prepare merger plans within 14 days, or they will be
forced to join with Krung Thai Thanakit, a finance firm backed by
the state-run Krung Thai Bank, or other firms.
</P>
<P>
The 16 finance and securities companies, including prominent
listed ones like Finance One, General Finance and Securities, have
combined assets of more than 230 billion baht (9.2 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the Finance Ministry said the depositors of the
suspended finance firms will be fully protected and they will be
allowed to withdraw their money, but under certain limitations.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the central bank said the 16 firms were singled
out for the forced action because their capital funds were not
higher than three-quarters of the registered capital or their
borrowing from the central bank had topped 40 percent of
outstanding deposits.
</P>
<P>
By law, these companies should be barred from taking deposits
from the public, they added.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that the Thai government has named
some healthy companies to absorb these troubled institutions and
some investors described the move as "bold and decisive" in
revamping the country's troubled finance sector.

<P>
ALMA ATA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China will
breed new opportunities for the region's growth, said a full-page
article published today in the Kazakhstan Pravda.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, now one of the most developed regions in the world,
will embrace a better future after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over the territory on July 1, said the article.
</P>
<P>
As a world trade and financial center, Hong Kong will help push
foward the Chinese mainland's development after the return, and
the role in turn will further its own prosperity, it asserted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's policy of "one country, two systems"
will keep Hong Kong's current social system intact and assure a
high-level of autonomy in the region's administration, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The policy, added the newspaper article, provides a guarantee
not only for Hong Kong's smooth return as a Special Administrative
Region, but also for its future prosperity and stability.

<HEADLINE> HK to Remain One of Safest Places: Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's police chief said
Kong will remain to be stable and safe after its return to China
at midnight, June 30.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will remain one of the safest and most stable places
in the world," said Eddie Hui Ki-on in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua. Hui is the current Commissioner of Police in Hong Kong and
will work in the same capacity for the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The priority for the Hong Kong police at the moment is to
ensure security for the handover ceremonies to be attended by
world dignitaries as well as Chinese and British leaders.
</P>
<P>
The police chief vowed to ensure absolute security for
thousands of guests coming for the ceremonies from every corner of
the world, adding that the police have gone all out to prepare for
the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
A veteran policeman, Hui joined the Hong Kong police in 1963
and served as inspector and assistant commissioner before being
appointed Commissioner in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China represents a historic change
to the metropolis, but security and stability in Hong Kong will
not compromised in the least since its social and economic systems
will remain unchanged and since the police's commitment to make it
one of the safest places in the world will remain unchanged, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The police have made plans and set goals for the next five
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The only change affecting the police, he said, will be the
removal of the word "Royal' from the name of the police force and
the replacement of the crown by a bauhinia, a flower representing
Hong Kong, on the police insignia.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, Hui emphasized, the Hong Kong police will
continue to enforce laws that are in conformity with the Basic
Law, and retain its membership in Interpol, while its staff will
continue to strictly follow professional and disciplinary codes.
</P>
<P>
"In one word, the police force will continue to carry out their
tasks with high professional standards and political neutrality to
safeguard Hong Kong's sustained stability and prosperity," the
Commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
He envisioned closer cooperation between the Hong Kong police
and their counterparts in China's inland areas, which has proved
to be quite successful over the past ten-plus years.

<P>
SHENZHEN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen and Hong Kong have
cooperated in building and running power plants over the past
decade, contributing to the fast growth of the power industry in
China's first Special Economic Zone (SEZ).
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the country's first foreign-funded power plant,
Shajiao B Power Plant, came into operation. It is
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project between the Shenzhen SEZ
Power Development Company and a Hong Kong company.
</P>
<P>
In its operation to date, the station's two generator units,
each of 350,000 kw capacity, have produced 40.78 billion kwh of
electricity, easing the bottlenecked power supply in the booming
SEZ.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, contracts to build two more power
plants, East Shenzhen and Qianwan, have been signed between
companies from the neighboring cities.
</P>
<P>
Planners say that the new plants will further improve the
power-supply network in Shenzhen as the SEZ enters its second
stage of development. Cooperation with Hong Kong, they say, has
greatly enhanced the reliability and safety of the power supply
network.

CHANGCHUN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A ginseng trade fair will be
held in Shanghai from August 8-11.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 domestic operations which cultivate, process and
market American ginseng will display products, hold trade talks
and symposiums on methods to develop their industry at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Foreign counterparts may be invited to take part, said the
event's organizer, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Though China is the world's third largest producer of the root,
after the United States and Canada, the scheduled event next month
will be the first ginseng promotional event ever to be held in the
country. Ginseng is highly valued for its health-inducing
properties.
</P>
<P>
American ginseng is cultivated in about 20 of China's
provinces, and they produce 100-150 tons of dried ginseng
annually, according to Lian Haozhe, head of a research institute
concerned with native products under the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Quality of Chinese-cultivated American ginseng is rated equal
to that from the U.S. and Canada, claimed Lian, whose academy is
based in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The consumer goods market is
expected to remain buoyant in the second half of this year taking
sales for the whole year beyond the target of 134 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An official report attributes the booming consumer commodity
market to the improved macro-economic situation, rising demand and
surging investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Savings by local residents topped 250 billion yuan in May this
year, up 52 percent year-on-year, while exports rose by 11.6
percent in the first five months.
</P>
<P>
Both the return of Hong Kong and the Shanghai's hosting of the
Eighth National Games are expected to keep citizens in a spending
mood, while authorities have planned a number of commercial
activities to spotlight certain sectors by staging more than 50
international and national exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also points out that several factors may
curb the bullish consumer market, such as the growing numbers of
jobless people, low-income families, stock investment, expected
price-hikes in apartment rents, water, power, coal, and the rising
charges of transport, education, medicine, insurance, recreation
and telecommunications.

and expenditures of 28.1 billion hryvnas (15.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is estimated to be 5.7 percent of the gross
domestic product, which the government hopes to make up through
reduced cash circulation and increased issuance of treasury notes.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments are also expected to be helpful for the
government's efforts to fill up the budgetary gap.
</P>
<P>
Also under the budget plan, the Ukrainian government will
allocate nearly 1.05 billion hryvnas (570 million dollars), or 4.7
percent of the national budget, to the defense sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1.07 billion hryvnas (580 million dollars), or 4.8
percent of the total, will go to judiciary and national security
and 2.02 billion hryvnas (1.09 billion dollars), or 8.9 percent,
will go to the social welfare sector.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament, which started to discuss the 1997
budget last September, was unhappy with the tax and pension reform
package included in the government-proposed budget plan.
</P>
<P>
It thus ignited a nine-month scuffle between the government and
the parliament. The deadlock not only forced a deputy prime
minister to resign, but also scared away many potential
investors.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong is Leading Investor in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- As central government continues to
favor hinterland regions with more preferential policies to spur
economic development, Sichuan province is becoming an increasingly
attractive investment destination for Hong Kong businesses.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has approved 2,375 Hong Kong-funded joint ventures
over the past few years, and latest statistics show that total
accumulated Hong Kong investment there hit 1.4 billion US
dollars. The figure is said to constitute 60 percent of all
overseas capital ever having entered the province.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investment has tended to be directed towards civil
construction, energy, transportation, food processing, chemicals
and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
An official with the province's foreign trade department said
that Sichuan's export to Hong Kong last year reached 520 million
US dollars, accounting for 24 percent of the total while import
from Hong Kong registered 250 million US dollars, 14 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, though abundant in natural and labor resources, is now
in great need of investment capital. Local officials said the
province should seek a reciprocal trade agreement with Hong Kong
so as to create a more sound economic mix here after the
handover.

<HEADLINE> Donated Funds Help Disabled People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The China Fund for the Disabled
(CFFD) received 25.7 million yuan in donations and much material
support from the Chinese public and friends abroad last year.
</P>
<P>
"The donations went a long way to help its 60 million disabled
people last year," Deng Pufang, fund director, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The fund was established in 1983 to promote the development of
undertakings for people with physical disabilities in China.
</P>
<P>
Deng told a meeting of the fund's board of directors in
Beijing, that CFFD spent 21.4 million yuan on rehabilitation
programs, education, employment, cultural and sports activities,
and the construction of basic facilities for the physically and
mentally disabled across the country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts last year, Deng said, 257,170 cataract
sufferers regained their sight; 51,365 polio victims or those
suffering from spinal or joint problems received successful
operations; and 13,420 deaf children participated in hearing and
speech programs."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted, more than 24 million newly married and
pregnant women and babies took liquid iodine to prevent mental
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Education for handicapped children has also improved, with 112
new special schools opened, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments provided jobs for 240,000 people with
physical disabilities last year and arranged training courses for
185,000 disabled people to learn skills of farming, animal
breeding and household handicrafts businesses.
</P>
<P>
"These achievements have gone far beyond expectations, Deng
said.
</P>
<P>
The fund's budget for implementing this year's plans will be 15
million yuan, said Han Sheng, secretary-general of the fund.
</P>
<P>
"After about 10 years' efforts, China's undertakings for the
disabled are now switching towards an approach of sustainable
development, despite a weak basis," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Disabled people are receiving more respect, understanding and
support from the public while many people with physical
disabilities have shown they are outstranding with their
achievement through unremitting efforts, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), worked out by the
Co-Ordination Committee for the Handicapped under the State
Council, will help the country's disabled people participate in
all aspects of social life.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic-language Publications Mushroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A minority like Ozbek, with just
more than 10,000 people in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
has its own books, teaching materials and other publications in
its own language.
</P>
<P>
Members do not need to bother reading other languages, thanks
to the fast development of publishing in ethnic languages.
</P>
<P>
Publication is also booming in more than 20 other ethnic
written materials, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
China is trying hard to publish more and better books for
ethnic people, according to the Third Ethnic Book Prize Giving
Ceremony yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic books publishing is an important part of the country's
publication career, the Beijing-based English paper quoted Yu
Youxian, director of the State Press and Publication
Administration, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), 57 kinds of ethnic
books have been listed as national key publications to be given
priority. It is more than double that in the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
To help solve financial difficulties facing ethnic language
books publication, the administration and State Ethnic Affairs
Commission last year set up the National Five Ethnic Books
Publication Fund.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, more than 150 publishing houses had
subscribed to donate more than 8.2 million yuan (1 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ten million yuan (1.2 million dollars) is expected by the end
of this year and the fund will be used then, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The country is increasing its investment in ethnic books
publication each year. In a market economy, ethnic books
publication, with small circulations, is severely challenged.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments' allocations and the new fund
will finance the publication of ethnic books.
</P>
<P>
In another development, ethnic language publication houses are
encouraged to explore international markets, as part of their
efforts to survive and develop.
</P>
<P>
In China, ethnic language books are not limited as they are for
general books. They also do not pay for bar codes and enjoy many
other priorities.

<HEADLINE> Sheringham Joins Manchester United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- English champions Manchester United
pulled off a huge surprise to the Premier soccer on Friday by
signing England striker Teddy Sheringham from Tottenham Hotspur.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham joined the European Cup semifinalists for a fee in
the region of 3.5 million pounds sterling ($5.8 million), which is
United's biggest close-season signing.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the 31-year-old forward, who has enjoyed a
successful partnership with Alan Shearer in the national team, is
believed to have given a huge boost to United for next season.
</P>
<P>
United now have a quality attacking player to replace Frenchman
Eric Cantona who recently announced his retirement from the game.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham had been at Tottenham since 1992. Ironically his
first match for United could be against the London club at White
Hart Lane on August 10 on the opening weekend of the Premier
league season.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Sails Further Despite Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Croatia secured its outing to the
second phase despite a 88-95 loss to Ukraine on Friday at the
European basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, one of the favorites to win the competition, avoided
an early exit only after Spain beat Germany 67-59 in the same
group.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was nevertheless eliminated, alongside Bosnia, Latvia
and Slovenia, all of whom finished bottom of their groups.
</P>
<P>
Spain won group D with three victories, while Germany, Ukraine
and Croatia finished level on points with one victory each, and
results of games between the teams were used to determine the
final standings.
</P>
<P>
With first-phase results also counting for the second phase,
the Croats will have to pull out all the stops to make it to the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
While the Croats have been disappointing, Spain and Greece have
both exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
The hosts were held by a tough German defence but eventually
found their touch from the three-point line to pull away.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tournament favourites Yugoslavia won a convincing 108-89
victory over Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Greece had surprised all by winning all their three opening
games in group A, including a cliff-hanger against Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
With just three tenths of a second on the clock, Greece's
Fragiskos Alvertis fired in a three-pointer to clinch the 78-76
victory.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Smooth Holding of Elections in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece today called for a smooth
holding of general elections in neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Greek Foreign Ministry late this
evening said that Athens believed that the smooth holding of
elections in Albania Sunday was "a fundamental prerequisite" in
promoting the democratic process, the achievement of political and
social stability, respect for human rights and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government hopes that the elections will lead to the
formation of a widely accepted government that will undertake
effectively the project of restoring the country," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Greece had taken specific and
fundamental measures to help Albania nationals in Greece,
including members of the ethnic Greek minority, travel to Albania
to vote.
</P>
<P>
Greece was prepared to continue its contribution in the future
to efforts by the Albanian people to establish a modern,
democratic society, it said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a seven-member interparty
parliamentary delegation left here for Tirana today to act as
observers in the forthcoming elections.

DAX-30 index closed at 3,795.41, down 9.88 points.
</P>

The French CAC-40 share index ended a touch weaker, retracing

<HEADLINE> IFC Signs 250 Mln Dlr Financing Accords With Czech Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today signed loan agreements totaling some 250
million U.S. dollars for Nova Hut, a.s., one of the Czech
Republic's principal steel producers.
</P>
<P>
The IFC financing, the largest ever arranged by the IFC in the
country, will help Nova Hut to embark on a comprehensive
modernization and environmental upgrade of its steel complex in
Ostrava, in the Moravia region of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nova Hut, which is in the process of being privatized, is one
of the first major Czech privatizations incorporating a
comprehensive investment program without a foreign strategic
investor. At present, it is an integrated steel company with an
annual production capacity of about 4 million tons of crude steel.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed by 2000 at a total cost
of some 650 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's financing package consists of a 75 million dollar
loan for the IFC's own account and a 175 million dollar syndicated
loan for a total of 17 international financial institutions from
Japan, Germany, Austria, South Korea, the U.S., France and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and the largest
multilateral source of equity and loan financing for private
projects in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Razali Says There Will Be No Political Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly
President Ismail Razali said today that there will be no political
statement from the week-long U.N. special session on sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
He said nevertheless the special session will adopt a final
document, to be known as Program for Further Implementation of
Agenda 21. Many issues will be contained in that document.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference near the end of the 19th U.N.
special session, which is designed to review the progress since
the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, President Razali acknowledged that
there are serious divisions between the 173 delegations on such
topics as financial targets for helping poor countries meet
environmental goals, greenhouse gases emission and protection of
forests, etc.
</P>
<P>
The failure to have a political statement "underlines how
difficult it is to capsulize issues in that context when over five
years we have not enough progress on some of the issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most industrial countries pledged at Rio to increase foreign
aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product, a goal on
the U.N. agenda since 1972. But aid has fallen to 0.25 percent,
especially in the United States.
</P>
<P>
On greenhouse gases reduction, the European Union proposed a
15 percent reduction in emission below the 1990 level by 2010.
The United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand want no
specific targets at this time. The final document will probably
call for "realistic targets" by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of forests, the United States, Brazil and India
opposed a treaty, preferring first to see existing agreement
enforced. Canada and the European Union, however, want the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Talks Fail to Ease Parade Tension in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The talks between rival parties in
Northern Ireland in a bid to reduce tensions have failed to
achieve their goal after an eight-hour discussion, a British
senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
"While we have not reached a resolution today, there are a
number of areas which I want to consider further," Britain's
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I shall do this and be in touch again with both sides early
next week," she added.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Roman Catholics and Protestant parade
organizers were held earlier today near the provincial capital
Belfast under the sponsorship of the British government. The
Catholics were strongly against the parade due to start on July 6
by the pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said they wanted a peaceful resolution to the
controversy over the parade in Portadown, a town where sectarian
tensions run high.
</P>
<P>
The Catholics blamed the Protestants for failing to reach
agreement Orange Order, saying it had refused to talk to them face
to face.
</P>
<P>
But the Protestants, who say their Portadown parade is a simple
demonstration of religious faith, issued a statement saying they
had put forward "responsible and accommodating principles which
respect the rights of everyone."
</P>
<P>
Britain fears that any trouble at the Portadown parade could
ignite violence across the province. A bloody clash erupted last
year during the parade season between the Roman Catholics and
Protestants.

WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
today denied a lawmaker's charge that it had a secret fund of 20
billion U.S. dollars for future weapons purchases.
</P>
<P>
Norm Dicks, a senior member of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, produced a summary sheet showing that the Pentagon
intends to use the "modernization reserve" fund from 2000 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
"This account is highly unusual, unlike any other contained in
prior budget submissions to Congress," said Dicks, who has served
for 20 years on the defense spending panel.
</P>
<P>
He said it "proves that the Pentagon was deceiving Congress
about the availability of out-year funding in its budget."
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any secret fund," said Susan Hansen, a Pentagon
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"It's public knowledge. The money has now been passed to the
services to include in their budget submissions," she added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sets Its Own Salmon Quotas After Talks Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
announced its own fishing plans for this year's Pacific salmon
fishery after the collapse of salmon talks with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the lack of an agreement with the U.S., it is
necessary now to move forward with management plans that will
conserve fish stocks and attend to the needs of our fishing
communities," said David Anderson, Canadian minister of fisheries
and oceans.
</P>
<P>
"Americans can no longer rely on Canada's good will to
accommodate their interests. It will not be business as usual,"
Anderson noted in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the quotas announced today, the total Canadian commercial
catch of all five species of salmon in 1997 is expected to be
nearly 24 million fish.
</P>
<P>
The potential Canadian catch of sockeye is expected to be 12
million, significantly higher than the 10-year (1983-94) average
of 9.9 million sockeye.
</P>
<P>
Canada estimates that over 18.2 million sockeye will return to
the Fraser River this year, the second highest return on record
since 1913.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Anderson stressed that conservation of salmon is Canada's
"top priority." He called on the United States to "fish
responsibly."
</P>
<P>
The latest round of talks between Canada and the U.S. broke
down last week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rejected Canada's final offer on salmon, which
included a reduced Canadian coho catch in return for a reduced
American sockeye catch.
</P>
<P>
Canada has said that it will push for third-party binding
arbitration to settle the dispute, the only option available after
the failure of several different processes.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. has been cool to the idea. An attempt at
non-binding arbitration collapsed two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not to Give Up Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
told a leading Hispanic group today that he refuses to give up on
affirmative action and wants to make sure the budget agreement
with Congress does not shortchange education.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in a satellite speech to the League of United Latin
American Citizens, said, "I'm not willing to give up on
affirmative action and education. I'm not about to give up on it,

policies we might implement to try to stop public higher education
in America from becoming resegregated."

<HEADLINE> US Congress Approves Huge Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate approved today
a tax cut plan of 135 billion dollars for the next five years, the
biggest tax cut in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The 80-18 vote in the U.S. Senate came a day after the U.S.
House of Representatives passed a similar tax-cut package by a
vote of 253-179.
</P>
<P>
The bill contains a total tax cut of 135 billion dollars that
are partially offset by 50 billion dollars of new revenue. And the
net tax cut for the next five years for American families will be
85 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 718-page bill passed in both the U.S. House and Senate
provides a 500-dollar tax credit for children under age 17, tax
breaks for education, a reduction in capital gains taxes, expanded
Individual Retirement Accounts and relief from estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
Roughly similar to the Senate version, the House bill departs
in significant areas, which will be the focus of still more
negotiations between Congress and the White House later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate also turned back today a move to further raise
cigarette taxes before the final vote, killing an amendment to add
23 cents more to the tax on a pack of cigarettes. The proposal
would have raised another 12 billion dollars for health coverage
for uninsured children from poor families.
</P>
<P>
A compromise version of the tax cut plan will be written by
House and Senate tax writers next month, and the final bill could
be sent to President Bill Clinton for his consideration by August.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Congress and the government on the tax cut
plan began almost immediately after the passage of the tax bill in
the U.S. House. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and White
House lobbyist John Hilley met privately with the main tax writer
in the House, Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, press secretary Mike McCurry has expressed
confidence that the talks will produce a final measure more to the
president's liking than either the Senate and House versions.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry said that if the administration's efforts fail,
President Clinton will veto legislation that blows a hole in the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic alternative to the bill approved by the
Republican-controlled Congress would extend the 500-dollar child
credit to millions of working families excluded in the Republican
plan because they had already taken the Earned Income Tax Credit,
which is aimed at helping the working poor. The Democratic plan
also offered narrower capital gains reductions and targeted them
to assist small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The tax cut initiative is one of the major part in the balanced
budget agreement reached earlier this year between the Clinton
administration and the U.S. Congress.
