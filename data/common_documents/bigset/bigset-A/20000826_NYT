 &HT;    AMWEST GROUNDING THREATENED(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By PETER CORBETT(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FAA ordered America West on Friday to prove it has completed
maintenance on a quarter of its fleet or the planes will be
grounded, agency officials say.
</P>
<P>
   America West has been given seven working days to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the audit and previous surveillance results, we
have serious concerns about America West's continuous airworthiness
maintenance program,'' said David Gillom, FAA flight standards
division manager in a letter to America West Chairman William
Franke.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA action is not unprecedented and is ``part of routine
surveillance to ensure the highest level of safety at the
airline,'' said Eliot Brenner, a senior Federal Aviation
Administration official in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The agency takes similar action regularly and has moved to
ground other airlines, he said, although they typically are smaller
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FAA has not taken action against any other airlines
as a result of safety audits of nine major carriers it launched
last month. Six of nine carriers have been reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Those safety audits came in response to a Jan. 31 Alaska
Airlines crash and a subsequent review of Alaska's aircraft
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the FAA letter, America West President Douglas
Parker said in a prepared statement that the company has completed
the maintenance checks and will be able to document it.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, Franke and other senior executives are in Montana on an
executive retreat and were unavailable for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, America West canceled seven flights on
Thursday to voluntarily pull nine Boeing 737 aircraft from service
to complete maintenance checks, company spokesman James Sabourin
said.
</P>
<P>
   America West's record keeping on its maintenance is one of the
key issues identified by the FAA, Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not been able to document that it has completed
airworthiness directives that require carriers to check on cracks
in critical aircraft parts such as engine mounts, Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   America West has to show that it has done the checks on 35 of
its 130 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA audit found no ``safety of flight issues'' that would
indicate the planes are unsafe, FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitalieri
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FAA doesn't ``consider this to be a minor issue,''
she said of the paperwork requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Proper record-keeping and maintenance oversight is important in
preventing accidents before they happen, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As with Alaska Airlines, America West has shown it doesn't have
the proper maintenance systems in place, Spitalieri said.
</P>
<P>
   Any move to ground a fourth of the fleet would cripple America
West at a time when it is trying to recover from chronic
reliability problems.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, hit with pilot contract negotiations and
weather-related delays, this summer has replaced America West as
the carrier with the worst on-time record but the Tempe-based
carrier has struggled with cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
   The compliance deadline for the required maintenance checks
falls on Sept. 6 after the busy Labor Day holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   America West has been under intense FAA scrutiny over its
troubled maintenance operation for well over two years. The FAA
fined the company $5 million in July 1998 for failing to conduct
required inspections and other maintenance-related issues. The fine
was later cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, the FAA's Gillom also cited concerns about
deferred maintenance and poor oversight of heavy maintenance
overhauls conducted by outside vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has clashed with America West on those issues for years.
In January the agency threatened to block the carrier from adding
aircraft to its fleet until it improved its maintenance practices.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials have also ordered America West to submit a
comprehensive action plan within a month for improving its
maintenance practices.

GIANTS FINISH THE PRESEASON WITHOUT TASTING A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ No matter
how big a lead the New York Giants might have late in a
regular-season game _ if they ever get such a lead _ do not be
surprised if coach Jim Fassel declines to remove his starters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday night at Giants Stadium, for the third time in four
preseason games, the Giants' reserves squandered a first-half lead
as the Giants concluded the preseason without a victory for the
first time in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens scored 24 second-half points to overcome a
10-point halftime deficit and win, 24-17. A 3-yard touchdown run by
Jason Brookins, against the Giants' second-team defense, gave
Baltimore its first lead of the game with 3 minutes 40 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive time in a preseason game between the
Ravens and Giants (0-4), Baltimore wide receiver Brandon Stokley
was a star. A year ago, Stokley scored a touchdown on the game's
final play, when Giants safety Lyle West went for an interception
and missed the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Stokley returned a punt 32 yards _ after the
Giants' Craig Walendy and Brandon Short appeared to have him
stopped for no gain _ to set up the game-winning score. He also
drew a pass-interference penalty against cornerback Emmanuel
McDaniel several plays before Brookins' touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's comeback eclipsed a 10-0 Giants halftime lead and a
7-0 lead that the Giants' starters held when they left just before
the first quarter ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' starters left with 1:37 to play in the first
quarter. In a limited appearance, quarterback Kerry Collins
completed 3 of 7 passes for 29 yards. The starters left with a 7-0
lead because of a 5-yard touchdown run by the rookie Ron Dayne, who
finished with 60 yards on 15 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne played the majority of the snaps with the first unit.
Although Tiki Barber started the game at running back, Dayne came
in after the first play. He had just 3 yards on his first rushing
attempt and 1 yard on his second.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Giants got the ball back for their second
possession, Dayne had four carries for 19 yards. It is also
apparent the Giants plan to put Dayne in situations where he makes
successive, multiple carries.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the Giants' second drive, Dayne carried on
first down for 5 yards, making a move to elude a tackler at the
line of scrimmage. He gained just 3 yards on second down on a good
run when there was no hole as he moved off right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   But on third-and-2, Dayne moved left, waiting for a hole
develop. And when he saw a gap, he cut back for 6 yards and the
first down.
</P>
<P>
   After Collins connected with wide receiver Ike Hilliard for a
long square out for a 20-yard gain that moved the Giants to the
Ravens' 5-yard line, Dayne took a pitch from Collins and moved
toward his right. Again, he waited for the hole to open, and cut
back to his left for a touchdown, going in almost untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown drive was set up by another big play by Barber,
who has had the best preseason of any Giants offensive player.
Barber caught a Baltimore punt on his 30-yard line. Seeing the
slimmest of openings in the middle of the Ravens' punt coverage,
Barber burst up the field. He made two cuts to escape tackles
before being brought down at the Baltimore 39-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and the Giants were in the game for a total of three
solid, if unspectacular, possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' first-string defense played far more dependably
FRiday night than it did against the Jets in the previous preseason
game. Cornerback Jason Sehorn was active in a variety of ways,
knocking Baltimore quarterback Tony Banks down on a blitz as Banks
was about to pass, forcing an incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   Later, defending Baltimore wide receiver Jermaine Lewis in
man-to-man coverage, Sehorn was in perfect position to slip around
him to bat down a pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' lone score of the second half was a 90-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown by the rookie Ron Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, the team's fourth receiver, who also had a spectacular
first-half reception, fielded the kickoff and slowly made his way
up the right sideline, waiting for his teammates blocking in front
of him. But when Dixon saw a narrow crease along the right
sideline, he bolted through with a burst of speed.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore was kicking to Dixon because it had just cut the
Giants' lead to 3 points on a 28-yard touchdown pass from the
rookie quarterback Chris Redman to the rookie wide receiver Germany
Thompson. On the third-quarter play, Tawambi Settles and Tinker
Keck, the Giants' rookie safeties, each missed a chance to tackle
Thompson, and so did the rookie linebacker Kevin Lewis.  &QL;

LAKERS TAKE A CHANCE ON RIDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Their roster depleted, their best efforts
to reload stymied, the Lakers grabbed the roulette wheel Friday and
gave it a hard spin. In a form of legalized gambling, they signed
up longtime problem child Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long-odds bet that won't offer a clear result for months.
But for now, it stands as a bold and intriguing stroke by the
defending NBA champions, who readily acknowledge the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Rider averages 18.1 points a game, but his seven-year career is
better known for drug-related arrests, clashes with teammates and
coaches, skipped practices, late arrivals, numerous suspensions and
thousands of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old guard makes the Lakers decidedly more athletic,
explosive and _ possibly _ combustible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it, obviously there's a great degree of
risk there,'' said Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak, who made
his first major move since taking over personnel decisions in early
August.
</P>
<P>
   But after several conversations with Rider, and a sit-down
session between Rider and coach Phil Jackson on Thursday, Kupchak
offered measured optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows where he is in this stage of his life. He needs a
situation where there can be a rebirth,'' Kupchak said. ``You know,
he's 29 years old. If you're gonna figure it out, now's the time to
do it. We're taking some risk, there's no doubt, and so is he,
which I think is a good start. We both have something to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, the risk is to the team psyche, but not to the
payroll. They signed Rider to a one-year, $736,000 contract _ the
minimum for a seven-year pro _ and the deal is only partially
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   If he behaves, it's an incredible bargain. If he reverts to old
habits _ the kind of things that forced the Atlanta Hawks to waive
him in March _ the Lakers lose nothing but their dignity.
</P>
<P>
   In a Lakers press release, Rider said he is ``looking forward to
a new start in my career, and I'm grateful to Mitch Kupchak, Phil
Jackson and (owner Jerry) Buss for having the faith in me to give
me this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are thrilled to finally add some talent to a roster
in need of depth. So far this summer, they have been rebuffed by
free agents Kendall Gill and John Amaechi and have watched
potential trades for Christian Laettner, Toni Kukoc, Anthony Mason
and Cedric Ceballos fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Rider, perennially one of the top shooting guards in the league,
was being pursued by the Miami Heat, who were reportedly offering
their $2.25 million salary-cap exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid turned down a lot more money to come here ... which
says something for him,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his past, including a conviction for marijuana possession
and a penchant for tardiness, Kupchak said, ``Certainly, it's
something that was discussed and thought long and hard about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Laker fans who suffered through the failed Dennis Rodman
experiment in 1999, the signing is sure to elicit chills. But it's
not a clean analogy, and Kupchak drew distinctions between the two
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman joined a young team still reeling from a slow start, a
major trade and a coaching change during a shortened 50-game
season. Now the Lakers are older, with influential veterans in the
locker room and an unflappable coach at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with what we accomplished this past year there's a
certain confidence and tolerance that players have by winning a
championship,'' Kupchak said, ``and I don't think they'll let
anybody come in and disrupt that. I really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The team envisions Rider, who can also play small forward, as a
much-needed scorer off the bench. But he could start in the
backcourt, with Kobe Bryant shifting to small forward to replace
free agent Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more versatile now,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the last man to give up on Rider sounded supportive on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Isaiah personally, and I hope it works out for him,''
Hawks GM Pete Babcock said. ``It didn't work out for him here. ...
And if you asked him, I'm sure we probably failed him just as much
as he failed us.'' &QL;

YANKEES FALL AS TORRE ALLOWS TIME FOR THE INJURED TO HEAL 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Bernie Williams raised a ball in his right
hand and, slowly at first, drew his arm forward, making a very
short throw about 90 minutes before Friday night's 8-1 loss to the
Oakland Athletics. The throws gradually lengthened, Williams always
moving carefully and stiffly, as if he were trying to balance a
plate on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has a strained muscle in his right side, and he is
proceeding cautiously, as are the other Yankees nursing injuries.
Williams could have probably started Friday night's game; same with
Paul O'Neill, the veteran right fielder. Both were out of the
lineup, again. Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, was
knocked out of his first injury rehabilitation game in Florida
Friday night when he was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a scary time of year for me,'' Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, said, ``because if anything major happens, I don't know if
we can get it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who has decided to try to play despite the pain in
his right elbow, started for Single-A Tampa against Kissimmee. As
he led off the fourth inning, he was hit by a pitch on the outside
of his left knee. The injury is not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, somehow, I can shake this off and play tomorrow,
but I don't know if they're going to want me to,'' Knoblauch told
The Associated Press. ``I've been thumped a thousand times and I've
never been hit in this spot. It was weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just starting to feel in the groove; it was going good.
This is how my year has been, exactly right here to a T. There's
nothing I can do but laugh about it. It was going in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre spoke Thursday with Knoblauch, who has tendinitis in his
right elbow. Knoblauch told Torre that he was still in pain. Torre
told Knoblauch once again how important he is to the team _
Knoblauch is an exceptional leadoff hitter _ and Knoblauch's status
seems to have come down to this: Can he play second base with the
pain? ``We're going to find that out,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Knoblauch said he was ready to play the rest of
the season with the pain that has bothered him since he initially
hurt the elbow July 24. ``I'm resigned to the fact that it's not
going to be healthy,'' he said. ``I'm trying to see if I can play
through it. I'll find out throughout these games.''
</P>
<P>
   If Knoblauch cannot play second base, his role will be far more
limited, as a part-time designated hitter, a pinch-hitter and a
pinch-runner, and Torre will probably use Luis Sojo and Jose
Vizcaino at second into the postseason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little more than five weeks remain until the playoffs begin, and
Torre wants to do everything he can to ensure that Williams,
O'Neill, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza
will be healthy for the postseason. If the Boston Red Sox were
running neck and neck with the Yankees, then perhaps Torre would be
forced to deal with the injuries a little differently. If the
Yankees needed to win every single game, then perhaps Williams and
O'Neill would have started Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' lead over Boston is three games, and Torre is
being cautious _ especially since the Oakland Coliseum outfield was
torn up during the Oakland Raiders' exhibition football game
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams took batting practice Tuesday and felt good swinging
from the right side of the plate, but he could still feel twinges
of pain while batting left-handed. His workout Friday evening was
more strenuous: Williams played catch, took some fly balls and
swung aggressively right-handed but gingerly left-handed. He came
off the field with his right thumb raised. ``I feel good,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees faced the right-hander Kevin Appier Friday night and
they will face the left-hander Mark Mulder on Saturday. There was a
chance Williams would start, as a right-handed batter, on Saturday.
But Torre said he doubted Williams would play this weekend; if
Williams does, his at-bats would probably come as a right-handed
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who has a hip pointer, lobbied extensively to be in the
lineup Friday night, telling Torre that he felt well enough to
play. ``I almost gave in,'' Torre said. ``But it's probably the
safe thing to do'' to hold him out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill will probably not play Saturday either, Torre said,
because Mulder is pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who is coming back from tendinitis in his right
shoulder, is set to throw again Saturday and start working off a
mound Sept. 3. The Yankees remain hopeful that Mendoza can rejoin
the team sometime in the middle of September and perhaps have
enough time to regain his command before the playoffs. ``He feels
good and he's moving forward,'' said Brian Cashman, the Yankees'
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   But as Torre looks ahead, he is not counting on Mendoza's
presence in the bullpen, because of the slow progress of Mendoza's
rehabilitation. ``In my mind, it'll be a bonus if we get him
back,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that happens, Torre will need another pitcher to fill
that crucial middle relief role in October. Jason Grimsley
struggled in July and into August but has pitched effectively in
his last two outings _ a significant development, Torre agreed.
Dwight Gooden has also been pitching in middle relief, but Torre
said he would not ask Gooden to fill a daily role because Gooden is
not accustomed to being asked to warm up quickly; he has been a
starting pitcher his entire career.  &QL;

 THIRD PARTY PIPE DREAMERS KEEP THEIR FAITH  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hope springs eternal, and when it comes to optimism, most
politicians could put Pollyanna to shame; but still, there should
be some limits.
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan accepted his share of the Reform Party nomination
in Long Beach earlier this month, he talked about what he was going
to do when he took the oath of office as president in January.
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin, the other Reform Party nominee, talks about the
changes his administration will make to the national scene. Ralph
Nader, the candidate of the Green Party, is already planning to get
rid of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash for Buchanan, Hagelin, Nader and the other
96 or so candidates who have filed to run for president: You're not
going to win. None of you.
</P>
<P>
   That's not something any politician wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming we don't win the White House ...'' is how Hagelin
answered a question about the goals of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter suggested that Al Gore or George Bush is going
to be the president-elect on Nov. 8, Nader was even blunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I neither accept your suggestion nor share your
clairvoyance,'' he said frostily.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that either candidate needs to be taught the facts of
life. Four years ago, Nader pulled a whopping 0.71 percent of the
presidential vote. Hagelin, running under the Natural Law Party
banner, had 0.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While third party candidates everywhere insist this year will be
different, they're running against the tide of history.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot, spending millions of his own money, took 19 percent
of the popular vote in 1992, but didn't pull one of the 270
electoral votes he would have needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   The last third party candidate to win a state was George Wallace
of the American Independent Party in 1968, when he virtually swept
the South, taking 13.5 percent of the national vote and 46
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Strom Thurmond, running for the segregationist States Right
Party in 1948, grabbed 39 electoral votes, also in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The only third party candidate to finish ahead of a Democrat or
Republican in a presidential race last century was Theodore
Roosevelt, running for the Progressive Party in 1912. He pulled 27
percent of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes to finish ahead
of incumbent President William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Roosevelt wasn't exactly a novice. He'd served almost
two full terms as president and handpicked Taft as his replacement
in 1908. Even so, he still lost to the Democrat, Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean third party efforts are useless, however. They
can serve as lightning rods for grievances against the two major
parties and the political system, and they also provide a forum for
issues the big guys have ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason a coalition of third parties this year plans
to turn a list of their ideas and issues over to both Bush and
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to present our platforms to the major parties and
tell them `Please, rip us off,' '' Hagelin said.
</P>
<P>
   Vandals struck Democratic Party headquarters in Chico, Calif.,
this week with a sobering reminder that hate groups are active in
California. They defaced the offices with anti-Semitic graffiti
just one week after Democratic Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
who is Jewish, was officially introduced to the country as Gore's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Chico Democratic workers were horrified to find scrawled
markings that said ``No Jew in the White House'' on the walls of
the offices, which had been left unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anger'' about the incident, said Democratic
campaign adviser Bob Mulholland, who lives in Chico.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland said the existence of hate groups and white
supremacist groups in Northern California has been documented _ but
none are specifically known to be headquartered in Chico.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this could happen anywhere,'' Mulholland said. While it's
``a tragic reminder'' of what Lieberman may face in the coming
campaign, he said, ``we believe it's an isolated case.''
</P>
<P>
   Headline writers went nuts when it was widely reported that
Lieberman was the first Jewish candidate on a presidential ticket
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Were they wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A scan of the biography of Ralph Nader's Harvard-educated,
journalist-author running mate, Winona LaDuke, notes that her
mother is a Russian Jewish art professor. Among Orthodox and
Conservative Jews, that means LaDuke is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   But the Green vice presidential candidate has for years
emphasized her credentials as ``a Native American activist and
author.'' Her biographical materials list her as an enrolled member
of the Mississippi Band of the White Earth Anishinaabeg and a
member of the Ojibwe tribe, who lives with her three children on
the White Earth reservation in northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   LaDuke's father, a former Hollywood bit actor, is described as a
Native American activist, and she has said she was influenced by
him. She became active in Native American causes during her stint
at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who is himself Lebanese American, was asked this week if
he had beaten Gore to the punch on naming a Jewish vice
presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's half Jewish'' _ and fully committed to Native American
causes, Nader replied.

REPUBLICANS RELEASE ATTACK AD AGAINST GORE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ark. Del. La., Mich., Mo., Ohio, Pa., Wash., Wis.) (SUBS with more description from ad, new headline) 
By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Two days after canceling one advertisement that
attacked Vice President Al Gore on his trustworthiness, the
Republicans Friday released another that sharply criticizes Gore's
plan for a prescription drug benefit for older Americans. It is the
first attack commercial of the post-convention campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is spending $7 million to
broadcast the 30-second advertisement in nine states beginning
Monday. The sum is a huge one this early, and it underscores how
urgently the Republicans believe they need to counter Gore's surge
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the party prepares to run the commercial, the campaign
of Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, is distancing
itself from it by buying its own commercial on the subject but
without the comparison to Gore's plan or the suggestion that Gore's
plan is bad for older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The party commercial says in part: ``And Al Gore? Gore opposed
bipartisan reform. He's pushing a big-government plan that lets
Washington bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe.
The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats decide. The Bush
Prescription Plan: Seniors choose.''
</P>
<P>
   While the narrator says that Gore opposed reform, the commercial
shows Gore speaking in the White House briefing room, gesturing
defensively. The implication is that the the vice president is
explaining his opposition to the Bipartisan Medicare Commission,
but the image is strikingly similar to that of his news conference
two years ago when he said seven times that there was ``no
controlling legal authority'' over whether he raised money from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said that the commercial was
misleading because Bush had not offered a specific prescription
drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zip, zero, nada, nothing,'' Lehane said, adding that the
commercial seemed to be a defensive move.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists acknowledged that Gore had gained ground
with his constant discussion of prescription drugs and said that
the party hoped at least to neutralize his success on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we neutralize it, we can go back to our issues of
character, integrity and leadership,'' one strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed little concern among Republican officials that the
party would be branded as the first to go negative in what has
rapidly become the opening round of the fall campaign. Their real
concern is that Gore has successfully pivoted into the fall
campaign by discussing an issue voters care about.
</P>
<P>
   And with that pivot, Gore, after months of stasis, began setting
the campaign agenda at a time when the Bush campaign has appeared
off-course. Republicans have been watching Gore's favorable rating
rise in polls and his unfavorable rating fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Wednesday canceled a commercial that had been sent out
to 350 television stations. It used excerpts from an interview with
Gore from six years ago in which he said that President Clinton had
never lied. The ambivalence over the commercial reflected a debate
on how negative Bush should go against Gore and how soon.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the new commercial effectively answers that
question, for now. The party and the campaign want to erode Gore's
success; putting the attack in the mouth of an anonymous narrator
in a commercial paid for by the party allows Bush to claim the high
road but still get the message across.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, Bush says: ``Every senior will have access to
prescription drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the issues on which he has had an advantage
over us,'' one Republican strategist said of Gore. ``This is a
recognition that Gore has gotten people talking about this issue
and it ranks in the double-digits with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he favors prescription drug coverage for those on
Medicare. But he has not set any money aside for it. Gore has
earmarked $253 billion over 10 years for providing prescription
drugs through Medicare. Bush has said that Medicare should cover
the entire cost of health care, including the cost of drugs, for
low-income older Americans, but the Gore campaign says that this
excludes too many people.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is intended for undecided voters, which means it
has to run several times before the message sinks in. It is to run
in Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS CONVICTIONS IN INSIDER TRADING 
 CASE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BILL WALLACE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal appeals court overturned Friday the
convictions of two former executives at California Micro Devices
charged with insider trading in the first major securities fraud
case prosecuted in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cal Micro executives Steven J. Henke and Chan Desaigoudar
now face a new trial in U.S. District Court for allegedly
defrauding stockholders of the Milpitas, Calif.,
computer-components manufacturing firm of more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco found
that U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker had forced Henke and
Desaigoudar to stand trial despite a ``disqualifying conflict of
interest'' that jeopardized the defendants' right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel also declined to rule Friday on U.S. Attorney
Robert Mueller's cross-appeal challenging the sentences the men
received, saying their sentences no longer matter because the
entire case must be retried.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, three of Cal Micro Devices' top officers were indicted
on fraud and insider trading charges.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were accused of booking millions of dollars in
revenue for products that had never been shipped,
double-bookkeeping and illegal write-offs. At the same time, Henke
and Desaigoudar dumped more than $1 million of their own stock in
the company before the price collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   One of three executives, former President Surenda Gupta, later
agreed to plead guilty and to testify against his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   When Desaigoudar and Henke came to trial, Gupta's lawyers sent a
letter to the attorneys representing Henke and Desaigoudar,
informing them that if they revealed contradictory statements Gupta
had made during defense meetings, it would violate a
confidentiality agreement covering all members of the defense team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware of no legal basis upon which you have any right
to breach this privilege,'' the letter said. `(We will pursue) all
appropriate legal remedies for any unauthorized breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conflict of interest, Walker refused to let Henke
and Desaigoudar's lawyers withdraw. When Gupta began his testimony
against the two defendants, their lawyers could not cross-examine
him for fear their questions would compromise privileged
information.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13-page appellate decision filed Friday, the court said
Walker was wrong and should have acknowledged the conflict and
acted to resolve it by allowing new counsel to assume the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few aspects of our criminal justice system are more vital to
the assurance of fairness than the right to be defended by counsel,
and this means counsel not burdened by a conflict of interest,''
the Court of Appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could have far-reaching consequences in other major
criminal cases, including those involving white collar crime,
according to Jerrold Ladar, a former federal prosecutor who is now
a prominent local defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joint defense agreements are very common in these kinds of
cases,'' he said. ``Defendants sometimes agree to testify just to
get themselves off. In that case, the other lawyers in a joint
defense agreement are stuck with a real problem cross examining
them without divulging privileged information.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, Ladar said, the court's opinion will force trial
judges to proceed cautiously when defense counsel tell them they
are hamstrung by conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco did not respond to a
request for comment on Friday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling is the second time this week that the Ninth
Circuit rapped Walker for errors.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the appeals court ruled that Walker erroneously
found Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin Harris had violated state
professional ethics rules when she questioned a corporate
whistle-blower in 1997 without allowing an attorney for the
corporation to be present.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the appeals panel said Walker's action, if
unchallenged, would allow prosecutorial codes of ethics ``to
protect corporate officers who would suborn perjury by their
employees.''

TWO FAMILIAR FACES VISIT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There were two familiar faces at Edison Field
on Friday night. They were faces that haven't been around much this
season but faces that are also among the organization's all-time
most popular players.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley and Gary DiSarcina were here for different reasons.
Finley, who was honored before the game for being voted onto the
organization's all-time team, is here with his new team, the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, recovering from shoulder surgery, was asked by Angels
manager Mike Scioscia to stop by and say hello. DiSarcina has been
rehabilitating the shoulder at a Newport Beach, Calif., clinic and
hasn't seen his teammates since early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Finley saw his likeness on the outfield fence and quipped: ``I
guess they got my check.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, the Angels' starting shortstop since 1992, doesn't
want to move on. But his contract runs out after this season, the
club holding a $3.45 million option.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a heartbeat,'' DiSarcina replied when asked if he wants to
come back next season. ``I miss the opportunity to play for Mike. I
had an opportunity in spring training for a short time, but I'd
like to have redemption and do it again. I want to play here. I've
played my whole career here and I want to finish here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're hurt going into your option year, you're at
their mercy,'' he said. ``They don't owe me anything. ... I've come
to a point in my career where it's not about money. If I can't
contribute, why come back at all?''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina had surgery to repair a small tear in his rotator cuff
three months ago. He has no pain and is now at the stage in which
he is rebuilding strength. He hopes to begin throwing in the next
two months. Lately, he's been doing a lot of running to stay in
shape, a monotonous task, but he hasn't lost his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning to run the Boston Marathon,'' he joked. ``And
next week, I'm moving to Kenya.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying away from the club for the past few months has been
``mental therapy,'' DiSarcina says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't play, you don't want to be dead weight, you don't
want to be in people's way,'' he said. ``Stay away and take care of
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, though, said he wants DiSarcina around more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him `We want to see you out here, you're a part of
this,''' Scioscia said. ``I've been there. It's frustrating when
you know you can't contribute and a lot was expected from you. But
I wanted to extend from our side _ the coaches and the players _ he
would be welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina said he has watched every Angels game that has been on
television. ``It's a fun team to watch,'' he said. ``I've become
more of a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his status with the club next year is in the hands
of management, he said he's noticed that a long-term replacement
has not yet been acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get Alex Rodriguez, and they didn't trade for Mike
Bordick,'' he said. ``They got Kevin (Stocker), but they didn't
sign anybody long term.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Closer Troy Percival is expected to be activated
from the disabled list today. ... Newly acquired pitcher Scott Karl
threw seven scoreless innings for Single-A Lake Elsinore on
Thursday night and is expected to join the Angels in time to start
next Tuesday's game against Toronto. ... Darin Erstad's
first-inning single Friday night was hit No.190 for the season,
setting the Angels' all-time, single-season record for a
left-handed hitter. Garret Anderson had held the mark of 189, his
1997 total. &QL;

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Gov. George W. Bush charged Friday that the Clinton
administration had neglected Latin America, pledged to put those
countries at the center of his foreign policy priorities and
outlined a way of thinking about the region that placed it on a par
with U.S. interests in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks at Florida International University in
Miami, a venue chosen by his campaign for its cultural, ethnic and
immigrant links to Latin America, as part of an indictment of the
administration, which he said had pursued an aimless strategy in
Latin America of ``summits without substance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speech also dwelt on Bush's sense of the importance of
the region to the United States in an unusually lengthy and
vigorous way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future cannot be separated from the future of Latin
America,'' Bush said. ``Should I become the president, I will look
south not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who ignore Latin America do not fully understand America
itself,'' he said. ``And those who ignore our hemisphere do not
fully understand American interests. This country was right to be
concerned about a country like Kosovo, for example, but there are
more refugees of conflict in Colombia. America is right to be
concerned about Kuwait, but more of our oil comes from Venezuela.
America is right to welcome trade with China, but we export nearly
as much to Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that President Clinton had ``dropped the ball''
on trade, failing to build on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which Clinton inherited from President Bush and then
pushed through Congress, with a broader free-trade zone throughout
the hemisphere. And he complained that Clinton had not obtained
so-called fast-track negotiating authority from Congress to
conclude further trade pacts with individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, proposed a few new
programs to help countries in Latin America and protect the
interests of the United States, but they involved relatively small
amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   He called for an extra $100 million a year in small-business
loans to Latin American entrepreneurs; an additional $100 million a
year in debt forgiveness for countries that took steps to protect
tropical forests; an American Fellows program that would encourage
people from Latin America to work in U.S. government agencies, and
the designation of a counselor at each U.S. Embassy in Latin
America who would encourage charitable activities by U.S.
organizations and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about helping to train law enforcement officials
and judges in Latin America, and providing countries there with
more help in fighting the production and export of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed most interested in simply making clear his
philosophy and priorities. After the speech, Bush traveled to
Richardson, Texas, near Dallas, for a private meeting with Vicente
Fox , the president-elect of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Both the speech and the subsequent meeting with Fox allowed the
Texas governor, whose lack of expertise on foreign policy has been
highlighted by several verbal gaffes and challenged by Vice
President Al Gore, to cast himself as a statesman engaged in the
affairs of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He and Fox followed their meeting with a news conference at
which they exchanged gifts _Fox got a Stetson-style hat that he
called a sombrero while Bush received cowboy boots _ and Bush
reiterated a pledge from his speech that if he is elected
president, he will arrange a summit meeting with Fox in November,
before either man is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said at the news conference that this would signal his
belief that the relationship between the United States and Mexico
was one ``of the most importance.'' Bush had said earlier, in his
speech, that he wanted Mexico to have as close and special a
relationship with the United States as Canada and Britain do.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks and events Friday also carried a potential
political advantage. The Republican nominee has been trying hard to
woo the votes of Hispanics, and their support for him could
determine whether he wins some of the states with the most
electoral votes, like Florida, where Gore has recently mounted an
aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appealed directly to Cuban-Americans in southern Florida
with a strongly worded vow in his address, titled ``Century of the
Americas.'' He promised not to ease current economic sanctions
against Cuba unless its leader, Fidel Castro, instituted democratic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My word to you, Mr. Castro: Let your people live in freedom,''
Bush said, drawing perhaps his loudest ovation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The speech and the conversation with Fox, who met the day before
with Clinton and, separately, Gore, came at the end of one of the
rockiest weeks in Bush's campaign since the Republican primaries.
And there was something undeniably unusual about the governor
turning to the arena of international affairs as he sought to
regain his balance.
</P>
<P>
   But his advisers said that the speech was scheduled weeks ago,
and they noted that unlike several of Bush's previous addresses on
international affairs, this one allowed Bush to claim some
firsthand knowledge of the subject, given that Texas and Mexico
share a border. Bush, for example, had met Fox at least two times
before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said
that Bush was clearly not prepared to represent the United States
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this week,'' Hattaway said, ``he criticized our own
military readiness, and his record as governor consists mostly of
ribbon cuttings for new bridges to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aides to Gore said that Bush's remarks ignored many of the
administration's successful efforts in Latin America. They noted
that NAFTA, which opened trade between the United States, Mexico
and Canada, was signed into law by President Clinton in 1994. They
also drew attention to the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which
promoted trade among those islands, and what they described as
successful efforts to curb or end violence in Ecuador, Peru and
Guatemala and to provide financial aid to Mexico and Brazil at
crucial times.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, Clinton's absence of fast-track authority
to negotiate trade agreements without amendments by federal
legislators was the result a Republican-controlled Congress that
would not give it to him. At the time, in addition to Republican
opposition, some congressional Democrats also opposed the
legislation for fear of alienating labor constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Condoleezza Rice, Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, said
that Clinton nonetheless warranted blame, because it was his
responsibility ``to state an agenda and persuade and cajole people
to follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't seem halfhearted about it,'' Rice added, implying
that Clinton had.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Bush's comparison of Kosovo and Colombia was not
an argument against military intervention in the former place or
for such intervention in the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she said, it was an expression of Bush's philosophy that
``you start with strong neighbors and reach out from there.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Bush both said that the Clinton administration's recent
approval of extra aid to Colombia for a fight against drugs and
political corruption was the right course of action.
</P>
<P>
   In previous foreign-policy speeches and remarks on the campaign
trail, Bush has identified many areas of the world as especially
important to the United States, including the Far East, the Middle
East and Russia. And nothing in his remarks Friday suggested he was
lifting Latin America high above those.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few densely populated continents that Bush has not
flagged as a priority is Africa, which has been discussed much more
extensively by his rival, Gore. Like Clinton, however, neither Bush
nor Gore has suggested that they would change the U.S. position
that there is no strategic interest in Africa that would warrant
either military intervention or major economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rice, in interviews with reporters, and Bush, in the
address itself, said that what the Clinton administration _ Bush
called it the Clinton-Gore administration _ had essentially failed
to do was perpetuate and extend the strides in peace, democracy and
trade that were well under way in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That happened to be when Bush's father, in the last full year of
his presidency, lost his re-election bid to Clinton. Rice worked as
a Russia expert on the National Security Council under President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that while Clinton signed NAFTA, ``I think the Bush
administration laid the groundwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the situation when his father, whom he did not
actually name, left office, Bush said, ``The promise of that moment
has been squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the drug traffic in Latin America was too
heavy, the disparities in wealth were too severe and there were too
many ``vast, urban slums where children scramble for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said both his speech and at the news conference with Fox
that he believed the border between the United States and Mexico
needed to be vigorously enforced, but that it must be done ``in a
human fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has called for a more open border, and Bush said the men had
discussed that issue, but the Texas governor dwelled on their
common belief that Mexico was a country and economy on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``His victory sends a strong signal of reform and modernization
in Mexico,'' Bush said of Fox's election.

 PHONY PRESS RELEASE TRIGGERS 60 PERCENT DROP IN COMPANY'S STOCK  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Panicked investors got duped big time Friday when the stock of
Emulex, which makes networking gear, plunged 60 percent after a
phony press release suggested the company teetered on the edge of
ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax, which for a few hours wiped out more than $2 billion
in market value, was one of the most brazen in stock-market
history. It vividly demonstrated the hair-trigger trading culture
that has taken hold of the stock market during one its most bullish
periods.
</P>
<P>
   The spurious release, which falsely reported financial reversals
and the resignation of Emulex's chief executive, hit the wires at
6:30 a.m. Pacific time, distributed by an obscure wire service
called Internet Wire. The news caused the company's stock to lose
almost two-thirds of its value in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Such stomach-churning moves based on bogus information have
taken place several times in recent years as scam artists have
tried to take advantage of the ability to move information
instantly around the world in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lucent Technologies temporarily lost about $7
billion of market value on March 30 after a day-trader posted a
fake profit warning on a Yahoo! Internet message board.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, as the market was opening, thousands of
institutional and individual investors were scanning Internet
business news services looking for trading tips.
</P>
<P>
   The crudely worded release claimed a sensational series of
developments at Emulex, a Southern California high tech company
that has gained an enthusiastic following.
</P>
<P>
   The release said the company had revised its fourth-quarter
earnings report from a profit to a loss. It went on to say that the
chief executive had resigned and that the company was under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   This bogus information _ which Internet Wire executives say
evidently came from someone posing as an Emulex publicist _ was
picked up and relayed by such leading business-news disseminators
as Bloomberg News and Dow Jones News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Those organizations, which failed to verify the negative
information before sending it out to subscribers, were still wiping
egg off their collective faces long after the market closed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Emulex's stock, which had closed Thursday on Nasdaq at $113.06,
skidded to $43 within minutes. Nasdaq authorities then temporarily
halted trading in the stock _ something it often does when a
stock's price goes haywire.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8 a.m., Emulex, which is based in Costa Mesa,
issued a statement categorically denying ``the negative statements
in this fictitious press release.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came from Paul Folino, the company's president and
chief executive, whose supposed resignation the hoaxster had
greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the stock resumed at 10:30 a.m. _ at which point the
stock zoomed to $120. It closed for the day down $7.31 at $105.75,
with 11.2 million shares changing hands _ five times the company's
normal volume.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that many traders were panicked into selling a
$100-plus stock at prices below half that level.
</P>
<P>
   They may never get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent,
said it won't cancel any of Friday's Emulex trades.
</P>
<P>
   NASD spokesman Wayne Lee suggested that investors who got burned
might be able to persuade their brokers to grant refunds.
</P>
<P>
   However, two prominent brokers say that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the trades will be broken,'' said Mike Dunn, a
spokesman for Datek Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any trade that came in prior to the halt stands as a good
trade,'' said Donna Kush, spokeswoman for Ameritrade.
</P>
<P>
   Burned traders conceivably could sue the perpetrator of the
hoax, if he or she is ever found.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, National
Association of Securities Dealers and the U.S. Attorney's office in
New York all have started investigations.
</P>
<P>
   So has the Chicago Board Options Exchange, where Emulex put and
call options are traded. The volume in those options _ which give
investors the right to buy or sell Emulex shares at a fixed price
before a fixed deadline _ soared to more than 11,000 contracts
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That is about 300 times normal daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Board officials are looking into the possibility that
someone who was wise to the hoax bought put options _ giving them
the right to sell Emulex stock at a high price _ before the false
news circulated.
</P>
<P>
   When a stock falls as far as Emulex did Friday, buyers of put
options can make profits as great as 20,000 percent and more in a
single day.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Compton, a spokesman for the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, said Friday that trading records ultimately will enable
the exchange to identify every buyer of every Emulex option for the
past day or two.
</P>
<P>
   The news agencies are under tremendous pressure to put out
market moving news before their rivals, which leaves little time to
check the accuracy of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Winkler, editor in chief of Bloomberg News, one of the most
closely watched business wires, said a reporter tried to verify the
bad news about Emulex before it was passed along to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company didn't answer its phones when we called,'' Winkler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg put out a story saying that Emulex stock was down
because of the damaging press release.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Winkler said, such a story would have carried a
disclaimer, indicating that the company could not be reached to
verify the release. But the disclaimer was unaccountably omitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to know who made the decision,'' Winkler
says. ``I'm not going to shoot anybody _ the only person who needs
to be shot is me. I'm wearing a hair shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   CBSMarketwatch.com, a leading online business-news service,
handled the bogus Emulex disclosure more meticulously.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Callaway, executive editor, said the release from Internet
Wire appeared in its raw form on his Web site around 6:30 a.m. He
said it was fed there automatically by Comtex, a New York news
network that serves many major online media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not publish a story based on the release,'' Callaway
stressed. Instead, a CBSMarketwatch editor e-mailed it to two
members of the reporting staff.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters wrote a story indicating that Emulex stock was
falling, and attributing that to the news release. But Callaway
said they pointedly stated that Emulex officials couldn't be
reached for comment.

FOR FIREFIGHTERS, IT'S BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 12th graf with Clinton order for 2,000 reinforcements)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHALLIS, Idaho _ They head out before dawn and trudge home after
dark, weary and covered in soot, still clutching the shovels and
axes that are their weapons. They sleep as many as 21 to a tent, in
makeshift camps pitched beneath smoky, lung-choking skies.
</P>
<P>
   That is how thousands of firefighters across the West have spent
summer 2000, a season so devastating that commanders say they
cannot help but view it as a war.
</P>
<P>
   Others are beginning to view it that way, too. In fact, the
United Services Organization, best known for organizing shows to
entertain U.S. troops overseas, has now come to this remote corner
of Idaho. With three former beauty queens dressed in red, white and
blue micro-mini-dresses and 4-inch heals cooing and flirting from a
flatbed truck, the scene along the Salmon River Thursday night
brought a taste of the 1950s to an audience that anywhere else
would call itself part of the Internet generation. It may have been
the most surreal moment in a summer in which fire has drawn people
of all stripes from all around the country to the most isolated of
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural disaster in the United States,'' said
Victoria Reed, a former Miss Maine and leader of the USO troupe,
``and it's important that the USO is here, because that's been our
mission since 1941 _ to entertain the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Craig Smith, 29, a marine from Birmingham, Ala., last saw a
USO show on a tour that took him to Japan, and he was among those
bug-eyed at what fortune had brought to the fire camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely something new,'' said Smith, , who had
never before set foot near Idaho. Even now, he said, ``I've been to
more countries than states.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is among some 1,700 men and a handful of women in eastern
Idaho battling the largest of dozens of major fires burning across
the western United States. His co-workers include paramedics from
Tennessee, high-school dropouts from California, and federal
land-managers from all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After working 16-hour days on end, this group found itself
gawking on Wednesday and Thursday nights at the performers from the
USO, an organization whose past tours have almost always been
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our missions are primarily to remote and isolated places, and
there aren't too many places in the United States that qualify,''
said James Pearcy, the USO's director of entertainment. ``But I
guess sleeping on the ground for 30 days in a fire zone in the
middle of nowhere would have to count.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Reed, , and including Erin Wheatley, Miss Arkansas of
1998, and Stacy Turner of Texas, the New York-based troupe
performed a medley of oldies that included everything from
``America the Beautiful'' to ``All My Loving'' and was punctuated,
in strutting, pinup-girl style, with the planting of many
lipstick-red kisses on the blushing but willing cheeks of young
marines and firefighters.. Those singled out for attention were
taunted by their buddies who found themselves singled out in turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a year!'' John Wallace, 23, a contract worker from Tule
Lake, Calif., said in disbelief, commenting not only on the
performance but also on the record paychecks that have resulted
from the record fire damage. ``I'm planning on living through the
winter off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, well over 25,000 men and women are involved in the
firefighting, including what will soon number more than 4,000
military personnel from the Army, Marines and the National Guard,
in an operation whose cost is estimated at $15 million a day. But
with 1.4 million acres still burning in the West, the current force
is not nearly sufficient, federal officials say. President Clinton
Friday ordered up to 2,000 employees of the Interior and
Agriculture departments to help supervise efforts to fight the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   So federal officials have said there is little they can do to
fight many of the blazes. From fire camps like this one, the main
effort has been focused far from the flames, in efforts to
safeguard houses from danger and to make sure that the danger has
passed in areas where fires have already burned through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources have just run dry all over the country, and so
we've had to back off to wider lines,'' said Bill Cyr, 48, an
engineer with the Los Angeles Country Fire Department who since
Aug. 5 has bunked down under a yellow-tarp every night with a
20-man Marine unit, for which he is serving as a temporary adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, nearly 6 million acres of land have
now burned this year, and with hot, dry weather conditions in the
West showing no sign of abating, the devastation is likely to
become the worst in at least half a century. Fourteen firefighters
have been killed during this season, including two prison inmates
struck by lightning in Utah on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst fires are in western Montana's Bitterroot
Valley, where a wind-driven flare-up in the last two days has added
to a blanket of smoke so thick that on Thursday midday felt like
deepest dusk. But the Clear Creek fire, burning northwest of here
in the Salmon-Challis National Forest, remains the largest single
blaze in the country, spanning some 165,000 acres, with only about
one-third contained.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1,755 people, 16 helicopters, 66 fire engines
and 14 bulldozers have been assigned to fight the fire. But the
area is so vast and so isolated that commanders say that much of
their time and energy is devoted to logistics.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest substantial airport, in Idaho Falls, is three hours
away from this camp, which is set on a highway so that it can be
resupplied. Reaching the fire lines takes the crews an hour each
way by bus, traveling on narrow Forest Service roads.
</P>
<P>
   And though the food served at the camp is far better than
standard military fare, it does not come cheap, said Dale B.
Thompson, a Park Service ranger based in Arizona who is managing
the food operation here. A Thursday dinner that included halibut
and au gratin potatoes dished up by the Big Sky Catering Co. of
Missoula, Mont., which specializes in providing for fire crews,
cost taxpayers $16 a meal, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The USO troupe flew in and out of Boise, Idaho, seven hours
away, and was returning to New York for regular weekend
performances on the USS Intrepid, the warship-turned-museum now
docked in New York. The Marines, who arrived here Aug. 5, have had
only one day off since, and receive no extra pay for their fire
service, said Lt. Alison Ake, a spokeswoman. The unit is scheduled
to return to California on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the civilian firefighters contracted by the Forest
Service and other federal agencies receive more generous treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They are required to take one day off for every 14 days of work,
or two days every 21, and most of them get time-and-a-half for
overtime, which adds up quickly over the long days. Wallace, the
23-year-old Californian, figures he will earn $3,000 a month this
summer as a member of what is known as a Type II, or second-tier,
fire crew. That is more than triple his regular wintertime wage.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks in the smoke, firefighters say, simple pleasures
feel like enormous rewards. Brian Crawley, a 33-year-old paramedic
from southeast Tennessee, was looking forward to a brief respite
from what would be two back-to-back 21-day fire tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm headed to the big metropolis of Challis,'' Crawley said,
``for two things I can't get here: a bed and a bath.''

BRUINS WIDE RECEIVERS BACK FOR MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are two UCLA receivers who have been tearing
it up in fall camp. They're strong, fast, have great hands and are
a big play waiting to happen. They almost remind you of those two
guys from 1998. ...
</P>
<P>
   By the way, whatever happened to Freddie Mitchell and Brian
Poli-Dixon?
</P>
<P>
   If two weeks of fall camp are any indication, Mitchell and
Poli-Dixon are indeed back and the two receivers are among the many
Bruins who can't wait for next week's season opener against
third-ranked Alabama to help put memories of last season behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon, who looked like a burgeoning star in 1998 with 10
touchdown catches, broke his right wrist against Fresno State and
missed the final eight games of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a new motto this year,'' Poli-Dixon said. ``I'm not
hungry. I'm starving.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, make it a table for two.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell led the Bruins with 38 catches last season, but he was
hardly the dynamic player who caught a 79-yard bomb and threw
another touchdown pass in the 1998 opener against Texas before
breaking his leg the next week.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mitchell didn't even score a touchdown last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't showed my fullest potential yet,'' Mitchell said.
``I'm ready to have that crazy season. I'm ready to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, from suburban Orlando, Fla., and Poli-Dixon, from
Tucson, Ariz., stayed in Los Angeles over the summer to work out
and catch ball after ball.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who is 6-foot, 188 pounds, seems to have regained the
explosiveness that nagging leg injuries robbed him of last season.
He praised strength and conditioning coach Mike Linn for rekindling
his enthusiasm _ at least when the TV cameras aren't on.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 216-pound Poli-Dixon is looking very much like the
player who ran past cornerbacks and through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Freddie feel a lot more confident this year,''
Poli-Dixon said. ``We're got a quarterback with experience, the
whole line is back, we know the offense and we put in all the work
in the spring and summer. We have enough confidence in our ability
that it doesn't matter who they put out there, we're going to make
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   CALLING IT QUITS: Two receivers who had fallen down the depth
chart, Paul Nelson and Ryan Smith, have decided to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a redshirt sophomore, was the Bruins' top receiving
recruit three years ago but never panned out. He switched to
cornerback last year where he started against Oregon State, but
then requested a switch back to receiver. He could end up at San
Diego State, where he almost transferred after his freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd been in here enough,'' head coach Bob Toledo said of
Nelson's annual trip to his office. ``It was time for him to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   BRUIN MAN, TROJAN FAN? With the Pac-10 looking for a much-needed
boost of national respect, does that mean Toledo will be rooting
for the Trojans on Sunday against Penn State?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough question,'' he said. ``I'm not going to answer
that.'' &QL;

WISE LOOKS GOOD IN ANGELS' WIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Matt Wise doesn't throw with much velocity,
probably just a bit faster than the speed of the cars that carried
his friends and family south on the Orange Freeway to Edison Field
from La Verne.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' rookie pitcher didn't hit 90 mph on the radar gun
all night, but he didn't need to. He had such command of his three
pitches _ fastball, curveball, changeup _ that the Cleveland
Indians went back to their team hotel wondering what hit them, and
what it was they couldn't hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth start of his major-league career, Wise gave up
only one run and three hits in 81/3 innings to lead the Angels to a
4-1 victory in front of 41,452. He struck out five, walked two and
took a shutout into the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton hit Wise's first pitch of the ninth into the
right-field seats to ruin the shutout bid and one out later, Wise
walked Roberto Alomar. That brought Angels manager Mike Scioscia to
the mound and Wise left to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa got the final two outs for his seventh save,
striking out David Segui with two runners on base to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Wise (3-1) got offensive help from Darin Erstad, who missed the
past four games with a muscle strain in his rib cage but returned
to get four hits. However, the big blow of the night was Tim
Salmon's three-run homer off Indians reliever Justin Speier in the
seventh inning, which gave Wise and the Angels some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   It was Salmon's 29th homer of the year. One more, and the Angels
will become the first American League team to have four players
reach 30 home runs in a season. The Dodgers and Rockies have done
it in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Angels to within 2{ games of Boston and
Oakland in the wild-card race. They also continue to sneak up on
the Mariners in the AL West, trailing by only four games.
</P>
<P>
   Wise was in complete control for eight innings. He gave up a
two-out single to Alomar in the first inning, and didn't allow
another hit until Jim Thome singled with two outs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Wise retired 18 of 19 batters, the only blemish a
leadoff walk by Omar Vizquel in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Thome's single in the seventh, Segui worked the count full
but Wise struck him out with a 78 mph changeup to end the inning.
It was Wise's career high fifth strikeout of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Wise used primarily his fastball and changeup, getting ahead of
the hitters early in the count with his fastball and throwing his
changeup late in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't (throw strikes) I won't be around long,'' Wise
said. ``I don't throw hard, I don't overpower anybody. Location is
my bread and butter, along with my changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a slider tonight but we didn't feel the need to use
it,'' catcher Bengie Molina said. ``He was getting people out with
fastball, changeup, so we stayed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise was called up three weeks ago only because there were
injuries and there was a need. But he has been as steady as any
starting pitcher the Angels have had all season. He has pitched at
least six innings in all four starts and has not yielded more than
three runs in any.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were deep in starting pitching, we have a lot of
great young arms,'' Scioscia said. ``We didn't want to test it as
much as we did, but they've come through and have made
footprints.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wise was perplexing the Indians hitters, Indians starter
Dave Burba was doing same to the Angels, escaping tough situations
while facing the Angels' toughest hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the first inning with a single, and two outs
later was still on first base. But Salmon hit one into the
left-field corner for a double, scoring Erstad for a 1-0 Angels
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But that was it until he left with one out in the seventh. He
worked out of jams in the third and fifth innings, getting key
strikeouts of Salmon and Vaughn along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finally broke through when they were able to knock
Burba out of the game. Erstad led off the seventh with his fourth
hit of the night, and one out later Vaughn walked. But Burba,
having made 128 pitches, was not given a chance to get out of
another jam.
</P>
<P>
   In came Speier, and out went the ball on a 0-1 pitch to Salmon. &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 27, will move today:
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-AFRICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ This weekend, on a return
engagement in Africa, President Clinton is singing the praises of
President Olusegan Obasanjo of Nigeria, a former general who was
elected last year in Africa's most populous country. The Clinton
administration has seized on Obasanjo, whose victory ended years of
military dictatorship, as an anchor of democratic stability in
restive West Africa. But there are risks. Obasanjo presides over a
country that is fractured north from south by Islamic extremism.
Nigeria is the second-most corrupt nation on earth, according to
Transparency International, a nonprofit group based in Germany. The
former general's record on human rights has already been stained,
and his top aides have been selling their influence. By Blaine
Harden. (Will move in ``i'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   VOTER-TURNOUT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What if they gave an election
and everyone came? Turnout in the last three American presidential
elections has hovered at around half of the nation's voting-age
population, which has prompted a good deal of national
hand-wringing. It's obvious that if everyone eligible voted this
November, the number of ballots cast would roughly double. But
would all those millions of additional votes change the outcome for
the main contenders, George W. Bush and Al Gore? By Michael R.
Kagay. (Will move in ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   TIRE-DISPOSAL-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The deaths and injuries
attributed to failed Firestone tires are horrific, but recalling
6.5 million tires poses another problem: What to do with them once
they are taken off Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles and other
light trucks? If someone figured out a way to stack the tires in a
column at a landfill, they would form a pile 949 miles high. By
Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ Long before anyone ever heard of
reality television, or its most recent efflorescence, ``Survivor,''
a group of scientists began putting ordinary people into unusual
situations and observing how they behaved. In perhaps the most
famous experiment, Dr. Stanley Milgram's study of obedience to
authority, the subjects meekly delivered what they believed were
potentially fatal electric shocks to another person when ordered to
do so by an experimenter in a white coat. Such research stimulated
heated ethical debate. Now, in a twist that oddly merges the
science of the past and the entertainment of the present, a
production company is planning to re-enact the Milgram study and
other social-psychology classics. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   ESTROGEN-HEART-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed so clear a decade
ago: Of course hormone replacement therapy would protect women's
hearts after menopause. After all, women's heart disease risk
starts to rise in middle age, around the time that their ovaries
stop making estrogen. And there was indirect evidence that the drug
was working. But now, new data are turning the estrogen hypothesis
on its head and showing that even the best-intentioned analysis can
go astray if it relies on indirect evidence. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES-SURVIVOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The two candidates
surveyed their voters and saw a group evenly divided _ loyal
stalwarts on each side, swing voters in the middle. Pundits and
fans who had followed the race closely had no idea who would win.
The venue was the nerve-racking finale of the CBS hit show
``Survivor.'' Richard, who won, excelled at defining his candidacy.
This year's presidential candidates tried to make similarly
effective speeches at their televised conventions. Comparisons
between the candidates and the survivors proved irresistible. By
Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE-VOTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last week, riding a wave of
strong polls following his family-focused speech at the Democratic
National Convention, Al Gore reiterated his intention to make
families, particularly ``working families,'' the focus of his
campaign. Gore took great pains to project an image of himself as a
devoted husband and father who understands that all families want
the same opportunities for their children. But where does his
parent-focused campaign leave unmarried voters, a group that has
supported the Democratic party by a strong majority in recent
years? By K.A. Dilday.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Given that both sides are bracing
for a down-to-the-wire presidential race, the nationally televised
debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
could be especially crucial this year. The common wisdom is that
Gore _ the oratorical slayer of Ross Perot, Jack Kemp and Bill
Bradley _ is such a vaunted debater, and Bush such a novice, that
it would be like watching a karaoke competition between Barbra
Streisand and Britney Spears. The truth is that Gore and Bush are
more evenly matched than people think. Bush, in fact, could even
come out ahead. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-MEXICO-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ As Vicente Fox paid his first
visit to Washington as Mexico's president-elect and informally
presented his ideas for a more liberal northward flow of Mexican
workers, his proposals stirred a flurry of mixed emotions at home.
Among the poor, Fox's proposals have sparked hopes that they might
soon be able to cross the border with more protections and dignity.
For Mexico's middle classes, an opening of the border seems more a
necessary evil. To them, the border is the epicenter of Mexico's
ambiguous, love-hate relationship with the United States. Because
it is a gateway to the most powerful country in the world, the
border is at once a kind of mythical place, but also a place where
Mexico's disadvantages are magnified. By Ginger Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Berlin) _ As the 10th anniversary of
German unification approaches on Oct. 3, it seems clear that the
conjunction of recovered German nationhood with a diminished nation
state has had some disturbing effects. The giant of Europe is
edging toward its anniversary in a mood of some agitation,
wondering aloud what to do about rightist extremism, pondering
where the roots of xenophobia lie, lamenting the misunderstanding
between Wessis and Ossis (Westerners and Easterners), and groping
for a shared sense of German identity that is nonthreatening. By
Roger Cohen.

   &UR; COLLEGE FOOTBALL PREVIEW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FBC-VECSEY-COLUMN (Hempstead, N.Y.) _ Joe Gardi calls his
Hofstra University football team the Road Warriors, meaning, they
will go just about anywhere for a game. They have no choice. In
this age of sprawling leagues, proliferating conferences,
made-for-TV affiliations, new best friends with instant traditions,
Hofstra goes it alone. And nobody wants to be locked in with a
Division I-AA powerhouse that is sending more players to the NFL
than some of the traditional schools that grab the prime time and
the headlines. By George Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-QUARTERBACKS (Undated) _ There's a superman at Virginia
Tech, and an old man at Florida State. There's the passing man at
Purdue, a running man at Nebraska and dueling men at Texas. They
have little in common except that they are quarterbacks and that
the prospects of their teams reaching bowl games or earning a
national title are in the care of their feet, arms and, especially,
their heads. They are a diverse, intriguing bunch who have been
chosen to play the most important position in football by coaches
who argue that quarterbacking on the college level transcends
merely possessing football skills. It means showing as much
maturity and toughness Sunday through Friday away from the stadium
as they do on the field on Saturday. By Joe Drape.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-PATERNO (State College , Pa.) _ Joe Paterno once called
Alabama Coach Bear Bryant ``the nearest thing we had to a god of
football.'' In their four meetings as head coaches, Paterno never
defeated Bryant. But this season, which begins for Penn State
Sunday with the Kickoff Classic against USC at Giants Stadium,
Paterno can eclipse Bryant and become No. 1 on a prestigious list.
Should the Nittany Lions win seven games, Paterno will have 324
victories, one more than Bryant's 323, the most for a coach in
Division I-A, the major league of college football. At age 73, as
Paterno begins his 51st season at Penn State and his 35th as head
coach, his pursuit of Bryant's record will put him in the national
spotlight and help write the narrative of the 2000 season. By Joe
Lapointe.

<P>
   FBC-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ College football notes and news. Lead
item: The two best running backs in the nation cannot be found
gobbling ground in the Big Ten or bursting around the corner of
Southeastern Conference defenses. You need to look harder to the
Western Athletic Conference and Texas Christian University where
LaDainian Tomlinson will launch a bid for the Heisman Trophy as
direct as the name of his website: www.LTFor2000. Or to the
Southern Conference and Georgia Southern where Adrian Peterson is
nearing the career yardage record for Division I-AA. By Joe Drape.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-BIG-EAST (Undated) _ Here is what the Miami Hurricanes have
lots of: quarterback-mauling defenders, speedy receivers, bruising
running backs and, as always, confidence. The Canes work hard and
are the kind of players that Coach Butch Davis likes. But here is
what Miami does not have: Michael Vick or a victory over Virginia
Tech in six years. If Miami can conquer the Hokies and Vick, the
left-handed quarterback who led Tech to last season's national
championship game, on Nov. 4 at the Orange Bowl, the Hurricanes
could be playing for something much more important than the Big
East championship. But that is the biggest if of the conference
season. By Dave Caldwell.

rawness of pain and relapse and death seem to spring from the

roomy but unassuming Colonial, with its green shutters and patchy
lawn, the sawdust has settled on the construction of Venus
Williams' gated home in South Florida. In an upscale enclave, where
prices hover well above the half-million-dollar range, the home
could stand as a stucco symbol of Williams's journey from the
beaded curiosity out of Compton, Calif., to an independent young
woman with a Grand Slam title of her own, from the gangly
10-year-old who used to cup giggles with her hand to a sleek
20-year-old who strides into rooms with the same detached stare as
a model on a catwalk. By Selena Roberts.

   FBN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Lead item: The soap opera-like saga of
the Miami Dolphin's J.J. Johnson, who will most likely start at
running back for the team this season, finally ended late this
week. It did so with a cryptic statement from the National Football
League that said news media reports of his pending suspension for
steroid use were in error, and he faced no such penalty. The
statement actually left more questions than answers about exactly
what happened in Johnson's puzzling situation that, as it turns
out, may be a landmark drug case for the NFL. By Mike Freeman.

   BBO-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ The Yankees have clearly outclassed the
field with their in-season acquisitions, each one of whom has made
a critical contribution to their division-leading status. Of the
six position players the Yankees picked up, five were hitting
better than .300 entering the weekend. By Murray Chass.

<P>
   On his first trip to Africa two years ago, President Clinton
dreamed out loud that his journey would be remembered in a hundred
years as ``the beginning of a new African renaissance.'' The
president singled out four African heads of state whose free-market
savvy would help revive the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, all four leaders _ in Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and
Eritrea _ have crippled their nations' economies by going to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans are so desperate for good news on the continent
that it is almost irresistible when we find a good man in Africa,''
said Edward Brynn, the former American ambassador to Ghana who
greeted Clinton in Accra on the first leg of his 1998 trip. ``The
only way we seem to be able to identify success in Africa is
through personalization.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, on a return engagement in Africa, Clinton is again
singing the praises of a good man in Africa. This time it's
President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, a former general who was
elected last year to lead Africa's most populous country. The
Clinton administration has seized on Obasanjo, whose victory ended
years of military dictatorship, as an anchor of democratic
stability in restive West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, there are risks. Obasanjo presides over a country
that is fractured north from south by Islamic extremism. Nigeria is
the second-most corrupt nation on earth (after neighboring
Cameroon), according to Transparency International, a nonprofit
anti-corruption group based in Germany. The former general's record
on human rights has already been stained by his order for soldiers
to destroy a town in the oil-producing Niger delta. His top aides
have been selling their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the concern of many longtime Africa watchers, Brynn, a
former No. 2 in the State Department's Africa bureau in the Clinton
administration, says the United States must resist the temptation
of ``putting all our eggs in the personality basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Brynn and many others argue that the only way for Americans to
help Africa in a meaningful way is to join with European allies in
the slow and painfully complex job of rebuilding institutions that
have been falling apart for decades. Most important are the civil
service, courts, the police and the military.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of colonialism in the 1960s and the spread of
self-rule across most of Africa, early American efforts to aid
newly independent states foundered when grants were badly monitored
and often stolen by corrupt bureaucrats. In the past decade, the
United States and other chastened donors have tended to steer clear
of direct aid to governments. Instead, they funnel money through
private and religious groups whose work in health care, basic
education and small-business development can be monitored more
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these approaches, though, has helped cure a
continentwide pathology that has turned many African governments
into predators. Poorly paid policemen, soldiers and civil servants
often use their authority to serve themselves, rather than the
public. ``We failed to keep a real hands-on posture with aid,''
said Brynn, who served as a diplomat on the continent for 17 years
in six different countries. ``We allowed a small, clever class that
inherited power from the colonial masters to take us to the
cleaners. It will take a whole lot of time and money to turn Africa
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Except in Nigeria, South Africa and a handful of other
countries, civil wars and corruption have swamped the African
renaissance that Clinton envisioned two years ago. Much of the
continent has resumed a long slide into poverty, war and disease _
a dismal trajectory that has excluded the region from the rapid
free-market growth in much of the developing world. That painful
pattern suggests that America's next president will be confronted
by military and humanitarian crises in Africa that cannot be solved
with foreign trips or inspiring speeches _ and quite possibly
cannot be solved at all.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 27 major armed conflicts in the world last year, 11
were fought in Africa. Five of the world's 10 most corrupt
countries are in Africa, according to Transparency International. A
peace deal for Sierra Leone, which the United States helped broker
in 1999, collapsed back into war this spring, with U.N.
peacekeepers taken hostage. As in Rwanda, where Clinton apologized
two years ago for America's failure to prevent genocide in 1994,
the continuing mess in Sierra Leone reveals an absence of
international commitment to peacekeeping in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS pandemic has accelerated and is threatening to kill up
to 25 percent of the population in some African countries. War in
Congo has sucked in a half-dozen other African states and shows no
signs of ending. A political and economic rot that African scholars
call ``failed-state syndrome'' seems to be spreading from countries
like Somalia and Sudan to what used to be models of stability _
Kenya, Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very frightening picture that we face in Africa,''
said Stephen Morrison, who left the State Department's policy
planning staff last spring after four years of working on Africa
policy. ``It makes people exceedingly uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, like many experts on Africa, agrees that the United
States and European countries need to commit more money and more
skilled people to rebuilding African governments. But like many
others, he concedes that no one is sure about how to do it or how
to persuade African leaders to allow what could be perceived as
neocolonial meddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us have answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, Morrison is preparing a
nonpartisan review of Africa policy during the Clinton years to
help inform the next administration. ``It is not clear that we have
come to terms as a government and a nation about what is truly
required to help Africa,'' he said. ``If we come in on the cheap
side, it is going to backfire. I think it is fair to say that the
Clinton administration has suffered from rhetorical excess in
Africa and deficits in terms of will and material commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison said the administration has been quick off the mark
with significant economic and military assistance to Nigeria. Aid
there has jumped from $7 million a year to more than $200 million
since Obasanjo was elected in February 1999. On his trip this
weekend, the president is not expected to offer much more money.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are especially high in Nigeria. With 113 million
people and huge oil and natural gas reserves, the country has the
potential to drive an economic revival in all of West Africa. It is
also one of few African states where the United States has a real
strategic interest. Oil from Nigeria and Angola accounts for about
16 percent of America's supply, a figure projected to rise to more
than 25 percent in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is also counting on Nigeria's armed forces to restore
peace in nearby Sierra Leone. American troops began arriving in
Nigeria last week as part of a $20 million program to train and
equip Nigerian and Ghanaian soldiers for peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we hanging too much on Obasanjo?'' Morrison asked. ``That
is clearly a danger we face. We have to invest in institution
building _ the military, the legislature, getting a handle on
corruption. But we cannot do any of this stuff on the cheap. It has
got to be sustained beyond this president and beyond Obasanjo.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending by the U.S. government on development assistance in
Africa has declined in the past decade. Aid to African nations
peaked in the early 1990s at just over $800 million a year, dipped
to $675 million in 1996 and grew this year to about $738 million.
By comparison, Israel received about $900 million in economic
support this year and Egypt about $760 million, according to the
Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority in Congress has repeatedly cut the
president's budget requests for Africa and has so far failed to
approve an administration proposal to forgive about $475 million in
African debt.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential trips notwithstanding, many experts on Africa
(including several who have served in the Clinton administration)
agree that Washington is not spending nearly enough money to
sustain or even begin the kind of fundamental reform that is the
only possible solution to the continent's complex problems. ``You
are left with a very weak hand,'' said Gerald Bender, a professor
of international relations at the University of Southern California
and an expert on Angola. ``You do not have the means to initiate
positive things or hold back problems like war.''

SURPRISE! DEBATES MAY MATTER. AND HELP BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement

details and prices, phone: 47 42 17 11; fax: 47-42-80-44.) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Given that both sides are bracing for a
down-to-the-wire presidential race, the nationally televised
debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
could be especially crucial. For millions of Americans, it may be
the first _ and only _ time they eyeball the two rivals for longer
than a few-second snippet on the news or in a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   But to listen to many strategists and pundits, Democrats and
Republicans alike, Bush might as well put away his briefing books
and sit out the debates. The common wisdom is that Gore _ the
oratorical slayer of Ross Perot, Jack Kemp and Bill Bradley _ is
such a vaunted debater and Bush is such a novice, sometimes even a
stumblebum, that it would be like watching a karaoke competition
between Barbra Streisand and a barroom crooner. Bush officials
angled for advantage last week in negotiating the debate roster, a
move Gore aides said was intended to find a format with smaller
audiences and moderators hospitable to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Gore and Bush are more evenly matched than
people think. Bush could even come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has had years of debate training and is known for absorbing
every fact and angle _ and using them to pound like a jackhammer at
his opponent. Bush, by contrast, had taken part in just two debates
before the primaries, against his rivals for governor of Texas in
1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush improved significantly during the primaries. And if
he can harness his easygoing charm, he might come off as less
intense and more appealing than Gore. After all, Ronald Reagan
vanquished President Jimmy Carter in 1980, not because he had a
better command of issues _ he did not _ but because he could better
connect with the audience when he admonished Carter, ``There you go
again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush can do to Gore what Reagan did to Carter _ make him
look pedantic, like a wonk who is out of touch _ he may very well
prevail,'' said Alan Schroeder, a political scientist and the
author of ``Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk TV''
(Columbia University Press, 2000). ``If the debate turns a little
more on content, then obviously Gore is in an advantage here.''
</P>
<P>
   Debates are all about expectations, which are decidedly rock
bottom for Bush, and his aides are doing their best to keep them
that way. ``I've watched the tapes,'' said Bush's communications
director, Karen Hughes, ``and Vice President Gore has a carefully
schooled and trained technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as other campaign officials were attacking Bush last week
as too timid to debate, William Daley, the chairman of the Gore
campaign, also tried to dampen expectations for his candidate. ``If
you see the tape of the Richards-Bush debate,'' he said, ``he did
just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   If fine is coming through without being bloodied, Bush did
survive an hourlong tussle in 1994 with Gov. Ann Richards, who was
one of the Democrats' biggest stars. She was funny and sarcastic.
He was not, but was unruffled and stuck to his message.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by most experts' reckoning, is an adroit debater. Yet some
of his successes had a lot to do with weak opponents. In the
primaries, for example, Bradley was lackluster and afraid to
counterattack aggressively. And in what was perhaps Gore's
best-known debate, on the North American Free Trade Agreement in
1993, Perot was not as well prepared _ and let himself become
rattled.
</P>
<P>
   Before those matchups, when Gore went up against Vice President
Dan Quayle, who was much maligned for his oratorical skills (or
lack thereof), Gore was not particularly impressive. In fact, many
analysts said Quayle did as well as or better than his opponent.
Several times Quayle tried to goad Gore into defending President
Clinton, saying, ``Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.''
Some Democrats skewered Gore after the debate for not sufficiently
defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   Debates are not merely the measure of who can best roll out the
facts, but who can appear most confident and comfortable under
excruciating pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush has the advantage, oddly enough, entirely because
of the expectations game,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bush camp seems apprehensive. The campaign proposed
five debates this year, two between the vice presidential nominees.
But unlike the Gore campaign, the Bush organization has not agreed
to the proposal offered by the Commission on Presidential Debates,
a bipartisan group that has sponsored debates since the 1988
campaign. The commission has proposed three presidential debates in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials said they want to consider all the possible
formats; Gore campaign officials say their rival is afraid to meet

SURPRISE! DEBATES MAY MATTER. AND HELP BUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Given that both sides are bracing for a
down-to-the-wire presidential race, the nationally televised
debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
could be especially crucial. For millions of Americans, it may be
the first _ and only _ time they eyeball the two rivals for longer
than a few-second snippet on the news or in a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   But to listen to many strategists and pundits, Democrats and
Republicans alike, Bush might as well put away his briefing books
and sit out the debates. The common wisdom is that Gore _ the
oratorical slayer of Ross Perot, Jack Kemp and Bill Bradley _ is
such a vaunted debater and Bush is such a novice, sometimes even a
stumblebum, that it would be like watching a karaoke competition
between Barbra Streisand and a barroom crooner. Bush officials
angled for advantage last week in negotiating the debate roster, a
move Gore aides said was intended to find a format with smaller
audiences and moderators hospitable to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Gore and Bush are more evenly matched than
people think. Bush could even come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has had years of debate training and is known for absorbing
every fact and angle _ and using them to pound like a jackhammer at
his opponent. Bush, by contrast, had taken part in just two debates
before the primaries, against his rivals for governor of Texas in
1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush improved significantly during the primaries. And if
he can harness his easygoing charm, he might come off as less
intense and more appealing than Gore. After all, Ronald Reagan
vanquished President Jimmy Carter in 1980, not because he had a
better command of issues _ he did not _ but because he could better
connect with the audience when he admonished Carter, ``There you go
again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush can do to Gore what Reagan did to Carter _ make him
look pedantic, like a wonk who is out of touch _ he may very well
prevail,'' said Alan Schroeder, a political scientist and the
author of ``Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk TV''
(Columbia University Press, 2000). ``If the debate turns a little
more on content, then obviously Gore is in an advantage here.''
</P>
<P>
   Debates are all about expectations, which are decidedly rock
bottom for Bush, and his aides are doing their best to keep them
that way. ``I've watched the tapes,'' said Bush's communications
director, Karen Hughes, ``and Vice President Gore has a carefully
schooled and trained technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as other campaign officials were attacking Bush last week
as too timid to debate, William Daley, the chairman of the Gore
campaign, also tried to dampen expectations for his candidate. ``If
you see the tape of the Richards-Bush debate,'' he said, ``he did
just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   If fine is coming through without being bloodied, Bush did
survive an hourlong tussle in 1994 with Gov. Ann Richards, who was
one of the Democrats' biggest stars. She was funny and sarcastic.
He was not, but was unruffled and stuck to his message.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by most experts' reckoning, is an adroit debater. Yet some
of his successes had a lot to do with weak opponents. In the
primaries, for example, Bradley was lackluster and afraid to
counterattack aggressively. And in what was perhaps Gore's
best-known debate, on the North American Free Trade Agreement in
1993, Perot was not as well prepared _ and let himself become
rattled.
</P>
<P>
   Before those matchups, when Gore went up against Vice President
Dan Quayle, who was much maligned for his oratorical skills (or
lack thereof), Gore was not particularly impressive. In fact, many
analysts said Quayle did as well as or better than his opponent.
Several times Quayle tried to goad Gore into defending President
Clinton, saying, ``Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.''
Some Democrats skewered Gore after the debate for not sufficiently
defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   Debates are not merely the measure of who can best roll out the
facts, but who can appear most confident and comfortable under
excruciating pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush has the advantage, oddly enough, entirely because
of the expectations game,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bush camp seems apprehensive. The campaign proposed
five debates this year, two between the vice presidential nominees.
But unlike the Gore campaign, the Bush organization has not agreed
to the proposal offered by the Commission on Presidential Debates,
a bipartisan group that has sponsored debates since the 1988
campaign. The commission has proposed three presidential debates in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials said they want to consider all the possible
formats; Gore campaign officials say their rival is afraid to meet
them head on. There is a history in the Bush family of reluctance
to debate: Former President George Bush took part in debates in
1988 and 1992, but only after protracted negotiations with the
debate commission. In a town meeting-style debate with Clinton in
Richmond in 1992, Bush seemed so bored that the camera caught him
glancing at his watch.
</P>

not to ``exploit'' Walter Mondale's youth and inexperience in
1984?) and can give a significant lift to a candidate (Perot in
1992) or highlight a weakness (President Gerald Ford saying in 1976

HOW TO MAKE 200 MILLION FLIP-FLOPS

   DETROIT _ The deaths and injuries attributed to failed Firestone
tires are horrific, but recalling 6.5 million tires poses another
problem: what to do with them once they are taken off Ford Explorer
sport utility vehicles and other light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   If someone figured out a way to stack the tires in a column at a
landfill, they would form a pile 949 miles high. The last thing
anyone wants is a high-rise breeding ground for mosquitoes,
particularly those carrying the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans simply abandon their worn-out tires by night at
the edge of the nearest stream, river or park. This is not only
illegal but impractical for Bridgestone/Firestone, which is
recalling enough tires to form a wall 50 feet high, 50 feet thick
and a half mile long _ big enough to clog most rivers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone and the Ford Motor Co. said on Friday that they were
looking for ways to use the scrap tires more productively,
something the industry has been doing for years. They are focusing
on ways to increase demand for scrap rubber, since tire-scrapping
factories already have huge stockpiles of tires waiting to be torn
apart whenever someone is willing to pay enough to cover the
shredding costs. Proposals include mixing them with asphalt for
paving roads, recycling them as auto parts, chopping them up for
furnace fuel and grinding them up to use as garden hoses or
playground mats.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ford's ideas, not surprisingly, is to turn the tires into
auto parts for yet more sport utility vehicles. The immense Ford
Excursion, which weighs as much as three small cars and is so big
that it allows tall drivers to look in the windows of school buses,
already uses a rubber air deflector, located below and behind the
front bumper, that is made from scrap tires.
</P>
<P>
   Chop up the tires, separate out the steel bands that fly apart
when the tires fail at high speed, and you would have 67 million
pounds of rubber. That would be enough to make more than 100
million pairs of flip-flops. Or they could be used for huaraches,
the flat Mexican sandals with soles made from tires that were de
rigueur in the 1960s for hippies rebelling against their parents'
leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that the shoe industry is unenthusiastic
about using old tires for the same reason that motorists are: The
rubber tends to come apart after a while. The technology for
various composite materials has improved so much that even in
Mexico, huaraches are seldom made from tires now, said Fawn
Evenson, the president of the American Apparel and Footwear
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled tires could also end up being sliced apart and
shoveled into power plant furnaces as fuel _ a small step toward
offsetting the poor energy efficiency of the Ford Explorer, which
gets 15 miles to the gallon in the city and 19 on the highway. A
typical tire on a family vehicle has the energy content of 7
gallons of oil, partly because of the extensive use these days of
synthetic rubber, an oil-based substance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 270 million tires scrapped each year in the United
States, about 114 million are mixed with coal and used as fuel,
says the Scrap Tire Management Council, which is run by tire
makers. But burning tires is unpopular with environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The green crowd prefers using tires to make garden hoses. Black
``soaker'' hoses, with many small holes in them for slow
irrigation, not only use water much more efficiently than
sprinklers but are made mainly from recycled tires. A million tires
a year are used to make Moisture Master soaker hoses, said Paul
Schneider, the product's marketing manager. The Firestone recall
will make more scrap rubber available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a small subsidy, Ford and Firestone could actually prevent
some injuries. Rubber playground mats made from recycled tires are
very safe, and making them available more widely would prevent some
of the 200,000 injuries and more than a dozen deaths that occur
each year on the nation's playgrounds, said Donna Thompson, the
director of the nonprofit National Program for Playground Safety,
which is financed by the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that while she had not heard from Ford or
Bridgestone, all of the recalled tires could be turned into 350
very large, thick playground mats for as little as $2 million, and
then be given away to schools and cities that could not otherwise
afford such mats.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before anyone ever heard of reality television, or its most
recent efflorescence, ``Survivor,'' a group of scientists began
putting ordinary people into unusual situations and observing how
they behaved.
</P>
<P>
   They were social psychologists, experts in the systematic study
of behavior. And they had noble aspirations. Stirred by the events
of their time _ the Holocaust, prison riots, the indifference of
bystanders as a young woman was stabbed to death on a New York
street _ they sought to understand the darkest human deeds in the
hope of finding ways to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the psychologists, who carried out a variety of
experiments at prestigious universities between the 1950s and the
1970s, were fascinated by the power of situations to influence
people's behavior, sometimes even overriding individual personality
traits and the dictates of personal conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments were compelling, and still enthrall
undergraduates when they are taught in introductory psychology
courses. In perhaps the most famous, Dr. Stanley Milgram's study of
obedience to authority, the subjects meekly delivered what they
believed were potentially fatal electric shocks to another person
when ordered to do so by an experimenter in a white coat.
</P>
<P>
   In another, student volunteers at Stanford University who were
randomly assigned to play prisoners or guards for a two-week stay
in a simulated prison became so caught up in their roles that the
study had to be halted after a week.
</P>
<P>
   But the research was also controversial, stimulating heated
ethical debate. Subjects were sometimes deceived about the true
purpose of the experiments, which critics felt was a breach of
trust. And some worried about the longterm effects on the subjects,
who often acted, under the pressures of the experimental paradigm,
in ways they later found abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   In a famous 1964 critique, Dr. Diana Baumrind, a psychology
professor at the University of California at Berkeley, wrote: ``I
would not like to see experiments such as Milgram's proceed unless
the subjects were fully informed of the dangers of serious
aftereffects and his correctives were clearly shown to be effective
in restoring their state of well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, ethical guidelines discouraged the use of
most deception in psychological research and required thorough
debriefing of subjects. As a result, neither the Milgram study nor
the Stanford prison experiment could be carried out today.
</P>
<P>
   That is, in the world of science.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of reality television shows, however, are
unfettered by such constraints. Their subjects are ``Survivor''
wannabes, who stand to win fame and fortune. The purpose is simply
to entertain, titillate _ and, oh yes, to make money. And the
situations that eager contestants are plopped into are limited only
by developers' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   They can put people on islands and make them eat bugs, walk on
hot coals and choose between their comrades (as in ``Survivor'').
They can chain four women to a man for a week (as in ``Chains of
Love,'' recently bought by NBC). They can, much like the
experimenters in the Stanford study, lock people up in prison (as
in ``Jailbreak,'' recently acquired by ABC, where the inmates will
try to escape).
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist that oddly merges the science of the past and the
entertainment of the present, one production company, Film Garden
Entertainment in Los Angeles, is even planning to re-enact the
Milgram study and other social psychology classics in a 13-part
series called ``The Human Experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very intrigued, long before `Survivor,' in producing a
show that would reveal certain things about human behavior in a
context that was entertaining and at the same time educational and
legitimate,'' said Nancy Jacobs Miller, Film Garden's president.
She said her company, like other producers, is hoping that a cache
of reality offerings might see them through an anticipated strike
by actors and writers next year.
</P>
<P>
   Film Garden is also trying to enlist as a consultant Dr. Philip
Zimbardo, the Stanford psychology professor who, with two graduate
students, directed the prison study three decades ago. Miller has
asked him to help choose experiments and guide their execution.
</P>
<P>
   But like other psychologists, Zimbardo, who said he has not
decided whether to participate in the project, has a mixed reaction
to reality television.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he said, ``Survivor'' and other such shows are
``wonderful, because they make the public aware of how fascinating
it is to observe human behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Candid Camera,'' he said, was arguably the networks' first
venture into reality television. Allen Funt, the show's host, ``was
one of the first intuitive psychologists,'' Zimbardo said. ``He put
ordinary people into unusual circumstances and we watched how they
improvised. That's what makes people want to be psychologists.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at the American Psychological Association's recent
annual meeting, the late Funt was honored for ``lifelong
contributions to psychology and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   And like the experiments of an earlier era, reality TV shows can
be useful in demonstrating the power of circumstance to determine
behavior, revealing, Zimbardo pointed out, ``that people are
incredibly complex and that we can alternately be Hitler at one
time and Mother Teresa the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet television is not science, despite the advertisements for
``Survivor'' calling it ``the ultimate human experiment.''
Participants are not randomly selected, the way experimental
subjects would be. There are no control groups.
</P>
<P>
   And the very intensity of such situations presents dangers.
``Simulated reality can become reality,'' Zimbardo said.
``Everybody knew in the prison study that it was an experiment,
which is a formal game. But it didn't make any difference. People
were having emotional breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists quickly realized the risks of such research, and
took steps to address them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the prison study, Zimbardo said, ``We were able
to do good. We were able to convey to the participants what their
behavior illustrated. The public learned something. The scientists
learned something. And the participants learned something.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But television makes no attempt to use reality shows as teaching
devices. And as it strings the tightwire, it provides few nets.
Ever since the suicide of a contestant voted off the original,
Swedish version of ``Survivor,'' American networks have tried to
screen applicants for psychological problems. Some shows, including
``Survivor,'' have psychologists on staff and provide counseling
for participants voted off.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, the philosophy appears to be that
participants in reality shows know what they are getting into.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are counting on what anyone who has taken a
psychology course _ and found the Milgram experiment and the
Stanford study the most fascinating research the field has to offer
_ knows: Reality, even manipulated reality, is hands down more
compelling than fiction.

bystanders as a young woman was stabbed to death on a New York
street _ they sought to understand the darkest human deeds in the
hope of finding ways to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the psychologists, who carried out a variety of
experiments at prestigious universities between the 1950s and the
1970s, were fascinated by the power of situations to influence
people's behavior, sometimes even overriding individual personality
traits and the dictates of personal conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments were compelling, and still enthrall
undergraduates when they are taught in introductory psychology
courses. In perhaps the most famous, Dr. Stanley Milgram's study of
obedience to authority, the subjects meekly delivered what they
believed were potentially fatal electric shocks to another person
when ordered to do so by an experimenter in a white coat.
</P>
<P>
   In another, student volunteers at Stanford University who were
randomly assigned to play prisoners or guards for a two-week stay
in a simulated prison became so caught up in their roles that the
study had to be halted after a week.
</P>
<P>
   But the research was also controversial, stimulating heated
ethical debate. Subjects were sometimes deceived about the true
purpose of the experiments, which critics felt was a breach of
trust. And some worried about the longterm effects on the subjects,
who often acted, under the pressures of the experimental paradigm,
in ways they later found abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   In a famous 1964 critique, Dr. Diana Baumrind, a psychology
professor at the University of California at Berkeley, wrote: ``I
would not like to see experiments such as Milgram's proceed unless
the subjects were fully informed of the dangers of serious
aftereffects and his correctives were clearly shown to be effective
in restoring their state of well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, ethical guidelines discouraged the use of
most deception in psychological research and required thorough
debriefing of subjects. As a result, neither the Milgram study nor
the Stanford prison experiment could be carried out today.
</P>
<P>
   That is, in the world of science.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of reality television shows, however, are
unfettered by such constraints. Their subjects are ``Survivor''
wannabes, who stand to win fame and fortune. The purpose is simply
to entertain, titillate _ and, oh yes, to make money. And the
situations that eager contestants are plopped into are limited only
by developers' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   They can put people on islands and make them eat bugs, walk on
hot coals and choose between their comrades (as in ``Survivor'').
They can chain four women to a man for a week (as in ``Chains of
Love,'' recently bought by NBC). They can, much like the
experimenters in the Stanford study, lock people up in prison (as
in ``Jailbreak,'' recently acquired by ABC, where the inmates will
try to escape).
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist that oddly merges the science of the past and the
entertainment of the present, one production company, Film Garden
Entertainment in Los Angeles, is even planning to re-enact the
Milgram study and other social psychology classics in a 13-part
series called ``The Human Experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very intrigued, long before `Survivor,' in producing a
show that would reveal certain things about human behavior in a
context that was entertaining and at the same time educational and
legitimate,'' said Nancy Jacobs Miller, Film Garden's president.
She said her company, like other producers, is hoping that a cache
of reality offerings might see them through an anticipated strike
by actors and writers next year.
</P>
<P>
   Film Garden is also trying to enlist as a consultant Dr. Philip
Zimbardo, the Stanford psychology professor who, with two graduate
students, directed the prison study three decades ago. Miller has
asked him to help choose experiments and guide their execution.
</P>
<P>
   But like other psychologists, Zimbardo, who said he has not
decided whether to participate in the project, has a mixed reaction
to reality television.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he said, ``Survivor'' and other such shows are
``wonderful, because they make the public aware of how fascinating
it is to observe human behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Candid Camera,'' he said, was arguably the networks' first
venture into reality television. Allen Funt, the show's host, ``was
one of the first intuitive psychologists,'' Zimbardo said. ``He put
ordinary people into unusual circumstances and we watched how they
improvised. That's what makes people want to be psychologists.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at the American Psychological Association's recent
annual meeting, the late Funt was honored for ``lifelong
contributions to psychology and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   And like the experiments of an earlier era, reality TV shows can
be useful in demonstrating the power of circumstance to determine
behavior, revealing, Zimbardo pointed out, ``that people are
incredibly complex and that we can alternately be Hitler at one
time and Mother Teresa the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet television is not science, despite the advertisements for
``Survivor'' calling it ``the ultimate human experiment.''
Participants are not randomly selected, the way experimental
subjects would be. There are no control groups.
</P>
<P>
   And the very intensity of such situations presents dangers.
``Simulated reality can become reality,'' Zimbardo said.
``Everybody knew in the prison study that it was an experiment,
which is a formal game. But it didn't make any difference. People
were having emotional breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists quickly realized the risks of such research, and
took steps to address them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the prison study, Zimbardo said, ``We were able
to do good. We were able to convey to the participants what their
behavior illustrated. The public learned something. The scientists
learned something. And the participants learned something.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But television makes no attempt to use reality shows as teaching
devices. And as it strings the tightwire, it provides few nets.
Ever since the suicide of a contestant voted off the original,
Swedish version of ``Survivor,'' American networks have tried to
screen applicants for psychological problems. Some shows, including
``Survivor,'' have psychologists on staff and provide counseling
for participants voted off.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, the philosophy appears to be that
participants in reality shows know what they are getting into.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are counting on what anyone who has taken a
psychology course _ and found the Milgram experiment and the
Stanford study the most fascinating research the field has to offer
_ knows: Reality, even manipulated reality, is hands down more
compelling than fiction.

<P>
   It seemed so clear a decade ago. Hormone replacement therapy
would protect women's hearts after menopause. After all, their risk
of heart disease rises in middle age, around the time their ovaries
stop making estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   And there was indirect evidence that the drug was working: Women
who chose to take it lived longer and had less heart disease than
those who did not. There even was a biological reason. Estrogen
makes a woman's total cholesterol level drop; it reduces the levels
of LDL cholesterol, the bad actor, while raising levels of HDL
cholesterol, which protects against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the elements were in place for estrogen to protect against
heart disease,'' said Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of medicine
and epidemiology at the University of California in San Francisco.
She and other experts were so convinced that they wrote a set of
widely adopted guidelines for the American College of Physicians
recommending that women at high risk of heart disease take estrogen
after menopause. But new data show that even the best-intentioned
analysis can go astray relying on indirect evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine
published a report of a study on whether estrogen taken alone or
combined with the hormone methoxyprogesterone can retard heart
disease in women whose arteries were already narrowing. It was one
of the first truly rigorous studies of the estrogen hypothesis. The
women in the study were randomly assigned to take hormone
replacement therapy or go without; they were followed for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Such studies avoid a pitfall of those that simply observe who
chooses to take or go without a drug. Often, those who take a drug
differ significantly those who do not. Women who take estrogen are
better educated, wealthier and more concerned about their health,
all factors that are associated with less heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, no estrogen effect ever emerged. The study
participants' arteries narrowed by the same amount whether they
took a placebo, estrogen or estrogen plus methoxyprogesterone.
</P>
<P>
   The study was the second blow to the estrogen hypothesis.
Recently another similarly randomized study concluded that women
with heart disease who were assigned the hormone had the same rate
of heart attacks, including fatalities, as those women with heart
disease who took placebos.
</P>
<P>
   For the millions of women reaching menopause, the real question
is: What happens if you don't have heart disease yet? Will estrogen
offer protection from the leading killer of Americans?
</P>
<P>
   That answer is not yet in. A federal study of 25,000 women
assigned estrogen at random will not be completed until around
2006.But, some say, the signs so far are not promising.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, drugs and behavior changes, like diets and exercise,
are tested first in people who already have the disease in
question. Every time treatments have slowed a disease in people who
are already ill, they have prevented the disease in people who are
well. Is it possible for a drug, like estrogen, to fail to protect
sick people and yet prevent disease in the healthy? If so, it would
be a first, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a professor of preventive and
family medicine at the University of California in San Diego, said
she has been looking for an example of a drug that prevents heart
disease but does not slow its progress. ``I always ask whenever I
have a group of cardiologists in the room, `Can you give me the
name of a medication that is good for the primary prevention of
heart disease but not for the secondary prevention?''' she said.
``I have not gotten an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal study of the 25,000 women has hit a snag. In April,
its directors informed the participants that there was a slight
trend in the data toward more heart disease and strokes in those
taking estrogen. While the trend could turn around, it does not
bode well for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they know more about estrogen, researchers say, it is
sounding reasonable that the hormone would not protect women's
hearts after all. The hormone turns out to have many effects, some
that might protect the blood vessels and the heart, others that
might promote heart disease. The hormone lowers LDL cholesterol,
but promotes clotting, a leading factor in heart attacks and
strokes. It raises HDL cholesterol, but also raises levels of
c-reactive protein, which is associated with inflammation. There is
increasing evidence that inflammation contributes to heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the estrogen story is not finished yet. For women
with heart disease, most experts would agree with Dr. Nanette
Wenger, a cardiologist at Emory University. ``Women with
established heart disease should not use estrogen,'' she said. For
healthy women, she added, ``the final chapter is not yet written.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart disease story is also a lesson in scientific evidence,
experts said. As scientists and the public seize upon indirect
evidence for other effects, like the current hope that estrogen may
prevent Alzheimer's, they might do well to remember how clear
estrogen's effects on the heart once appeared. ``We thought it was
very likely that heart disease risk would be reduced and that
therefore those most at risk should take estrogen,'' Grady said.
``Now, I think that's wrong.''

(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement

<P>
   The two candidates surveyed their voters and saw a group evenly
divided _ loyal stalwarts on each side, swing voters in the middle.
Pundits and fans who had followed the race closely had no idea who
would win. Even casual observers said it would be neck and neck.
The venue was the nerve-racking finale of the CBS hit show
``Survivor,'' in which 16 castaways endured trials, forged
alliances and ate bugs in their quest to win a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with four finalists vying for the prize: Susan
Hawk, the truck driver; Rudy Boesch, the ex-Navy Seal; Kelly
Wiglesworth, the river guide; Richard Hatch, the corporate trainer.
First they had to answer trivia questions about castaways
eliminated in earlier episodes. Kelly triumphed, displaying
impressive social skills; she knew even the middle names of the
children of a former cast mate. With Kelly gaining immunity, Susan
was ousted, and the remaining islanders had to hold a hand on a
totem pole for hours until their patience ran out. Kelly won again,
showing quiet fortitude and an iron will.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial moment came when the last two, Kelly and
Richard, had to present their cases to a jury of their ex-peers.
One hopes that the presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore, were watching and taking notes. Kelly
learned that to win an election, dazzling social skills _ or quiet
fortitude and an iron will _ are not enough. The winner needs a
speech that inspires and empowers the undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who won, excelled at defining his candidacy. This
year's presidential candidates tried to make similarly effective
speeches at their televised conventions, with the added problem of
having a larger electorate to persuade _ and many fewer people
watching than the CBS audience of 50 million, eclipsed only by the
Super Bowl. Comparisons between the candidates and survivors proved
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   _ JENNY LYN BADER
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, defined himself as an
outsider:
</P>
<P>
   I come from a different place, and it has made me a different
leader. In Midland, Texas, where I grew up, the town motto was
''the sky's the limit.'' And we believed it ... Neighbors helped
each other ... This background leaves more than an accent, it
leaves an outlook ...
</P>
<P>
   That background may lack the polish of Washington. Then again, I
don't have a lot of things that come with Washington. I don't have
enemies to fight. I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the
last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of
civility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said she was no politician. She hoped she had made no
enemies and asked her tribe to judge her not on what she had done
on the island, but on who she is and how much fun she is to have
around:
</P>
<P>
   Um, I'm not a politician. I didn't come here to campaign for
myself. I think we're all adults here. I think we all know that,
you know, this is a game, and I hope nobody has taken anything
personally ... I hope we're not going to be judged here on how we
chose to play the game. I'm hoping what we're going to be judged on
_ or I personally will be judged on _ is the person that I am, the
conversations that we had, the time we spent together, the things
we talked about. You know, with that game we played the other night
_ how well did you get to know people ... I didn't have the
conversations I had with you and want to know things about you and
share my life with you because I thought I was going to be quizzed
on it or it was part of my strategy. It was because we were all
here together, and I cared to know all of you ... (If) we were
voting for the sweetest or the nicest or things like that maybe
neither of us would be up here. I don't know that the best person
is sitting up here. But hopefully, you know, the better person will
win.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, concerned that the national election was starting to
resemble a high school one, asked constituents to vote not for the
more popular guy, but for the one who works the hardest and even
makes unpopular decisions:
</P>
<P>
   I know my own imperfections. I know that sometimes people say
I'm too serious, that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe
I've done that tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But the presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a
day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes, you have to choose to do
what's difficult or unpopular. Sometimes, you have to be willing to
spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy
wrong ...
</P>
<P>
   I know I won't always be the most exciting politician. But I
pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will
never let you down.
</P>
<P>
   Richard took an even blunter
vote-for-me-even-if-you-don't-like-me approach. And he hoped his
achievements would be respected, if not beloved:
</P>
<P>
   I take a little bit of a different approach to it. For me, it's
not about you deciding who the best person is. I don't think you
really know who I am and probably don't know who Kelly is. My
approach to the game was one of strategy from the beginning. Before
I even got here, I started to think about what it might take to get
through 14 ejections, and it got really complicated. And I couldn't
really plan it as well as I thought _ and it certainly didn't turn
out to go according to plan. But I certainly had a strategy, and I
came to play a game, and I was playing a game. There were a lot of
sincere interactions, but no matter how sincere they were I don't
think anybody really knows who we are in only 39 days. I think the
starts of friendships are certainly things that have happened, but
for me instead of who's the better person it is about who played
the game better. And I'm hoping you just respect my having
approached the game from that perspective from early, early, early
on.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, an early favorite, endorsed Bush, honoring a
campaign promise. In a letter to his supporters in May, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   From the first day of my campaign, I said repeatedly that if I
did not win the Republican nomination for president, I would
support whoever did. This was a pledge I made when I was at 3
percent in the polls and repeated again throughout the primaries.
And like all the promises I made along the campaign trail, this was
one I intended to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, a military hero with a reputation for straight talk, had
called Richard names in the past, but he voted for Richard, simply
because the two forged an alliance. He explained his vote to Bryant
Gumbel in the post-finale reunion:
</P>
<P>
   We set up an alliance and I gave him my word, and my word is
good.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, said he joined the race
to critique both the Democrats and Republicans. Announcing his
candidacy, he said:
</P>
<P>
   This is the foundation of our campaign, to focus on active
citizenship, to create fresh political movements that will displace
the control of the Democratic and Republican parties, two
apparently distinct political entities that feed at the same
corporate trough. They are in fact simply the two heads of one
political duopoly, the DemRep Party. This duopoly does everything
it can to obstruct the beginnings of new parties including raising
ballot access barriers, entrenching winner-take-all voting systems,
and thwarting participation in debates at election times.
</P>
<P>
   Susan, the unlikely Ralph Nader of Pulau Tiga, expressed her
disdain for both front-runners, with a special animosity reserved
for the one with whom she had been closest in the past:
</P>
<P>
   I plead to the jury tonight to think a little bit about the
island that we have been on. This island is pretty much full of
only two things, snakes and rats. And in the end, with Mother
Nature, we have Richard, the snake, who knowingly went after prey,
and Kelly, who turned into the rat, that ran around like the rats
do on this island, trying to run from the snakes. I feel we owe it
to the island's spirits that we have learned to come to know to let
it be in the end the way Mother Nature intended it to be: for the
snake to eat the rat.

   The two candidates surveyed their voters and saw a group evenly
divided _ loyal stalwarts on each side, swing voters in the middle.
Pundits and fans who had followed the race closely had no idea who
would win. Even casual observers said it would be neck and neck.
The venue was the nerve-racking finale of the CBS hit show
``Survivor,'' in which 16 castaways endured trials, forged
alliances and ate bugs in their quest to win a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with four finalists vying for the prize: Susan
Hawk, the truck driver; Rudy Boesch, the ex-Navy Seal; Kelly
Wiglesworth, the river guide; Richard Hatch, the corporate trainer.
First they had to answer trivia questions about castaways
eliminated in earlier episodes. Kelly triumphed, displaying
impressive social skills; she knew even the middle names of the
children of a former cast mate. With Kelly gaining immunity, Susan
was ousted, and the remaining islanders had to hold a hand on a
totem pole for hours until their patience ran out. Kelly won again,
showing quiet fortitude and an iron will.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial moment came when the last two, Kelly and
Richard, had to present their cases to a jury of their ex-peers.
One hopes that the presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore, were watching and taking notes. Kelly
learned that to win an election, dazzling social skills _ or quiet
fortitude and an iron will _ are not enough. The winner needs a
speech that inspires and empowers the undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who won, excelled at defining his candidacy. This
year's presidential candidates tried to make similarly effective
speeches at their televised conventions, with the added problem of
having a larger electorate to persuade _ and many fewer people
watching than the CBS audience of 50 million, eclipsed only by the
Super Bowl. Comparisons between the candidates and survivors proved
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   _ JENNY LYN BADER
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, defined himself as an
outsider:
</P>
<P>
   I come from a different place, and it has made me a different
leader. In Midland, Texas, where I grew up, the town motto was
''the sky's the limit.'' And we believed it ... Neighbors helped
each other ... This background leaves more than an accent, it
leaves an outlook ...
</P>
<P>
   That background may lack the polish of Washington. Then again, I
don't have a lot of things that come with Washington. I don't have
enemies to fight. I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the
last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of
civility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said she was no politician. She hoped she had made no
enemies and asked her tribe to judge her not on what she had done
on the island, but on who she is and how much fun she is to have
around:
</P>
<P>
   Um, I'm not a politician. I didn't come here to campaign for
myself. I think we're all adults here. I think we all know that,
you know, this is a game, and I hope nobody has taken anything
personally ... I hope we're not going to be judged here on how we
chose to play the game. I'm hoping what we're going to be judged on
_ or I personally will be judged on _ is the person that I am, the
conversations that we had, the time we spent together, the things
we talked about. You know, with that game we played the other night
_ how well did you get to know people ... I didn't have the
conversations I had with you and want to know things about you and
share my life with you because I thought I was going to be quizzed
on it or it was part of my strategy. It was because we were all
here together, and I cared to know all of you ... (If) we were
voting for the sweetest or the nicest or things like that maybe
neither of us would be up here. I don't know that the best person
is sitting up here. But hopefully, you know, the better person will
win.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, concerned that the national election was starting to
resemble a high school one, asked constituents to vote not for the
more popular guy, but for the one who works the hardest and even
makes unpopular decisions:
</P>
<P>
   I know my own imperfections. I know that sometimes people say
I'm too serious, that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe
I've done that tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But the presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a
day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes, you have to choose to do
what's difficult or unpopular. Sometimes, you have to be willing to
spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy
wrong ...
</P>
<P>
   I know I won't always be the most exciting politician. But I
pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will
never let you down.
</P>
<P>
   Richard took an even blunter
vote-for-me-even-if-you-don't-like-me approach. And he hoped his
achievements would be respected, if not beloved:
</P>
<P>
   I take a little bit of a different approach to it. For me, it's
not about you deciding who the best person is. I don't think you
really know who I am and probably don't know who Kelly is. My
approach to the game was one of strategy from the beginning. Before
I even got here, I started to think about what it might take to get
through 14 ejections, and it got really complicated. And I couldn't
really plan it as well as I thought _ and it certainly didn't turn
out to go according to plan. But I certainly had a strategy, and I
came to play a game, and I was playing a game. There were a lot of
sincere interactions, but no matter how sincere they were I don't
think anybody really knows who we are in only 39 days. I think the
starts of friendships are certainly things that have happened, but
for me instead of who's the better person it is about who played
the game better. And I'm hoping you just respect my having
approached the game from that perspective from early, early, early
on.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, an early favorite, endorsed Bush, honoring a
campaign promise. In a letter to his supporters in May, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   From the first day of my campaign, I said repeatedly that if I
did not win the Republican nomination for president, I would
support whoever did. This was a pledge I made when I was at 3
percent in the polls and repeated again throughout the primaries.
And like all the promises I made along the campaign trail, this was
one I intended to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, a military hero with a reputation for straight talk, had
called Richard names in the past, but he voted for Richard, simply
because the two forged an alliance. He explained his vote to Bryant
Gumbel in the post-finale reunion:
</P>
<P>
   We set up an alliance and I gave him my word, and my word is
good.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, said he joined the race
to critique both the Democrats and Republicans. Announcing his
candidacy, he said:
</P>
<P>
   This is the foundation of our campaign, to focus on active
citizenship, to create fresh political movements that will displace
the control of the Democratic and Republican parties, two
apparently distinct political entities that feed at the same
corporate trough. They are in fact simply the two heads of one
political duopoly, the DemRep Party. This duopoly does everything
it can to obstruct the beginnings of new parties including raising
ballot access barriers, entrenching winner-take-all voting systems,
and thwarting participation in debates at election times.
</P>
<P>
   Susan, the unlikely Ralph Nader of Pulau Tiga, expressed her
disdain for both front-runners, with a special animosity reserved
for the one with whom she had been closest in the past:
</P>
<P>
   I plead to the jury tonight to think a little bit about the
island that we have been on. This island is pretty much full of
only two things, snakes and rats. And in the end, with Mother
Nature, we have Richard, the snake, who knowingly went after prey,
and Kelly, who turned into the rat, that ran around like the rats
do on this island, trying to run from the snakes. I feel we owe it
to the island's spirits that we have learned to come to know to let
it be in the end the way Mother Nature intended it to be: for the
snake to eat the rat.

   BERLIN _ It is an irony of modern German history that national
unity was achieved just as the nation-state model in Western Europe
was being drained of its political content. The vast new
Chancellery under construction in Berlin, resembling an outsized
ocean liner on the banks of the Spree, has become an object of some
mockery partly because the power actually wielded in the building
will be slight. European integration, the creation of a euro
currency governed by a European central bank, and the might of
financial markets have made big inroads on national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   As the 10th anniversary of German unification approaches on Oct.
3, it seems clear that this conjunction of recovered German
nationhood with a diminished nation state has had some disturbing
effects. In the east, patriotism was central to the former
communist state, propagated on the idea that its worker-hero
citizens were the superior Germans. Its demise left a spiritual
emptiness. People complain they no longer have a heimat _ the
emotive German word for home. Some have joined rightist,
anti-immigrant movements to defend the ``homeland'' they feel they
have lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the west, some intellectuals and mainstream politicians are
questioning the virtual post-war dogma of subsuming Germany's
wounded identity in Europe's and confining any patriotism to an
almost abstract commitment to the values of freedom and human
rights enshrined in the post-war constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of foreigners is linked to the dismantlement of the
nation-state involved in the construction of the European Union,''
Roland Koch, the Christian Democratic premier of the western state
of Hesse, warned recently. He urged Germany to be more assertive in
pursuit of its national interests, ``like England and France.''
From a Christian Democrat, a man from the party of that most
committed of Europeans, Helmut Kohl, such words amounted to the
breaking of a taboo.
</P>
<P>
   And so the giant of Europe is edging toward its October
anniversary in a mood of some agitation, wondering aloud what to do
about rightist extremism, pondering where the roots of xenophobia
lie, lamenting the misunderstanding between Wessis and Ossis
(Westerners and Easterners), groping for a shared sense of German
identity that is nonthreatening.
</P>
<P>
   As Germany mulls over these questions, it might consider the
scene in central Chemnitz, an important industrial center of the
former East German state where unification has brought the
frustrations of 20 percent unemployment and, at a deeper level, the
angst of a void. Here an enormous bust of Karl Marx, backed by a
mural inscribed with ``Working Men of All Countries Unite,'' stands
on a pedestal used by youths in reversed caps clattering around on
skateboards. Down the street a Citibank does brisk business and a
McDonald's offers a menu in the gruesome mixture of German and
English widely known as Denglisch.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying this jarring scene, Michael Nier, a theorist for the
rightist National Democratic Party, shook his head. ``In East
Germany, we were a proud state, and we wanted to be the better
Germany,'' he said. ``Now we are becoming a mere colony of American
financial capital, a place that has lost all identity, and every
upstanding German should stand up and fight this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nier dismissed the skinhead violence against foreigners, calling
it the work of ``marginal rightist anarchism.'' But then he
developed some angry arguments. The West had destroyed East
Germany. In its place, America had set about implanting a
multicultural society because ``in a certain chaos, a certain
disorientation, it is easier to govern and control people.''
</P>
<P>
   The German government, in the pocket of big industry with global
interests, had no willingness to resist this process, Nier
continued, because ``it has no more concept of Germany.'' So the
National Democratic Party would prosper because ``people do not
want this leveled world society that speaks English and eats
hamburgers'' and because most Germans ``want this to remain our
land, not a place with 2 million Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Nier's party represents a tiny fringe of opinion _ it has 6,500
members. But in his indignant sense of loss, in his suspicion of
the West, he is not an unrepresentative figure of the east. People
feel stripped of their pride, reduced, in a commonly heard phrase,
to ``second-class citizens,'' which makes them inclined to look for
scapegoats, a method dear to communist states. The easiest person
to pick on is, of course, a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological adjustment for Germans in the east has been
the more difficult; they were never taught to forswear German
national pride as people in the west were. Sandra Breka, who was
raised in the southwestern city of Stuttgart, recalled being unable
to eat lunch at school after sitting through history lessons where
documentary films of Nazi concentration camps had been shown. ``The
piles of teeth, the piles of shoes, the piles of bodies, I can see
them still,'' said Breka, 28. ``And every year from fifth grade we
saw them. The message, of course, was clear: Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the east, however, the message was uplifting, couched in the
myth that the Germans of the communist state had resisted Hitler's
capitalist regime. The Buchenwald concentration camp was a rite of
passage for schoolchildren who, above all, went to see the cell
where the chairman of the prewar German communist party, Ernst
Thaelmann, died in 1944. East Germans could feel proud because they
were the true heirs to Thaelmann, who became an icon in the east,
immortalized as ``a great son of the German people murdered by
fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   And where is that pride today? Even in the west, there are signs
of conservative intellectual stirrings among people eager to
rediscover a German patriotism, tired of what they regard as the
blackmailing of an American-dominated ``Holocaust industry,''
convinced that Germany has paid and done enough to atone.
</P>
<P>
   The recent award of one of Germany's most prestigious literary
prizes to Ernst Nolte, a historian who has argued that Nazism was a
riposte to Bolshevism in a European civil war, was one sign of this
trend. Speaking in June, Nolte said the politically correct
argument for ``an unstoppable transition toward world
civilization'' was dangerous, and the collective guilt imposed on
Germany since 1945 was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, at unification, Kohl accepted that German guilt.
He abandoned any claim to formerly German lands in Poland; he
abandoned the beloved mark for the euro. These were the clearest
signs he could give Germany's nervous allies that this newly united
state would be unthreatening because its identity lay in a Europe
at peace. But if the allies were happy, it is now clear that not
all Germans were. For the long-awaited unification gathered them
suddenly in a big country committed to the noble, but scarcely
stirring, aim of being a unit of the European Union.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When Guadalupe Loaeza hears her country's next
president urging a more open border between the United States and
Mexico, her heart floods with contradictory emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In struggling to describe the inner tug-of-war, Loaeza, a
successful writer, talks about the many times she has driven across
the divide between Tijuana and San Diego. It's a journey that
starts with the fear of being assaulted by the gangs of thieves
known to prowl the area; the aggravation of waiting in smog-choked
lines of cars, with street vendors banging on the windows hawking
statuettes of the Virgin of Guadalupe in one hand and a Mickey
Mouse doll in the other; the depressing signs of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the U.S. side, she says, the sun literally seems to
shine brighter, and her head fills with game-show tunes. She gorges
herself on shopping in fine department stores. Then she plops
herself at the best table at the city's best seafood restaurant and
orders the biggest lobster she can get.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, she said, her waiter is Mexican. The busboys and
dishwashers are, too. She scrunches her Saks Fifth Avenue bags out
of sight as feelings of shame and sadness sweep over her once
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is a very painful place for me because it reminds
me of all that Mexico has been unable to achieve,'' she said.
``Driving from one side to the other, in a space that is
geographically only a few miles wide, you feel as though you have
traveled between two different worlds. And for me it is very
painful that the world where there is most of the misery and
poverty and corruption is Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Vicente Fox paid his first visit to Washington
as Mexico's president-elect and informally presented his ideas for
a more liberal northward flow of Mexican workers, he was speaking
to a country that sees its southern border mostly as a pathetically
inadequate barrier, one that fails to keep out drugs, crime and the
tidal wave of some 150,000 undocumented Mexicans each year.
</P>
<P>
   But for Mexicans, the proposals have stirred a flurry of mixed
emotions. Among the poor, whose sons and husbands are the most
likely to venture illegally across the border in search of decent
wages, Fox's proposals have raised hopes that they might soon be
able to cross safely and with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   For the middle classes, an opening of the border seems more a
necessary evil. To them, the border is the epicenter of Mexico's
love-hate relationship with the United States. Because the border
is the gateway to the most powerful country in the world, it is at
once mythical and a place where Mexico's disadvantages are
magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Calderon, a 21-year-old college student from the state of
Guanajuato, said that migration to the United States dominates its
culture. Guanajuato is the home of Fox and has the nation's third
highest rate of migration to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here,'' Calderon groaned, ``children do not talk about
growing up to become doctors or lawyers. They grow up planning to
go to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a well-known poet, grew up in Michoacan, a state
that also has a high rate of migration north. He never felt drawn
to the border as a boy, he said. And feels less so as a man.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't even see the border region as truly Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I go there I feel ashamed,'' he said. ``I wonder, why
is it Mexico has to have such a hideous border, full of people
trying to get bribes, full of environmental problems, full of
poverty? It's the place where all of the negative parts of Mexico
thrive best.''
</P>
<P>
   Primitivo Rodriguez, a political analyst, had a more optimistic
view. The border, he said, has become an engine of new prosperity
in the wake of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Border
cities, thanks to the American-owned factories called maquiladoras,
have Mexico's lowest unemployment rates and access to rare goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
   What some Mexicans consider an insufferable invasion of all
things American into Mexican border cities _ where radio stations

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When Guadalupe Loaeza hears her country's next
president urging a more open border between the United States and
Mexico, her heart floods with contradictory emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In struggling to describe the inner tug-of-war, Loaeza, a
successful writer, talks about the many times she has driven across
the divide between Tijuana and San Diego. It's a journey that
starts with the fear of being assaulted by the gangs of thieves
known to prowl the area; the aggravation of waiting in smog-choked
lines of cars, with street vendors banging on the windows hawking
statuettes of the Virgin of Guadalupe in one hand and a Mickey
Mouse doll in the other; the depressing signs of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the U.S. side, she says, the sun literally seems to
shine brighter, and her head fills with game-show tunes. She gorges
herself on shopping in fine department stores. Then she plops
herself at the best table at the city's best seafood restaurant and
orders the biggest lobster she can get.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, she said, her waiter is Mexican. The busboys and
dishwashers are, too. She scrunches her Saks Fifth Avenue bags out
of sight as feelings of shame and sadness sweep over her once
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is a very painful place for me because it reminds
me of all that Mexico has been unable to achieve,'' she said.
``Driving from one side to the other, in a space that is
geographically only a few miles wide, you feel as though you have
traveled between two different worlds. And for me it is very
painful that the world where there is most of the misery and
poverty and corruption is Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Vicente Fox paid his first visit to Washington
as Mexico's president-elect and informally presented his ideas for
a more liberal northward flow of Mexican workers, he was speaking
to a country that sees its southern border mostly as a pathetically
inadequate barrier, one that fails to keep out drugs, crime and the
tidal wave of some 150,000 undocumented Mexicans each year.
</P>
<P>
   But for Mexicans, the proposals have stirred a flurry of mixed
emotions. Among the poor, whose sons and husbands are the most
likely to venture illegally across the border in search of decent
wages, Fox's proposals have raised hopes that they might soon be
able to cross safely and with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   For the middle classes, an opening of the border seems more a
necessary evil. To them, the border is the epicenter of Mexico's
love-hate relationship with the United States. Because the border
is the gateway to the most powerful country in the world, it is at
once mythical and a place where Mexico's disadvantages are
magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Calderon, a 21-year-old college student from the state of
Guanajuato, said that migration to the United States dominates its
culture. Guanajuato is the home of Fox and has the nation's third
highest rate of migration to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here,'' Calderon groaned, ``children do not talk about
growing up to become doctors or lawyers. They grow up planning to
go to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a well-known poet, grew up in Michoacan, a state
that also has a high rate of migration north. He never felt drawn
to the border as a boy, he said. And feels less so as a man.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't even see the border region as truly Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I go there I feel ashamed,'' he said. ``I wonder, why
is it Mexico has to have such a hideous border, full of people
trying to get bribes, full of environmental problems, full of
poverty? It's the place where all of the negative parts of Mexico
thrive best.''
</P>
<P>
   Primitivo Rodriguez, a political analyst, had a more optimistic
view. The border, he said, has become an engine of new prosperity
in the wake of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Border
cities, thanks to the American-owned factories called maquiladoras,
have Mexico's lowest unemployment rates and access to rare goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
   What some Mexicans consider an insufferable invasion of all
things American into Mexican border cities _ where radio stations
play more rock 'n' roll than rancheros and people eat flour
tortillas rather than corn _ Rodriguez considers a dynamic cultural
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the border as sort of a great line of defense of Mexican
culture,'' he said. ``It is easy to speak Spanish and sing the
Mexican national anthem when you are in Chiapas or Mexico City. But
when you hear the anthem in Tijuana or when someone shouts `Viva
Mexico,' in the streets of Ciudad Juarez, it has much deeper
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Mexican way of saying to America, `I may have to listen
to your music. I may have to learn to speak English. I may even
have to work for you. But don't ever forget I am a Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug trafficking and illegal immigration has given the border
a bad image here and in the United States,'' he said. ``But cities
like Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are the fastest-growing cultural and
economic centers of the country.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 27:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-NIGERIA (Abuja, Nigeria) _ President Clinton kicked off
a three-day trip to Africa, landing in the capital of Nigeria to
help support the still-shaky transition of Africa's most populous
country to civilian rule from 16 years of military dictatorship.
Awaiting Clinton at the airport was Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former general who was elected in a peaceful transition
15 months ago after the death of the country's longtime military
ruler. It was the first face-to-face meeting between Clinton and
the Nigerian leader, and the first visit by an American president
to Nigeria since Jimmy Carter in 1978. By Marc Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-VOICES (Abuja, Nigeria) _ Among those standing outside
the gates of the hotel where the world's most powerful man had just
checked in, there lurked a simmering anger beneath the hope his
visit inspired. President Clinton had been brought to the Nicon
Hilton and would soon go visit President Olusegun Obasanjo. Despite
the Nigerian authorities' efforts to clear people away from the
street outside the hotel, a crowd had built up _ out-of-state
visitors, displaced street hawkers, the jobless, all ordinary
Nigerians struggling to be heard. On a continent seldom visited by
American presidents, the hope was that Clinton would erase all
their suffering. ``We are suffering,'' one man said. ``Let
President Clinton see me.'' By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   HAMAS-LEADER (Gaza City, Gaza Strip) _ As Israel and the
Palestinians circle each other in a wary and increasingly fractious
quest for a final peace agreement, the spotlight only rarely
settles these days on a small, wizened, straggly bearded man in a
wheelchair whose antagonism to Israel could one day unsettle or
even destroy any deal that establishes a Palestinian state pledged
to co-existence with Israel. He is Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, 64,
spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas. By
John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-MARIJUANA (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ As Canada's
health department looks this fall for a reliable supplier of almost
1 million marijuana cigarettes for clinical trials, some Canadians
say it need look no farther than British Columbia, where relaxed
attitudes about smoking marijuana have helped turn the province
into a major North American producer for some of the drug's
strongest strains. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   SOMALIA-BUSH (Mogadishu, Somalia) _ Somalis who speak little
English will still giggle and say: ``Read my lips.'' Despite mixed
feelings about Americans here, there is strong affection for the
father _ as a man who tried to make peace in Somalia _ that has
rubbed off on the son this American election year. ``We are
following it,'' said Shuayb Abdi Karim, 30. ``And we support
Bush.'' Or ``Bush Junior,'' as George W. Bush is sometimes called
here. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   AFGHANISTAN-EMBARGO (United Nations) _ As some Security Council
members, led by Russia and the United States, move toward
increasing sanctions on the militant Islamic government of
Afghanistan, a report by the United Nations' relief coordinator
there says that the existing economic embargo is having ``a
tangible negative effect'' on the country and on efforts to help
the Afghan people. The embargo, which has grounded international
traffic by the national airline, Ariana, is also further isolating
Afghans and making it more difficult for the outside world to deal
with their leaders, the report found. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-WOUNDS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ ``I've experienced it
all,'' Pramoedya Ananta ToerPramoedya, the nation's most prominent
writer, said. ``I've been beaten, hit, tortured, humiliated. There
cannot be forgiveness.'' Now that President Suharto is gone and
speech is free, Indonesian society is filled with a clamor of
voices over the abuses perpetrated during Indonesia's three decades
of authoritarian rule. The question is, just how much strength and
energy does this unsteady nation have to reopen old wounds and
reignite old enmities? By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-KARMAPA (Undated) _ Representatives of a major Buddhist
order have petitioned the Indian government to grant asylum and
freedom of movement to their 15-year-old leader, the Karmapa, who
remains under virtual house arrest at a monastery in northern India
eight months after fleeing Tibet. About 400 of his followers from
around the world, including a contingent from the order's American
headquarters in Woodstock, N.Y., met in India last week to consider
their next moves. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-EGYPT (Washington) _ After accusing Egypt of obstructing
the Camp David summit, the Clinton administration is now focusing
on the Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, as the key to finding a
solution in the Middle East, particularly on the future status of
Jerusalem. President Clinton is due to see Mubarak in Cairo Tuesday
on the way home from Africa. ``Getting the Egyptians involved is
key and they want to be involved,'' a White House official said. By
Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   LEBANON-POLITICS (Beirut, Lebanon) _ Ten years after Syrian
forces snuffed out Lebanon's civil war, this battered country is
entering a crucial parliamentary election marked by a deepening
economic crisis, widespread public cynicism and startlingly open
denunciations of vote-rigging and Syrian domination. By John
Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTORY-ASSISTANCE (Undated) _ Because the whole directory
assistance system is a lot more complicated than it used to be,
every consumer in the United States probably has at least one tale
of woe about calling to find a phone number. Maybe they dialed 411
in New York and could not get a listing for the Empire State
Building. Or they called 555-1212 in Los Angeles and were asked to
spell Sunset Boulevard. But anyone hoping for federal or state
regulators to step in and fix directory assistance might find their
time better spent reading the phone book. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-PRISONS (Delano, Calif.) _ A new prison proposed for this
town _ California's 24th new prison since the state began the
biggest prison-building boom in the nation's history in 1980 _ may
not be a done deal. A coalition of groups has sued the state to
stop the prison, ostensibly on environmental grounds, but in fact
to force the state to re-examine its prison-building plans and
rethink its strict policies limiting paroles. The groups contend
that it would be much more beneficial to the state and offenders
if, instead of incarceration, the authorities began pushing
treatment for those convicted of drug use and mentoring and job
opportunities for young people at risk. The debate reflects a
larger one nationwide over whether the country is building too many
prisons. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-PRAYER (Hattiesburg, Miss.) _ It started slowly at first,
a few students holding hands in the bleachers and saying ``Our
Father who art in Heaven'' while football players gathered on the
North Forrest High School field Friday night. But by the time they
got to ``deliver us from evil,'' most of the crowd of 4,500 was
standing, proudly reciting the Lord's Prayer, insisting that God
cannot be removed even from a Class 4A high school football game.
School officials carefully stayed out of the way, in order not to
violate a June decision of the U.S. Supreme Court prohibiting
student-led prayer at games and assemblies if it is officially
sanctioned by the school. The scene was repeated, with various
levels of participation, at scores of high school football games
around the South Friday night, and is likely to grow as word
catches on. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO-GIRLS-SCHOOL (Chicago) _ Kai Penn had always planned to
be an actress, model and singer, but the sixth grader says her
career aspirations will probably change now that she is a student
at the Young Women's Leadership Charter School here. ``I go on the
Internet a lot,'' said Kai, 11, on her first day at the South Side
school. ``It was my dad's idea for me to go here. It's pretty cool.
Maybe I'll be a tech person now.'' Seventy-five sixth-grade and
ninth-grade girls are the first students to enroll in Chicago's
first all-girls public school, and one of the few public all-girls
schools in the nation. Perhaps more important, it is one of even
fewer girls schools, public or private, to focus primarily on math,
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-BUSINESS (Undated) _ Joseph I. Lieberman has
introduced himself to the American people this month on a decidedly
populist note, lashing out against oil companies, assailing
industrial polluters and calling for greater government spending on
health care. But behind the traditional Democratic oratory of his
convention speech is a senator who has described himself as being
``pro-business, pro-trade and pro-economic growth.'' Lieberman's
pro-business record contrasts sharply not only with his own speech
at the Democratic National Convention, but also with the larger
message that Vice President Al Gore has been sending recently. By
Leslie Wayne and Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-HISPANICS (El Paso, Texas) _ When George W. Bush was
re-elected governor of Texas in 1998 by a landslide, he not only
made a surprisingly strong showing with Hispanic voters statewide,
but he even won El Paso, an overwhelmingly Hispanic city that no
Republican had ever won. ``It opened eyes among Republicans across
the country,'' said Kenneth Carr, chairman of the city's Republican
Party. Now, as he campaigns for president, Bush is courting
Hispanic voters nationwide. In speeches, he often mentions the 1998
race as evidence of his commitment to inclusiveness and proof that
his policies offer benefits that are colorblind. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ In barely a week, Republicans
and Democrats have switched places in a striking reversal. After
looming over the race for months as the man to beat, George W. Bush
suddenly seemed not so invincible. And after months of reinvention,
after months of reassuring restive Democrats, Al Gore was, if not
on top, certainly on the offensive. The shift was prompted largely
by opinion surveys showing that Gore had pulled even with Bush
after the Democratic convention. But where the contenders stand now
is much less important than where they will stand after Labor Day,
when voters begin to take closer notice of the campaign. By Richard
L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-HEALTHCARE (Washington) _ Riding a wave of success on his
prescription drug plan, Vice President Al Gore plans to dedicate
all of next week to a cross-country discussion of health-care
issues and a comparison of his proposals with those of Gov. George
W. Bush. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NIXON-BOOK (Washington) _ President Nixon medicated himself with
a mood-altering prescription drug in the White House and, depressed
by hostile public reaction to the bombing of Cambodia in 1970, he
consulted a New York psychotherapist who considered him
``neurotic,'' according to a biography to be published on Monday.
Moreover, concern about Nixon's mental state in 1974 led the
secretary of defense, James R. Schlesinger, to order all military
units not to react to orders from ``the White House'' unless they
were cleared with him or the secretary of state, writes Anthony
Summers in ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard
Nixon.'' By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-LUNCH-SALMONELLA (Undated) _ Agriculture Department
officials say they are discussing the possibility of loosening
their new standards for preventing salmonella contamination in
ground beef used for the nation's school lunch program. The
reconsideration, which was provoked by criticism from the food
industry, has angered consumer advocates. By Marian Burros.

<P>
   The family values platform has been the stomping ground of
Republicans for so long that there has been little room for the
Democrats. But last week, riding a wave of strong polls following
his family-friendly speech at the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles, Vice President Al Gore reiterated his intention to
make families, particularly ``working families,'' the focus of his
campaign. Gore projected himself as a devoted husband and father
who understands that all families want the same opportunities for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   But where does all the talk about parents leave unmarried,
childless voters, a group that has supported the Democratic Party
by a strong majority in recent years? The risk is that such appeals
will keep this block, which includes single women, a group that has
been growing since 1970, at home, .
</P>
<P>
   According to polls by the Voter News Service, a consortium of
television networks and The Associated Press, single adults made up
34 percent of voters in 1996. These voters have supported the
Democratic candidate for president in significantly larger
percentages than married voters have in every presidential election
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties have directed appeals particularly to
mothers by stressing certain issues like education, gun control and
health care. But they have virtually ignored unmarried women. The
percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 24 who had never
married doubled from 35.8 percent in 1970 to 70.3 percent in 1997.
During that same period, the percentage of never-married women
increased nearly fourfold in the 25-to-29 age group. Time just
proclaimed that single women have moved to the center of national
social and cultural life from a position of obscurity. Yet in the
political landscape they are still invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose his oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, to second
his nomination for president at the convention. He sent a message:
His role as a father is one of the most important criteria that
qualify him for president. Although Schiff has been an adviser to
her father, she became a more visible member of his campaign only
after she married and became a mother. In his convention speech
Gore invoked family no fewer than 50 times. On the other hand,
Bush, the Republican candidate, used it only six times.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore announced his candidacy in June 1999, he used family
25 times. Delivering the commencement speech at Harvard University
in 1994, he said: ``I believe in finding fulfillment in family, for
the family is the true center of a meaningful life. Cynics may say:
All families are confining and ultimately dysfunctional; the very
idea of family is outdated and unworkable. But the cynics are
wrong. It is in our families that we learn to love.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the single lifestyle becoming increasingly popular,
particularly among women, Gore's family focus may alienate those
who are trying to take pride in what has been seen as a less than
ideal choice in a society that values marriage and childbearing
highly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's national spokesman, Doug Hattaway, said many of the
issues Gore addresses, like prescription benefits, appeal to all
people, including those ``who are not yet parents.'' Implicit is
perhaps the assumption that the childless and single will one day
become parents, that they are responsive to a message that focuses
on families.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that is often true. Still not everyone is destined for
parenthood. ``In every society there are people who never marry and
live a contented life,'' said David Popenoe of the National
Marriage Project at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Why do politicians often ignore this huge group of voters? This
rather large and amorphous body does not define itself as a group;
the voters in it are also often folded into other target
demographic categories, including younger voters, ethnic groups,
divorced people, widowers and those older adults who have never
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the groups we look at are groups that we've heard
campaigns are targeting,'' said Jeffrey M. Jones, managing editor
of the Gallup Poll. ``Single voters are a group that's never really
been talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to obtain data on unmarried voters, probably
because they have not yet emerged as a lobby, although the lobbying
branch of the American Association for Single People, a
California-based organization that promotes the rights of unmarried
people, is planning a national advertising campaign directed at
unmarried voters who feel underserved by the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Coleman, executive director of the association, says that
he has been struggling for decades to secure equal rights for
single people and to enlist organizations like the National
Organization for Women and the American Civil Liberties Union to
promote the inclusion of marital status as a nondiscrimination
category in proposed civil rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Single people feel that they're being ignored or discounted,''
Coleman said. ``It certainly doesn't make you feel very motivated
to go out and vote.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton skillfully appealed both to people with
families and to those who are alone. In his 1996 speech he stressed
working families, too, but welcomed anyone who wanted to be part of
a larger American family.

   The family values platform has been the stomping ground of
Republicans for so long that there has been little room for the
Democrats. But last week, riding a wave of strong polls following
his family-friendly speech at the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles, Vice President Al Gore reiterated his intention to
make families, particularly ``working families,'' the focus of his
campaign. Gore projected himself as a devoted husband and father
who understands that all families want the same opportunities for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   But where does all the talk about parents leave unmarried,
childless voters, a group that has supported the Democratic Party
by a strong majority in recent years? The risk is that such appeals
will keep this block, which includes single women, a group that has
been growing since 1970, at home, .
</P>
<P>
   According to polls by the Voter News Service, a consortium of
television networks and The Associated Press, single adults made up
34 percent of voters in 1996. These voters have supported the
Democratic candidate for president in significantly larger
percentages than married voters have in every presidential election
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties have directed appeals particularly to
mothers by stressing certain issues like education, gun control and
health care. But they have virtually ignored unmarried women. The
percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 24 who had never
married doubled from 35.8 percent in 1970 to 70.3 percent in 1997.
During that same period, the percentage of never-married women
increased nearly fourfold in the 25-to-29 age group. Time just
proclaimed that single women have moved to the center of national
social and cultural life from a position of obscurity. Yet in the
political landscape they are still invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose his oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, to second
his nomination for president at the convention. He sent a message:
His role as a father is one of the most important criteria that
qualify him for president. Although Schiff has been an adviser to
her father, she became a more visible member of his campaign only
after she married and became a mother. In his convention speech
Gore invoked family no fewer than 50 times. On the other hand,
Bush, the Republican candidate, used it only six times.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore announced his candidacy in June 1999, he used family
25 times. Delivering the commencement speech at Harvard University
in 1994, he said: ``I believe in finding fulfillment in family, for
the family is the true center of a meaningful life. Cynics may say:
All families are confining and ultimately dysfunctional; the very
idea of family is outdated and unworkable. But the cynics are
wrong. It is in our families that we learn to love.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the single lifestyle becoming increasingly popular,
particularly among women, Gore's family focus may alienate those
who are trying to take pride in what has been seen as a less than
ideal choice in a society that values marriage and childbearing
highly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's national spokesman, Doug Hattaway, said many of the
issues Gore addresses, like prescription benefits, appeal to all
people, including those ``who are not yet parents.'' Implicit is
perhaps the assumption that the childless and single will one day
become parents, that they are responsive to a message that focuses
on families.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that is often true. Still not everyone is destined for
parenthood. ``In every society there are people who never marry and
live a contented life,'' said David Popenoe of the National
Marriage Project at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Why do politicians often ignore this huge group of voters? This
rather large and amorphous body does not define itself as a group;
the voters in it are also often folded into other target
demographic categories, including younger voters, ethnic groups,
divorced people, widowers and those older adults who have never
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the groups we look at are groups that we've heard
campaigns are targeting,'' said Jeffrey M. Jones, managing editor
of the Gallup Poll. ``Single voters are a group that's never really
been talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to obtain data on unmarried voters, probably
because they have not yet emerged as a lobby, although the lobbying
branch of the American Association for Single People, a
California-based organization that promotes the rights of unmarried
people, is planning a national advertising campaign directed at
unmarried voters who feel underserved by the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Coleman, executive director of the association, says that
he has been struggling for decades to secure equal rights for
single people and to enlist organizations like the National
Organization for Women and the American Civil Liberties Union to
promote the inclusion of marital status as a nondiscrimination
category in proposed civil rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Single people feel that they're being ignored or discounted,''
Coleman said. ``It certainly doesn't make you feel very motivated
to go out and vote.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton skillfully appealed both to people with
families and to those who are alone. In his 1996 speech he stressed
working families, too, but welcomed anyone who wanted to be part of
a larger American family.

<P>
   What if they gave an election and everyone came?
</P>
<P>
   There would be profound surprise, for one thing. Turnout in the
last three American presidential elections has hovered at around
half of the nation's voting-age population, which has prompted a
good deal of hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that if everyone eligible voted this November, the
number of ballots cast would roughly double. But would those 100
million or so additional votes change the outcome for the main
contenders, George W. Bush and Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: maybe yes, maybe no.
</P>
<P>
   First, the maybe yes. If the race is close, then any usual
nonvoters who turn out have the potential to decide the outcome.
And races that go down to the wire typically generate higher
turnout, because of the uncertainty, and heightened competition.
After Labor Day, as each party's post-convention bounce in the
polls levels off, voter surveys will give the first good indication
of how close the 2000 election is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the maybe no. It may be that this year's likely nonvoters
differ so much in how they are lining up behind the candidates that
if they voted, a different candidate would be elected. But that
would be in contrast to every election since 1988. A statistical
analysis of those three elections by The New York Times suggests
that if nonvoters had voted, only the margin of victory would have
changed, not the victor.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics say that if the ``votes'' of nonvoters had been
counted, George Bush would have increased his margin of success
over Michael Dukakis in 1988; there would have been no change in
the margin of Bill Clinton's win in 1992, and his margin would have
increased to a landslide in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities of the preferences of voters and nonvoters
suggest that in modern campaigns, with saturating news coverage and
endless commercials driving home candidates' positions, voters and
nonvoters may reach similar conclusions and take sides in roughly
similar proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, assessing opinions is an inexact science. And there's
much more data to go on for voters than for nonvoters.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions and tentative conclusions being formed by likely
voters are measured by many polls and also widely broadcast and
published. The only way to know nonvoters' preferences is through
the infrequent public opinion polls _ with their inherent degrees
of error in sampling and measurement _ that bother to address them.
And there are other gray areas. Nonvoters who become voters may be
motivated by something that also changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News polls, conducted just before
Election Day in each of the last three presidential races, were
designed to determine whether usual voters and usual nonvoters
agreed, disagreed slightly or disagreed strongly in their candidate
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, voters preferred Bush by 8 percentage points. Nonvoters
that year also preferred Bush over Dukakis, but by 16 percentage
points. If everyone had turned out to vote, Bush's margin over
Dukakis would have been somewhat larger than it was. Same winner,
but bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Voters and nonvoters each favored Bill Clinton over President
Bush in 1992, and by the same margin, 6 percentage points. Had
everyone voted that year, there would have been the same winner and
the same victory margin. But Ross Perot would have gained an
additional 2 percentage points over the 19 percent he actually
received.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, by contrast, voters and nonvoters held preferences that
differed strongly. Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole by 8 percentage
points, but among nonvoters, Clinton was the overwhelming choice.
If everyone had voted, it would have been a 24-point Clinton
blowout. (In 1976, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter ran a close race,
but nonvoters were not polled.)
</P>
<P>
   The seeming pattern in these three elections _ that with
everyone voting the winner would have remained the same in each
case, with an enlarged victory margin in two of the three cases _
provides ammunition for several arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that nonvoters are not invariably more pro-Democratic
than voters, as stereotypes suggest. Nonvoters were more pro-Bush
than voters in 1988, more pro-Clinton in 1996 and indistinguishable
in their preferences in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and author of
``Everything You Think You Know About Politics ... And Why You're
Wrong'' (Basic Books), said that the finding of few big differences
in candidate preferences of voters and nonvoters conforms to ``the
standard finding of political scientists.'' But she said she was
still surprised because ``nonvoters, tending to have lower
socio-economic status, might be expected to be more Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   But does the voter/nonvoter pattern also suggest that it doesn't
matter that nonvoters stay home?
</P>
<P>
   Only if the sole purpose of voting is to elect someone. But
citizens are urged to participate in politics not only to elect
people, but also, perhaps even primarily, for their own good.
Dennis Thompson, Alfred North Whitehead professor of political
philosophy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, has argued in
his book ``The Democratic Citizen'' (Cambridge University Press)
that participation can help develop citizens' awareness, knowledge
and self-realization.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the three polls measured only how voters and nonvoters
reacted to the candidates, issues, and appeals in the campaigns
that were actually waged in those election years. They cannot show
what public reactions might have been if the candidates, issues and
messages had been different. And if everyone voted, those might
become quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Nonvoters tend to be younger, less well off in income and
education, less partisan, less politically involved and more
alienated from the system. If parties and candidates actually
expected everyone to vote, they might find themselves having to
revise their strategies, raising quite different issues.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns might revolve as much around health care for poor
children, child care for working mothers, and job training and
college tuition for working-class and lower-middle-class youths, as
they do now around prescription drugs for the elderly and tax cuts
for the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, turnout was 49 percent of the voting-age population,
defined as United States residents 18 or older. In 1992 it was 55
percent. In 1988, despite earnest get-out-the-vote drives, it was
50 percent. But the category includes some people who are legally
ineligible to vote, like noncitizens, felons and those who have not
yet met local residency requirements, so actual turnout would have
been a bit higher in each case.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred percent turnout may always be a fantasy, practically
speaking. But, if political participation brings civic awareness,
then a higher voting rate may still be a desirable goal, even if it
does not change the outcome of elections.

   Accused Weapons Scientist Is Freed on Bail
</P>
<P>
   In December, a federal judge was told that Wen Ho Lee posed such
a threat to national security that if the scientist leaked the
nuclear weapons secrets he had allegedly taken from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory it could tilt the global balance of power. Lee
was held in solitary confinement without bail pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   But now the balance of power has shifted in the courtroom. The
judge reversed his decision after hearing damaging new evidence,
ruling that Lee could be freed to a form of home detention. The
order was a sign that, after admissions by prosecutors that
misleading testimony had been presented earlier, the government's
case was suffering serious weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Rejects Gore Probe
</P>
<P>
   For the third time, Attorney General Janet Reno brushed off the
advice of senior advisers and declined to intensify an
investigation into Vice President Al Gore's fundraising activities
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would not appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate Gore's sworn statements that neither his appearance at
a Buddhist temple in California in 1986 nor his attendance at
several White House coffee sessions were fundraisers.
Law-enforcement officials said Reno's decision meant that Gore
would finally be free and clear of any criminal liability as he
goes into the final months of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Inquiry Ends
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded over
Long Island, killing all 230 people aboard, the National
Transportation Safety Board concluded its investigation, the
longest and most expensive in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The board reiterated its finding that the Boeing 747 broke apart
shortly after taking off from Kennedy International Airport bound
for Paris. The report concluded that a short circuit set off fuel
vapors in the jet's center wing fuel tank, which was nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Aftershocks of Sub Disaster
</P>
<P>
   The mea culpas began almost as soon as Norwegian divers pried
open the hatch of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, which went
down in 350 feet of water during exercises in the Barents Sea on
Aug. 12, killing the crew of 118 officers and sailors. The
commanders of the navy offered to resign, as did the defense
minister, Igor Sergeyev, but Russia's commander in chief, Vladimir
Putin, declined to accept the resignations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said they suspected that the Kursk was sunk
after striking a submerged object of ``large tonnage,'' like a
foreign submarine, and they were busy scouring the seabed for
evidence. But the main task facing Putin is quieting the political
storm over the navy's ill-equipped and inept rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Cover-Up on Auto Defects
</P>
<P>
   Japan's automakers, known for quality, hate to show fallibility.
But Mitsubishi Motors finally had to admit that since 1977 it had
concealed complaints about problems like faulty fuel tanks and
brakes. The flaws do not seem to have caused serious accidents, but
the company, which recently allied itself with DaimlerChrysler,
didn't take them lightly, quickly recalling 88,000 cars and trucks,
on top of a recall of 532,000 a month ago. And though Mitsubishi's
president, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, did not resign, he did bow deeply in
apology to the transportation minister.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement in Phone Walkout
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications
employer, settled a strike by more than 86,000 employees that
lasted more than two weeks in 12 Eastern states and the District of
Columbia. Union members received a wide range of concessions from
the company, which was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the
GTE Corp., including higher wages and benefits, stock options,
increased job stability and greater freedom to organize in
Verizon's fast-growing wireless division. The strike created a
backlog of roughly 50,000 repair requests and 200,000 new service
orders.

<P>
   U.N. Readies Iraq Team
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein calls them spies, and doesn't want them
back in Iraq. But the United Nations has more than 40 new arms
inspectors trained and ready to go. To meet some Iraqi objections,
the team is drawn from 20 countries, some of them _ like China,
France, India, Russia and Sudan _ considered friendly to Iraq. Only
11 arms experts have been drawn from the United States and Britain.
Hans Blix, the leader of the new inspection commission, says he is
prepared to wait out the Iraqis, who can't hope to have a decade of
sanctions lifted until they cooperate.

   McCain Undergoes Operation
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain received good news when pathologists found no
evidence that a malignant melanoma from his left temple had spread
to lymph nodes in his face or neck. The nodes were removed during
an operation in which surgeons also found no evidence that another
melanoma in his left upper arm had spread.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has had three melanomas. His doctors have pronounced him
cured of his first melanoma, which was removed from his left
shoulder in 1993. People with multiple melanomas do not necessarily
fare worse than those with one. The prognosis depends in part on
the thickness of a melanoma, and McCain did not disclose findings
of such pathology tests on the one from his temple.
</P>
<P>
   Christians Arrested in China
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday in Los Angeles, a leader of China's
government-approved churches said the country had entered a
``golden age'' of religion. On Wednesday in central China, the
limits of that freedom were clear as some 130 evangelical
Protestants, including three visiting Taiwanese-American
missionaries, were arrested at a revival. The worshipers were from
one of several large, fervent Christian groups that refuse to
cooperate with official bodies and face police harassment and the
jailing of their leaders. By week's end, the Americans had been
released but the fate of the detained Chinese was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   New Rule on Embryo Study
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health issued rules under which the
many university biologists it supports may start working with human
embryonic stem cells. Biologists hope that through study of the
cells they will learn the secrets of how the body develops as well
as the means to patch aging tissues with fully youthful cells.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion object to federal funds being used for the
research because human embryos, potentially capable of life, are
destroyed in the process of deriving the cells. In practice the
cells come from excess frozen embryos due to be discarded by
fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Test Gap Widens Again
</P>
<P>
   After narrowing through the 1980s, the gap between test scores
of black and white students widened again between 1990 and 1999,
according to national test scores released in a federal report.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that the average black 17-year-old reads only
about as well as the average white 13-year-old. Most puzzling, the
gap remains widest among children of the best-educated parents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have little explanation, but suggested that solutions
might lie in the examples of some cities that have closed the gap.
Those cities have introduced smaller classes and require all
students to take rigorous courses.

   Accused Weapons Scientist Is Freed on Bail
</P>
<P>
   In December, a federal judge was told that Wen Ho Lee posed such
a threat to national security that if the scientist leaked the
nuclear weapons secrets he had allegedly taken from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory it could tilt the global balance of power. Lee
was held in solitary confinement without bail pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   But now the balance of power has shifted in the courtroom. The
judge reversed his decision after hearing damaging new evidence,
ruling that Lee could be freed to a form of home detention. The
order was a sign that, after admissions by prosecutors that
misleading testimony had been presented earlier, the government's
case was suffering serious weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Rejects Gore Probe
</P>
<P>
   For the third time, Attorney General Janet Reno brushed off the
advice of senior advisers and declined to intensify an
investigation into Vice President Al Gore's fundraising activities
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would not appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate Gore's sworn statements that neither his appearance at
a Buddhist temple in California in 1986 nor his attendance at
several White House coffee sessions were fundraisers.
Law-enforcement officials said Reno's decision meant that Gore
would finally be free and clear of any criminal liability as he
goes into the final months of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Inquiry Ends
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded over
Long Island, killing all 230 people aboard, the National
Transportation Safety Board concluded its investigation, the
longest and most expensive in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The board reiterated its finding that the Boeing 747 broke apart
shortly after taking off from Kennedy International Airport bound
for Paris. The report concluded that a short circuit set off fuel
vapors in the jet's center wing fuel tank, which was nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Aftershocks of Sub Disaster
</P>
<P>
   The mea culpas began almost as soon as Norwegian divers pried
open the hatch of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, which went
down in 350 feet of water during exercises in the Barents Sea on
Aug. 12, killing the crew of 118 officers and sailors. The
commanders of the navy offered to resign, as did the defense
minister, Igor Sergeyev, but Russia's commander in chief, Vladimir
Putin, declined to accept the resignations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said they suspected that the Kursk was sunk
after striking a submerged object of ``large tonnage,'' like a
foreign submarine, and they were busy scouring the seabed for
evidence. But the main task facing Putin is quieting the political
storm over the navy's ill-equipped and inept rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Cover-Up on Auto Defects
</P>
<P>
   Japan's automakers, known for quality, hate to show fallibility.
But Mitsubishi Motors finally had to admit that since 1977 it had
concealed complaints about problems like faulty fuel tanks and
brakes. The flaws do not seem to have caused serious accidents, but
the company, which recently allied itself with DaimlerChrysler,
didn't take them lightly, quickly recalling 88,000 cars and trucks,
on top of a recall of 532,000 a month ago. And though Mitsubishi's
president, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, did not resign, he did bow deeply in
apology to the transportation minister.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement in Phone Walkout
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications
employer, settled a strike by more than 86,000 employees that
lasted more than two weeks in 12 Eastern states and the District of
Columbia. Union members received a wide range of concessions from
the company, which was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the
GTE Corp., including higher wages and benefits, stock options,
increased job stability and greater freedom to organize in
Verizon's fast-growing wireless division. The strike created a
backlog of roughly 50,000 repair requests and 200,000 new service
orders.

<P>
   U.N. Readies Iraq Team
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein calls them spies, and doesn't want them
back in Iraq. But the United Nations has more than 40 new arms
inspectors trained and ready to go. To meet some Iraqi objections,
the team is drawn from 20 countries, some of them _ like China,
France, India, Russia and Sudan _ considered friendly to Iraq. Only
11 arms experts have been drawn from the United States and Britain.
Hans Blix, the leader of the new inspection commission, says he is
prepared to wait out the Iraqis, who can't hope to have a decade of
sanctions lifted until they cooperate.

   CLINTON-NIGERIA (Abuja, Nigeria) _ President Clinton kicked off
a three-day trip to Africa, landing in the capital of Nigeria to
help support the still-shaky transition of Africa's most populous
country to civilian rule from 16 years of military dictatorship.
Awaiting Clinton at the airport was Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former general who was elected in a peaceful transition
15 months ago after the death of the country's longtime military
ruler. It was the first face-to-face meeting between Clinton and
the Nigerian leader, and the first visit by an American president
to Nigeria since Jimmy Carter in 1978. By Marc Lacey.

   LIEBERMAN-BUSINESS (Undated) _ Joseph I. Lieberman has
introduced himself to the American people this month on a decidedly
populist note, lashing out against oil companies, assailing
industrial polluters and calling for greater government spending on
health care. But behind the traditional Democratic oratory of his
convention speech is a senator who has described himself as being
``pro-business, pro-trade and pro-economic growth.'' Lieberman's
pro-business record contrasts sharply not only with his own speech
at the Democratic National Convention, but also with the larger
message that Vice President Al Gore has been sending recently. By

   SCHOOL-PRAYER (Hattiesburg, Miss.) _ It started slowly at first,
a few students holding hands in the bleachers and saying ``Our
Father who art in Heaven'' while football players gathered on the
North Forrest High School field Friday night. But by the time they
got to ``deliver us from evil,'' most of the crowd of 4,500 was
standing, proudly reciting the Lord's Prayer, insisting that God
cannot be removed even from a Class 4A high school football game.
School officials carefully stayed out of the way, in order not to
violate a June decision of the U.S. Supreme Court prohibiting
student-led prayer at games and assemblies if it is officially
sanctioned by the school. The scene was repeated, with various
levels of participation, at scores of high school football games
around the South Friday night, and is likely to grow as word
catches on. By David Firestone.

Republican had ever won. ``It opened eyes among Republicans across
the country,'' said Kenneth Carr, chairman of the city's Republican
Party. Now, as he campaigns for president, Bush is courting
Hispanic voters nationwide. In speeches, he often mentions the 1998
race as evidence of his commitment to inclusiveness and proof that
his policies offer benefits that are colorblind. By Jim Yardley.

`WHAT CITY, PLEASE?' VEXATION IN DIALING CAN START WITH 411 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandra L. Frankel, town supervisor of Brighton, N.Y., just east
of Rochester, thinks of dialing 411 as a call for disinformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone uses directory assistance and asks for an
individual or a business in the town of Brighton, directory
assistance doesn't recognize that location,'' Frankel said
recently. ``It's as if Brighton and other similar communities don't
exist to the telephone companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin L. McKelvey, a technology executive in Maryland, is no fan
of directory assistance, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to order takeout from Bennigan's in College Park,
and it took nine calls to get the number,'' McKelvey recalled. ``I
got an operator and each time I was getting the wrong number and
they kept giving me a different wrong number. They even gave me a
residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the whole directory assistance system is a lot more
complicated than it used to be, many consumers can attest to tales
of woe about calling to find a phone number. Maybe they dialed 411
in Manhattan and could not get a listing for the Empire State
Building. Or they called 555-1212 in Los Angeles and were asked to
spell Sunset Boulevard. Or maybe they were among the thousands of
people each day on the East Coast who heard a ``We're sorry ...''
recording when they dialed 411 during the recent Verizon
Communications strike.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone hoping for federal or state regulators to step in and
fix directory assistance may find their time better spent reading
the phone book. By most official measurements, directory assistance
is working pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, which receives some 1,900
complaints a day from the public, could count only 15 that had
anything to do with directory assistance in the six weeks from the
beginning of July to the middle of August.
</P>
<P>
   And the New York State Public Service Commission, one of the
nation's most active state telephone regulators, says that while it
has received 8,200 complaints so far this year about phone
companies, fewer than three dozen were about directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that there is no problem. It just may be that
directory assistance, when it does not work quite right, is one of
those vexations of modern life that seldom rise to the level of
formal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The degree of frustration I think is the issue,'' said Trip
Agerton, who oversees the directory service operators for the
BellSouth Corp., the main phone company in the Southeast. ``If I
get a wrong phone number I'm frustrated, but it's not like I had a
car wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is a frustrated consumer to do _ short of punching in
numbers at random in hopes of hearing a familiar voice? As it turns
out, there are actually some patterns of logic to today's bizarre
directory assistance bazaar. And while understanding the underlying
structure may not guarantee always getting the right number, it
just might help a person navigate the network.
</P>
<P>
   The place to start is with the industry's glowing report cards.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the nation's biggest local phone company _ whose unions
ended an 18-day strike last week _ says that data compiled before
the strike indicates that the average time spent on hold by each of
its nearly 3 million daily directory assistance callers in the area
formerly served by Bell Atlantic declined from 5.5 seconds in 1996
to 3.6 seconds this year _ or, collectively, 65 fewer years on hold
this year than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with the data compiled by big phone companies like
Verizon is that it may cover a receding portion of the billions of
directory assistance calls that Americans make each year. As more
of the telecommunications industry has been deregulated in recent
years _ bringing waves of competition in everything from pay phones
to home phones, business phones and cell phones _ hundreds of
companies around the country are now providing directory
assistance. And they are doing so with varying degrees of accuracy
and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup of AT&AMP;T's Bell System in 1984 and before 1996,
almost all directory assistance calls were handled by the big local
phone companies. Callers would dial 411 or 555-1212 to reach a
local operator. And for a long-distance number, they could add an
area code to 555-1212 and reach an operator in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, dialing 411 from home or office, or a pay phone run by
the main local phone company, still generally reaches a local
operator. But other pay phone providers sometimes farm out
directory assistance calls to companies that may cover many cities
and states. And some corporations link their office phone systems
to a carrier other than the dominant local phone provider, which
means a 411 call may connect to an operator across the country who
is looking up numbers from a national database.
</P>
<P>
   As for long-distance number inquiries, that game changed
radically about four years ago when AT&AMP;T, the No. 1 long-distance
carrier, began intercepting its customers' long-distance calls to
555-1212. So now, a caller in, say, Miami who dials (415) 555-1212
will not reach a Pacific Bell operator in the San Francisco area.
Instead, the caller may well be routed to an AT&AMP;T subcontractor in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to run that business in a particular way, and any
time we wanted to make a change, we had to negotiate with 25
different companies,'' explained Howard E. McNally, AT&AMP;T's senior
vice president for consumer services. ``We couldn't guarantee a
consistent experience by sending those calls to 25 different
carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   The other major long-distance carriers, including WorldCom and
Sprint, have done essentially the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The wireless phone industry, meanwhile, operates under its own
system. A wireless subscriber who dials 411 is generally connected
to a directory assistance operator affiliated with his wireless
carrier. Those operators generally use a national database.
</P>
<P>
   But no one disputes that the quality of directory assistance
service varies from provider to provider.
</P>
<P>
   The listings themselves are generally compiled and controlled by
the roughly 1,300 individual local phone companies around the
country. Big carriers like AT&AMP;T and Verizon contract with outside
companies to pull together phone listings from the multitude of
local phone databases around the nation. To save money, other,
smaller companies may sometimes try to compile listings by scanning
phone books, property records or other sources that are less likely
to be up to date and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, big phone companies say that directory assistance
listings are about 95 percent accurate. But if there are, as is
estimated, 3 billion directory assistance calls in a year (the
actual figure may be higher), that adds up to 150 million wrong
numbers annually.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Louis S. Richman is restive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a really annoying aggravation that when you call
for the headquarters number for a major corporation that you get
some branch office delivery dock,'' said Richman, finance editor of
Consumer Reports magazine, in New York. ``Or you call for a major
hospital in a major city and they never heard of it, or a
restaurant that you knew was there a week ago but they can no
longer find it or you get a fax number.''
</P>
<P>
   It may help if callers understand that there are gazetteering
limitations with today's patchwork directory assistance. And the
limitations begin with four words: United States Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone listings are almost always governed by the post office
address of the residence or business listed. Take Brighton, the
town in upstate New York supervised by Frankel. A letter to her
town must be addressed to Rochester; the Postal Service does not
recognize Brighton as an official mailing location. Given this, and
the fact that there is another community in New York known as
Brighton, near Buffalo, it is understandable that a directory
assistance operator in Omaha, Neb., or elsewhere may become a bit
confused.
</P>
<P>
   But the Postal Service rationale carries little weight with
Frankel. ``I would think that the telephone directory services are
something that should be upgraded,'' she said. ``The technology is
there to do it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may depend on which company is wielding the technology.
Although the main local phone company for most of New York state is
Verizon, the local phone company for the Brighton that is near
Rochester, and for Rochester itself, is Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In an unscientific test conducted from phones in Manhattan,
directory assistance operators for AT&AMP;T and Verizon were routinely
able to find numbers in Brighton for the Twelve Corners Apothecary,
the Bagel Bin Cafe and Frankel's two home numbers. In most cases,
though, the operator would note that the listing was in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   And in a second unscientific test, directory assistance calls
placed from Rochester and within Brighton, also succeeded without
exception in finding those same numbers. The volunteer tester,
Jennifer Leonard, president of the Rochester Area Community
Foundation, a charitable group, called various directory assistance
services to obtain the listings for the apothecary and Frankel's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who lives in Brighton, called a Frontier operator from
her office in Rochester, a Frontier operator from a pay phone in
Brighton, an operator affiliated with her local phone company, Time
Warner Communications, and a Verizon operator from her wireless
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the operators were located in Rochester and all of them
had both numbers and had no problem with the location of Brighton,
N.Y.,'' Leonard reported.
</P>
<P>
   Whether directory assistance in Brighton is as truly bad as
Frankel has found it, or as reasonably good as this informal test
might indicate, it is certain that there are many more paths than
there used to be to that tantalizingly helpful operator's greeting,
``What listing?''
</P>
<P>
   With all the variables, it may be that the best hope for a
caller _ besides keeping those keypad fingers crossed _ is to be
very, very precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases you can find the one you're looking for,'' said
Agerton at BellSouth, which handles more than 500 million directory
assistance calls a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what happens a lot of the time,'' Agerton said, ``is
someone calls and says, `I want Bill Smith in Roanoke, Va.' And so
you pull it up and there's Bill Smith, so you put them through. But
then they call back and in fact they wanted William T. Smith on
Lovers' Lane.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The combination of warm, humid air at the surface and a large,
but weak disturbance aloft forming over the central Appalachians
will produce patches of thundershowers from New England to the Gulf
States on Sunday. The strongest storms are expected in the
afternoon from the Carolinas to the lower Tennessee Valley. Most of
the Atlantic beaches will have some sunshine and a dry day.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of dry and seasonably warm air will cover the Great
Lakes as high pressure glides east across Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Torrid weather over the southern Plains will be tempered by more
clouds and isolated storms. Record heat will continue in parts of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon thunderstorms will form over most of the Rockies, but
much of the West will be bright and a bit cooler.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TARNISHED CHILL
</P>
<P>
   West Yellowstone, Mont., has a reputation for being the coldest
spot in the contiguous states on more occasions than any other
location in a typical year. This image was tarnished on Thursday
when the mercury did not fall below 53 degrees, establishing a
record high minimum for the date in the usual icebox of the nation.
A combination of an active breeze and thick clouds helped keep
readings well above seasonal levels. A surge of cooler air from the
North Pacific should bring the usual chill back to West Yellowstone
later this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman has introduced himself to the American people
this month on a decidedly populist note, lashing out against oil
companies, assailing industrial polluters and calling for greater
government spending on health care.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the traditional Democratic oratory of his convention
speech is a senator who has described himself as being
``pro-business, pro-trade and pro-economic growth.'' During his two
terms in the Senate, Lieberman has closely aligned himself with
three industries _ insurance, high technology and health care _
that are the main sources of his campaign contributions, and whose
lobbyists say they are pleased with how he has promoted their
agendas in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's pro-business record contrasts sharply not only with
his own speech at the Democratic National Convention, but also with
the larger message that Vice President Al Gore has been sending
recently. In his acceptance speech at the convention _ and since
then on the campaign trail _ Gore has repeatedly attacked ``big
tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies,
the HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether defending stock options for the newly minted rich of
Silicon Valley, promoting legislation that allowed insurance
companies to enter new markets or promoting a moderate alternative
to the administration's ill-fated health care program, Lieberman is
seen as a leader among a small band of business-friendly Democrats
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He has embraced industries viewed as the pillars of a new
high-tech, free-trade economy. And Lieberman and other centrist
Democrats have received a windfall of campaign contributions from
industries that are not traditional supporters of the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman understands the needs of business and doesn't
view industry with hostility,'' said Herbert Perone, a spokesman
for the American Council of Life Insurers, an industry group. ``You
can count on Joe Lieberman to understand why something is important
to us and vote the right way and not scoff at our reasons. He's
been a friend to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman declined to be interviewed for this article, but
instead issued a statement saying that he would ``call it like I
see it on the issues, including when I disagree with those
individuals, industries and interests who support me.''
</P>
<P>
   And an aide said Lieberman did not see a conflict between the
support he received from business and the Democratic ticket's
populist message. The aide added, ``He has done some things the
health care industry has liked, and other things they have not
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's support for these industries, and theirs for him,
are part practical and part philosophical. As the junior senator
from Connecticut, the home of 36 insurance companies _ including
such giants as Aetna and Hartford Life _ he has worked hard to
protect the interests of the state's leading industries and, with
more than 50,000 workers, one of its largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   Geography also accounts for his staunch support of military
programs with a Connecticut connection. As a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, he has been a strong advocate for
increased military spending, fighting for the controversial Sea
Wolf submarine project, which is made in Groton, Conn., and costs
$2.5 billion per sub, and defending such programs as the Blackhawk
and Comanche helicopters, which are also manufactured in his state.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's interests seem to go beyond local politics and
reflect a belief that the Democratic Party will flourish _ and the
economy, too _ when government promotes international trade,
business entrepreneurship and technological innovation. This
philosophy has pulled Lieberman away from such traditional sponsors
of the Democratic Party as trade unions and trial lawyers. Instead,
he has drawn his greatest support from a Wall Street flush with
cash, a Silicon Valley just stepping into the political arena and a
health care industry reeling in record profits.
</P>
<P>
   Among Lieberman's top supporters is the health care industry _
and, more specifically, pharmaceutical companies. A health care
lobbyist said the senator was ``a loyal friend'' who, more often
than not, supported industry initiatives on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Lieberman was part of a bipartisan group
in Congress that tried to break a deadlock between the Clinton
administration and Republican leaders over how to regulate health
plans. At the time, the administration argued that the legislation
favored by Lieberman, which did not pass, would have been too
generous to insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lieberman's aides say, he has also taken some
anti-industry stances. They point out that he wrote legislation
that would have required health care report cards for HMOs and
insurance companies. The legislation was not passed.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is not afraid to take on pharmaceutical companies
``when they are wrong,'' said Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for the
senator. ``He has opposed the industry on prescription drug prices
_ especially at a time of a rising surplus. That is something that
Lieberman is proud to stand with Gore and fight for. There is no
hesitation there.''
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers have come under particularly sharp attack by
Gore, but Lieberman has always ``kept an open door and an open
mind'' to the industry's arguments, said Karen Ignagni, president
of the American Association of Health Plans, the HMO trade group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very interested in policy and has mastered the specifics
of a number of legislative proposals,'' Ignagni said. ``He really
wants to know the details. His door is always open, and you have
the opportunity to make your case.'' Last year, Lieberman
co-sponsored a bill that limited the amount of money plaintiffs
could receive from lawsuits against HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Ignagni predicted that Lieberman would ``find it difficult'' to
reconcile his generally pro-business record with the populist
language of the Gore-Lieberman ticket. ``I think it's impossible,''
she said. ``I see it as a political ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   But a financial services lobbyist disagreed, noting that
President Clinton was often more pro-business than Gore: ``This
worked effectively for the last eight years. Why, all of a sudden,
do they think it will be an impossible situation? Joe Lieberman's
qualities won't dry up and blow away if he is elected vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Gore ticket, Lieberman had already collected
nearly $3.3 million for a re-election campaign in which he faced
minimal opposition. Executives and political action committees in
the insurance, finance and real estate industries were the biggest
givers, coming up with $773,386, according to data from the Center
for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   He received $276,000 from the health care industry and $173,563
from high-tech companies _ money that Silicon Valley fund-raisers
say was given to the senator without his even having to solicit it.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Israel groups have given him $213,000, and he received
$10,500 from the Free Cuba political action committee for his
anti-Castro, pro-embargo stand, the largest donation given by that
organization in the current election cycle. He received $102,700
from military contractors and a much more modest $84,997 from trade
unions. He received no contributions from the handgun industry,
although some handgun manufacturers are based in Connecticut.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lieberman's support among the financial services
industry is due to Connecticut's close proximity to Wall Street.
The industry was particularly pleased by his support last year of
the financial services industry modernization bill, which permitted
banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies to merge into even
larger conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lieberman has used the gospel of the new economy to
raise money for similar-thinking Democrats through the New Democrat
Network, an ideological political action committee he founded in
1996 with Sen. John Breaux, the moderate Democrat from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The group has raised a total of $7.2 million since its founding,
$4 million of it coming in the past 18 months. Not surprisingly,
the three largest industry donors to the New Democrat Network are
the same ones that support Lieberman's Senate campaign committees.
The PAC's donors include more than 22 of the nation's largest
insurance companies; technology companies like Microsoft, America
Online and MCI Worldcom; and a roster of pharmaceutical companies
that includes Merck, Glaxo Wellcome and Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to build a generation of Democrats who are more
modern and global in their outlook,'' said Simon Rosenberg,
executive director of the PAC. ``We view ourselves as a venture
capital fund for the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley corporations are among Lieberman's biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right down the line,'' said Jeff Modisett, vice president and
general counsel of TechNet, a Silicon Valley lobbying group, ``we
are hard pressed to find a bill of importance to us that he hasn't
been a champion of or at least supported. It's hard to imagine any
other member of Congress who is as well received by the high-tech
community as Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman first went to battle for Silicon Valley in 1994, when
he led the charge against proposed accounting changes that would
have forced corporations to treat stock options given to employees
as a form of compensation, an action that could have halted their
use. Fast-growing companies complained that if the bill had passed
it would have reduced their profitability, made it impossible to
attract and keep top talent and hampered their prospects of going
public. Lieberman led the Senate fight against the rule change and
today is often praised as the senator who saved stock options.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Lieberman has supported a laundry list of pet
high-tech issues. In the last Congress, he introduced a bill to
double government financing of basic high-tech research at
universities. He backs efforts to expand tax credits for corporate
research and development expenses. He also supports efforts to
liberalize visa restrictions to allow more high-tech workers in
foreign countries to immigrate here.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also broke with his party to support tort law changes,
an important issue among high-tech companies, whose volatile stocks
make them worry about class-action lawsuits brought by angry
shareholders. And his backing of liberalized trade with China is
welcome among high-tech companies wanting to sell their wares
there.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's support of liberalized trade with China and tort
changes is also popular among his financial services backers. With
financial markets expanding, domestic insurance companies want to
begin to sell products overseas, especially in India and China. In
addition, Lieberman's attempts to reduce lawsuits against
corporations are ``a biggie for us,'' said Perone of the insurance
industry, which is vulnerable to product liability litigation.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of Lieberman's closeness to the insurance
industry, Perone cited a letter the senator wrote last January to
the administration objecting to a proposed $7 billion package of
taxes on insurance products as ``unwarranted and
counterproductive.'' While the measure had little chance of being
enacted _ and ultimately died _ the industry was pleased with the
swiftness with which Lieberman put their thoughts to paper.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lieberman
has pressed to protect the dwindling number of military
installations in Connecticut. In the mid-1990s, when efforts were
made to scuttle the proposed Sea Wolf submarine program, he managed
to make sure that at least three of the $2.5 billion subs where
built _ thereby preventing the closing of General Dynamics'
Electric Boat facility in Groton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A military contracting lobbyist remembers that Lieberman won the
debate not by arguing that the boat was important for his state,
but by saying the nation needed to retain an industrial base of
submarine-making skills until the next generation of subs was
designed. Those submarines _ the so-called Virginia class _ are now
being manufactured in Connecticut as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a certain moral authority to the debate,'' said one
lobbyist for the military industry, ``even if it is in his
constituents' interest.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his pro-business views, Lieberman is termed an
``interesting mix'' by Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers
Union's Washington office. While Kimmelman said he had ``done
battle'' with Lieberman on such issues as tort changes, he also
said the senator could be ``a strong pro-consumer populist.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman characterized Lieberman as a strong supporter of
consumer protections and anti-monopolistic efforts among
telecommunications companies and rated him ``fairly pro-consumer''
on increased government financing for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Kimmelman cited Lieberman's successful drive to
reregulate the cable television industry after consumers complained
of high prices and anti-competitive practices in the early 1990s.
Then, when the cable companies sought to lighten these regulations
in the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act, Lieberman worked
against them and succeeded in getting the regulations extended
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman was a breath of fresh air for us,'' Kimmelman said.
``He has his home-state interests he is going to side with. But
once he does that, he doesn't have to worry about any other
industries. So he goes out of his way to look for important
consumer protection issues to get involved in.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ As Israel and the Palestinians circle
each other in a wary and increasingly fractious quest for a final
peace agreement, the spotlight only rarely settles these days on a
small, wizened, straggly bearded man in a wheelchair whose
antagonism to Israel could one day unsettle or even destroy any
deal that establishes a Palestinian state pledged to co-existence
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the
Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, seems an improbable enemy
for a peace that would aim at resolving one of the world's most
protracted and bitter conflicts. Until he speaks, sketching a
future of unremitting warfare until Israel is wiped from the map,
there is little about him to suggest that he leads an organization
that the United States lists as one of the world's most dangerous,
if currently quiescent, terror groups.
</P>
<P>
   At 64, Sheik Yassin _ the title is one given in Islam to a man
revered for his piety _ is emaciated by the paralysis he suffered
in a teen-age accident on a Gaza beach. His hearing is deeply
impaired by infections he blames on the 10 years he spent in
Israeli prisons before his release in October 1997. He dresses in
the all-white of an Islamic holy man, and speaks in such a tiny
voice that even aides have to lean close to understand what he is
saying.
</P>
<P>
   But what he says, and his ability to turn words into action,
could hardly be more significant to the long-term prospects for
Middle East peace. Even if Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, overcome deep differences
over Jerusalem and other issues that confounded attempts to reach a
peace pact at last month's Camp David summit meeting, Yassin and
the Islamic resistance could remain the wild card of regional
politics, their unreconciled hatred for Israel a threat to
destabilize peace.
</P>
<P>
   The words have hardly changed, not since Yassin, responding to
the new mood of defiance represented by the street uprising among
Palestinians known as the intifada, emerged from decades of Islamic
devotions to found Hamas in 1987. ``I believe completely that
Israel will vanish, and that we Palestinians will recover the lands
and homes that were stolen from us in 1948,'' he said.
Extrapolating from predictions of disaster for the Jews he says he
has drawn from inferences in the Koran, he added: ``I've said it
before, I'll say it again, the year 2027 will see the end of the
state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether this is the vow of a zealot whose time has passed,
of an embittered man who lost his family's lands in a village,
Al-Jura, that was on the Mediterranean coast near what is now the
Israeli town of Ashqelon in 1948, or the resolve of a charismatic
leader with a charter that will one day plunge the region into a
renewed round of bombings and assassinations, may depend on how the
eddying forces of Palestinian politics resolve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the 1993 Oslo accords that began the peace process,
Arafat pledged to help uproot Palestinian terrorism, but his record
has been mixed. No outsider can really know whether Arafat and
Yassin are irreconcilable adversaries, the good-cop-bad-cop act of
Palestinian politics, or as Israeli intelligence officials believe,
a complex and shifting amalgam of both.
</P>
<P>
   In an extended interview at his office on the Gaza beachfront,
ended only when the muezzin's call to prayers from a local mosque
signaled time for Yassin to say his noon prayers, the signals were
conflicting.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Yassin complained vigorously that Arafat was
holding about 300 activists from Hamas and an associated group,
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, in jail, in addition to 1,500
others who are prisoners of the Israelis. He also spoke of the 10
weeks he spent under house arrest in Gaza in 1998, under Arafat's
orders, after an abortive Hamas attempt to blow up a school bus
near the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Yassin said Arafat's intelligence apparatus had voided 175
separate attacks against Israeli targets that had been planned by
Hamas' military wing, the Ezzadin Al-Qassem Brigade, in recent
years. This, he implied, explained why there had been few attacks
in Israel and around the Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West
Bank since the chaotic years from 1994 to 1996, when a spate of
suicide bombings and kidnappings by Hamas and Islamic Jihad killed
scores of Israelis. At that time, Arafat was just beginning to
assert his authority in the first blocks of territory ceded to the
Palestinians under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   Against this, there was much to suggest that Yassin and Arafat
recognize that they need each other. Arafat's Palestinian Authority
recently permitted Hamas to set up its Gaza headquarters only a few
hundred yards down Gaza's beachfront road from Arafat's
``presidential'' offices. And much about the new Hamas offices
suggests that it has no need to pretend it lives in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, whitewashed and air-conditioned, the offices are
sandwiched between the Dolphin bar and the Al-Jojo fishing tackle
shop. The prayer room used by Yassin has an open portal looking out
over the pounding Mediterranean surf, and there are no armed guards
outside. When Yassin leaves, he travels in an expensive Range
Rover, adapted to take the Islamic leader's wheelchair, which the
sheik's aides said was given to him by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   When Yassin was asked when he last met Arafat, he said he had
invited him to dinner at his Gaza home three months ago, and that
Arafat had lingered for a lengthy talk. ``Of course, we talked
politics,'' he said. ``Politics is our bread and water.'' As for
Arafat personally, he said that he considered him a brave, if
misguided, man. ``He has tried to restore our rights, but if he
can't, he should step aside and allow others to try,'' he said.
``If he recognizes the state of Israel, he will have given away our
rights to our 1948 lands, and he will have gone from leading our
resistance to defending our enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Yassin's words turned menacing, at least for
Arafat, suggesting another reason why Arafat has chosen, until now,
not to have any final showdown with Hamas. At the Camp David talks,
the sheik said, Arafat appeared to have toed the ultimate ``red
line'' in Palestinian politics _ finalizing a deal that, in return
for mutual recognition by Israel and a Palestinian state, would
have given Israel the prize sought since 1948, acceptance of its
right to live on lands taken from Palestinians in Israel's war for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is in a very critical situation _ he can't move
forward, and he can't move back,'' he said. ``He's reached the
logical conclusion of his policy of negotiating with the Israelis,
and he's reached a dead end, unless he makes concessions that would
be fatal for him. I only hope, for his sake, that he can get
himself out of this situation, without giving up any Palestinian
rights, without sacrificing our future for the sake of the Zionist
entity.''
</P>
<P>
   On a blindingly hot summer's day that had many of the
1.1-million Palestinians of Gaza sheltering in the shadows, there
was much else to suggest that Hamas and its rejectionist politics
are far from having exhausted their future, especially among the
young. Conversations with several people produced only a minority _
many with links to Arafat's apparatus _ who said they would accept,
as part of a final peace settlement with Israeli, a renunciation of
the ``1948 lands'' _ a phrase used in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A merchant selling gold trinkets from a hand cart in the bazaar,
a well-known editor, a secondary school teacher, an 18-year-old
youth kicking a football along the beach, a cashier selling
stationery, a food shop owner swatting flies _ all dismissed the
notion that Palestinians would settle permanently for a state in
Gaza and the West Bank, and a foothold in Jerusalem, except as a
way station to a fuller reckoning with Israel later, when a
Palestinian state had achieved a more nearly equal footing with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The strongest support for Hamas, now as before, comes from those
living in refugee camps, perhaps as many as two-thirds of the Gaza
population. These are people who live in Gaza City, Rafah and other
towns, in squalid neighborhoods with unpaved roads, inadequate
electricity, water and sanitation, and chronic unemployment that
have condemned three generations in the same families to poverty.
The camps are divided into neighborhoods, named for the towns and
villages in pre-1948 Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Rafah, near the Egyptian border at the southern end of the
Gaza Strip, when a visitor asked Ahmed Da'abes, aged 16, where he
was from, he answered without a pause, ``Yibna'' _ a predominantly
Palestinian town before 1948, now the Israeli town of Yavne, 10
miles south of Tel Aviv. And what did Ahmed think of Arafat?
``Well, you know very well the kind of leaders we have now,'' he
said. ``If our leaders were from the Islamic movement, we would be
sure that we would one day have Yibna back.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The message is one that needs no underscoring in Israel.
Organizations like Shin Bet, the internal security agency, have
never relented in their hunt for Islamic militants, and have scored
some chilling successes. In January 1996, a cell phone doctored by
Shin Bet exploded in the hands of Yehiya Ayash, the leader of the
Al-Qassem brigade, Hamas' military wing, killing him. His
successor, Mohammed Dief, was arrested in Gaza in May this year,
and is being held in an Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Shin Bet announced that a joint operation between its
agents and Arafat's in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank had resulted
in the roundup of 23 Islamic activists involved in planning terror
bombings and other attacks, including one Gaza man, Nabil Okal, 27,
said to have been sent by Hamas for training in a camp in Pakistan
run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist leader who sits
atop the FBI's most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, another Shin Bet operation resulted in the seizure
of an alleged Hamas armory in the West Bank town of Nablus, where
agents were said to have found one of the largest stores of weapons
and bomb-making equipment seized in years. The two swoops appeared
to have been behind a new State Department advisory issued 10 days
ago warning Americans of an increased risk of terrorist attacks in
Israel, and might have prompted a warning of a possible resumption
of attacks given this week by Barak.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Yassin said his organization would consider a
``truce'' with Israel if it abandoned all claims to Gaza, the West
Bank and Jerusalem, and released all Palestinian prisoners. But in
the interview in Gaza City, he said that the offer was now void, as
Israel had rejected it. Asked if this would not condemn young
Palestinians to an endless, bloody fight against a nation that is
heavily armed and trained, he smiled, as if he had heard such
foolishness a thousand times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the strength of a man who is ready to fight and die for
the liberation of his land, who doesn't need aircraft and tanks and
atomic bombs,'' he said. ``How can Israel resist people who are
prepared to die as martyrs?''

CLINTON BEGINS AFRICAN TOUR WITH SUPPORT FOR THE `NEW NIGERIA'
</HEADLINE>
 By MARC LACEY     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ President Clinton began a four-day trip to
Africa on Saturday, arriving in the capital of Nigeria to help
support the shaky transition of Africa's most populous country to
civilian rule after 16 years of entrenched military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was greeted at the airport by President Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former general who was elected in a peaceful transition
15 months ago after the death of the country's longtime military
ruler.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second face-to-face meeting between Clinton and the
Nigerian leader, and the first visit by an American president to
Nigeria since Jimmy Carter arrived here in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In his lengthy tour of Africa two years ago, Clinton pointedly
bypassed Nigeria, a clear snub to the generals who were leading the
country then perilously close to collapse. But this time Nigeria is
the focal point of his three-nation tour as the administration
tries to nudge along a difficult transformation of this important
oil-producing nation.
</P>
<P>
   After an elaborate airport arrival ceremony early Saturday
morning that featured song and dance, and a private meeting at the
presidential villa with Obasanjo, Clinton spoke on Saturday to the
National Assembly, a body created shortly after Obasanjo won
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begin this visit with enormous admiration for the progress
you have made and the highest hopes for the progress you will make
in the future,'' Clinton said after his meeting with Obasanjo, who
stood by his side. He called it a ``high honor to visit the new
Nigeria and to pledge American support to the most important
democratic transition since the fall of apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   In their brief appearance before reporters, Clinton, wearing a
dark suit with a bright red tie, and Obasanjo, wearing the
customary Nigerian flowing robe called an agbada, touched on the
major priorities of the visit: peacekeeping in Africa, the fight
against AIDS and the economics of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to announce a series of aid packages for Nigeria
that would go beyond the $108 million that the United States
currently gives to the country. The assistance is intended for
primary education, disease prevention and roads.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo promised to push for lower or at least more stable oil
prices when he attends a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries next month that will include heads of
government of the 10 countries that participate in the cartel. In
their initial meeting, Clinton encouraged Nigeria to do what it
could to push other OPEC nations to increase production and bring
prices down.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential visit is intended to encourage Nigerians to
stick with democracy despite continuing problems with poverty,
corruption and ethnic strife in a nation that Sandy Berger, the
president's national security adviser, called the ``poorest
oil-rich country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, despite its chaotic past, remains one of the
continent's wealthiest states and the economic and political
powerhouse of its region. With one-quarter of the population of all
of sub-Saharan Africa and significant oil resources, the country is
viewed by the United States as a potentially stabilizing force amid
the chaos in much of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has spent $10 billion on peacekeeping over the last
decade in more than two dozen different missions, American
officials said. But its military is known for its human rights
abuses, including summary executions of rebels and rebel
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents also plan to discuss how to improve Nigeria's
notoriously inefficient and inequitable oil production system,
which sends millions of barrels to the United States and other
countries but cannot seem to supply its local gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, Clinton will announce U.S. assistance for
education and disease prevention, in addition to an aid package
that has shot up from $7 million to $108 million as the country has
instituted reforms over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders are also expected to address some of the other
issues at the top of Africa's agenda: debt relief, the fight
against infectious diseases and the ongoing conflicts in Burundi,
Uganda, Rwanda and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a make-or-break transition, not just for Nigeria, but
for Africa,'' Berger told reporters before the trip began. ``If
Nigeria succeeds, this can help lift the whole region to prosperity
and peace. If it fails, it can swamp the whole region in turmoil
and misery.''
</P>
<P>
   From Nigeria, Clinton heads to Tanzania, where he will support
the efforts of former South African President Nelson Mandela to
broker a peace deal between warring Hutu and Tutsi in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will wind up his trip Tuesday with a two-hour stop in
Cairo that was added to the schedule to allow the president to
discuss the Middle East peace talks with the Egyptian president,
Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria, Clinton's host has himself undergone something of a
transformation. A former general, Obasanjo headed the military
government after Gen. Murtala Muhammad was assassinated in 1976.
But he handed over power to a civilian president in 1979, and spoke
out so vocally against corruption and military rule that a later
ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, jailed him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will see little of Nigeria beyond Abuja, the spiffy new
capital. The president will venture out only once during his
two-day stay, to a village several miles away that was being buffed
and polished for his visit. Some 70 percent of Nigerians live in
such villages, and aides said Clinton was eager to talk to
residents about the day-to-day challenges of their lives.

JOE DRAPE'S TOP 20 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Florida State
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 12-0
</P>
<P>
   Why not three national titles in a row? The Seminoles return 14
starters, among them a 28-year-old quarterback, Chris Weinke, and a
running back, Travis Minor, who will gain more than 1,000 yards
behind an experienced line led by All-American candidate Tarlo
Thomas. The Seminoles will run more until Weinke gets comfortable
with a new receiving corps, including Snoop Minnis and Anquan
Boldin, who will keep the FSU heritage of flashy wideouts alive.
Seven starters from the best big game defense in college football
return _ including linebackers Tommy Polley, Brian Allen and
Bradley Jennings, who were the top three tacklers on the nation's
17th ranked defense.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? Nobody in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Bobby Bowden gets son Tommy and Clemson in Tallahassee, as well as
the rival Florida Gators.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can freshman Brett Cimorelli replace
two-time All-American and NFL first-round choice Sebastian
Janikowski as an accurate, thunder-footed place kicker?
</P>
<P>
   2. Virginia Tech
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: (11-1)
</P>
<P>
   Why not a rematch with Florida State for the national title? As
a red-shirt freshman last year, Michael Vick led the nation in
passing efficiency, was named the Big East Offensive Player of The
Year and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. He'll be even
better behind four of five returning starting linemen. His deep
threat, Andre Davis, returns and running back Andre Kendrick will
turn the corner on the option. Coach Frank Beamer needs to replace
All-American Corey Moore and eight other starters from the nation's
stingiest defense, but the Hokies have had no-names playing
smothering defense since he got there 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? Last year, Virginia Tech outscored conference
opponents by 318-88. With road games at Syracuse and Miami those
margins will dwindle but the final result will not.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Will the Hokies be satisfied with a
single dream season or is the foundation laid for a perennial
power?
</P>
<P>
   3. Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 12-1
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Eric Crouch was the first Nebraska quarterback to
lead the team in rushing (889 yards) since 1955. With I-backs Dan
Alexander, Correll Buckhalter and Dahrran Diedrick returning, the
Cornhusker option should better last year's average of 266 rushing
yards a game. Speedy Bobby Newcombe is back at wingback _ after
starting the first two games at cornerback _ and may rekindle the
days of Johnny Rogers. On defense, coach Frank Solich will rely on
senior linebacker Carlos Polk (six sacks, 21 hurries) as he
replaces six starters, including two All-American defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? They lose recent South Division nemesis Texas
from the schedule. Only tough road game is at Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Will they beat themselves? The
Cornhuskers fumbled 49 times last year, losing 25 of them.
</P>
<P>
   4. Wisconsin
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 10-2
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect an aerial assault from coach Barry Alvarez, but
Wisconsin won't be as lumbering as in the Ron Dayne era.
Quarterback Brooks Bollinger completed 59.7 percent of his passes
and ran for 445 yards. A mammoth offensive line led by center Casey
Rabach will make sure Michael Bennett becomes the eighth straight
1,000-yard rusher for the Badgers. Eight returning defensive
starters mean Wisconsin will once again challenge for the best
scoring defense. Last year, they were fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? Take your pick of this four game stretch: at
Michigan, Ohio State, at Michigan State, Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Why do Big Ten teams rarely play in the
title game? Answer: This is the nation's toughest conference and
it's hard to go undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   5. Texas
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 9-5
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' young talent showed its inexperience late last
season with losses at Texas A&AMP;M, against Nebraska in the Big 12
championship and against Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. Not this
year, with 18 returning starters. Either Major Applewhite (3,357
yards, 21 touchdowns, 1999 conference offensive of the year) or
Chris Simms (former Giant Phil's son) will trigger a potent
offense. On defense, tackles Casey Hampton and Shane Rogers are
All-American candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? On Oct. 7, Texas plays a vastly improved
Oklahoma in Dallas, which will revive the excitement of Red River
Classics from days of yore.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Applewhite? Simms? Both? How will the
quarterback duel impact team chemistry?
</P>
<P>
   6. Michigan
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 10-2
</P>
<P>
   John Navarre will start at quarterback until Drew Henson
recovers from a broken right foot. If Michigan quarterbacks can get
the ball to Heisman candidate David Terrell (71 catches, 1,0384
yards, seven touchdowns) that number will go up. The Wolverines
will have a balanced offensive attack. Senior running back Anthony
Thomas (1,297 yards, 17 touchdowns) will keep opponents
off-balance. The defense will need to grow after losing five of its
front seven. The secondary is experienced, but also gave up more
passing touchdowns than eight other Big Ten teams.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? The Wolverines go to Illinois in September,
Purdue in October and Ohio State in November.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Was all that fuss for the past two years
about Henson deserved?
</P>
<P>
   7. Alabama
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 10-3
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen starters are back from a team that won the Southeastern
Conference Championship for the first time since 1992. The Tide
will replace running back Shaun Alexander with the senior Shaun
Bohanon, but the ball will be in the hands of the speedster Freddie
Milons as much as possible. Alabama will play two mobile
quarterbacks, Andrew Zow and Tyler Watts. Last season, linebacker
Saleem Rasheed became the Tide's first freshman to lead the team in
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? They open at UCLA, get pesky Southern
Mississippi in September and West Division rival Ole Miss in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can Alabama sustain the urgency that
appeared in 1999 after an early season loss against Louisiana Tech
and a rumor that coach Mike DuBose was about to lose his job?
</P>
<P>
   8. Miami
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 9-4
</P>
<P>
   In quarterback Ken Dorsey, the Hurricanes have a dropback
quarterback in the image of Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde. As a
true freshman, he passed for 807 yards and 10 touchdowns in six
games. His receivers may be the best in the nation _ Santana Moss
(899 yards) and Reggie Wayne (40 catches). Senior James Jackson was
a second-team All-East running back and sophomore Clinton Portis
finished fourth among league rushers. Linebacker Dan Morgan is a
four-year starter and Butkus Award candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? Coach Butch Davis again has a salty
non-league schedule at Washington on Sept. 9 and playing host to
Florida State on Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can the Hurricanes beat Virginia Tech
for the first time since 1994?
</P>
<P>
   9. Kansas State
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 11-1
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats return 15 starters and have an exciting prospect in
junior college transfer Josh Scobey, who is Northeastern A&AMP;M's
all-time leading rusher with 2,423 yards and 31 touchdowns. They
will beat up early on a soft schedule: Louisiana Tech, Ball State
and North Texas. A pair of all-Big 12 receivers, Aaron Lockett and
Quincy Morgan _ who caught 75 passes between them _ will help run
up the points. Strong safety Jarrod Cooper returns to lead a
secondary that may repeat as the best in the nation in pass
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? The Wildcats travel to Colorado and Texas A&AMP;M
with a home game against Oklahoma in between.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Will they ever play in a national title
game?
</P>
<P>
   10. Washington
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 7-5
</P>
<P>
   After opening 1999 0-2, the Huskies got rolling behind
quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo, who set a school record by passing
and running for 2,762 yards. The line returns four starters
including the senior All PAC-10 guard Chad Ward. Coach Rick
Neuheisel must rebuild a defensive unit that gave up more than 400
yards a games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? The Huskies host Miami and travel to Colorado
in weeks two and three.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can the defense quit giving away the
yardage Tuiasosopo and the offense gain?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   11. Mississippi
</P>
<P>
   1999 record 8-4
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels may have the best backfield in the nation with the
senior quarterback Romaro Miller, the SEC's leader in all-purpose
yards last year; running back Deuce McAllister, and the
hard-running Joe Gunn. The nucleus of a line that gave up just 19
sacks last year will make Ole Miss awfully tough, especially in the
seven games they play at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? They travel to Alabama and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can Ole Miss really rise to the top of
the nation's second-toughest conference?
</P>
<P>
   12. Florida
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 9-4
</P>
<P>
   Nine starters are back on defense, including end Alex Brown, who
had a school-record 13 sacks last year. But the offense needs major
retooling after finishing 65th in rushing _ Earnest Graham returns
after missing four games in 1999 with a thigh injury _ and losing
wide receivers Darrell Jackson and Travis Taylor to the NFL. Coach
Steve Spurrier has put the pressure on quarterback Jess Palmer to
lead a team that finished the season with three straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? Maybe Tennessee early and Florida State in
the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can Spurrier return the intensity to the
Gators?
</P>
<P>
   13. Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 9-3
</P>
<P>
   The senior running back Travis Henry (6.3 yards a carry) will be
the offensive focal point until either sophomore Joey Mathews or
freshman Casey Clausen show they can replace Tee Martin at
quarterback. Defensive end Will Overstreet and linebacker Eric
Westmoreland are swift and emotional leaders of a rebuilding
defense. The Vols had nine players taken in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? The Vols open the season with tough Southern
Miss and Florida, though both are at home, as is Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Is this another underestimated squad for
coach Phillip Fulmer, a la the 1998 Vols who won the national
title?
</P>
<P>
   14. Illinois
</P>
<P>
   1999 Record: 8-4
</P>
<P>
   This is a breakout year for the Illini behind 10 returning
offensive starters led by quarterback Kurt Kittner. He threw for
2,448 yards and 22 touchdowns to 11 different receivers as Illinois
scored the most points in school history. His line returns, so
inside runner Rocky Harvey will help control the clock. Only four
starters, however, return on a defense that gave up 388.5 yards a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? Toughest road games are back-to-back: Penn
State and Michigan State in October.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can coach Ron Turner put together a
defense as solid as the offense is explosive?
</P>
<P>
   15. Boise State Broncos
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 10-3
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos will be this year's Marshall with a Chad
Pennington-style quarterback in Bart Hendricks, who last year threw
for 3,103 yards and 22 touchdowns and was the Big West offensive
player of the year. He throws to eight experienced receivers,
including the NFL prospect Jeb Putzier, who is 6'5'' and runs a 4.5
40-yard-dash. The senior defensive back Dempsy Dees is one of the
best cover players in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? The Broncos travel to Arkansas and Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: How long does it take them to crack the
national polls?
</P>
<P>
   16. Georgia
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 8-4
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs return 19 starters and an athletically blessed
quarterback, Quincy Carter, from a team that led the SEC in total
offense at 419 yards per game. Running back Jasper Sanks rumbled
for 896 yards, but had trouble hanging onto the ball. The defense
was not as impressive; it gave up 382.6 yards a game, the most in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? They get Tennessee, Florida and Ole Miss at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can the new defensive coordinator Gary
Gibbs put some ``want-to'' in a suspect defense?
</P>
<P>
   17. Clemson
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 6-6
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Keith Adams, who recorded 186 tackles in 1999, is one
of eight starters returning on a defense that held Florida State to
17 points. Bobby Bowden's son, Tommy, is in his second year will
unleash a hurry-up offense that keeps opposing defenses running.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? The Tigers' weak schedule could carry them
into Tallahassee at 9-0 for the father-son matchup against the
Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: In Bowden's second year at Tulane, the
Green Wave went undefeated - history repeating itself?
</P>
<P>
   18. Oklahoma
</P>
<P>
   1999 Record: 7-5
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Stoops took the Sooners to the air _ quickly. Last
year, quarterback Josh Heupel threw for 3,460 yards and 30
touchdowns to lead an offense that needed an average of only 2
minutes 21 seconds to score. Now Stoops turns his attention to a
defense that gave up the most rushing yards in the Big 12. The
Sooners' front seven returns.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them: Oklahoma will have to overcome rivals of old:
Texas and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can the Sooners put some starch into a
defense that gave up big leads in losses to Notre Dame and Texas?
</P>
<P>
   19. Purdue
</P>
<P>
   1999 Record: 7-5
</P>
<P>
   If the Boilermakers are to make an appearance in the Rose Bowl
for the first time since 1966, quarterback Drew Brees is going to
need a lot of help. He threw for 3,909 yards and 25 touchdowns last
year but will miss departed primary receiver Chris Daniels and his
121 catches. The defense especially has to pitch in after giving up
more than 28 points a game to Big Ten opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them? Take your pick from a brutal schedule: at
Notre Dame, Penn State or Wisconsin. Home games against Michigan
and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Can coach Joe Tiller turn the explosive
Boilermakers into contenders as well as entertainers?
</P>
<P>
   20. Penn State
</P>
<P>
   1999 record: 10-3
</P>
<P>
   Three defensive All-Americans departed for the pros _ Courtney
Brown, LaVar Arrington and Brandon Short _ leaving only one player,
Justin Kurpeikis, who started more than seven games. Quarterback
Rashard Casey led the Big Ten in passing efficiency despite
alternating with Kevin Thompson, but faces an aggravated assault
charge that could become a distraction. Coach Joe Paterno believes
he'll be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Who can stop them: The Big Ten schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The important question: Will Paterno get the seven victories he
needs to pass Alabama coach Bear Bryant as the all-time winningest
coach in Division 1-A this year, or next year?

NO MATTER THE SCHOOL, QUARTERBACKS SHARE THE HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a superman at Virginia Tech, and an old man at Florida
State. There's the passing man at Purdue, a running man at Nebraska
and dueling men at Texas. They have little in common except that
they are quarterbacks and that the prospects of their teams
reaching bowl games or earning a national title are in the care of
their feet, arms and, especially, their heads.
</P>
<P>
   This group may not go down in history as famous as the
quarterbacks of 1982, who featured the future National Football
League Hall of Famers John Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly. They
may not end up NFL starters like the quarterbacks of 1998: Tim
Couch in Cleveland, Donovan McNabb in Philadelphia, Akili Smith in
Cincinnati, Cade McNown in Chicago and Daunte Culpepper in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   They are a diverse, intriguing bunch who have been chosen to
play the most important position in football by coaches who argue
that quarterbacking on the college level transcends merely
possessing football skills. It means showing as much maturity and
toughness Sunday through Friday away from the stadium as they do on
the field on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about 19- or 21-year-old kids who have a
full-time job as a student and a full-time job as team leader and
focal point in the offense,'' said Greg Davis, the offensive
coordinator for Texas, where Major Applewhite and Chris Simms are
battling for the starting job. ``You have devoted fans, media,
radio shows, the Internet watching their every move. They get too
much credit when they do good, too much blame when they do bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturdays, they face swarming, attacking defenses forcing
the quarterback to make the game. The reason is that defensive
coordinators have decided there are more tailbacks in the country
that can beat you than quarterbacks. It's a tremendous amount of
pressure that requires a remarkable kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, the two most watched quarterbacks could not be more
different. Michael Vick of Virginia Tech represents what coaches
believe the position will look like in the future. He runs the
40-yard dash in 4.25 seconds, has a left arm that can flick a pass
65 yards downfield and appears to have a supernatural ability to
turn potential trouble into touchdowns. Last season in the national
title game against Florida State, Vick demonstrated how dangerous
this combination can be when he put up 322 yards of offense and
helped erase a 14-point halftime deficit with a 15-point third
quarter before the Hokies lost, 46-29.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Florida State defensive end David Warren best summed up
what teams face when taking on Vick and the Hokies. ``He's better
than what we saw on film,'' Warren said. ``And that's saying a lot
because we were in awe of him on film. By the third quarter, our
defense was exhausted. It was like chasing a chicken or a cat
around. Everywhere you look, he's there. And once you get there,
he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Warren's teammate and the winning quarterback
in the Sugar Bowl, Chris Weinke, is what the college quarterback
has typically looked like. Almost. He is 6 feet 5 inches, a
drop-back passer who threw for 3,103 yards and 25 touchdowns last
season, and unflappable enough not to have thrown an interception
in his last 237 attempts. He is also 28 years old after showing up
in Tallahassee four years ago after a minor league baseball career.
He is Bobby Bowden's first three-year starter at quarterback and
the leader of the defending national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a coach on the field, yet he always knows his
role,'' Bowden said. ``That's probably one of the greatest things
he's got going for him right now. He knows his place. He's not
trying to act like a coach. He keeps himself at the level of our
other players, even if he is five or six years older.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick and Weinke may very well end up in a national championship
rematch in the Orange Bowl. For that to happen, each has tried to
emulate the other's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Vick will not sneak up on anyone the way he did last season as a
redshirt freshman who led the nation in passing efficiency, threw
for eight touchdowns, ran for five and finished third in the
Heisman Trophy balloting. He is a full-blown star now on a young
team that wants to prove that last year was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the marquee player last year, too,'' Vick said,
shrugging off the heightened expectations. ``I knew everyone was
gunning for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Frank Beamer, wants Vick to play smarter _ for
example, running out of bounds more often to avoid debilitating
hits. ``Where he will improve, after a full year of experience, is
in making decisions,'' Beamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Vick concurred, still wincing at the bruises he nursed in the
wake of the Sugar Bowl. ``I just decided I can't take all that
punishment,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll only run for touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke surprised the Seminole coaching staff by paring 20 pounds
off his sturdy frame before this summer's practices and showing
more agility out of the pocket, especially on roll-out patterns. No
one will mistake him for Vick, but his center, Jarad Moon, says the
effort was noticed by his teammates. ``I've never seen a player be
a leader for the offense and defense,'' Moon said. ``A lot of times
it seems the offense and defense are separate teams. But everybody
looks up to Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Last Chance at Purdue
</P>
<P>
   In the Big Ten, they look up to Drew Brees of Purdue, who is
very likely to finish the year with virtually every conference
passing record.
</P>
<P>
   Brees has little to prove individually _ over three years he has
thrown for 64 touchdowns and more than 8,000 yards while completing
62 percent of his passes. But the Boilermakers have not gone to the
Rose Bowl since 1966 and, coming off a disappointing 7-5 season _
including a blown 25-point lead in a loss to Georgia in the Outback
Bowl _ there is pressure for Brees to carry the team further.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Joe Tiller is trying to help by adding more downfield
routes to his multiple-receiver spread offense. He wants Brees to
go deep more often and manage the clock better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it might have handicapped his style of play because he
didn't look for the big play as much as he had in the past,''
Tiller said. ``And he's a guy you have to give the game to and let
him go with it. We want the ball in Drew's hands with the chips on
the line because that's when he's best.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan can only hope the ball is in Drew Henson's hands.
Wolverine fans have been obsessed with Henson, although he has not
started a game. But he has frustrated them again by fracturing his
right foot last week and requiring surgery that will delay his
season several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan coach Lloyd Carr not-quite-alternated Henson with the
departed Tom Brady the past two years, teasing fans with glimpses
of Henson, a strong-armed 6-4, 218-pounder who completed 49.6
percent of his passes for 800 yards in 18 games. To hear Carr tell
it, between sitting behind Brady and taking criticism from the
Wolverine faithful for playing minor league baseball, Henson is
mentally prepared to lead a talented team _ if he can come back
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew Henson has to carry the mantel all of the quarterbacks
here at Michigan have to deal with _ they are never good enough and
there is always someone behind them that is better,'' Carr said.
``You can go back to Elvis Grbac, Brian Griese, Tom Brady, and it
will be the truth in the year 2050. That is part of dealing with
things when you are a high-profile athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Running It Out at Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   At Nebraska, the ball will be in the hands of the junior Eric
Crouch every play. He replaced Bobby Newcombe in the third game
last year and led the Cornhuskers to a 12-1 record while becoming
the first quarterback to lead Nebraska in rushing (889 yards) and
running for 16 scores. A state sprint champion in high school,
Crouch is a runner in the purest and, in Big Red Country, most
beloved way: he starts the option and more often than not keeps it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It means he takes a lot of hits, and he had off-season shoulder
surgery to alleviate pain that for much of last year prevented him
from getting more than three hours of sleep at a stretch. He is
perhaps the toughest of this year's college quarterbacks. When
Coach Frank Solich decided to put a green jersey on Crouch and make
him a no-hit zone in fall practice, the quarterback wondered if the
college game was getting a bit soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like there are few teams anymore around the country
who allow their quarterbacks to get hit all year long,'' Crouch
said. ``It's a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I won't have
to worry about that. Deep down, I would rather be wearing that red
jersey instead of the green one, but I can't really argue with the
coaches' decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Has a Controversy
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this would not be college football season without a
quarterback controversy, and in Texas the Longhorns are embroiled
in a very public one between the two-year starter, Major
Applewhite, and the sophomore Chris Simms, the son of the former
Giant quarterback Phil. When Applewhite, who threw for 3,357 yards
and 21 touchdowns and was named Big 12 offensive player of the year
as a sophomore last season, injured a knee in the Cotton Bowl, the
door was open for the 6-5, 210-pound Simms, who banged through it
with a terrific spring.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mack Brown has not named a starter and says he will begin
the season playing both; he wants to see if Applewhite is tentative
after surgery last spring, and he wants to see if Simms is as
effective in real competition.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever emerges will have to survive the worst part of college
football: Thousands of fans have already turned out for the
Longhorns' open practices to cheer either Applewhite or Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Brown asked Texas fans and the news media not to
participate in polls trying to determine the popular choice for the
starter's job. He assured them that the Longhorns needed both and
reminded them that the goal was to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not professional athletes,'' Brown said, ``and it is
not fair to subject them to a popularity poll of unidentified
people whose opinion will have no bearing on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   College quarterbacks certainly are not pros. Fair or not,
however, they will be treated like them as they march their teams
through another college season.

VICK AND VIRGINIA TECH STAND IN MIAMI'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE CALDWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is what the Miami Hurricanes have lots of:
quarterback-mauling defenders, speedy receivers, bruising running
backs and, as always, confidence. The Canes work hard and are the
kind of players that coach Butch Davis likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend 85 to 90 hours a week at the office,'' Davis said. ``I
don't want to spend all that time at work with players I don't
like.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, fine. Here is what Miami does not have: Michael Vick or a
victory over Virginia Tech in six years.
</P>
<P>
   If Miami can conquer the Hokies and Vick, the left-handed
quarterback who led Tech to last season's national championship
game, on Nov. 4 at the Orange Bowl, the Hurricanes could be playing
for something much more important than the Big East championship.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the biggest if of the conference season.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has had to replace most of its defense, plus its leading
rusher, Shyrone Stith, but the Hokies have Vick. As a freshman last
year, Vick proved that he could win games almost by himself. His
scramble down the sideline set up the winning field goal in a 22-20
victory over West Virginia, the closest call the Hokies had during
the regular season. In the Sugar Bowl, he rallied the Hokies from a
three-touchdown deficit before they ran out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Listed at 6 feet 1 inch and 214 pounds, Vick is said to be even
bigger and faster than he was a year ago, when he led the nation in
passing efficiency and finished third in the balloting for the
Heisman Trophy. Tech coach Frank Beamer said he had not had to
worry that Vick, whose face has been on almost as many magazine
covers this summer as Jennifer Aniston's, would become overwhelmed
by all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophomore jinx?'' Beamer said. ``I don't think that will be an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech might have to rummage for some rushing yardage and will
probably not hold six opponents to 10 points or less, as it did a
year ago. But Vick presents matchup problems for every opponent on
the Hokies' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has the type of team that can keep the ball away from
Vick. The Hurricanes have a fleet of four good running backs, a
young but talented quarterback in Ken Dorsey and receivers Santana
Moss and Reggie Wayne. Miami won seven of its last eight games last
season and scored at least 28 points in every game except the 43-10
loss Nov. 13 at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have already vowed that they will not make as
many mistakes as they did in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make mistakes against those guys,'' Wayne said.
``When we play them, the team that makes the most mistakes is going
to lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And, probably, the conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that this was the most balanced he had seen the Big
East in his six years as Miami's head coach, but that is damning
with faint praise. Though the other six teams in the conference
will certainly be trying to trip up Tech and Miami, none appear to
be deep or talented enough to make a serious run at the title.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Pettijohn, a senior defensive end, is the best player at
Syracuse, which beat Kentucky in the Music City Bowl to partly
atone for a disappointing season. Boston College has a good
quarterback in the senior Tim Hasselbeck, who threw a 97-yard
touchdown pass in a loss to Virginia Tech. Pittsburgh has
secondary-stretching wide receivers in Latef Grim and Antonio
Bryant. West Virginia's Avon Cobourne, just 5-8, led the Big East
in rushing as a freshman, gaining 1,139 yards and averaging 5.4
yards a carry. Temple has a promising sophomore defensive tackle
with good bloodlines, Dan Klecko, the son of the former Jet Joe
Klecko. And Rutgers has quarterback Mike McMahon back after
shoulder surgery, although he has been held out of some training
camp workouts after reporting stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   But Temple and Rutgers will simply be trying to keep up, again.
The Owls have won 15 games in the last 10 years. Rutgers has won
eight games in the last four years. Both went out the same way last
year _ with 55-0 losses to Miami. The goals for both Temple and
Rutgers are, not surprisingly, modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we want to win more than we lose,'' Rutgers
Coach Terry Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, meanwhile, has a loftier goal: winning the Big East
championship. With that would come a berth in a big bowl game, and
if the Canes can find a way to knock off both Tech and Florida
State, the defending national champion, at home, they could be
playing for the national title on Jan. 3 in the Orange Bowl at Pro
Player Stadium in Miami, a long bus ride from campus.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hokies await.

<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ It started slowly at first, a few students
holding hands in the bleachers and saying ``Our Father who art in
Heaven'' while football players gathered on the North Forrest High
School field Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they got to ``deliver us from evil,'' most of
the crowd of 4,500 was standing, proudly reciting the Lord's
Prayer, insisting that God cannot be removed even from a Class 4-A
high school football game.
</P>
<P>
   School officials carefully stayed out of the way, in order not
to violate a June decision of the U.S. Supreme Court prohibiting
student-led prayer at games and assemblies sanctioned by the
school. Handbills had been distributed by a Christian ministry
active in southern Mississippi urging people to pray just before
the game, but no loudspeaker was used, and there was no official
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the government shut down the prayers on the
intercom doesn't mean they can stop us from praying silently or
just starting a prayer, just by leading it by someone
anonymously,'' said Savannah Spencer, an eighth-grade clarinet
player who prayed with most of the school band. ``Our band teachers
and drum majors said we can stand up if we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was repeated, with various levels of participation, at
scores of high school football games around the South on Friday,
and is likely to grow as word spreads. Throughout the region, where
the line between religion and high school football has never been
particularly well-marked, grass-roots efforts are underway to
restore prayer to its traditional position just before the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, in a case involving the Santa Fe, Texas,
school board, was widely denounced in many Christian pulpits around
the South as the last straw in the court's recent decisions on
religion in public life. All summer, a loosely knit coalition of
conservative organizations and religious denominations have worked
on ways to legally maintain prayer at student gatherings, and the
solution was displayed Friday night: a planned recitation of the
Lord's Prayer, immediately after the National Anthem, by students
and parents who have not sought permission from the school to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the school isn't involved, the students and the
fans can get up and say whatever they want,'' said Paul Ott, a
popular outdoor-sports broadcaster in southern Mississippi who has
been using his radio show to spread the word about the prayer. ``We
are not going to let them take God any further away from our
country. People all over are standing up and saying the Lord's
Prayer to protect their religious liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement is catching on from Texas to the Carolinas. In
Asheville, N.C., last week, more than 25,000 people gathered at a
high school football stadium for a rally sponsored by a new group
called ``We Still Pray,'' which is promoting the recitation of the
Lord's Prayer. Scattered groups of people said the prayer at dozens
of games in western North Carolina Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   An organization called ``No Pray, No Play'' is advocating the
same idea in Texas, and has been supported by pastors around the
state who are organizing prayers for next week's games. In Forest
City, N.C., a radio station is allowing a pastor to say a prayer at
the beginning of high school football broadcasts, and is urging
fans at the game to turn up their radios during the prayer. The
American Family Association, a conservative Christian organization
led by the Rev. Donald Wildmon, is promoting prayer at football
games on its widely heard radio shows.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, church organizers are trying to stay within the
court ruling by bypassing the school administration. In its 6-3
decision, the court said that impermissible school involvement
included the use of the stadium public address system, a speaker
representing students, any direct supervision or approval by the
faculty, or any policy that explicitly or implicitly encourages
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But some districts are going further. In Batesburg-Leesville,
S.C., Friday, the student body president said a prayer over the
public address system before a football game. The school board in
Searcy, Ark., voted to let a Christian group hold prayers around a
school flag pole before games.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union branch in South Carolina says
it will go to court to stop the practice in Batesburg-Leesville.
But Steven Shapiro, the national legal director of the ACLU in New
York, said he was not sure what to make of the students who are
saying the Lord's Prayer on their own. If the school is genuinely
uninvolved, it might constitute protected free speech, he said,
though he is concerned about its presence at a school event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated legal question, but one of things we have
learned over years, is that school officials are rarely uninvolved
at their own events, rarely passive observers,'' he said. ``School
officials don't like to relinquish control.'' The organization's
response will depend on the facts surrounding a district's
involvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Dellinger, a constitutional scholar at Duke University
Law School and former solicitor general of the United States, said
prayer could pass muster only if it was truly private and
independent of school authority, at which point it would be
considered protected free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as unfortunate that football games can be used
as occasions for prayer, the effect of which is to make some
students feel like religious strangers at their own public
schools,'' he said. ``But as long as it is a product of private
decisions by individuals or groups, it doesn't violate the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   At two high schools in Hattiesburg, the school principals said
they had both been informed beforehand by organizers that the
prayer would be said, but took no action. At a game not far from
North Forrest at Hattiesburg High School, just a few students and
parents rose to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a while to catch on, like anything else,
but I think it's going to grow pretty big,'' said John Simpson, the
principal of Hattiesburg High School, who prayed. ``Most of the
students and parents support this _ they think the Supreme Court
went too far. ``I would love to be in the middle of it, but I'm not
going to violate the law. So I'm glad the kids are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased by the nature of the prayer, however.
Matthew Krell, who is Jewish and is a drum major in the band at
Hattiesburg High, said he wished the organizers had not chosen such
a well-known Christian prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against prayer, but it shouldn't be one specific to a
single religion,'' he said. ``If they ever really got organized, I
guess I'd just have to say the Sabbath prayer _ it's Friday night,
you know.''

AFTER 50 YEARS AND 317 VICTORIES, A DECISION SPARKS CONTROVERSY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Paterno once called Alabama coach Bear Bryant ``the nearest
thing we had to a god of football.'' And when Paterno met Bryant
for a national championship, Paterno made some mortal mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   After Paterno's conservative play-calling helped Alabama
preserve a 14-7 lead over Penn State with a goal-line stand late in
the 1979 Sugar Bowl, the Nittany Lions squandered another chance
when they were penalized for having too many men on the field
during an Alabama punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stood toe-to-toe with Bear Bryant,'' Paterno once
wrote, ``he out-coached me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant retired in 1982 and died in 1983. In their four meetings
as head coaches, Paterno never defeated Bryant and recalled last
week that Bryant was ``an epic figure.'' But this season, which
begins for Penn State Sunday with the Kickoff Classic against USC
at Giants Stadium, Paterno can eclipse Bryant and become No. 1 on a
prestigious list.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Nittany Lions win seven games, Paterno will have 324
victories, one more than Bryant's 323, the most for a coach in
Division I-A, the major league of college football. Eddie Robinson
won 408 games at Grambling State, a Division I-AA school. At age
73, as Paterno begins his 51st season at Penn State and his 35th as
head coach, his pursuit of Bryant's record will put him in the
national spotlight and help write the narrative of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't give it a lot of thought,'' Paterno said
recently, when asked about Bryant's record. ``I suppose when it
happens _ if it happens _ I'll be, you know, I'll probably choke up
again.'' He was referring to the emotion he showed on the field
after his 300th victory, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the attention paid to Paterno this season may not be all
flattering. There are renewed questions about Paterno's coaching
touch, the kind that have circulated before _ and have always been
disproved _ after low points in his career. Perhaps more serious is
skepticism about his use of a starting quarterback, Rashard Casey,
who has been charged with beating an off-duty police officer. To
some, playing Casey seems to contradict much of the ethical
approach that Paterno has stood for throughout his illustrious
career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, despite a 10-3 record, the Nittany Lions ended their
season in disappointment. Expected to contend for the national
championship and rated No. 2 in all the polls with a 9-0 record in
November, they lost their final three Big Ten games _ by a total of
12 points _ and fell from contention.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those defeats, 24-23 at home against Minnesota,
came on a last-second Minnesota field goal that ended a drive after
a Penn State punt. Had the Nittany Lions attempted and converted a
50-yard field goal, instead of punting from the Minnesota 33-yard
line, the Gophers would have needed a touchdown to win. Penn
State's kicker, Travis Forney, had hit the left upright from the
same spot earlier and was successful twice from 44 yards. ``That's
a mistake I made,'' Paterno said after that game.
</P>
<P>
   The skid that began that day continued a trend of poor finishes.
Paterno's teams used to get stronger in late season. But in the
last three years, the Nittany Lions are 4-7 in November, and they
have emphasized conditioning in recent months to eliminate
fourth-quarter sags.
</P>
<P>
   The more specific focus of debate this season will be the
presence of Casey, a senior charged with aggravated assault for a
fight with the officer, Patrick Fitzsimmons, outside a bar in
Casey's hometown, Hoboken, N.J., on May 14. Fitzsimmons has also
filed a civil suit against Casey and two other men who were with
Casey, although only one of the other men was charged with assault
in the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, at the
request of the police chief, is investigating allegations that the
officer was the victim of a racially based attack. The police said
that the white officer was with a black woman when they encountered
Casey and his friends, all of whom are black. Before the fight,
Casey told the woman she should be with black men, the police chief
said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is awkward for Paterno. And although the coach has
stressed his support for Casey, he has not publicly explained his
rationale at any length. Some critics want more from an individual
who has, in the past, talked and written extensively about
educational standards for athletes and is currently crusading
against betting on college sports in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play Rashard Casey until something convinces me I
shouldn't,'' Paterno said. When told that some observers are
perplexed by the situation, Paterno said: ``You don't expect me to
do anything just because something is alleged. If some people out
there are perplexed, I'm probably perplexed about their
perplexions.''
</P>
<P>
   With a grand jury in New Jersey expected to weigh the severity
of charges against Casey this autumn, would an indictment of his
quarterback persuade Paterno to change his thinking? ``If it was a
question of indictment, I think I would probably want to talk that
over with university officials,'' Paterno said. ``But that's
different than if he's guilty. I'd have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   He has made big decisions before. After graduating from Brown in
1950, Paterno was headed for law school but accepted what he
thought would be a temporary position as an assistant coach at Penn
State. His coach at Brown, Rip Engle, was moving and he needed
Paterno's help in installing the T-formation with the Nittany
Lions. As Paterno grew comfortable in coaching, he began to crave a
head-coaching position and discussed it with Vince Lombardi, a
friend from Brooklyn who was also learning the craft as an
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi had coached a New Jersey high school team against
Paterno's Brooklyn Prep team when Paterno was a player. Lombardi
told Paterno that they would face discrimination in their careers
because they were Italian and Catholic. Paterno had already felt
the snubs of some wealthy and privileged fellow students at Brown.
His experiences, he has said, sharpened his sensitivity regarding
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Since replacing Engle in 1966, Paterno has won two national
championships and 20 of 30 bowl games and has had five undefeated
seasons while compiling a record of 317-83-3. He has befriended
prominent politicians, including Republican presidents. He and his
wife, Sue, have donated $3.5 million to Penn State for nonsports
use. He has sent dozens of players to the National Football League,
including Courtney Brown and LaVar Arrington, defenders who were
the first two players chosen in the draft last spring. He has
motivated and related to several generations of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the world to me, him believing in me that much,''
Casey said, when asked about playing for Paterno. ``I can look back
at all the times I met with him and spoke to him. He knows me as a
person. He knows how I carry myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey said people frequently ask him about Paterno's intensity
and Casey tells them: ``You've got to get used to him. He can
intimidate you early. When he yells at me, I laugh at his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a voice from Brooklyn, which rises in pitch and intensity
when Paterno is angry. Omar Easy, a tailback, said Paterno's voice
``is kind of different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can stay a mile away and hear him screaming,'' Easy said.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Kurpeikis, a defensive end, discussed Paterno's energy
and how he runs after players up and down the field at practice.
``It's somewhat comical,'' he said. ``It's amazing. You don't
realize he's as old as he is because he doesn't act his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ron Graham also marvels at Paterno's energy. ``You
see him out on the practice field, running around and being
involved the way he is, you wouldn't think he's 70-some years
old,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Rod Perry said: ``It's not real hard to relate to
good people. Good people kind of cross generation gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistent in appearance for decades, Paterno retains a full
head of dark hair, flecked with gray. He still wears tinted glasses
and rolled-up pants above white socks and black athletic shoes. He
will turn 74 right before Christmas, but will probably not retire,
even if he surpasses Bryant, who coached almost until he died. In
1998, Paterno said, ``I have programmed myself that I want to go
through 2001,'' but last summer he signed a five-year extension
through 2004. He has frequently said he would not know what to do
without coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno chuckled when he recalled a comment by 70-year-old Bobby
Bowden of Florida State, whose 304 victories are second among
active coaches. ``When you retire, there is just one more big
event,'' Bowden said. ``And I ain't ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a light moment last year, Paterno suggested he would remain
head coach for 50 years. That would take him to 2015, when the man
some call St. Joe would be 88 years old. ``That should get me into
heaven,'' Paterno said. ``It will be my penance.''

COLLEGE FOOTBALL NOTES AND NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Off the Beaten Path
</P>
<P>
   The two best running backs in the nation cannot be found in the
Big Ten or the Southeastern Conference. You need to look to the
Western Athletic Conference and Texas Christian, where LaDainian
Tomlinson will begin a Heisman Trophy bid as direct as his Web
site's name: www.LT For 2000.com. Or to the Southern Conference and
Georgia Southern, where Adrian Peterson is aiming at Division I-AA
career yardage record.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, TCU went 8-4 and won its second consecutive bowl game
because Tomlinson was impossible to bring down. The 5-foot-11-inch,
220-pound running back led the nation in rushing with 1,850 yards,
averaged 168.1 yards a game and set a NCAA record by running for
406 yards against Texas-El Paso. His feelings were bruised when he
finished 14th in last year's Heisman race despite outgaining the
winner, Ron Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   So he has set his sights on gaining 2,000 yards this year and at
least getting an invite to the Downtown Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   For Peterson that number is 6,193 _ the I-AA career rushing
record set by Jerry Azumah of New Hampshire from 1995-98. Peterson,
a junior, already has 3,739 yards. He will not be overlooked
anymore if he has a good performance against Division I-A Georgia
on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Best of the Trenches
</P>
<P>
   He does not get as much attention as running back Anthony Thomas
or wide receiver David Terrell, but Michigan's most decorated
player is offensive guard Steve Hutchinson. He is the favorite for
the Outland Trophy as the nation's best lineman and is a lock to be
named all-Big Ten for the fourth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Coach's Prerogative
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Kentucky coach Hal Mumme decided to replace
quarterback Dusty Bonner _ who led the Southeastern Conference in
passing efficiency and yards in 1999 _ with a redshirt freshman
with the build and bulk of a lineman: 6-4, 275-pound Jared
Lorenzen. ``I was speechless,'' Lorenzen said when Mumme told him
of the change.
</P>
<P>
   While Bonner transferred, Mumme, who polished Tim Couch, said he
had chosen the right man to stretch the field. ``He's very accurate
and has a good touch. He can take it off of it if he needs to. He's
a great athlete.''

   BILINGUAL-AMERICA _ CHICAGO _ ``Welcome. We speak Spanish,''
said the sign in Spanish beckoning customers to get a haircut at a
suburban Chicago salon. But somewhere along the way, former
employees allege, the Regis Hairstylist Salon decided that Spanish
spoken among employees made its English-speaking customers
uncomfortable. The sign disappeared and employees were ordered to
speak only English. Several hairstylists allege that they lost
their jobs for speaking their native tongue. As immigrants from

   COXNET FOCUS 0826: MADAM PRESIDENT -- What's next, ``Vice
President Ken''? The joking perhaps was inevitable when the
nonprofit group the White House Project teamed up recently with
Mattel and Girls' Inc. to launch a President Barbie doll. With a
politically correct helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand
nuclear war and an unintentionally funny advisory on the back of
her box _ ``Podium not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this
Leader of the Free (Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous
light. But many people aren't laughing these days when the subject
turns to a woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican and
Democratic conventions, and both George W. Bush and Al Gore
reportedly included a woman on their ``short list'' of potential
running mates (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes

   MEXICO-CENTAM _ TAPACHULA, MEXICO _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene
Lopez, 15, said she was willing to do anything if she could just
get to the United States. ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take
care of babies,'' the Salvadoran teenager said earnestly, her eyes
as wide as saucers. But Lopez never made to Houston or El Paso, her
dream cities. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all teen-age
girls _ ended up in a jail cell here for undocumented migrants
crossing into Mexico's southernmost Chiapas state. While U.S.
officials conduct their own battle to stem illegal crossings,
Mexican officials here say they've seen a 30 percent increase over
last year in the number of undocumented immigrants they're catching
along the southern border with Guatemala. Although they've taken
South Americans into custody, too, the vast majority detained are
Central Americans bound for the United States. An increasing number
appear to be willing to take perilous journeys to avoid capture,
suffocating in cargo trailers or drowning at sea. Those captured
often say they're looking for a way out of poverty that hasn't
abated after years of civil war and 1998's Hurricane Mitch.

Whatever happened to good manners? It's a question that's been
asked often in recent years. About the time we all fell in love
with blue jeans and sweats, it seems we stopped minding our P's and

one of those who mourns the loss, take heart. If this year's fall
fashions are any indication, significant changes are in store.

MIXED REVIEWS FOR BUSH POLICY ON HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ The scene from the 1998 race for governor
hardly suggested a typical Republican tableau: There in Segundo
Barrio, one of the oldest and poorest neighborhoods in this
isolated border city, Gov. George W. Bush had come to eat Mexican
sweetbread and campaign in Spanish accented with a Texas twang.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was venturing into one of the last Democratic strongholds
in Texas, an overwhelmingly Hispanic city that no Republican
candidate for governor had ever won. But when Bush was re-elected
by a landslide, he also by one estimate won nearly half the
Hispanic vote statewide. He even won El Paso. It seemed like
political magic; he had found votes in places Republicans usually
dared not tread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened eyes among Republicans across the country,'' said
Kenneth Carr, chairman of the city's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigns for president as ``a different kind of
Republican,'' Bush is now sprinkling his Spanish from Iowa to
California, courting Hispanic voters nationwide much as he did in
Texas. In speeches, he often mentions the 1998 race as evidence of
his commitment to inclusiveness and proof that his policies offer
benefits that are colorblind.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush's record shows that he has embraced his state's
growing Mexican-American population, pointedly rejecting the
hostility shown by some members of his party on issues like
immigration and bilingual education. However, Hispanics in Texas
remain more likely to be poor, unemployed and without health
insurance _ ingrained problems that predate Bush but that his
critics say he has done too little to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush's rhetoric is more moderate,'' said Dolores
Briones, the El Paso County judge, a Democrat and the county's
highest elected official, ``but the reality for our families has
not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there is debate in Texas about how well Bush did
with Hispanics in 1998. He won 69 percent of the overall vote, and
he has claimed winning 49 percent of the Hispanic vote, based on an
initial exit poll. But that figure is remarkably high for a
Republican, and later exit polls and academic studies suggest his
actual total might have been closer to 33 percent, still high for a
Republican but not as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use the 50 percent, and that's just false,'' said Rodolfo
de la Garza, head of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at the
University of Texas, who has studied the race. He cautioned against
using the 1998 race as a gauge of Bush's potential appeal because
turnout was low and the challenger was weak.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Hispanics have emerged as the nation's
fastest' growing minority group since Bush took office in 1995.
Demographic studies in Texas predict that Hispanics, mostly
Mexican-Americans, will surpass Anglos and become the largest
ethnic group by 2030. In Houston, the state's largest city,
Hispanics are expected to gain majority status by the end of this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the political response to this new wave of
immigration at times has been hostile. Republicans in Congress
fought to kill bilingual education and pushed for laws establishing
English as the country's official language. Pat Buchanan, running
for president in 1996, threatened to build a wall along the border.
And, most notably, Gov. Pete Wilson of California became a symbol
of intolerance to many Hispanics in 1994 by championing Proposition
187, a controversial referendum that denied most government
benefits to illegal immigrants and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush established a different tone. His first political appointee
was Tony Garza, a Mexican-American, whom Bush named secretary of
state. In his first piece of state business, Bush met with the
governors of five Mexican states near the border. He opposed
Proposition 187 and supported English Plus, a modified version of
bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   His position on Proposition 187 was mostly moot _ Texas did not
provide nearly the same amount of benefits to undocumented
immigrants as California did _ but it established him as a friendly
face in a hostile party. He courted Mexico, supporting the Clinton
administration's bailout of the peso when congressional Republicans
criticized the plan. In 1996, when a quirk in the federal welfare
overhaul left many legal immigrants without food stamps, Bush made
an emergency expenditure to provide aid to the elderly and disabled
until federal officials corrected the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also courted Hispanics on a personal level. He spoke
Spanish often, if not always fluently, and talked of shared
cultures, a point underscored by his own traditional Christmas
menu, which included tamales and enchiladas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Mexican-American community, we appreciate that his
feelings are heartfelt,'' said Garza, now a member of the Texas
Railroad Commission, whose chief responsibility is regulating the
oil and gas industry. ``You don't get finger pointing from George
W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Bush and other national Republicans was
stark, but, in many ways, he was following the path taken by other
Texas governors. Texas and Mexico have long shared cultural,
historic and economic ties that have made the two interdependent.
When the Mexican peso was devalued in the mid-1990s, the ripple
effect was felt all along the Texas border; in El Paso, 80 stores
closed. The advent of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
which opened trade between Mexico and the United States, has only
deepened the mutual self-interest _ state statistics show that more
than 228,000 jobs in Texas are now linked to NAFTA.
</P>

   ``No governor in Texas has ever done what Pete Wilson did,''
said de la Garza, the University of Texas government professor. And
Bush, he said, has also used his personal charm to establish
himself as a ``buena gent,'' or good guy. ``Above all, he has
managed symbols wonderfully, and that's not a trivial issue. He has
demonstrated cultural respect.''

<P>
   A review of Bush's record shows a more complicated picture. Dan
Bartlett, a campaign spokesman for Bush, said the governor had
appealed to Hispanics through broad conservative themes and a
cultural emphasis on family and tradition. ``The whole theme of
personal responsibility and accountability, coupled with the
message of inclusion, has resonated with the Hispanic community in
Texas,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush regularly cites statistics showing how test scores of
minority students, including those of Hispanics, have risen in
Texas during his tenure. Roughly 70 percent of Hispanic students
passed the most recent Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, the
exam students must pass to graduate. His Hispanic allies, like
Alberto Gonzales, whom Bush appointed to the Texas Supreme Court,
called education a critical issue and credited Bush for appealing
to Hispanic voters with an optimistic, inclusive message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope is often all that poor Hispanic kids have,'' said
Gonzales, who grew up poor but went on to graduate from Harvard Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   But criticisms of the assessment exam have been loudest from
minority groups. The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund in San
Antonio challenged the test in court, saying it discriminated
against Hispanics, who were more likely to be enrolled in schools
with fewer resources. The lawsuit also contended that the state had
vastly undercounted dropout rates for Hispanics, and it estimated
the true rate at above 50 percent. In January, a federal judge
upheld the state's right to administer the test but agreed with the
plaintiffs that ``Texas minority students have been, and to some
extent continue to be, the victims of educational inequality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's emphasis on inclusion has focused attention on the 3,041
appointments he has made, perhaps his greatest power as governor.
His aides note that in addition to Garza and Gonzales, the governor
has appointed several other Hispanics to high-level positions,
including Jose Montemayor as commissioner of insurance, and Tony
Sanchez and Raul Romero to the University of Texas Board of
Regents.
</P>
<P>
   But state records show that Bush's appointments still tend to be
overwhelmingly white and mostly male in a state that is
increasingly less so. His appointments have been 77 percent white,
13 percent Hispanic, 9 percent black and 1 percent from other
racial groups. By comparison, the state is 55 percent white, 31
percent Hispanic, 11 percent black and 3 percent other racial
groups. Sixty-three percent of Bush's appointees are men and 37
percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   For any Texas governor, one of the most difficult challenges is
addressing the endemic poverty along the Mexico border, and Bush's
political success in places like El Paso has raised questions about
what he has done for the region. Politically, the border is
regarded as one of the last bastions of Democratic power in Texas,
but Bush sensed an opportunity in 1998. He visited the city at
least 13 times during his first term, partly because his wife,
Laura, had family ties here, partly because the city offered him a
chance to demonstrate his bipartisan and biracial appeal.
</P>
<P>
   His local campaign attracted Democratic activists like Terry
Diaz, who said she was drawn by Bush's charisma but also by a
pragmatic desire to have his ear for El Paso. Carlos Ramirez, the
city's Democratic mayor, angered his party by endorsing Bush and
recalled a frantic Election Day scramble as volunteers handed out
fliers at baseball games and canvassed churches, encouraging people
to vote. ``It was an extremely emotional, very satisfying effort,''
Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won El Paso by 600 votes, a narrow margin that gave him a
large symbolic victory. His huge re-election win, coupled with his
strong showing among Hispanics, buttressed his national reputation
as the front-runner for the party's presidential nomination. In El
Paso, Ramirez said the governor had delivered in his promises to
help the city, appointing two residents to powerful state
educational boards, supporting the city in a water dispute with New
Mexico and signing a law intended to speed up water and sewage
services to the poorest communities along the border called
colonias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has never said no to a request we have made from
him,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree. Diaz, for example, ultimately became
disenchanted with the governor and dropped out of his campaign,
saying he had done too little to address border problems. The high
rates of poverty and the uninsured existed for decades, and Diaz
and others said they did not expect Bush to resolve such rooted
problems in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
   But Eliot Shapleigh, a Democratic state senator who represents
El Paso, including many Hispanic neighborhoods, said the border
still suffers too many inequities. He said local hospitals struggle
because the state reimbursement rate for Medicaid is lower on the
border than elsewhere. He also said per capita income on the border
had fallen every year since Bush took office. Shapleigh and other
lawmakers along the border have called for a ``Marshall Plan'' of
state investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the governor, and you've got 77 percent popularity
and a $6 billion surplus, you can make big things happen in
Texas,'' Shapleigh said. ``He punted.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pressing problems along the border is the lack
of health insurance. More than 1.4 million children in Texas are
uninsured. In El Paso alone, 72,000 children who are eligible are
not yet enrolled in Medicaid or the federal Child Health Insurance
Program. Several lawmakers have received complaints that state
officials make it too difficult to enroll in either program and
have expressed concerns that the federal government could withhold
some money for the insurance program if the pace is not quickened.
Since May 1, about 80,000 children have been enrolled, roughly 17
percent of the goal of 428,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has been extremely friendly, extremely
supportive in public statements, but the state has not turned the
corner in dealing with these issues,'' said Bill Schlesinger, a
co-director of Project Vida, a nonprofit agency with a clinic in
one of El Paso's poorest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already been criticized for his efforts in the 1999
legislative session to limit the number of people eligible for the
child insurance program to those with family incomes up to 150
percent of the poverty line, even though federal law provided
coverage for up to 200 percent. The lower figure would have left
200,000 children without coverage. The governor ultimately signed
the law at the 200 percent threshold, and his aides call the issue
a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are aggressive efforts under way to enroll children in
CHIP,'' Bartlett said.

   Atlantic Coast
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Florida State, a potential national champion now
and forever. It needs receivers for Chris Weinke, its 28-year-old
quarterback, but it has always found them. Clemson will challenge
if its offense jells and its rebuilt secondary comes together.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOT _ North Carolina, with an offense retooled after last
season's 3-8 aberration.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ QB Chris Weinke and CB Tay Cody, Florida State;
OLB Keith Adams and FS Robert Carswell, Clemson; TE Alge Crumpler,
North Carolina; RB LaMont Jordan, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   PIVOTAL GAMES _ Georgia Tech at Clemson Oct. 28, Clemson at
Florida State Nov. 4, Florida at Florida State Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Can Georgia Tech replace quarterback Joe Hamilton
and remain competitive?
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic 10
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Massachusetts, the Division I-AA national champion
in 1998, will be a power again behind the running of tailback
Marcel Shipp. Delaware and James Madison, both with sound defenses,
may be nationally ranked, too.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOT _ Villanova, because Brian Westbrook, a combination
running back and wide receiver, is back after missing last season
with an injured knee. In 1998, he became the first college player
at any level to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving
in one season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ MLB Kole Ayi, Massachusetts; DE Chris Morant,
James Madison; RB Butter Pressey, Delaware; QB Mike Scipione,
Villanova.

<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Can any visitor beat Massachusetts, which has
lost only one home game the last two years?
</P>
<P>
   Big East
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Miami, once the best team in the nation, and
Virginia Tech, which made a run for the national title last season,
are powers again. Miami, with 14 starters back from its Gator
Bowl-winning team, gets the edge, but beware of Tech and its wizard
at quarterback, Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOTS _ Pitt, 5-6 last season, has a dangerous passing
game, and Boston College can run.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ QB Michael Vick and OT Dave Kadela, Virginia Tech;
WR Santana Moss and ILB Dan Morgan, Miami; WR Latef Grim, Pitt; CB
Will Allen, Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   PIVOTAL GAMES _ Virginia Tech at Boston College Sept. 30,
Florida State at Miami Oct. 7, Virginia Tech at Miami Nov. 4.

<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Can Syracuse, for years a national power, turn
around from last season's 3-4 conference debacle?
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ A powerhouse conference that sent seven teams to
bowl games last season and has seven in a consensus preseason Top
25. The best may be Wisconsin, with sound running despite Ron
Dayne's graduation, and Michigan, if quarterback Drew Henson
recovers quickly from preseason foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOT _ Illinois, which beat Michigan and Ohio State on the
road last season and has most of that offense back.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ QB Drew Brees, Purdue; CB Jamar Fletcher,
Wisconsin; WR David Terrell and OG Steve Hutchinson, Michigan; C
Ben Hamilton and DE Karon Riley, Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   PIVOTAL GAMES _Penn State at Ohio State Sept. 23, Wisconsin at
Michigan Sept. 30, Michigan at Purdue Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Can Penn State, with a new defensive coordinator
and nine new defensive starters and with quarterback Rashard Casey
facing legal problems, be a national challenger again?
</P>
<P>
   Big 12
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Nebraska, with a brutal but partly rebuilding
defense, and an offense almost as good, may be the best team in the
nation. Kansas State, with question marks on offense, benefits from
a soft schedule. Texas has a secure defense and talented
quarterbacks in Major Applewhite and Chris Simms.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOT _ Colorado, despite a tough early schedule, a new
quarterback and an offense that lacks the power of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ QB Eric Crouch, OG Russ Hochstein and ILB Carlos
Polk, Nebraska; OT Leonard Davis and DT Casey Hampton, Texas; S
Jarrod Cooper, Kansas State; DE Justin Smith, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   PIVOTAL GAMES _ Texas-Oklahoma at Dallas Oct. 7, Nebraska at
Oklahoma Oct. 28, Nebraska at Kansas State Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ If quarterback Eric Crouch is hurt, will Nebraska
hold up with inexperienced replacements?
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Southern Mississippi, with a solid defense, should
roll after season-opening road games against Tennessee and Alabama.
East Carolina's many-splendored offense should win games, too.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOTS _ Houston, Louisville, Cincinnati and Memphis are
clustered on the next tier. None seems a title threat.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ DE Cedric Scott and SS Leo Barnes, Southern
Mississippi; QB David Garrard and LB Pernell Griffin, East
Carolina; OG Josh Lovelady, Houston; C Doug Rosfeld, Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   PIVOTAL GAMES _ Virginia Tech at East Carolina Sept. 7; Southern
Mississippi-Alabama at Birmingham, Ala., Sept. 16; East Carolina at
Southern Mississippi Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Will Southern Mississippi, with so many new
offensive assistants, play cohesively?
</P>
<P>
   Ivy
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Cornell, which averaged 40 points a game last
season, returns 10 offensive starters to its pro-type offense.
Yale, another passing team, needs the inexperienced Peter Lee to
measure up to the graduated Joe Walland at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOT _ Penn, with its big offense, although graduation took
three starting defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ CB Todd Tomich and SS Than Merrill, Yale; QB Gavin
Hoffman and TB Kris Ryan, Penn; QB Ricky Rahne and WR Joe
Splendorio, Cornell; WR Stephen Campbell, Brown.
</P>
<P>
   PIVOTAL GAMES _ Yale at Cornell Sept. 23, Penn at Cornell Nov.
18, Yale at Harvard Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Can Cornell's defense hold up in a league in
which every team averaged at least 30 points a game last year?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Pacific 10
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Washington's productive option offense features
quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo, who passed for 302 yards and ran
for 207 against Stanford last season. Southern California should
win behind a veteran defense. Alas, the Big 2 do not meet.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOTS _ UCLA, if it finds depth. Oregon, if it finds
runners.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ OT Chad Ward and SS Hakim Akbar, Washington; RB
Ken Simonton, Oregon State; TE Todd Heap, Arizona State; DE Kenyon
Coleman, UCLA; DT Ennis Davis, Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   PIVOTAL GAMES _ Oregon at Southern California Oct. 14, UCLA at
Washington Nov. 11, Southern California at UCLA Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Can Washington's new linebackers and cornerbacks
help to put the Huskies into the national championship picture?
</P>
<P>
   Patriot
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Colgate and Lehigh, who tied for the title last
year, are again the best, although graduation hit both offenses
hard.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOT _ Towson, especially if it finds a worthy successor to
quarterback Joe Lee.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ RB Randall Joseph and CB Brandon Tinson, Colgate;
WR Jamal White, DE Andrew Hollingsworth and FS Ricky Crestwell,
Towson.
</P>

Oct. 7, Colgate at Lehigh Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   KEY QUESTION _ Can Colgate replace Ryan Vena and can Lehigh
replace Phil Stambaugh, the best quarterbacks in this high-powered
passing league last year?
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ With 19 returning starters, Alabama, the surprising
conference champion last season, looks good again. So do Florida,
with a veteran defense, and Georgia, with a big offense led by
quarterback Quincy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOTS _ Many candidates, but not Lou Holtz's South Carolina
Gamecocks, who were 0-11 last season in his first season with the
team.
</P>
<P>
   KEY PLAYERS _ WR Freddie Milons, C Paul Hogan and OLB Saleem
Rasheed, Alabama; DE Alex Brown, Florida; ILB Jamie Winborn,

   KEY QUESTION _ Can quarterback Jesse Palmer, in his senior year,
do justice leading Florida's pass-happy offense?
</P>
<P>
   Others
</P>
<P>
   CONTENDERS _ Notre Dame is the best of a weak group of
independents, and its running game has improved, but the Irish
could be 0-4 before the end of September. Texas Christian, with a
soft schedule, is favored in the Western Athletic Conference;
Colorado State in the Mountain West, Marshall in the Mid-American,
Boise State in the Big West and Duquesne in the Metro Atlantic
Athletic.
</P>
<P>
   LONG SHOTS _ Utah and Brigham Young in the Mountain West, Fresno

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Joe Gardi calls his Hofstra University
football team the Road Warriors, meaning, they will go just about
anywhere for a game.
</P>
<P>
   They have no choice. In this age of sprawling leagues,
proliferating conferences, made-for-TV affiliations, new best
friends with instant traditions, Hofstra goes it alone.
</P>
<P>
   The solo act is fine if you're Notre Dame and can hire your own
television network, and play anybody you want. It doesn't work that
way for a school on Long Island with little drawing power and a
potent run-and-gun offense.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to be locked in with a Division I-AA powerhouse
that is sending more players to the National Football League than
some of the traditional schools that grab the prime time and the
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra has sent Wayne Chrebet to the Jets' bunker on the fringe
of the campus. Earlier this month, Gardi went out to the Hall of
Fame Game in Ohio to have his photo taken with four of his players
currently with the San Francisco 49ers: Dave Fiore, Lance
Schulters, Jim Emanuel and last year's all-American, Giovanni
Carmazzi, the third quarterback picked in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is such an effective advertisement that hardly anybody
wants to play the freelance kings of the Hempstead plains.
</P>
<P>
   Check out this schedule _ at Montana this Saturday, forest fires
or not; then go to Maine; two home games against Delaware and Rhode
Island; then go to Massachusetts; a week later at Portland State in
Oregon; two home games against Liberty and Elon; then Cal Poly at
San Luis Obispo; a week later at Youngstown in Ohio. Then Albany at
home. Then possibly three straight weeks of Division I-AA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the more eclectic schedules in the land. If you
wrote the names of the opponents on a blackboard, you would be
hard-pressed to deduce what they have in common. ``We're a victim
of our success,'' said Gardi, who has won 81 games, lost 29 and
tied 2.
</P>
<P>
   When Gardi arrived in 1990, the road trips were to Bucknell,
Stony Brook, Gettysburg, Catholic and Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying Dutchmen Travel Itinerary,'' the media guide said:
``Team leaves via bus from the Hofstra Field House at 8:30 a.m ...
will arrive at 10:30 a.m.'' Now that was a road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Hofstra was playing Montana in the university
town of Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful, gorgeous, spectacular,'' Gardi recalled. ``They
filmed the movie `And a River Runs Through It' right around there.
Great little stadium. Fifteen thousand people right on top of you.
Screaming at you the whole game. One guy was right behind me.
Finally I turned around and said to his wife, `Ma'am, you're the
one I feel sorry for.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gardi just happens to remember the details of that game, how
instead of felling logs and punching cattle the Montana players
thumped on Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of my guys went down on one play,'' Gardi recalled the
other day. ``I ran out there and told them: `Hey, this is
embarrassing. Two of you better get up,' and two of 'em did, but
the third guy was hurt worse than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The final score was 50-6, and Gardi was concerned he might have
led his troops over their heads. He still recalls one of his
players, Herve Damas, consoling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, don't worry about it,'' Damas said. ``We got our butts
beat, but this is a lot better than Hempstead Turnpike'' _ meaning,
better than local rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hofstra has roamed to the ends of the earth for
games, meanwhile petitioning the traditional Eastern conferences
for membership. Gardi would love to play nonleague games against
his alma mater, Maryland, or Rutgers from his home state of New
Jersey, but it's not happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not stupid,'' Gardi said. ``I've heard people say
that as long as I'm here, Hofstra will never get in a conference.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to be here a while. Gardi, 61, recently re-upped for
five more years. ``I know guys in my business who retire,'' he
said. ``Then they're calling and saying, `Hey, can I come over and
do anything?'''
</P>
<P>
   He still revels in being called Coach. After his 10-year gig as
defensive guru with the Jets went sour in 1985, Gardi worked five
years monitoring officials for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train ride from Sayville took two hours,'' Gardi said.
``Other people read the paper or did crossword puzzles. I dreamed
about coaching four hours a day. Even when I was watching films of
the officials, I sneaked a peek at what the teams were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Hofstra were matched in 1990. Gardi, from Maryland, and
Dr. James Shuart, the Hofstra president and an alum, hit it off
like the old linemen they are. Gardi promised Shuart he would take
Hofstra far. Turned out he meant Missoula.

CONDO COMPLEX'S RESIDENTS WANT TO LIVE IN SAME CITY  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECILIA CHAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although Clifford Levine and Joe Borden live just
across the street from each other in the gated Creekside
condominium complex, they call separate cities home.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabasas-Los Angeles boundary line runs right through the
95-unit complex, leaving residents served by different school
districts, cable franchises, utility companies and even police
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a crazy set-up,'' said Levine, whose house sits
on the Los Angeles side of Park Arroyo. ``It's just incredibly
incongruous we should be separated like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they are shuffled between police and sheriff's
departments or told they need a nonresident card to use their
neighborhood library. Children who live on the west side of Park
Arroyo attend classes in the Las Virgenes Unified School District,
while those right across the street go to Los Angeles schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the worst thing in the world, but it makes it
confusing,'' said Creekside resident Bonnie Sima, who lives on the
Los Angeles side. ``It makes it difficult for us to have a sense of
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Calabasas is now trying to unite the neighborhood with a plan to
annex the 55 Creekside condominiums that are in Los Angeles.
Calabasas officials, who submitted an application to the Los
Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission in February 1999,
must first get the OK from the city of Los Angeles to detach the
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that just for consistency within the complex, all
of those residents should be Calabasas residents,'' said Mark
Persico, Calabasas' planning and building services director. ``We
believe, and the residents believe, it all should be under the
control of one agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of a smaller unit of government means a greater
voice in local issues,'' he said. ``They will have a greater
ability to effect change if they were coming to Calabasas City
Council vs. Los Angeles City Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Creekside was built back in the early 1980s, on a lot that
straddled the boundary between the city of Los Angeles and
unincorporated Los Angeles County. To complete the project, the
developer had to get permits from both the city and county planning
departments.
</P>
<P>
   When Calabasas became a city in 1991, its boundary took in the
unincorporated portion of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after incorporating, Calabasas tried to annex a 60-acre
parcel on the western edge of Woodland Hills that encompassed
Creekside, a commercial strip and the historic landmarks of Leonis
Adobe and the Plummer House.
</P>
<P>
   But the city of Los Angeles refused to part with the land
because of the sales tax revenue it would lose.
</P>
<P>
   Although Los Angeles officials generally support the annexation
of Creekside, they are concerned about the inclusion of the
intersection of Valmar Road and Park Ora, just east of the condo
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic department from Los Angeles had questions about
giving up that intersection because they've got residents on the
east side of the intersection and we've got residents on the west
side,'' Persico said. ``They've got a question of relinquishing
control of the entire intersection.''
</P>
<P>
   Persico said Calabasas officials plan to meet with Los Angeles
City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, whose district includes part
of the complex, to discuss concerns of control over the
right-of-way.
</P>
<P>
   Miscikowski was out of town last week and could not be reached
for comment. But her spokesman, Glenn Barr, said she is open to the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we support this thing? It's self-evident,'' Barr said.
``She was the one who introduced the motion to do the detachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials said no date has been set for the City
Council to vote on Miscikowski's request to detach the 10.7 acres.
</P>
<P>
   But for residents of Creekside, the action can't come too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Pagni, who has lived at Creekside for 12 years, said
parents on the Los Angeles side of the complex are anxious to have
their children attend Las Virgenes schools, which are not only
closer but have a better reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has really been the motivating factor to get annexed,''
Pagni said.
</P>
<P>
   Being united also would do away with confusion in trying to deal
with various government entities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got a threatening phone call and I called the (Los
Angeles) Police Department but nobody would claim me,'' Pagni said.
``Calabasas said they didn't take L.A. calls and Los Angeles didn't
know what division I was in. It took me an hour to get the right
station.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two entities was underscored after
the Northridge Earthquake in 1994, when Levine was without water
for days while Borden, his Calabasas neighbor, had plenty to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the earthquake the water was turned off for about
four to five days,'' said Levine, president of the Creekside
Homeowners Association. ``Las Virgenes (Municipal Water District)
was the first to turn on its water. We had to walk across the
street to our neighbors and get pails of water from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Borden also would like to see the annexation come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like Cliff to be more than just a neighbor,'' Borden
said. ``I would like him to live in the same city.''

 &HT;    Yard sales a bonanza for bargain-hunters

<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Take 50 cents?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Biesecker held up a ceramic cat figurine marked $1 for
inspection by the woman who has just wandered out of her house
munching a doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   It was early on a Friday morning in July and Biesecker knew
better than to pay $1. The woman looked like she just wanted to get
rid of the stuff so she wouldn't have to haul it off.
</P>
<P>
   She nodded agreeably. ``Sure,'' she said, and Biesecker smiled,
chit-chatting with the woman about this and that as she continued
looking over the items _ a bin of mostly full bottles of nail
polish in shades of pink and red, a stack of garden tools, old
self-help books.
</P>
<P>
   Biesecker knelt to inspect a box of fabric pieces and asked,
``How much for the fabric?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A dollar for the whole box,'' the woman said, so Biesecker
left the sale with a box of fabric and a ceramic cat, all for
$1.50.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk about yard sales, because there's a lot to say. Well,
actually, all that really needs to be said is that people have yard
sales and people buy things at yard sales. That's it. Otherwise,
they're just a tiny drop in this great ocean of global economy.
They're significant only to those who have them and to those who
pore over newspaper yard sale listings Thursday night, circling the
ones they want to hit early Friday morning in search of just about
anything. The ``just about anything'' is what it's really about,
and right now is a high point of yard sale season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's a lot to say about yard sales after all.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it's about man's relationship with his stuff.
That's a whole different story, the complex psychology of
ownership, but what it comes down to, basically, is this: Earth is
essentially a marble in the middle of a solar system that's in the
outer reaches of a spiral galaxy somewhere in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ we get even more insignificant. Earth's circumference
is about 25,000 miles, so compared to one average person, who has a
circumference of about three feet, Earth is pretty big. And it's
all we have. All ``I am the master of all I survey'' positivisms
aside, we're hurtling through a great starry void, kept on this
crazy marble only by gravity. So we cling to what we can, drawing
things near us to feel significant, to feel in control, to stake a
claim in the world we know.
</P>
<P>
   What started with cave people _ My sticks! My spear! _ has
somehow become right now: My MP3 player! My titanium golf clubs!
Prosperity based on what we draw from the earth means we can cling
to more of it. Which has made us jaded.
</P>
<P>
   We get tired of our stuff. It bores us after a while, or
outlives its usefulness to us, or overstays its welcome in our
homes and garages. But we're torn by the thought that once it was
valuable to us, once it meant something. So we think, ``Well, I
could have a yard sale and get a little money for it, so the memory
of my former stuff will live on in my new stuff.'' And then we
think, ``Plus, it might be valuable to somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   THREE MAIN KINDS OF YARD SALES:
</P>
<P>
   1. Just take it. Please. And don't tell anyone that I ever even
owned a ThighMaster, let alone sold it at my yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   2. We're going be rich, rich, rich because we're going to put
some stuff out on the driveway and charge a lot for it. Five bucks
for the game of Scrabble that's missing the F's. (In other words,
my stuff is pretty cool, even though I don't want it anymore.)
</P>
<P>
   3. But this was my grandmother's. It's valuable. (Which begs the
question: Why, then, are you selling it?) Variation: It's an
antique. I saw somewhere/someone told me that this is worth a lot
because it's from the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's old doesn't mean it's valuable,'' said B.
Erin Cole as she pulled up to a townhouse yard sale mid-morning on
a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick circuit of the carport, where tables were piled
with books for a dollar and costume jewelry in the $2 to $10 range,
Cole thanked the proprietors and left, saying, ``They liked their
stuff,'' under her breath.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, her mother and various other relatives have been going to
yard sales for about as long as she can remember. It's something to
do on a weekend in a town where, quite frankly, there's not a ton
to do. Plus, tapping into something more primal, she enjoys the
thrill of the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find things at yard sales that you can't find in stores,''
she said as she perused a downtown yard sale, where she ended up
buying two Armistead Maupin books for a friend. ``And stores are
overpriced. You get something at a yard sale and you have a story
to tell about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She even has an organized list of yard sale rules and
superstitions, which include:
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger and more elaborate the sign, the worse the yard
sale. If the sign has glitter on it or balloons attached, just stay
away entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the yard sale sign says `Nothing Stolen' on it, stay away.
It's all stolen, probably from me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Methodists have the best church yard sales. I have no idea why
this is. First runner-up: Mormons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an especially bad yard sale, people will remember
your house for years to come. Same if you have an especially good
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who go to yard sales a lot hold the best yard sales.
They know what reasonable prices are and they have a lot of crap to
get rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Biesecker has her own rules, too, the first of which is that if
you don't find something to buy within the first three sales you go
to, you might as well give up for the day.
</P>
<P>
   And Linda Mulleady, who calls her home decor Early American Yard
Sale, said her rule is not to get discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people don't like to go to yard sales because
they get discouraged,'' she explained. ``They think all they're
going to find is junk, and that's really not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU ARE WHAT YOU OWN
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who says yard sales aren't just as much about who we are
as what we own has obviously never been to one. Who we are _ at
least, who we are as people who go to yard sales _ is: people who
want bargains, people who like unique things, people who enjoy
history represented in tangible objects, people who like having
stuff, people with an insatiable, voyeuristic curiosity to see what
other people have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I don't think I like new things,'' said Vera Clay,
laughing, as she picked through a box of clean socks marked 25
cents each or five for a dollar. At an earlier yard sale she'd
bought a typewriter in a case for $5 and a fancy old velvet hat for
$1.
</P>
<P>
   She's been going to yard sales for years and years, looking for
unique items to decorate her home and indulge her weekend hippie
personality _ tools, clothes, anything that's just as good from a
yard sale as it is from the store, plus a savings of many dollars
in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   REASONS PEOPLE GO TO YARD SALES
</P>
<P>
   For bargains, obviously, because there are some things that just
hurt to buy new _ Rototillers or car jacks. There's no need to buy
them new when gently used is just as good. Many people find nice
children's clothes at yard sales, which helps the ol' budget
because kids grow so fast and their clothes can be so expensive.
Others find things they'd like to have but can't justify to their
spouse buying new. This explains why a canoe went so quickly at a
recent yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   The America that has yard sales is, for the most part, a blue
collar America that clips coupons, has a budget and likes to save
money on some things so more money can go toward other things, like
vacations or DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   For hobbies or collections. Biesecker collects, among other
things, cloth flour and feed sacks from the 1800s and early 1900s.
She even gives presentations about the historic value of flour and
feed sacks, so she's always on the lookout. Mulleady collects
cookie jars and makes stuffed animals, so she always looks for
fabric, buttons and other notions.
</P>
<P>
   For bragging rights. You'll notice that avid yard sale-goers
enjoy showing you around their homes, pointing to a certain item
and declaring, ``Guess how much I paid for that. Two dollars!''
Biesecker has found collectible figurines, pewterware, crockery,
linens and luggage. Clay found lighthouse prints, in honor of the
years she and her husband lived in Oregon, tools and clothes. Large
parts of Cole's library came from yard sales. Mulleady has added to
her teddy bear collection, her husband's railroad memorabilia, the
decor of both bathrooms and her yard with yard sale finds.
</P>
<P>
   Serious yard sale-goers like to bargain and barter. It's part of
the fun, the back and forth challenge that helps thaw the numbness
from just forking over whatever the marked price is in a store.
They also tend to be enterprising, refinishing furniture that was
in questionable condition when they bought it but that gleams like
new once they're finished. Rather than looking at a table of yard
sale items as one big mass of junk, they look at individual items
and think about the big picture _ the micro-macro yard sale
technique.
</P>
<P>
   To make money. Most consider yard sale profits to be found
money, a nice bonus for sitting in the garage all day and having
strangers parade through, looking at their stuff. Some people try
to get away with perpetual yard sales as their business, though
their are city ordinances prohibiting that, and there are people
whose yards just look like yard sales.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the professional yard sale-goers, antique store
owners who know exactly what they're looking for or people who
watch too much ``Antiques Roadshow'' and believe they're going to
find a Monet beneath the velvet Elvis or pickers consigned by
thrift store owners to just buy everything at the sale. Some might
say that gets into questionable moral territory buying a piece of
art worth $20,000 for $2 from the little old lady who doesn't know
what she's got and has to pare down her possessions because she's
moving into assisted living. Others question the practice of buying
something from a yard sale for $1, selling it to a thrift store
owner for $4, who sells it in the store for $8. There are
techniques the pros use, and they upset some people. But then a lot
of people say it's capitalism and the American way, and God bless
it, and caveat emptor.
</P>
<P>
   For something fun to do on a weekend. Because face it, people
have weird things sometimes and it's interesting to peruse through
it, even if you don't buy anything. Where else are you going to see
a string art guitar, a framed copy of ``Footprints in the Sand''
written in puff paint, a T-shirt that says ``Beam me up, Jesus''
and a Boy Scout tent, all piled on the same driveway? Plus, it's
just nice to get out on a summer day, indulge shopaholic impulses
without setting your credit card on fire, drive around and discover
your town, meet new people and see what's what.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a fun thing to do,'' Clay said. ``I really enjoy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And you never know when you might find the very thing you needed
or wanted, or didn't even know you needed or wanted but now that
you've seen it, you must have it.
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL YARD SALES
</P>
<P>
   These days, yard sales are going high tech and big business.
There are virtual yard sales on the Internet. (What is eBay, after
all, if not one big electronic yard sale?) There are books about
how to have successful yard sales, seminars on sale techniques.
Keep a cooler full of soda and sell it for 75 cents a can, they
say. Keep the dog away. Price everything and incorporate 25 cents
or five for a dollar techniques. Don't tell people what you paid
for an item new.
</P>
<P>
   It's all good advice, really, but it's just not the same as
going through yard sale listings in the newspaper, circling likely
prospects and getting up obscenely early the next morning to get
first pick at a yard sale. Often there are cars lined up on the
street as sleepy-eyed sellers trudge out of the house with piles of
things for sale. Many people, in their ads, post the times of the
sale to prevent that 6 a.m. tap-tap on the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the camaraderie of it. In small towns many of the
serious yard sale-goers know each other and greet one another like
old friends when yard sale season begins in March _ a high point
because of spring cleaning _ and as it continues through November.
The banana-belt Western Slope is a prime place for yard sales.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, on a July Friday, Biesecker stopped at a home on
Orchard Avenue, walked up the driveway to inspect a bag of maroon
wool yarn and, probably knowing the owner wouldn't take less than a
dollar because it's wool but what the heck, that's part of the fun,
asked, ``Take 50 cents?''

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM A SHORTENED CAREER, A LIFETIME OF COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c .2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Julia called to say goodbye, sounding rushed. She
was planning her funeral, the music, the clothes she wanted to be
laid out in, the makeup. She asked Andrea Jaeger to send a
photograph of her hand prints in a cement block set along a walkway
at the Silver Lining Ranch here.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger was stunned. ``Julia was 14,'' she said last week, two
months after Julia died of cancer. ``When I was 14, my biggest
decisions were about what to order from room service in five-star
hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-age tennis star, Jaeger had her own problems. In
Prairie View, Ill., outside Chicago, classmates pelted her with
cafeteria food and stuffed her in a locker. She was always off
playing tennis. She was different; she had no school friends. On
the circuit, the older pros made fun of her pigtails and braces,
especially after she beat them. She began dressing in the public
bathrooms. She had no tour friends.
</P>
<P>
   One lonely day, during a tournament in New Jersey, as she tells
it, she impulsively bought some toys and took them to children at
the Helen Hayes Hospital in West Haverstraw, N.Y., a rehabilitation
center.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, at 35, Jaeger is rarely quiet, but now she
is hyper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me feel like Santa Claus, I went to give them
something and I ended up with the gift,'' she said with skimpy
punctuation. ``There was this boy with stubs for hands who wanted
to play video games with me and a girl who danced with her IV pole
and a girl who asked me to rub her bald head. She was going through
chemo and I thought, `When I grow up I am going to spend my life
helping these kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger appears to have grown up. She has created, from a
teen-age notion, a program that has touched several thousand
children with advanced cancers over the past 11 years. But her
warm, energetic, sometimes howling offerings of life and laughter
in the rawness of pain and relapse and death seem to spring from
the optimism of the happy childhood she never had.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a former Swiss boxer, was her coach, never her dad,
she says, and although she reached No. 2 in the world and advanced
to the 1983 Wimbledon final (she lost to Martina Navratilova), her
career was over at 19.
</P>
<P>
   Seven surgeries could not repair her shoulder. She was not the
teen-burnout head case sometimes portrayed, but in retrospect she
wonders if the injuries were her body's way of taking her out of a
life that did not truly absorb her ``to a life that I loved and was
better at and can do forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the game, but the tennis life became surreal for me
after I met those kids,'' she said. ``Here I was, I could order
adults to put certain candies for me in the locker room _ they
would jump to do it _ and there they were, thinking about dying.
Puts having a bad day in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In her early 20s, she and a friend with tennis club business
experience, Heidi Bookout, founded Kids Stuff, now called the
Silver Lining Foundation, and began offering sick youngsters a
vacation week in an Aspen hotel. Once her $1.4 million savings from
prize money was gone, the shoestring operation was fueled by local
freebies and maxed-out credit cards. Jaeger and Bookout gave tennis
lessons in exchange for donations. Jaeger was a ticket agent at the
Aspen airport so she could buy the campers discounted fares.
</P>
<P>
   Two other women, Kate Anderson and Bookout's sister, Beene
Smyley, have also been there from the beginning, 11 years ago. The
first big donation, from John McEnroe, and his continued support,
gave Jaeger fund-raising credibility and opened the door to the
tennis establishment.
</P>
<P>
   For kids who can travel, there is now a week at Wimbledon; last
year, on a rainy day, Andre Agassi invited a bunch over to his flat
for lunch. A group of New York kids too sick to travel will attend
the United States Open with Dr. Jim McKinnell, a pediatric
oncologist at the Brooklyn Hospital and Silver Lining's medical
director. Once pros with heart meet the kids, they become involved.
In the middle of a recent tournament, Pete Sampras pulled off a
highway into cellular range to call a boy in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   But the soul of the program is here at the 10-acre ranch in the
palm of a green valley surrounded by the pricey Aspen mountains.
Completed last summer on land donated by the local Benedict family
was the 18,000-square-foot, $6 million lodge with its medical
suite, stage, single bowling alley and eight bedrooms, each
decorated in a phantasmagoric motif _ starry night, Hollywood,
rainforest, San Diego Padres _ as different as possible from the
white walls of a hospital. The principal benefactor was the
financier Ted Forstmann, who donated $1.7 million early.
</P>
<P>
   While Jaeger spends much of her time fund-raising (the program
costs $2.3 million a year) with the shameless ferocity of an old
moonballer rushing the net, she is also the wise and silly head
counselor. Twenty youngsters, usually between 9 and 17, come for a
week at a time, typically from two or three hospitals around the
country. Each group is usually accompanied by a nurse. The campers
have been chosen because they are well enough at the moment for the
adventure, but their prognoses are poor. Of the 12 Chicago
youngsters in Jaeger's first session 11 years ago, only one is
still alive; but she is a mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows if you have tomorrow,'' Jaeger said, ``whether
you have cancer or not. I want them to have life while they're
alive, to be in a place where nobody isolates them because they are
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Life at the ranch includes horseback riding, swimming, tennis
(``Did Andrea play pro once?'' a kid asks), whitewater rafting,
fishing at Kevin Costner's nearby spread (the movie star patiently
poses with each camper) and skiing in winter. The talent show is as
hilariously awful as any camp's, even though some of the
chorus-line wigs are on bald heads, and some of the high-kickers
wear seven-pound braces.
</P>
<P>
   There are rituals. At story time, Jaeger gently leads them to
talk about the friends who turned away because they thought cancer
was contagious, the doctors who didn't listen, the guilt they feel
for what their parents are going through, and the freedom they feel
in a safe haven where everyone shares the dreads. After the gondola
ride up Aspen Mountain, Jaeger crows ``good job, good job'' as
throwing up, leukemia, dad not visiting in the hospital,
chemotherapy, spinal taps and losing hair are named and cast into
the gorge, a stone at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The sendoff at the airport is wrenching; despite the promise of
newsletters, phone calls, holiday gifts, home visits, counselor
jobs, family retreats, even college scholarships _ Jaeger's
decision to keep the groups small makes a lifelong follow-up
program possible _ all know that there are faces here who will live
on only in the videos of their time together. At the gate, Jaeger
reminds them of her 800 number. Call anytime, she shouts, if you
have a relapse or just want to talk. Many do.
</P>
<P>
   Cherish called to say hello, sounding rushed. She was planning
her wedding, and wondered if she could spend part of her honeymoon
at Silver Lining. She said she wanted her husband to see what had
saved her for him, what had kept her going seven years ago when she
needed to know she was not alone.

BOOK SAYS NIXON TOOK MOOD-ALTERING DRUG AS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Nixon medicated himself with a
mood-altering prescription drug in the White House and, depressed
by hostile public reaction to the bombing of Cambodia in 1970, he
consulted a New York psychotherapist who considered him
``neurotic,'' according to a biography to be published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, concern about Nixon's mental state in 1974 led the
secretary of defense, James R. Schlesinger, to order all military
units not to react to orders from ``the White House'' unless they
were cleared with him or the secretary of state, writes Anthony
Summers in ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard
Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger confirmed the account in an interview Friday, and
said the book's description of events was the most complete and
most accurate account of his actions, which had been reported in
more general terms earlier. The book quotes him as saying, ``I am
proud of my role in protecting the integrity of the chain of
command. You could say it was synonymous with protecting the
Constitution.'' He confirmed Friday that that was how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   The book reports that the prescription drug, Dilantin, was given
to Nixon in 1968 by Jack Dreyfus, the founder of the Dreyfus Fund
and an enthusiastic promoter and user of the drug, after Dreyfus
had dinner with Nixon and friends in Florida. Confirming the
account, Dreyfus said in an interview last week that the drug is
effective in dealing with ``fear, worry, guilt, panic, anger and
related emotions, irritability, rage, mood, depression, violent
behavior, hyperglycemia, alcohol, anorexia, bulimia and binge
eating, cardiac arrhythmia, muscular disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus said in the interview that he gave Nixon a bottle of
one-thousand, 100 milligram capsules, ``when his mood wasn't too
good.'' He said Nixon scoffed when he said they should be
prescribed by a doctor, and he later gave the president another
1,000 capsules. In the book, Dreyfus says Nixon told him: ``To heck
with the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of the psychopharmacology
clinic at Cornell medical school, said in an interview Thursday
that Dilantin was properly used to prevent convulsions, but has
been discredited for psychiatric use. He said it could be used to
prevent anxiety, but other drugs were better. He said Dilantin has
``potentially very serious side effect risks, like change of mental
status, person becoming confused, loss of memory, irritability,
definitely could have an effect on cognitive function.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's pre-presidency treatments by Dr. Arnold A. Hutschnecker
have been reported. But the White House and Nixon allies
steadfastly denied that Nixon was treated once he became president.
Robbyn Swan, Summers' wife and collaborator, said in a telephone
interview that she had interviewed Hutschnecker in 1995 and 1997,
and that he had indicated that while he had seen Nixon rarely while
he was president, they maintained contact, apparently by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from their home near Waterford, Ireland, she played a
tape recording of part of an interview with Hutschnecker, in which
he said of Nixon: ``He didn't have a serious psychiatric diagnosis.
He wasn't psychotic. He had no pathology, but he had a good portion
of neurotic symptoms: anxiety'' and sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   Hutschnecker, who is 102 and living in Sherman, Conn., declined
to be interviewed Friday. Juan Gonzales, who was caring for
Hutschnecker, said the doctor would not give any more interviews
and ``could hardly speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Swan said that when she last saw the doctor a few months ago, he
was in a wheelchair and did not speak, although he agreed to be
photographed for a television documentary by the History Channel
and the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arrogance of Power,'' which Viking will publish and is
planning to sell for $29.95, is generally hostile in its treatment
of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It restates, with much new detail, the accusation that Nixon's
1968 presidential campaign sought to persuade President Nguyen Van
Thieu of South Vietnam not to agree to President Lyndon Johnson's
pleas for South Vietnam to join peace talks in Paris with the
United States, North Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Summers, an Irish journalist, cites a document
the FBI released to him, a transcript of a wiretap recording of
South Vietnam's ambassador to Washington, Bui Diem. It reported
that ``Mrs. Anna Chennault contacted Vietnamese ambassador, Bui
Diem, and advised that she had received a message from her boss
(not further identified), which her boss wanted her to give
personally to the ambassador. She said that message was that the
ambassador is to `hold on, we are gonna win' and that her boss also
said `hold on, he understands all of it.' She repeated that this is
the only message `he said please tell your boss to hold on.' She
advised that her boss had just called from New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Nov. 2, 1968, Spiro T. Agnew, the vice-presidential
candidate, was in Albuquerque, N.M. Summers, citing declassified
White House documents, suggests that Agnew himself telephoned
Chennault, a well-connected Washington hostess and the widow of
Claire Lee Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers in China. He
concludes ``Nixon's running mate acted for no one but Nixon.'' He
also reports that Chennault told the ambassador's secretary after
the election that she had talked to Nixon about her role.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most provocative charge in the book is that Nixon beat his
wife, Pat. Here the author relies on second-hand accounts. He
writes of various journalists being told of beatings. His most
specific account comes from John P. Sears, an aide to Nixon in the
1968 campaign and early in his administration, describing an event
that may have happened just after Nixon's 1962 defeat for governor
of California.
</P>
<P>
   The book quotes Sears as saying a Nixon family lawyer, Waller
Taylor, ``told me that Nixon had hit her in 1962 and that she
threatened to leave him over it. ... I'm not talking about a smack.
... He blackened her eye. ... I had heard about that from Pat
Hillings as well as from the family lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears, a retired lawyer in Washington, confirmed Friday that he
had told Summers about Taylor and Hillings. Taylor and Hillings, a
longtime Nixon associate, are both dead.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Nixon Eisenhower, advised of the accusation, asked John
Taylor, director of the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., to
respond on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``It cannot possibly be true. It is utterly
inconceivable. Anyone who knows and worked with President Nixon
knows first of all that he could not have done it, second of all
that he would not have done it, and third of all that had he done
it, there are innumerable people who would not have spoken to him
and yet remained active in his life and in Mrs. Nixon's life until
their deaths and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``Mrs. Eisenhower this afternoon confirmed that
she and Tricia and her mother were at home watching television and
that later that day Mrs. Nixon came home and they spent the evening
together.'' And he said that Waller Taylor was not the Nixon family
lawyer but ``happened to occupy the same law firm office as former
Vice President Nixon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shaw said Hutschnecker told her he felt comfortable describing
his consultations with Nixon because he had once told the president
he wanted to write about it, and Nixon had replied, ``only when I
am 6 feet under.'' Nixon died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon left the White House after resigning in 1974, a
letter from Hutschnecker was found in his desk. The letter, sent at
the height of the Watergate disclosures on July 3, 1973, said,
``Once doubts have been planted in the minds of people, neither
legal, political or PR-defense regardless of how well presented,
can fully wipe out all the doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times, the
doctor wrote ``both a clinical as well as a psychoanalytically
oriented physician should take part in the policy-making of our
federal or local governments.'' He said they would be able to
``raise their voice when human ambition and greed or drives for an
uninhibited use of power seem to be getting out of control.''

HOME-GROWN DRUG BUSINESS BOOMS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ As Canada's health department
looks this fall for a reliable supplier of almost 1 million
marijuana cigarettes for clinical trials, some Canadians say they
need to look no further than ``British Columbia,'' where relaxed
attitudes about smoking marijuana have helped turn the province
into a major North American producer for some of the drug's
strongest strains.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexicans can grow bales of the stuff on plantations, cold
weather Canadians have genetically tweaked their indoor plants to
reach potencies of 10 times the levels of the Woodstock-era grass,
putting it on a par with prized Jamaican weed.
</P>
<P>
   Now marijuana is estimated to be a $1 billion-a-year export
here, right behind lumber and tourism as the leading business in
British Columbia. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police estimate that
there are about 9,000 ``grow operations'' in the Vancouver area.
Across the bay from here, in the city of Nanaimo, the Mounties
estimate that there are 1,000 residential grow operations, about
one every two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my neighborhood, it's one house in 10,'' said Chris, a
40-year-old grower. ``I walk around late at night, after work, and
I can smell it, from the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, marijuana turns up in the oddest places. In May, a
newspaper here reported that a man had been caught growing plants
in a garage of a house he rented from the attorney general of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, two Canadian men wearing military uniforms were
arrested in Blaine, Wash., after crossing the border in two
Canadian military trucks: The U.S. Customs Service said one truck
was loaded with five duffel bags, containing 240 pounds of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of marijuana growing stems from many factors.
</P>
<P>
   Judges, mirroring local public opinion, tend to give lenient
punishments. An arrest for growing 500 plants, the average size of
a bust here, often yields an $800 fine _ compared with a short
prison sentence in California or a life sentence in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid my partner's fine, $500, with money from the business,
it's a business,'' said Buck, an engaging 30-year-old in a polo
shirt. He said he talked his way out of any charges when a
policeman his age discovered his grow operation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the local newspaper, The Vancouver Sun, found that of
112 people convicted here of growing marijuana in the late 1990s,
one quarter served no jail time and paid no fines, and that 58
percent paid fines of less than $1,800. Fewer than one in seven
served any jail time.
</P>
<P>
   With prices for ``B.C. Bud'' double on the American side of the
border, marijuana is indeed lucrative in a province with some of
North America's highest tax rates, stagnant economic growth, and
high unemployment among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver also offers the technical support a serious grower
needs. With cultivators here approaching their indoor marijuana
farming with the solemnity of Japanese bonsai gardeners, the number
of stores specializing in hydroponic gardening equipment mushroomed
in Vancouver during the 1990s, from three to 30. Growing plants
without soil, in a mix of rock pellets and nutrient-rich water,
requires an array of electric gadgets _ from 1,000-watt lamps to
cooling systems to special systems that neutralize telltale odors
before ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   At one store, Jon's Plant Factory, the offerings do not seem
geared to growing hydroponic tomatoes. In the electronic section,
there is a $1,400 sophisticated pager, sort of an electronic plant
sitter that can alert the long distance gardener of system failures
_ water pumps, air fans, fertilizer drips _ even if an intruder has
opened a window or a door.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to complex growing systems, Chris, an experienced
electrician and plumber, said during a store tour: ``Some people
will sell their feeding schedules for $6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper technical support comes from Marc Emery, Canada's
leading cannabis capitalist. Emery offers 350 varieties of
marijuana seeds through his Web site and publishes Cannabis
Culture, a magazine of gardening tips. Earlier this year, he
started two Internet media productions, Pot Radio and Pot-TV
Internetwork, a 24-hour online broadcast of marijuana news.
</P>
<P>
   For marijuana broadcasters like Emery, the news from Canada this
summer has been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   In separate rulings in late July, Ontario Court of Appeal judges
ruled against employee drug testing and invalidated Canada's law
against marijuana possession. In the latter case, Judge Marc
Rosenberg suspended his ruling for a year to give Parliament time
to rewrite the law. His ruling, however, immediately granted Terry
Parker, a 44-year-old Toronto man, the right to smoke marijuana to
help control his epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   With Parliament scheduled to return in September, Canada's two
national newspapers, The Globe and Mail and The National Post, have
editorialized in favor of decriminalizing marijuana for medical
uses. Anne McLellan, Canada's justice minister and a member of
Parliament for the governing Liberal Party, has said such
decriminalization ``is a legitimate question.''
</P>
<P>
   On that subject, Canadians, as usual, are cautiously looking at
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outright legalization would cause serious trouble with the
United States,'' The Globe and Mail editorialized after the Ontario
decision. Calling for decriminalization, a path favored by the
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the newspaper concluded:
``Therefore, Canada should follow its historical nature and take a
middle path.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey here in May for The Vancouver Sun, 56 percent of the
people agreed that provincial courts should ``ignore the Americans
and hand out sentences we think are appropriate.'' A virtually
identical percentage said that possession of marijuana should not
be a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   With 61 seriously-ill people authorized by Health Canada to
smoke marijuana for medicinal purposes, the government plans to
start clinical trials of marijuana next year.
</P>
<P>
   When smugglers are cornered at the border, the smart ones sprint
north. Even so, the border is lightly patrolled and few people are
caught, compared with the intensely watched U.S. border with
Mexico. In the federal fiscal year ending last September, the U.S.
Customs Service agents seized 50 times as much marijuana coming in
from Mexico, 988,310 pounds, as they seized coming in from Canada,
19,753 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans hope that if Canada decriminalizes marijuana
possession it would show the United States a different path.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some hope on our part that Canada and other foreign
countries can provide models to the U.S. for alternatives,'' said
Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center, a New
York-based drug policy center that provided much of the funding for
the lawsuit this summer that overturned Canada's possession law.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Vancouver police have raided marijuana growing
operations at twice the rate of last year. But they are careful to
publicize their raids as efforts to break up vicious Asian gangs,
to protect children from fires in houses with faulty wiring, or to
break up smuggling rings where hockey bags stuffed with marijuana
are traded for guns and hard drugs from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have houses burning down, we have explosions, we have
organized crime in our neighborhoods,'' said Sgt. Chuck Doucette,
the Mountie spokesman here. Noting that anonymous tips about grow
houses have flooded his office this year, he added: ``We cannot
keep up with the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, decriminalization for casual use seems to be a reality
here in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, hundreds of people gathered for a marijuana
``smoke-in'' on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery, five blocks
from the British Columbia premier's office. Vancouver police
ignored the event.

SHUT-OUT NIGERIANS TALK OF LEADERS WITH SCORN 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ Among those standing outside the gates of the
hotel where the world's most powerful man had just checked in,
anger simmered beneath the hope his visit inspired. President
Clinton, soon after his plane had touched down here in the capital
of Africa's most populous nation, had been brought to the Nicon
Hilton and would soon visit President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Nigerian authorities' efforts to clear people from
the street outside the hotel's main entrance, a crowd of perhaps a
hundred had built up _ out-of-state visitors, displaced street
hawkers, the jobless, all ordinary Nigerians struggling to be
heard. Even under normal circumstances, few of them would have made
it through the gates of the Nicon Hilton, Nigeria's most
prestigious hotel, whose rate for a single night would equal many
Nigerians' annual earnings.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton's visit had turned the hotel into a
fortress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go inside _ in my own fatherland!'' said Prince
Inyang, a jobless 31-year-old. ``There are Nigerians inside who are
having a bash and enjoying themselves. But other Nigerians are
suffering. If you see all the Nigerians standing here, you see
suffering written on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   On a continent seldom visited by American presidents, in a
country where the last visit by a sitting American president, Jimmy
Carter, is considered a historic event, the hope was that Clinton
would erase all their suffering. The anger was directed at
Nigeria's leaders, who the people believed were trying to prevent
Clinton from witnessing their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Okoi Bassey, 25, who sells newspapers in street traffic, said he
was one of the many peddlers the authorities had tried to chase
away from the area in recent days. The police had confiscated about
$70 worth of his newspapers, he said angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians are the criminals,'' he said. ``We are the
ones working with our sweat under the sun all day. We are
suffering. Let President Clinton see me.''
</P>
<P>
   As in most poor corners of the world, there is an exaggerated
belief here of what an American president can accomplish. And
perhaps the expectations were higher with Clinton, who is widely
loved in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians interviewed said they hoped his visit would help
rebuild the country's educational system, rein in the military for
good and create business opportunities. Asked what she expected
from Clinton's visit, Fatima Sule said simply: ``He will uphold our
young democracy and not let it die. We have been suffering for so
long under military regimes. We don't ever want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the wishes, though, one theme united most of them:
Nigeria's leaders had ruined the potential of a country that is one
of the world's top oil producers and Clinton would point them in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my body is full of joy to see President Clinton come to
this Nigeria,'' said Benjamin Akpa, 41, a tailor. ``I want
President Clinton to put order in our government. We have had three
Senate presidents in one year because they were corrupt. I want
President Clinton to tell our legislators that they must be serious
about democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Uzoechi, 44, wanted to warn Clinton not to trust
Nigeria's leaders. ``Nigeria's name is a bad one in the world,'' he
said. ``Is it poor people like me who have made it bad? No, it's
the people who don't sweat and who steal by signing with their
pens. And so he should be careful about canceling our debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ema Ayikoye, 23, echoed the sentiment about debt cancellation.
Since coming to office 15 months ago, Obasanjo has made forgiveness
of Nigeria's $30 billion debt one of his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is debt cancellation going to help the poor people?''
Ayikoye asked. ``Will we see any benefit from it? Or will it simply
benefit the people who have already stolen our money?''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Odenigbo, 45, had another suggestion: ``President
Clinton should tell all the big men in Nigeria to bring 1.1 million
naira each,'' he said, mentioning a figure of about $11,000. ``We
can take that money and open a small-scale industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon, police officers came over to clear the
crowd in front of the Nicon Hilton's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a disgrace!'' one man from the crowd shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it,'' said Adamu Ibrahim, 30. ``We are the poor.
They don't want us to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police could only push the crowd a few feet away. A
black limousine in a motorcade came out of the entrance, carrying
Clinton to his meeting with Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He waved at us!'' said Sule Alhaji, 54, a man in the crowd.
``He was happy to see us!''

U.N. REPORT: EMBARGO AGAINST AFGHANISTAN HURTING PEOPLE, NOT
TALIBAN RULERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As some Security Council members, led by Russia
and the United States, move toward increasing sanctions on the
militant Islamic government of Afghanistan, a report by the relief
coordinator from the United Nations says that the economic embargo
is having ``a tangible negative effect'' on the country and on
efforts to help the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in mid-August by relief officials trying to assist a
population still shattered by more than 20 years of civil war, a
severe drought and the frequently self-defeating economic
strictures of the Taliban, the strict Islamic movement that seized
power four years ago, found that sanctions imposed in 1999 are
stifling what little international trade the country had.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo, which has grounded international traffic by the
national airline, Ariana, is further isolating Afghans and making
it more difficult for the outside world to deal with their leaders,
the report found. The survey was issued last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The findings add to a debate in the Security Council about the
unintended consequences of embargoes, which often hurt the most
vulnerable people, as in Iraq. The council has ordered a study on
the effects of sanctions and the use of the open-ended economic
embargo as a policy tool.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions were imposed on the Taliban government largely at the
behest of the United States, which is demanding that the Saudi-born
financier Osama bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan and has been
accused of financing international terrorism, be turned over for
trial. The Clinton administration says he is linked to bombings of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, which fears the spread of Islamic militancy on its
southern borders, and Iran, which supports a faction of the armed
opposition, are also calling for harsher measures against the
country. An embargo on arms sales is being discussed. Both sides in
the lingering civil war are being armed by outsiders, American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and Afghans agree that an arms embargo will have
widespread support among the Afghan population, which has seen arms
flow in from Pakistan, Iran, Central Asia and Russia, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the relief office for Afghanistan said that the
economic sanctions had fallen hardest on Ariana, a small airline
that operated monthly cargo flights to Dubai and India. Afghans
exported fresh fruits and imported medicine, medical equipment and
electronic goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of the air link to India has brought to an end the
import of medicines that were valued for their low cost and good
quality,'' the report said. Staff members at a leading medical
center in the capital Kabul, the Indira Gandhi Hospital, told the
United Nations that half the medicine and medical supplies used in
the city's hospitals had come from India.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of export earnings for Afghan fruits has forced growers
to sell on the low-priced domestic market. ``This has resulted in a
loss of income and employment in harvesting, packing and
distribution tasks,'' the report said. Air mail into and out of the
landlocked country has all but ended.
</P>
<P>
   Ariana has had to stop paying overtime and has apparently cut
back on aircraft maintenance. The International Assistance Mission,
a private organization working in Afghanistan, told the United
Nations that a technical consultant questioned the safety of the
airline's domestic fleet of old Soviet-era planes. Afghanistan,
without a railway network and good roads, relies on its airline.
</P>
<P>
   In human terms, the report said, ``A significant impact of
sanctions is the extent to which ordinary Afghans feel isolated and
victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   As in other countries under U.N. economic sanctions, the
government takes the opportunity to hold the embargo responsible
for all sorts of problems, the United Nations said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban has become increasingly defensive; its
representatives abroad this week again raised the question of why
they were denied Afghanistan's U.N. seat when other governments
that took power in civil wars were usually treated differently. At
the United Nations, Afghanistan is still represented by an ousted
government whose top officials all live in exile after being driven
out of the capital in 1996.

   WASHINGTON _ Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic
Party, said his world had transformed last week. ``Now, my phone
calls are getting returned that weren't getting returned,'' he
said. ``When everything goes right, everything goes right.''
</P>

   By contrast, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, said it
was sobering to see polls showing for the first time that Gov.
George W. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore in his state _ a
battleground _ had evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody believed or should have believed that
somehow the early numbers were reasonable,'' Engler said. ``They
were too big.''
</P>
<P>
   In barely a week, Republicans and Democrats have switched places
in a striking reversal. After looming over the race for months as
the man to beat, Bush suddenly seemed not so invincible. And after
months of reinvention, after months of reassuring restive
Democrats, Gore was, if not on top, certainly on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The shift was prompted largely by opinion surveys showing that
Gore had pulled even with Bush after the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   But where the contenders stand today is much less important than
where they will stand after Labor Day, when voters begin to take
closer notice of the campaign. In every presidential contest since
and including 1984, the candidate with a clear lead in the polls by
Labor Day has won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to sound the alarm at this point,'' said Richard
N. Bond, a former chairman of the Republican Party. ``Most
Republicans feel this will be a race that's in the margin of error
by Labor Day. If it's not, you've got to see where you lost and
where Gore gained. And if it's among independents and women, that
would be a cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to hold off on the alarm is the Electoral
College. The Republicans' strength in the South and near West gives
Bush a firm foundation of electoral votes. Whatever the polls say
about the popular vote, most strategists agree that Gore's chances
of breaking open a wide Electoral College lead, especially this
soon, are not realistic. The campaigns are battling fiercely in
important regions, particularly the Midwest, for the 270 electoral
votes needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew contended that the Gore bounce would not be fleeting.
``What you do see is a true momentum change here,'' he said. ``Al
Gore is now defined not just as his own man, but as a man who
stands up for the issues that you care about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew acknowledged that no one could be sure that the gains
would be sustained. ``I don't think anybody can tell you they know
anything for certain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns do not want to take chances. To shore up the polls
by Labor Day, they are planning a barrage of new television
commercials and campaign events; in Bush's case, to get back on the
offensive, and in Gore's, to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this battle royal more than two months
before votes are cast is that perceptions _ of who is ahead and who
is not _ are consequential in presidential politics. If a candidate
is widely viewed as a winner, that can affect everything from fund
raising to news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush campaign officials said they had fully expected
Gore to climb up in the polls after the Democratic convention. But
they conceded that they were not prepared for the overwhelmingly
positive news coverage he has drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Such coverage complicates things for Bush. Many of his
weaknesses did not appear as weakness when he was ahead in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   But last week he found himself on the defensive for behavior
that is nothing new in his campaign. News accounts noted his
flubbed speech lines and raised questions about his willingness to
debate, his plan for a huge tax cut and his party's efforts to run
harsh attack advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush official in Austin, Texas, said that while he had
expected the recent lift for the Gore campaign, he had been
startled by the effusive coverage of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something of a surprise,'' the official said,
``it's been how quickly as a whole the media has pivoted from a
week ago saying it's a cakewalk for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush adviser summed up the campaign's position: ``You'd always
rather be 20 points ahead, but nothing has happened in the past six
weeks or so that hasn't been anticipated by the Bush people. They
almost got Gore's bounce right to the number, internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the Gore campaign has essentially driven the
media coverage of the campaign for two weeks, from the favorable
publicity when Gore picked Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his
running mate and on through the Democratic convention _ and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Now that things are looking up, some Gore operatives portray
their position as a vindication of their political skills and the
campaign framework they laid out months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, if Bush does not recover, Republicans may begin
to question whether his loyal cadre of top advisers in Texas is
really up to running a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Already, prominent Republicans are finding themselves defending
Bush's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the boys from Texas up to it?'' asked Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky. ``This is the most exceptionally run campaign I've
ever seen, including Bush '88 and Clinton '92. They're up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the Bush campaign's potency, it is the same
organization whose top officials fully expected the governor to win
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's losing presidential campaign four
years ago, said he had been struck by excessive confidence within
his own party at its convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans left Philadelphia with plans to pick out
the drapes for their new offices as opposed to running their
get-out-the-vote campaign,'' Reed said. ``There were very few
substantive meetings in Philadelphia. They were more poll updates
and rah-rah sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   So for last week, at least, it was the Democrats who were
gleefully examining the latest polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting that this is a done deal,'' said Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del. ``But the only thing that worries me is
somehow, all of a sudden, Al Gore gets kicked in the teeth and it
shakes his confidence. I don't know what that would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Biden offered suggestions of two off-limits areas that the
Gore campaign never likes to be reminded of: ``Campaign finance and
the Buddhist temple.''

SOMALIS WATCH U.S. ELECTION AND SEE A FAMILIAR FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia _ Somalis who speak little English will still
giggle and say: ``Read my lips.'' Despite mixed feelings about
Americans here, there is strong affection for the father _ as a man
who tried to make peace in Somalia _ that has rubbed off on the son
this American election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are following it,'' said Shuayb Abdi Karim, 30. ``And we
support Bush.'' Or ``Bush Junior,'' as George W. Bush is sometimes
called here.
</P>
<P>
   Karim was standing in a spot that caused much pain for Somalis
and Americans alike. An American Black Hawk helicopter was shot
down there in October 1993, igniting an all-night battle in which
18 Americans and perhaps 500 Somalis died. Karim said his brother,
who was 18, was killed by a stray bullet.
</P>
<P>
   That battle marked the beginning of the end for America's
military involvement in Somalia, and in all of Africa for that
matter, under the Clinton administration. So the logic behind the
fervor for George W. Bush here is that he might have a personal
stake in reversing that, since his father sent American troops here
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans win, I think the Somali problem is over,''
said Abdi Sheikdon Negeye, 40, once one of Somalia's most popular
radio personalities. ``All Somalis believe that. We lost Somalia
when the Democrats came in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not have good memories of Somalia (just as there
are many Somalis who feel American soldiers went too far in trying
to create peace here). And Bush has given no sign of any plan for
re-engaging in one of the most troubled corners of the world if he
wins the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not tamped down hope here. That hope is fueled
partly by the memories of the money that flowed into Somalia during
the U.N. operations here and softened the economic blow after the
government of the dictator Muhammad Siad Barre _ and all central
authority _ fell in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Also, peace talks going on now in the neighboring country of
Djibouti have created some optimism about the return of government.
Many Somalis say it would not take much money _ donated perhaps by
the United States _ to give any new government an early dose of
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for those reasons, some Somalis are following American
politics and this election very closely. Negeye, at a wedding in a
well-guarded hotel in Mogadishu, was talking about how he views
Republicans as far better on foreign policy than the Democrats. One
Somali said he liked Bush because Gen. Colin Powell is also a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   At one of Mogadishu's beautiful beaches, Abdulahi Ahmed Koronto,
42, said he sees Bush as having stolen Bill Clinton's old game
plan, positioning the Republicans to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is a man who has taken policy from the
Democrats,'' said Koronto, a programs officer for a foreign aid
agency in better days who is now unemployed. ``He looks very
compassionate. His father was not compassionate like him. He's very
flexible, no?''
</P>
<P>
   And in a society where family counts above all, many Somalis say
they feel they know the candidate from his father, starting from
the familiar voice and face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks very much like his father,'' said Muhammad Hassan
Guled, 56, a former port manager who was holding the wedding for
his son. ``And his father left him a big reputation. Now the world
is expecting much from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has support from Somalia's most famous son, Hussein
Aidid. His father, Gen. Muhammad Farah Aidid, was one of
Mogadishu's most notorious warlords until his death in a street
battle in 1996. The elder Aidid was, in fact, the man whom the
American soldiers were trying to capture in October 1993, when the
Black Hawk was downed.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Aidid, 38, who lived for 17 years in the United
States and fought as a United States Marine in the Persian Gulf
War, returned to Somalia to take over his father's faction. He was
a registered Republican in California _ who voted both for Bush and
for Clinton in various races, he said _ and he had some advice for
the younger Bush: ``You can't be in his shoes. You have to have
your own ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice seemed heartfelt: Aidid has had much trouble of his
own stepping out of the shadow of his father.

 &HT;    Ads blitz winnable one-third
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The contours of the presidential campaign came into
sharper focus this past week on television screens in 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the haze of late summer, with many Americans on
vacation, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
began putting serious campaign money into television advertising,
an estimated $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their disagreements, the candidates seemed to agree
that the election may well be decided by what happens in these 17
states, or at least in most of them.
</P>
<P>
   The initial round of advertising is especially significant if
you think of the presidential race as not one, but 51 separate
elections. In this match, the winner is the first to 270 electoral
votes, garnered by knitting together some combination of the 50
states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out the national popularity polls, and forget for the
moment about two-thirds of the states. Those elections already are
decided _ at least in the minds of the strategists on both sides.
You will not see Gore spending much money in Texas, Bush's home
turf. Neither will Bush pour much money or effort into reliably
Democratic Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Once the winnowing is done, between 15 and 20 states remain that
both sides believe they can win. It is in those states and, mainly,
on the airwaves, that the remainder of the 2000 presidential
campaign will likely play out.
</P>
<P>
   The overlapping ads are running in: Arkansas, Delaware, Florida,
Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New
Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington, Wisconsin and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee will join in this week with
ads in nine of those states, spending at least another $5 million a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is advertising in Georgia, New Hampshire, North
Carolina and Nevada. Gore, in an interview last week, hastened to
point out that he isn't writing off Georgia, despite not
advertising there at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia's in the group of targeted states,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't read anything into that. Georgia is a very highly targeted
area. It's targeted for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts and consultants said it is indeed
possible to glean the campaign's strategy from its purchase of air
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the state-by-state polling shows that
those are the states that really are close,'' said Rich Galen, a
former Republican official who publishes an electronic political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the states are traditionally hard fought. Ohio, with 21
electoral votes, picked the winner in all but two presidential
elections in the 20th century. It stands out as a bellwether among
bellwether states, said Eric Rademacher, who directs the Ohio Poll
at the University of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led Gore 47 percent to 41 percent in a July poll taken
before both political conventions, Rademacher said.
</P>
<P>
   But other states have been strongly Democratic in recent
elections, suggesting that Gore has not completely solidified his
standing among traditionally Democratic voters even after recent
polls that show him doing better among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia has voted for Republican presidential candidates
just three times in the past 65 years. But both campaigns are
advertising there this year after a pre-convention poll showed Bush
with a lead over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a choice of either viewing it as a sign that things
are really bad or that this is a state that can be moved back into
the Democratic column,'' said Mike Plante, a Democratic consultant
who is working for West Virginiagubernatorial candidate Robert
Wise.
</P>
<P>
   Plante said he preferred the latter assessment, noting that the
state's older electorate should make it ``fertile ground'' for
Gore's proposal to have Medicare provide a prescription drug
benefit. ``If you're looking at where we do change the scenario and
where do we change it quickly, West Virginia is right there,''
Plante said. ``A little bit of care and feeding now amounts to
moving this state solidly back into the Democratic column.''
</P>
<P>
   The same notion may be driving Bush's advertising in
traditionally Republican southwestern Ohio. Advertising on
Cincinnati television also reaches into northern Kentucky and
eastern Indiana, which tend to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting a close race in Ohio, Rademacher said, ``I don't
think it's necessarily that bad an idea to get that base as
energized as you can...These ads are saying, 'Hey, we can't go to
sleep at the wheel here.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Galen said the emphasis on West Virginia, as well as other
states that have been Democratic bastions in recent elections,
including Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin, shows that the
advantage remains with Bush, notwithstanding Gore's gain in polls
taken after the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is taking his campaign to Democratic strongholds, while
Gore, for the most part, is not mounting a strong effort in
traditionally Republican areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the reason senior Democrats have been so nervous for
so long,'' Galen said. ``They have been unable to lock down the
states they wanted to have locked down. Because Bush has his base
in line, he doesn't have to go back to places like South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   One state where Republicans might have expected to coast to
victory is Florida, where Bush's brother, Jeb, is the governor. But
Gore has been helped by the choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman
(D-Conn.) as his running mate, especially among South Florida's
large Jewish population. And Bush and Gore not only are advertising
there, but both campaigned in the state last week.
</P>
<P>
   The one state conspicuous by its absence, particularly on Bush's
list, is California, with its 54 electoral votes. After pledging
that he would not write off California, as his father did in 1992,
Bush has so far not advertised in the nation's largest state.
</P>
<P>
   A new Field Poll shows him trailing Gore, 50 percent to 37
percent, in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Sullivan, a Bush spokesman, said the state's size makes
it too expensive to sustain an advertising campaign between now and
the election. By some estimates, statewide advertising in
California costs $1.5 million a week, meaning a candidate would
have to spend $15 million _ out of a total of $67 million _ to be
on the air from now until Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge and it has many media markets; we're not able to
start this early,'' Sullivan said. ``But Governor Bush has been to
California 15 times, we did a post-convention train trip there''
and vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney campaigned in the state
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has set its advertising campaign in concrete.
Indeed, aides to both Bush and Gore cautioned that this round of
advertising is merely an ``initial buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling will have a large say in where the money is spent.
Targets will shift. States that appear competitive today may look
won or lost a month from now. Other states will unexpectedly come
into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the early stages of a heavyweight boxing match,''
Galen said. ``Which way is he going to move when you throw the
left? What happens when you hit him with a second jab?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ For Pramoedya Ananta Toer, forgiveness is
cowardice. Principle is absolute. The only way to deal with the
crimes of the past is to look them in the face, seize the culprits
and punish them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've experienced it all,'' Pramoedya, the nation's most
prominent writer and one of its moral touchstones, said in a recent
interview. ``I've been beaten, hit, tortured, humiliated. There
cannot be forgiveness. I cannot reconcile with bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya spent 11 years as a political prisoner during the
harsh rule of President Suharto, which ended more than two years
ago. Pramoedya's books were banned and his archives and library
destroyed. Now, he said, the time for an accounting has come. ``I
hold to the principle that all criminals of every kind must be put
on trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Suharto is gone and speech is free, society is
filled with a clamor of voices, and Pramoedya's is just one of
them. While his anger has added fuel to a national debate over the
abuses perpetrated during Indonesia's three decades of
authoritarian rule, the question his critics raise is just how much
strength and energy does this unsteady nation have to reopen old
wounds and reignite old enmities?
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia struggles to rebuild itself, the debate over the
role of the past has been overshadowed by the urgent issues of the
moment _ the continuing political power of Suharto's army, the rise
of separatist movements, the rebuilding of political institutions,
the crisis of the economy, the threat of social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues, his critics say, that Pramoedya is not taking
into account.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike South Africa when apartheid ended, Indonesia made no
clean break with its past. There was no winning side in its
struggle with history. Many of the abusers from the past are still
powerful and many of the abuses continue today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, some penalties will have to be imposed, but how far these
penalties go and who will suffer them is an issue we still have to
debate,'' said Smita Notosusanto, a leading democratic advocate.
``That's the difficult part. If we go along totally with Pramoedya,
we will have to sacrifice too much of our future in order to settle
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of judicial investigations have been opened, notably
involving military abuses in East Timor last year and against a
separatist movement in Aceh. But they are moving slowly, hampered
by politics and the continuing power of the chief culprit,
Indonesia's army.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Parliament passed a constitutional amendment
enshrining the principles of human rights but absolving any past
abusers from prosecution. That protection, quietly inserted at the
apparent insistence of the military, has drawn loud public
criticism. It remains unclear how much effect it will have on any
prosecutions under criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, historians and researchers have begun learning
the truth about past abuses, largely hidden in Suharto's time.
These began with the massacres of hundreds of thousands of
suspected Communists in the mid-1960s as Suharto came to power. The
abuses continued as he used the military to suppress opponents and
maintain order throughout this broad and constantly feuding nation.
</P>
<P>
   With historical research only beginning, a number of government
and private groups are exploring models like the truth commissions
in South Africa and the trials in South Korea where two former
presidents were convicted of abuses and then pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge is more complicated in Indonesia, said
Jonathan Simon, an American scholar who is helping develop
democratic institutions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be in a very strong and secure political position
before you begin doing this kind of thing,'' he said. ``In South
Africa you had a liberation movement that overthrew a previous
regime and started fresh from a new point. What you have here in
Indonesia is a mixture of the old and new governments, a mixture of
reform and nonreform forces. It is not us and them the way it was
in South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermawan Sulistyo, director of the Research Institute for
Democracy and Peace, a private policy group, has been researching
the massacres of 1965 and 1966 and sees a danger in confronting
people with past traumas.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in Bali, which was devastated during those
massacres, a private group has begun exploring local killings and
confronting people with their own history. This action has served
only to open fresh wounds and revive past traumas, without bringing
any resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you open things up, what you get is only political
revenge and political vendetta behind what seems like a legal
process,'' he said. ``The problem in Indonesia now is that many of
the incidents, many of the abuses, are opened up with more
political baggage than legal baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, Indonesia is not yet ready for
reconciliation. ``How can you reconcile with abusers when you still
have the old machinery in power?''
</P>
<P>
   As historians and researchers work to learn the truth about the
abuses that were hidden in Suharto's time, Pramoedya's principal
critic in the debate is Goenawan Mohamad, a writer who is one of
Indonesia's leading journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pramoedya looks at forgiving as eliminating the crime or the
guilt,'' he said. ``To me, forgiving is acknowledgment of the
guilt, and acknowledgment is important if you want to be humble to
deal with the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Pramoedya, he said the most important thing now is to open
a window into the past and to learn from it, but he said
compromises must be made for the sake of national stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a public discussion, a debate, a
consciousness-raising session to acknowledge that Indonesians are
capable of committing such atrocities,'' Goenawan said. ``And from
that basis we can hope to avoid this kind of thing the next time
around.''

   Most recently, the Hawks' only All-Star has been linked to the
Knicks. The argument is that New York will need a center if Patrick
Ewing is traded to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, there are a lot of teams don't have a center.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last count, there were may be five true centers in the
entire league,'' Hawks president Stan Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
   When trade talks include Mutombo, general manager Pete Babcock
has said he would only deal his big man for one who can make the
Hawks. But because the list starts with Shaquille O'Neal and ends
with Alonzo Mourning, trading Mutombo has become an impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we can't confine ourselves so specifically,''
Kasten said. ``We should more correctly say we wouldn't trade
Dikembe unless we can improve our team. I think that's a more
accurate assessment of Pete's feelings and mine and our coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complexity of recent proposed trades, Babcock
said, the Hawks have been included in a number of conversations.
``But we haven't found anything that we were interested in doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo led the league in rebounding (14.1) and ranked second in
field-goal percentage (.562) and shots blocked (3.3). He would be
difficult to replace.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Haws are a dangerously young team that desperately
needs a strong offensive weapon. The lure of a big-time scorer
could prove irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mutombo is entering the final year of his five-year
agreement at $14.422 million. The Hawks could extend Mutombo at a
maximum rate of 12.5 percent or $16.224 million next season, but it
isn't likely. that isn't likely with annual raises of more than
$1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we gave Dikembe a maximum deal, that wouldn't help us at
all,'' Kasten said. ``It would kill us (in the salary cap).''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo, of course, isn't likely to find a $16 million cap hole
anywhere next summer, either, so he will take less from the Hawks
or go somewhere in a sign-and-trade. The advantage is with Atlanta
as the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had ongoing talks with (agent) David Falk,'' Kasten
said. ``We spoke a few days ago. Pete and David have talked about
an extension, but I don't know if it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, who had designs on Mutombo in 1996, would like to
take another run at him. Dallas is interested. So is Phoenix to
name three clubs.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mutombo himself, he says whatever is on his mind in a
given day.
</P>
<P>
   He remains angry about the Steve Smith-for-J.R. Rider deal and a
few weeks ago told friends he wants to be traded to Portland,
saying that Blazers free-spending owner Paul Allen will find a way
to pay him.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo says that he enjoys Atlanta, he does not want to leave
and he is very interested in being part of this remodeled club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait and see what they do,'' Mutombo said
recently, ``and then do what's best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   KRUGER HARD AT WORK
</P>
<P>
   Kasten calls Lon Kruger ``the hardest-working coach I've ever
seen, and he doesn't go around telling you how hard he's working.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few days, Kruger flew to Toledo, Ohio, to spend the day
with his incumbent leading scorer, Jim Jackson. Kruger set up an
appointment with Mutombo, and the two had lunch Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can already tell you about every player in the
league,'' Kasten said. ``Imagine how much work that entails in the
short time he's been an NBA coach.'' It has been less than three
months.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONNEL CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have named Wally Blase as the club's new head athletic
trainer and Tom Smith as assistant trainer and equipment manager.
Blase, 30, comes to the Hawks from the Chicago Bulls, where he
spent the last four seasons as the team's assistant athletic
trainer. He replaces Chris Tucker, who recently accepted a similar
position with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Smith, 35, joins the Hawks
after spending the last six years as the head athletic trainer at
St. Paul Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota. He will assist Blase in
tending to the athletic training needs of the players, in addition
to taking care of the teams' uniforms and equipment and hotel and
travel arrangements.

LOOSER RULES ARE CONSIDERED FOR BACTERIA IN STUDENTS' BEEF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Mich., Texas)  By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials say they are discussing the
possibility of loosening their new standards for preventing
salmonella contamination in ground beef used for the nation's
school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   The reconsideration, which was provoked by criticism from the
food industry, angered consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, the department, which provides 70 percent of the
ground beef used in schools, has required that every batch it buys
be free of salmonella. Before that there were no standards for any
pathogens, including salmonella, bacteria responsible for about 600
deaths and 1.4 million illnesses last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meat processors complained that the standards were unnecessary,
because proper cooking kills the bacteria, and were too difficult
to meet. At first many declined to even bid on government contracts
for the school lunch program. But the industry ended up with a glut
of beef and over the last few weeks more companies have offered
their meat for sale. Still, the department has been able to buy
only half the ground beef it needs for the schools, and at about 55
cents a pound more.
</P>
<P>
   School officials in Wisconsin and Illinois said they would buy
ground beef on the open market to ensure a steady supply, and New
York City officials said they would do the same but reduce the
amount they used.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the industry criticism, department officials began to
reconsider the salmonella rules.
</P>
<P>
   When asked last week whether the department was scaling back the
standards, Kathleen Merrigan, administrator of the department's
Agricultural Marketing Service, said, ``I would prefer to say we
are fine-tuning them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Merrigan nor anyone else at the department would say
what the new standards might be.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups accused the department of caving in to industry.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Tucker Foreman, a former Agriculture Department official
and now director of the Food Policy Institute of the Consumer
Federation of America, said the department was falling back on its
more traditional role of promoting the interests of the food
industry and neglecting its duty to protect consumers. That duty is
one that Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has accepted with
greater vigor than most of his predecessors. ``What we are saying
is they should change their priorities,'' Foreman said. ``They are
saying to buy meat with no salmonella costs us more money and it's
not worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its first obligation is to assure safe food for children who
eat school lunches,'' Foreman said of the department.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American School Food Service Association said
its members, who are in charge of school feeding programs, are
caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully committed to all steps appropriate to ensuring
safety of food for kids,'' Barry Sackin, the association's director
of government affairs, said of the salmonella rules. ``Our only
concern is the precipitous way it has been implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   The department adopted the new specifications after a federal
judge rebuffed its efforts to implement random tests for salmonella
at a Texas meat-processing plant. The department wanted to close
the plant, which had supplied as much as 45 percent of the ground
beef used in the school lunch program, after it failed tests for
salmonella three times. But the judge said the department did not
have the authority to use such tests, which the department has
implemented nationwide, and ordered that the plant remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman canceled the department's contract with the company,
Supreme Beef, and adopted the new standards for its ground beef
purchases. Since the regulations went into effect, salmonella
contamination has dropped by as much as 50 percent, studies show.

BOOK SAYS NIXON TOOK MOOD-ALTERING DRUG AS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs 1st graf of optional trim to fix Shaw to Swan.) 
By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Nixon medicated himself with a
mood-altering prescription drug in the White House and, depressed
by hostile public reaction to the bombing of Cambodia in 1970, he
consulted a New York psychotherapist who considered him
``neurotic,'' according to a biography to be published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, concern about Nixon's mental state in 1974 led the
secretary of defense, James R. Schlesinger, to order all military
units not to react to orders from ``the White House'' unless they
were cleared with him or the secretary of state, writes Anthony
Summers in ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard
Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger confirmed the account in an interview Friday, and
said the book's description of events was the most complete and
most accurate account of his actions, which had been reported in
more general terms earlier. The book quotes him as saying, ``I am
proud of my role in protecting the integrity of the chain of
command. You could say it was synonymous with protecting the
Constitution.'' He confirmed Friday that that was how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   The book reports that the prescription drug, Dilantin, was given
to Nixon in 1968 by Jack Dreyfus, the founder of the Dreyfus Fund
and an enthusiastic promoter and user of the drug, after Dreyfus
had dinner with Nixon and friends in Florida. Confirming the
account, Dreyfus said in an interview last week that the drug is
effective in dealing with ``fear, worry, guilt, panic, anger and
related emotions, irritability, rage, mood, depression, violent
behavior, hyperglycemia, alcohol, anorexia, bulimia and binge
eating, cardiac arrhythmia, muscular disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus said in the interview that he gave Nixon a bottle of
one-thousand, 100 milligram capsules, ``when his mood wasn't too
good.'' He said Nixon scoffed when he said they should be
prescribed by a doctor, and he later gave the president another
1,000 capsules. In the book, Dreyfus says Nixon told him: ``To heck
with the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of the psychopharmacology
clinic at Cornell medical school, said in an interview Thursday
that Dilantin was properly used to prevent convulsions, but has
been discredited for psychiatric use. He said it could be used to
prevent anxiety, but other drugs were better. He said Dilantin has
``potentially very serious side effect risks, like change of mental
status, person becoming confused, loss of memory, irritability,
definitely could have an effect on cognitive function.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's pre-presidency treatments by Dr. Arnold A. Hutschnecker
have been reported. But the White House and Nixon allies
steadfastly denied that Nixon was treated once he became president.
Robbyn Swan, Summers' wife and collaborator, said in a telephone
interview that she had interviewed Hutschnecker in 1995 and 1997,
and that he had indicated that while he had seen Nixon rarely while
he was president, they maintained contact, apparently by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from their home near Waterford, Ireland, she played a
tape recording of part of an interview with Hutschnecker, in which
he said of Nixon: ``He didn't have a serious psychiatric diagnosis.
He wasn't psychotic. He had no pathology, but he had a good portion
of neurotic symptoms: anxiety'' and sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   Hutschnecker, who is 102 and living in Sherman, Conn., declined
to be interviewed Friday. Juan Gonzales, who was caring for
Hutschnecker, said the doctor would not give any more interviews
and ``could hardly speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Swan said that when she last saw the doctor a few months ago, he
was in a wheelchair and did not speak, although he agreed to be
photographed for a television documentary by the History Channel
and the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arrogance of Power,'' which Viking will publish and is
planning to sell for $29.95, is generally hostile in its treatment
of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It restates, with much new detail, the accusation that Nixon's
1968 presidential campaign sought to persuade President Nguyen Van
Thieu of South Vietnam not to agree to President Lyndon Johnson's
pleas for South Vietnam to join peace talks in Paris with the
United States, North Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Summers, an Irish journalist, cites a document
the FBI released to him, a transcript of a wiretap recording of
South Vietnam's ambassador to Washington, Bui Diem. It reported
that ``Mrs. Anna Chennault contacted Vietnamese ambassador, Bui
Diem, and advised that she had received a message from her boss
(not further identified), which her boss wanted her to give
personally to the ambassador. She said that message was that the
ambassador is to `hold on, we are gonna win' and that her boss also
said `hold on, he understands all of it.' She repeated that this is
the only message `he said please tell your boss to hold on.' She
advised that her boss had just called from New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Nov. 2, 1968, Spiro T. Agnew, the vice-presidential
candidate, was in Albuquerque, N.M. Summers, citing declassified
White House documents, suggests that Agnew himself telephoned
Chennault, a well-connected Washington hostess and the widow of
Claire Lee Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers in China. He
concludes ``Nixon's running mate acted for no one but Nixon.'' He
also reports that Chennault told the ambassador's secretary after
the election that she had talked to Nixon about her role.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most provocative charge in the book is that Nixon beat his
wife, Pat. Here the author relies on second-hand accounts. He
writes of various journalists being told of beatings. His most
specific account comes from John P. Sears, an aide to Nixon in the
1968 campaign and early in his administration, describing an event
that may have happened just after Nixon's 1962 defeat for governor
of California.
</P>
<P>
   The book quotes Sears as saying a Nixon family lawyer, Waller
Taylor, ``told me that Nixon had hit her in 1962 and that she
threatened to leave him over it. ... I'm not talking about a smack.
... He blackened her eye. ... I had heard about that from Pat
Hillings as well as from the family lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears, a retired lawyer in Washington, confirmed Friday that he
had told Summers about Taylor and Hillings. Taylor and Hillings, a
longtime Nixon associate, are both dead.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Nixon Eisenhower, advised of the accusation, asked John
Taylor, director of the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., to
respond on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``It cannot possibly be true. It is utterly
inconceivable. Anyone who knows and worked with President Nixon
knows first of all that he could not have done it, second of all
that he would not have done it, and third of all that had he done
it, there are innumerable people who would not have spoken to him
and yet remained active in his life and in Mrs. Nixon's life until
their deaths and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``Mrs. Eisenhower this afternoon confirmed that
she and Tricia and her mother were at home watching television and
that later that day Mrs. Nixon came home and they spent the evening
together.'' And he said that Waller Taylor was not the Nixon family
lawyer but ``happened to occupy the same law firm office as former
Vice President Nixon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Swan said Hutschnecker told her he felt comfortable describing
his consultations with Nixon because he had once told the president
he wanted to write about it, and Nixon had replied, ``only when I
am 6 feet under.'' Nixon died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon left the White House after resigning in 1974, a
letter from Hutschnecker was found in his desk. The letter, sent at
the height of the Watergate disclosures on July 3, 1973, said,
``Once doubts have been planted in the minds of people, neither
legal, political or PR-defense regardless of how well presented,
can fully wipe out all the doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times, the
doctor wrote ``both a clinical as well as a psychoanalytically
oriented physician should take part in the policy-making of our
federal or local governments.'' He said they would be able to
``raise their voice when human ambition and greed or drives for an
uninhibited use of power seem to be getting out of control.''

 &HT;    Jackets face long odds vs. Hokies
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ For the first time since October 11, 1998,
Georgia Tech will play in a game without a national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yellow Jackets take on 10th-ranked Virginia Tech
tonight, they have a chance to change that and jump into the Top 25
with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets enter the game as 16-point underdogs, mainly because
of Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who is the early-season
favorite in the Heisman Trophy race. Last season as a redshirt
freshman, Vick passed for 1,840 yards and 12 touchdowns, and rushed
for 585 yards and eight scores. He had 352 yards offense against
Florida State in the Hokies' 46-29 loss in the Sugar Bowl in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets embarrassed themselves on defense last year, giving
up 30.3 points and 413.8 yards per game. Tonight could become
another embarrassment for Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you go into your first game this early, you wonder do
you have enough coverage, can the young guys handle it,'' Jackets
coach George O'Leary said. ``It's magnified when you play a team
like Virginia Tech who has a magical quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to defending him is to make him throw from the
pocket,'' O'Leary said, ``because basically he's a running back
with the ball in his hands. Their offensive line has done a good
job of protecting him, plus establishing a line of scrimmage for
their power game. They are a power team and we've got to stop that
first.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary also faces opening with an inexperienced quarterback, in
George Godsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been happy with him, with everybody saying he can't do
it,'' he said. ``Sure he has limitations, but so do most of the
quarterbacks we've seen. He reads coverages and fronts well. The
team has gotten behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary says he hasn't changed anything on the offensive side of
the ball since 1999 Heisman runner-up quarterback Joe Hamilton
graduated after last season. ``George may not do them as well, but
he knows his limitations,'' he said. ``Maybe he'll take a bad play
and not turn it into a 20-yard gain, but he'll get 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech strong safety Chris Young says he's prepared to do
whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to show up on Michael Vick's highlight film on
ESPN,'' Young said.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Ten years after Syrian forces snuffed out
Lebanon's civil war, this battered country is entering a crucial
parliamentary election marked by a deepening economic crisis,
widespread public cynicism and startlingly open denunciations of
vote rigging and Syrian domination.
</P>
<P>
   Rafik Hariri, the swashbuckling multibillionaire builder who had
raised hopes that the glittering Beirut of old could be reborn, is
running hard in a free-spending campaign to become prime minister
once again.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days the government of President Emile
Lahoud has declared an all-out war on Hariri, with hours of special
programming on state-run television accusing him of everything from
corruption in mosque building to agreeing to resettle Palestinian
refugees _ a particular sore point here _ to being fat. One
television spot showed two hapless fisherman floating near a raft
bearing Hariri's ubiquitous campaign poster and shouting, ``Look _
a whale.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1998, Hariri, backed by Syria, tried to rebuild
Beirut almost single-handedly, throwing up highways, a new airport,
a showy sports stadium and a breathtaking restoration of the
downtown _ a shelled-out no man's land in the war _ with banks and
cafes springing up among its old churches, mosques, Roman ruins,
and Ottoman, French colonial and Levantine stone buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A greengrocer's son who went to Saudi Arabia and became a
builder for, and friends with, the royal family, Hariri was not of
the world of the traditional feudal clan leaders of Lebanon's
divided sectarian society. Indeed, he seemed a modern international
mogul out of James Bond, with his own airliner, television station,
newspaper and palace and a bulletproof limousine with a device that
cancels nearby cellphones to foil remote-control bombs.
</P>
<P>
   There were hopes that the Beirut of the '50s and '60s _ the
banking and intellectual center of the Middle East, the playground
for oil-rich Saudi and Persian Gulf Arabs _ would make a comeback.
Gleaming luxury hotels and apartment towers went up in a frenzy of
speculation, along with branches of Parisian fashion houses.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebanon is seeing its dreams of postwar revival slip away.
</P>
<P>
   The recent political developments that have altered the region _
Israel's withdrawal from the south, the death of Syria's longtime
ruler, Hafez Assad, and the tentative progress of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort _ have yet to translate into a
revival for Lebanon. Nor have they allowed it to slip out from
under Syria's yoke.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is probably the Middle Eastern country with the most
potential _ a varied natural beauty of mountain and seashore, an
educated, resourceful and industrious population, and a rich
history and culture _ Lebanon is an economic wreck. The government
has a current deficit of more than $22 billion _ 140 percent of
gross national product _ and it is growing. Debt service regularly
runs over 90 percent of revenues and last month topped 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a vast income discrepancy between the few gaudy rich
and the many poor, still living in makeshift slums, displaced by
years of war. The middle class is battered _ and departing.
</P>
<P>
   There was a burst of national pride in May when Israel withdrew
from the border zone it had occupied for more than 20 years. But
that is only bringing new problems of rebuilding a devastated area.
The government is widely distrusted as inept and corrupt, and the
elections are a reminder of just who is really in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Lebanese political figures regularly go _ or are
summoned _ to the Syrian capital, Damascus, for instructions, but
much of the day-to-day running of Lebanon falls under the direction
of Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, a Syrian military intelligence chief. In
this he is helped by Brig. Gen. Jamil Sayed, a Shiite Moslem who
exercises wide local power as the director of the Lebanese internal
security agency.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 35,000 Syrian troops are stationed in Lebanon, along
with an unknown number of intelligence operatives. But by now Syria
has so thoroughly placed its loyalists in the Lebanese system that
the Syrian military presence is not widely visible.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan and Sayed, the leading Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar
reported in June, are in charge of organizing the election and
selecting candidates who would be ultimately successful on the
basis of their support for Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screening the candidates to the general elections is also
aimed at securing a parliament that would be supportive of
President Emile Lahoud and that will help him rule smoothly,'' the
newspaper reported. ``The way the list of candidates is being set
up gives a prior outlook to the structure of the new Parliament,
which is expected to be pro-Syrian in its majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Hariri's ambitious projects ran up the enormous
national debt and were riddled with corruption. He is detested by
two of Syria's main delegates here: Lahoud, the former military
chief, and the powerful interior minister, Michel Murr, who owns a
burned-out downtown skyscraper, once a snipers nest, that did not
profit from Hariri's restoration.

   The real estate boom collapsed in 1997, leaving the country with
an estimated 370,000 empty, mostly expensive, apartments. Hundreds
of thousands of Lebanese, most of them young and educated, have
left the country in the last decade. In a place that flaunts its
devotion to appearance and ostentation, two telltale segments are
hurting: Hairdressers and expensive restaurants.

   Hariri left office when Lahoud became Syria's choice as
president in 1998. Now the free-spending tycoon is fielding a
ticket of 18 candidates for the 19 seats from Beirut and has formed
alliances with what are believed to be leading tickets in the Chouf
mountains, the north and the Bekaa region that could give him a
majority when the 128-member Parliament convenes in October.
</P>
<P>
   But his future is more likely to depend on Syria than the
voters. Presumably with this in mind, he traveled to Damascus soon
after 32-year-old Bashar Assad took office after the death of his
father in June. He went as part of a consortium of four major Saudi
investors ready to put as much as $400 million into real estate
development, luxury hotels and other projects there.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is now believed to be leaning toward Hariri as Lebanon's
only hope of avoiding fiscal collapse, but Lahoud's vociferous
objections are proving awkward. Kenaan and other Syrian operatives
have been scrambling behind the scenes to try to calm matters. By
week's end, the Syrian president was summoning the parliamentary
speaker, Nabih Berri, the army commander, Gen. Michel Suleiman,
Hariri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss to Damascus.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The election law is complex and itself controversial. There are
17 recognized religions and sects here, and the seats are
apportioned to make parliament half Christian and half Muslim. One
Beirut district is to be represented by one Maronite, one Roman
Catholic, one Greek Orthodox, one Protestant and two Sunnis.
</P>
<P>
   Leading candidates like Hariri assemble slates of supporters
fitting these categories. People do not vote where they live, but
in their family's home village, and they must make the trip ahead
of time to obtain a voting card from local officials. Voting in the
northern districts is to be this Sunday and in Beirut and southern
areas next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Scorn is being heaped on the elections from all quarters. On the
left, Walid Jumblatt, the hereditary Druse leader, speaks darkly of
``the excessive intervention of the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   On the right, Dory Chamoun, survivor of a once-powerful
Christian family, called for a boycott of the vote, saying,
``Lebanon is now a crippled state whose affairs are conducted by
Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Lebanese it is a depressing spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth voting,'' said Caline Chidiac, 26, an
optometrist who dutifully reads the daily newspapers. ``I don't
feel represented, I feel disgusted. We are the middle class that's
not going to exist. They're pushing all the good ones and the young
ones to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be an amazing country, but there's no democracy
here,'' she said, adding in reference to the campaign portraits of
candidates plastered all over the city: ``We just see these
pictures. It's a nightmare. It's just faces, faces, faces.''

CLINTON COURTS EGYPTIAN LEADER AS TIME EBBS FOR PEACE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After accusing Egypt of undermining the Camp David
summit meeting, the Clinton administration is now focusing on the
Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, as a key to finding a solution in
the Middle East, particularly on the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is due to see Mubarak in Cairo on Tuesday, and
will be working on ideas on the Jerusalem problem, as well as the
broader settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, a
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the Egyptians involved is key, and they want to be
involved,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The courting of the Egyptian leader as a central figure in the
peace effort comes as a last round of diplomacy unfolds before time
vanishes for a Middle East deal. The White House and the Israelis
view the end of September as effectively the last moment for
reconvening a Camp David-style summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of September, the precarious political position of
the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, could worsen, and the onset
of Jewish religious holidays, which run from late September into
much of October, will make negotiations more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disclaimers by the White House, negotiators say it will
be more difficult for Clinton to be the heavyweight mediator once
the American presidential campaign is in its final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House has said that Clinton would only
consider another summit meeting if the gaps between the parties
were small and there was little risk of failure. After meeting with
Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in New York in
September at the United Nations' Millennium Summit, Clinton expects
to have a better idea whether a new Mideast meeting would be
worthwhile, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived in Cairo Saturday to see Mubarak for a meeting in
which the administration hopes the Egyptian leader will lend Arafat
some cover for compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is one issue Arafat cannot act alone on,'' the
administration official said. ``And the Arab and Muslim countries
are very skittish.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Camp David meeting last month, Arafat stuck by his
position that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian
state. He rejected proposals for shared sovereignty between
Israelis and Palestinians over the most contentious site, Temple
Mount, known by Muslims as Haram al Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of negotiating over how to share sovereignty in East
Jerusalem is a high-wire act for Arab leaders _ especially Mubarak
_ who have long feared massive opposition to such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were not optimistic that a creative
solution on the Temple Mount issue, or over Jerusalem as a whole,
could be found. But they seemed relieved that ideas were being
exchanged between Israeli and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
   And the Israelis said they were pleased that the Clinton
administration had brought Egypt onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that Egypt is key in giving Arafat a feeling
that there is a milieu out there for an agreement,'' an Israeli
official said.
</P>
<P>
   After the senior Israeli negotiator, Shlomo Ben Ami, met with
the Egyptians in Alexandria, Egypt, on Thursday, the Egyptian
foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said that the idea of ``shared
sovereignty'' was a ``departure from international law and Egypt
cannot agree to that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Egypt ``is not negotiating with the Israelis over
the Palestinians, but trying to deal with the Israeli position and
bring it back to international law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moussa was quoted by Ben Ami as offering an idea of
``postponed sovereignty'' for the Temple Mount. The Israeli praised
the Egyptians for coming up with ``very interesting'' ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said it still remained the
preference of the White House to wrap up a deal that included all
elements of disagreement between Arabs and Israelis _ Jerusalem,
the fate of refugees, the borders of a new Palestinian state, and
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Camp David summit meeting broke down last
month, a close aide to Clinton attacked Mubarak for flying to see
the royal family of Saudi Arabia during the last days of the
meeting and sending signals that a compromise on Jerusalem by
Arafat would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House also appeared to recognize that it had not
done enough preparatory diplomacy with Arab leaders before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a general assessment that there was a technical
blunder by the administration in not properly consulting the
Egyptians before Camp David went sour,'' a senior Middle East
diplomat said.

 &HT;    S.C. Split: GOP differs by region
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Party preferences change over time.
Demographics shift, and politicians come and go. But century over
century, some features of a state's body politic persist and give
it a special personality.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the old political worry lines can be traced
in the difference between Upcountry and Lowcountry Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina in many ways has always reminded me of a bucket
of crabs. As one tries to climb out, the other pulls him back,''
said Robert Hitt, former managing editor of The State newspaper in
Columbia and now corporate spokesman for BMW in Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   No simple change of party label has erased this tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade or so of Sen. Strom Thurmond's switch to the
GOP, South Carolina became the jewel of the Republican's Southern
realignment, with the bulk of the state's white power structure
moving to the party. The Democrats have bounced back in recent
years with the 1998 election of Gov. Jim Hodges. Still it can be
said the Republicans have plowed as deeply into traditionally
Democratic ground here as anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Republicans across the state can be expected to show
up solidly for Gov. George W. Bush, but there were decided
differences in the state's Feb. 15 Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain did very well in the Lowcountry, where
he was well-received by military retirees and the region's more
libertarian-leaning, independent-minded natives.
</P>
<P>
   The Upcountry, with its mix of religious, social and business
conservatives, gave Bush a huge winning margin, at a time he was
reeling from his loss in the New Hampshire primary and taking heat
for his speech at Bob Jones University. The line of counties along
I-85, including Greenville and Spartanburg, may have been the most
crucial electorate in Bush's nomination fight this year.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, a similar division appeared in the race for
the state party chairmanship. Henry McMaster, who has sometimes
been a thorn in the side of former Gov. Carroll Campbell, faced a
stiff challenge from businessman Katon Dawson, who had support from
much the same coalition which won the primary for Bush. But
McMaster held off the challenge with a combination of votes from
the Lowcountry and his home base in the Columbia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference sometimes may seem only a matter of degree. Three
years after acknowledging he was gay, a Republican prosecutor in
Charleston County was defeated in a June party primary. But few
South Carolinians would doubt if a similar vote had been held in
Greenville County, the margin would have been vastly larger than
272 votes out of nearly 30,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   The same forces operate in both regions. Former state
transportation Commissioner Buck Limehouse blamed the Christian
Coalition when he was upset in a recent GOP primary by state Rep.
Henry Brown. But Brown also had valuable legislative backing, and
South Carolinians would make the point that even the Christian
conservatives of the Lowcountry differ in recognizable ways from
those in the Upcountry.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatism of the Upcountry Republicans is more sober,
thrifty and judgmental. That of their Lowcountry counterparts more
flamboyant and impassioned. Greenville Mayor Knox White noted
opposition to abortion is much deeper in his area than the
Lowcountry. But on the question of taking the Confederate flag down
from the state Capitol dome, the most outspoken opponents were from
the Lowcountry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real emotion and fervor on that issue is nonexistent up
here,'' White said. Greenville, he emphasized, ``is pre-eminently a
business town.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the traditional differences which have changed
little since all the politicians had Ds after their names, the
Lowcountry has also taken in a sizeable number of Republicans from
other parts of the country, whose views on issues such as abortion
and the environment run more toward midstream.
</P>
<P>
   While the conflicts are often only intramural, the difference in
perspectives the two regions embody could make for some interesting
politics in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   The two sections of the state have had their differences since
the days when traders began traveling the Cherokee Path from
Charleston to the Indian villages in the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Both have prospered over the past decade, in very different
ways. Greenville-Spartanburg has become a manufacturing and
business hub, blending BMW's German pride in workmanship with the
staunch fundamentalism represented by Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   The state's top industry is not German cars or French tires,
however, but tourism. From the classy venues of Charleston's
Spoleto Festival to the country music caverns of Myrtle Beach,
coastal South Carolina has managed to capture a vast portion of the
tourism demographic, and with it thousands of generally well-heeled
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   So the opposite sides of South Carolina's political personality
carry on a prosperous rivalry, often to the irritation of
less-favored areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it seems we have two sections of haves arguing with
each other while the rest of the state is made up of have-nots,''
said Chip Felkel, a business consultant and Republican activist who
grew up in Williamsburg County, the state's poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston appears to be booming as it never did when it was
struggling to hold on to its naval yard and striving to expand the
port's share of commercial shipping. Which leads to a conflict that
could ignite considerable Lowcountry-Upcountry friction.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, the South Carolina State Ports Authority
announced plans for what would ultimately be a 1,300-acre facility,
the Global Gateway, on Daniel Island, at the confluence of the
Wando and Cooper rivers near the old city. Charleston needs such a
massive development if it is to keep pace with Savannah, which just
this summer snatched two major shipping contracts from the port.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plans were announced, however, thousands of new
residents have poured into the area, largely on the strength of its
environmental attractions. A small bedroom community has even
sprung up on Daniel Island.
</P>
<P>
   The solidly Republican Charleston County Council has voted its
opposition to the project, and Republicans are solidly represented
in the anti-growth groups which are organizing to fight the project
with a bigger war chest than they have had in previous battles.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Republican in the Upcountry takes a contrary view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for the people of Charleston having basic veto power on
what the Ports Authority is going to do if it has an impact on the
way they're living . . . and I come to that position without even
drinking the water,'' said state Sen. David Thomas of Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   This is, nevertheless, a case where the interests of the two
regions collide directly. Forty percent of the goods that go
through the Port of Charleston come to the Greenville-Spartanburg
area, Hitt pointed out. The Upcountry business community's support
for the project is more quiet than the Lowcountry opposition, but
that is in the character of these disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Gateway controversy is still gathering. Just a few
weeks ago, a legislative study committee decided the project needed
still more investigation. But it seems likely in the coming decade
lawmakers will be forced to find a resolution. And in that 21st
century political battle, L and U may be as useful for designating
the competing sides as D and R.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BEST IS YET TO COME FOR SOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When one great figure in sports more or less sanctifies the
supposed heir apparent that immediately follows in his or her
sneakers or cleats, it has become known as passing the baton. But
what we hear is not always what is truly meant, deep down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Jack Nicklaus finished playing the first two
rounds of the Professional Golfers' Association tournament with
Tiger Woods, he paid Woods a gracious and lavish compliment. It
reminded this reporter of the line of praise bestowed by Bobby
Jones _ a golfing icon if ever there was one _ after Nicklaus had
won his third Masters, at 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young man,'' Jones said, ``you play a game that I am totally
unfamiliar with.'' A few years later, I had an opportunity to speak
with Jones _ the model of what was often considered a Southern
gentleman _ and asked him about that moment. ``Well,'' Jones said,
in his easy drawl, ``I laid on a compliment. You know how you do
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication was clear. Jones, then the only man to have won
the Grand Slam of Golf, in 1930, was not about to to give Nicklaus
a perch above him in the pitch-and-putt pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   If there has ever been a finer champion than Nicklaus, both on
or off the course, he doesn't come readily to mind, though Woods is
certainly a splendid candidate.
</P>
<P>
   What Nicklaus said, after having played with Woods last week,
was: ``What Tiger is doing right now, I think he is a better player
than I ever was.'' But ``right now'' is an interesting phrase.
Tiger, who has won five major titles at 24, is ahead of Nicklaus'
three major victories at a comparable age. But Nicklaus added 15
more majors in his career. Nicklaus might well have been saying,
``Let's not jump the gun. Let's just wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   And recall what the Golden Bear added about the advancement in
equipment: ``I'm not sure you can do that'' _ Woods' use of clubs _
``with the golf ball we used to play with because it had so much
spin on it. Today you can tailor a golf ball to your game more than
you could then.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes a champion is the feeling that when he goes to
compete, he can't lose. This feeling lasts for a long time, like
forever. Recall the conversation Muhammad Ali had with Joe Louis.
Ali said that he in his prime could have beaten Louis in his prime.
Louis said to him, ``You know I had a Bum-of-the-Month club.'' Ali
said, ``I know.'' And Louis said, ``You'da been one of the bums.''
</P>
<P>
   To many, the best all-around basketball player ever was Oscar
Robertson. Until Michael Jordan came along. To some, Robertson
remains the best. Several years ago I asked Robertson _ who
averaged nearly a triple-double for 10 straight years _ his
opinion. ``Jordan's a great player,'' Robertson said, ``but we had
fewer teams, and the talent wasn't as diluted. So I think Jordan
would have scored about 20 points a game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty a game?'' I said. ``But you scored 30 a game in that
era.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Robertson said with a shrug, ``I handled the ball more
than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon Runyon once described Red Grange, the spectacular running
back of the 1920s, this way: ``He is three or four men and a horse
rolled into one. He is Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth, Al Jolson, Paavo
Nurmi and Man o' War.'' Grange told me several years ago that
``Gale Sayers and O.J. Simpson are the greatest running backs I've
seen in football in the last 10 years.'' That took care of 10
years, and left the rest of the century _ which told me something
about Grange's competitiveness. ``And overall?'' I asked. ``They're
bigger today,'' Grange said, ``not better.''
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful Shirley Povich, who for more than half a century
wrote a sports column for The Washington Post, told me about the
time he took Walter Johnson, who was as famous for his modesty as
he was for being the fastest pitcher of his time, to a baseball
game to watch the new fireballing sensation Bob Feller.
</P>
<P>
   All around them, fans were whistling and exclaiming. Shirley
said that Walter seemed equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked a question which had long concerned me,'' Shirley
said. ``I turned to Walter and asked, `Is he as fast as you were,
Walter?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Stengel, too, was impressed with the modern player, but
not to the extent that they were better than the older guys.
Shortly before Stengel died, in 1975, I asked him to compare the
two greatest home-run hitters in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this fellow in Atlanta is amazin','' Casey said. ``He hits
the ball the best for a man his size. But I can't say he hits the
ball better than Ruth. Ruth could hit the ball so far nobody could
field it. And that's even with the medicinal improvements today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come along now with the aluminum cup and it improves
players who only used to wear a belt and it's better for catching
ground balls.''

IN CHICAGO, GIRLS GET A PUBLIC SCHOOL OF THEIR OWN  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Md.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kai Penn had always planned to be an actress, model
and singer, but the sixth-grader says her career aspirations will
probably change now that she is a student at the Young Women's
Leadership Charter School here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go on the Internet a lot,'' said Kai, 11, on her first day
at the South Side school. ``It was my dad's idea for me to go here.
It's pretty cool. Maybe I'll be a tech person now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kai, 74 other sixth-graders and 75 ninth-grade girls are the
first students to enroll in Chicago's first all-girls public
school, and one of the few public all-girls schools in the nation.
(Such schools have existed in Philadelphia and Baltimore with more
traditional curriculums for 150 years.) But perhaps more important,
it is one of even fewer girls schools, public or private, to focus
primarily on math, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the school, a sister to the Young Women's
Leadership Academy in Harlem, which opened in 1996, say it will
free the girls from what many find to be an intimidating presence
of boys in classes.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes at a time when many are questioning the value of an
all-girls educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by the American Association of University Women
showed no definitive proof that a single-sex educational
environment is more beneficial to girls than a coed environment.
The report found that while many girls prefer a single-sex
atmosphere, they may not excel academically when they are separated
from boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found these schools are not a cure-all,'' said Pamela
Haag, research director at the American Association of University
Women. ``The bottom line is that separating students by sex alone
is not going to be a solution. More than anything, there are just
basic characteristics that need to be in place for a school to be
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But directors of the charter school here, which they expect to
include grades 6 through 12 in the coming years, say the school
fulfills a particular need among inner-city girls, many of whom
would never consider careers in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a college prep curriculum because these girls are
going to college,'' said Jeanne Nowaczewski, one of a group of 20
professional Chicago women who championed the school after
recognizing the dearth of such programs for disadvantaged girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked for the right to take the poorest kids available and
educate them for $5,023 per kid, as opposed to a private school
that charges $11,000 tuition,'' said Nowaczewski, a lawyer who
serves the school's board. ``We did it because when we talked to
teachers, they said they wished they'd been able to catch those
students early.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 73 percent of the students here are African-American;
the majority of the students come from nearby communities on the
South Side. About 75 to 80 percent of the girls are poor enough to
qualify for the free lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   The school is purposefully located on the campus of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, which produces many computer-science
majors.
</P>
<P>
   The planned curriculum includes seven rigorous years of math,
science and computer courses, and courses are designed to make
girls attractive to colleges and future employers. In addition to
the heavy emphasis on science and technology, students spend
Wednesday afternoons volunteering in nursing homes. As they get
older, they are steered to internships with Chicago companies.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum is, by necessity, somewhat light on physical
education and the humanities; In fact, English and social studies
are lumped into one course. Students are selected by a lottery, and
there is already a waiting list for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Nambo, a sixth-grade science teacher who is herself a
product of an all-girls, Catholic education, said she had not seen
the benefits of the single-sex educational environment until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you set up the right atmosphere, girls will be more vocal.
With boys around, and their aggressive hormones, girls really start
to shy down,'' said Nambo.
</P>
<P>
   On this first day of class, one teacher emphasizes the
importance of asking questions, urging her students to ``always
leave the class asking `did I understand everything the teacher
said?' and if you don't, go ask her.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Haag said inner-city all girls schools probably have more
benefits than their suburban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, with groups that are disadvantaged, these schools seem to
function very well. Now, at least, we will have the opportunity to
study a single-sex schools that aren't exclusive, that don't cater
only to higher income students.''

BUDDHISTS ASK INDIA TO FREE TEEN-AGE RELIGIOUS LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representatives of a major Buddhist order have petitioned the
Indian government to grant asylum and freedom of movement to their
15-year-old leader, the Karmapa, who remains under virtual house
arrest at a monastery in northern India eight months after fleeing
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 of his followers from around the world, including a
contingent from the order's American headquarters in Woodstock,
N.Y., met in India last week to consider their next moves in a
campaign to have the immigration status of the Karmapa clarified by
India, which he entered illegally in January after a grueling
overland Himalayan trek from Tibet through Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa's followers are also demanding that he be allowed to
take charge of his school's primary monastery outside Tibet, at
Rumtek, in the Indian state of Sikkim.
</P>
<P>
   The young religious leader, Ugyen Trinley Dorje, is recognized
by Buddhists of the Kagyu school _ one of four main branches of
Tibetan Buddhism _ as their leading reincarnated lama, or teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Large communities of Kagyu Buddhists live in Europe, North
America and East Asia. Their headquarters in the United States is
the Karma Triyana Dharmachakra Center in upstate New York, a site
chosen by the young Karmapa's predecessor. The monastery, known as
KTD, is the largest Kagyu center outside the Himalayas. Monks and
lay residents at the center expect that the Karmapa will come to
Woodstock to stay for extended periods, once he is free to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once everything gets settled, he will definitely come to
KTD,'' said Thomas Schmidt, who directs the monastery's Tibetan
religious music programs. ``This is one of his residences, the most
important after Tsurphu and Rumtek.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has not replied to the request for asylum,
American Buddhist leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   India faces a complicated situation in dealing with the Karmapa.
His flight from the Tsurphu monastery, near the Tibetan capital,
Lhasa, was an embarrassment to the Chinese government, with which
India is attempting to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China's perceived enemy, the Dalai Lama, leader of
another Buddhist school but recognized universally as Tibetan
Buddhism's foremost figure and the leader of a Tibetan government
in exile, has joined in demanding the Karmapa's release, saying
that it was wrong to prevent him from taking up his religious
duties and the higher studies he has said he went to India to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Los Angeles in June, the Dalai Lama said
that the Karmapa would be an important symbol for new generations
of Buddhists. ``Buddhist spirituality needs to be carried on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa's followers have gained an unexpected ally in the
political leader of Sikkim, a former Buddhist kingdom annexed by
India in 1975 after it undermined and deposed Sikkim's last king,
Palden Thondup Namgyal, who was married to an American, Hope Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   In July of this year, a large delegation of senior Buddhist
monks from the state met with Chief Minister Pawan Chamling and
apparently persuaded him that public opinion was strongly on the
side of the young Karmapa, who is being challenged for control of
Rumtek by a rival lama.
</P>
<P>
   Chamling went to New Delhi recently to argue that the Sikkimese
wanted the Karmapa to be seated at Rumtek without delay. Chamling
met with Indian officials just before the Karmapa's followers began
their meeting at his monastery near the Dalai Lama's base at
Dharamsala on Aug. 19, which the Dalai Lama also attended.

STORM RAISED BY PLAN FOR A CALIFORNIA PRISON

<TEXT>
<P>
   DELANO, Calif. _ This aging farm town has yet to meet the New
Economy and is barely on speaking terms with the old one. It had
staked its hopes for recovery on the nearby North Kern State
Prison, but 10 years later, the prison has not lived up to its
promise of lowering the town's 26 percent unemployment rate or
boosting business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Delano lobbied hard and finally persuaded state officials
to build another maximum-security prison here, right across the
road from North Kern State.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony here on July 4, Gov. Gray Davis celebrated the
proposed $335 million prison as a win-win: An increase in prison
cells for a system the California Department of Corrections
describes as 195 percent over capacity and a tax-and-revenue boon
for Delano, known for its lettuce fields and as the birthplace of
the United Farm Workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the prison, which would be California's 24th new one since
the state began the biggest prison building boom in the nation's
history in 1980, may not be a done deal. The prospect of yet
another prison has galvanized groups across the state, including
prison moratorium advocates, liberal members of the state
Legislature and those opposed to the ``three strikes'' law.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of these groups has sued the state to stop the
prison, ostensibly on environmental grounds, but in fact to force
the state to re-examine its prison building plans and rethink its
strict policies limiting paroles. The groups contend that it would
be much more beneficial to the state and offenders if, instead of
incarceration, the authorities began pushing treatment for those
convicted of drug use and mentoring and job opportunities for young
people at risk of going astray.
</P>
<P>
   The question the coalition is forcing: Does California, with a
penal system larger than that of most countries, need a new prison?
</P>
<P>
   The debate reflects _ and will surely influence _ a larger one
nationwide over whether the country is building too many prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections and the California Correctional
Peace Officers Association say the planned 5,000-bed prison is
needed to help alleviate overcrowding in a system with roughly
161,500 prisoners in 33 prisons. Farming towns like Delano, where
about half the high school students go to college, celebrate new
prisons as job centers (though there is scant evidence that prisons
provide significant employment to local residents) and as the means
to a bigger tax base.
</P>
<P>
   But those suing to stop the prison say that the meager benefits
it would bring to Delano's ailing economy are no reason to build an
institution that is superfluous. They say it is the result of the
Department of Corrections overestimating projections of new inmates
and underusing parole and prison alternative programs. With the
state's crime rate dropping for eight straight years and the
prisoner population dropping for the first time in 23 years, the
critics say, there is no need for yet another state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are trying to wear the cloak of being tough on
crime to pander to the fears of voters,'' said John Vasconcellos, a
Democratic state senator, about why the Delano prison was approved.
``But voters have repeatedly voted down bonds to build new prisons.
They want public safety and leaders that have the insight and
leverage to enhance public safety, but not just by locking people
up and treating them badly and having them come out worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Terhune, the director of the Department of Corrections, says
that although the number of prisoners has been leveling off, the
population projections, based on California's growth, ``would
justify the need for another facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Terhune says that a dire need exists for maximum-security cells
for the most violent offenders. About 9,000 such inmates are now in
cells with less violent offenders, he said, in a mix that has
proved volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Don Novey, president of the correctional officers' union, said
that opponents of the prison had not factored in that the prison
system, which he said was short 2,000 guards, had been incredibly
overcrowded for 30 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Vasconcellos says the timing of the new Delano prison is
especially bad because of a voter initiative on the November
ballot, which is expected to be approved, that demands alternatives
to incarceration for nonviolent offenders charged with drug
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor blackmailed us into approving it in exchange for
other things,'' Vasconcellos said of the prison. ``The opening of
the second Delano prison would be contingent on the Department of
Corrections developing and filling 9,000 therapeutic drug treatment
beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis had asked for two new prisons, the one in Delano and a
smaller one in San Diego County; the Legislature approved only one.
</P>
<P>
   Prison moratorium groups say the correctional officers' union,
the most powerful union in the state and one of Davis' major
campaign contributors, is behind pushing the Delano prison through
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that as recently as December, the state canceled
plans to build four 500-bed privately run prisons because officials
like Terhune said that the beds were not needed. ``If the state
didn't need 2,000 new beds in December, why does it need 5,000 new
beds now?'' said Rose Braz, program director for the Critical
Resistance in Oakland, which challenges the proliferation of
prisons and is a main plaintiff in the suit against the Delano
prison
</P>
<P>
   In a projection of prisoner population, the Department of
Corrections overestimated what the population would be by Dec. 31,
1999, by 2,648, according to its figures.
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting the new prison say that regardless of the reason,
the figures prove that a new prison is counterintuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Etelson, of the National Lawyers Guild, another plaintiff
against the Delano prison, said that the suit seeks to get to the
root of the prison population explosion in California. ``What's
fundamentally wrong with the California prison system is that it's
too big,'' Etelson said. ``There are too many people who shouldn't
be in prison who are.''
</P>
<P>
   For towns that have staked their hopes of rebirth on the
construction of a prison and what it should bring _ for tax
purposes, all inmates are considered residents _ the philosophical
debate is about what a prison will do for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism is growing in these communities. One in three new
prisons built in the state since 1980 are in the Central Valley,
yet the unemployment rate in the valley remains at five times the
state average.
</P>
<P>
   And here in Delano, a city of 35,000 residents about 25 miles
from Bakersfield, the answer is decidedly mixed. Napoleon Madrid,
the mayor, says that the first prison was supposed to bring jobs
and did not. In 1990, the unemployment rate was the same as it is
now.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent to 9 percent of the jobs go to local residents,
the prison's opponents say. and those are the low-paying service
jobs. Of the 1,600 jobs projected for the new prison, Madrid said
that the Department of Corrections estimated that only 72 would go
to the citizens of Delano.

OREGON VOTE OUTCOME LIKE A CHINESE PUZZLE  
 SYSTEM CATCHES UP WITH TOM HAYDEN  
 A PRESIDENT'S PICTURE MAKES A FEW WAVES  
 AND LASTLY, A WORD OR TWO FROM THE MRS. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Calif, La., Fla.)   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oregon's 1st Congressional District, covering the state's
northwest corner and much of Portland, leans Democratic. But
Republicans don't automatically cede the seat. The incumbent, Rep.
David Wu, a moderate freshman Democrat and the lone
Chinese-American in the House, beat his Republican opponent in 1998
by only 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   So while it's an uphill battle this year for Wu's Republican
challenger, state Sen. Charles Starr of Hillsboro, a conservative,
it is too soon to call this race. Wu remains the favorite, with
more money and a better organization.
</P>
<P>
   But he has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his most enthusiastic and financially generous
supporters from 1998 have soured on him, especially some of the
Chinese-Americans and some of the export-conscious business leaders
whose backing was crucial to his win. Why?
</P>
<P>
   He voted against liberalizing trade relations with China, saying
its government abused human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, thousands of Chinese-Americans all over the country
rooted for Wu to become the third Chinese-American ever to serve in
Congress, seeing him as a perfect builder of bridges to China. They
gave him their time, their money and, if they were Oregonians,
their votes. Likewise, many business leaders in Oregon and around
the country rooted for Wu, figuring he would support liberalized
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said he told voters in 1998 that he opposed liberalized trade
and he noted that many Americans, including a great many
Chinese-Americans, agreed with him, then as now, especially those
who, like him, had ties to Taiwan. ``This is a matter of democratic
values,'' he recently told The Oregonian, the state's leading
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   His vote nevertheless surprised and soured many supporters. Some
now plan to vote Republican. Some refuse to send him money. Some
plan to stay home on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In another down-to-the-wire race, that combination could be
politically fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people feel he is not doing what they hoped he would,''
Edwin Chan, a Democrat who is president of the Consolidated Chinese
Benevolent Association in Portland, said a few days ago. ``Many
people are disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   System Catches Up With Tom Hayden
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hayden is at a new place in this life. And what a life _
radical organizer of Students for a Democratic Society, charter
member of the Chicago Seven, freedom rider, grunt in the War on
Poverty, opponent of the war in Vietnam, Jane Fonda's former
husband, unsuccessful candidate for governor of California, for
mayor of Los Angeles and for U.S. senator and, for the past 18
years, member in good standing (honest) of the august California
Legislature, most recently as a state senator from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The system _ term limits _ has finally caught up with him. Come
adjournment next week, he is out of there.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes, senator, once you've opted to be co-opted.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to go, anyway. Last Wednesday, his legislative
colleagues held a farewell ceremony for him _ a love-in, really _
that went on for two emotion-packed hours. It finally ended when he
confessed, tears rolling down his cheeks, that while legislators
should not ``meekly serve our time,'' he nevertheless had finally
learned, thanks to the kindly patience of colleagues, that, well,
``you just don't get your way by insisting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roll over, Abbie Hoffman, and tell Bill Kunstler the news.
</P>
<P>
   So what's next for Hayden, now 60 and newly a father?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the fire burns still.
</P>
<P>
   He was spotted marching with protesters in the streets of Los
Angeles during the Democratic National Convention, and friends say
he is mulling over whether to go after a seat on the Los Angeles
City Council.
</P>
<P>
   A President's Picture Makes a Few Waves
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a good political move to Ander Crenshaw, a
Republican running for the open seat in Florida's 4th Congressional
District, which covers Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sept. 5 party primary just a couple of weeks off,
Crenshaw, a former state senator, figured running a television
advertisement showing him standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ronald
Reagan might give him an edge over the other primary contender, Dan
Quiggle, a businessman. Crenshaw had been co-chairman of the Reagan
presidential campaigns in Florida in 1980 and 1984, so what better
way to play up his Republican bona fides than to be seen with the
most popular Republican of them all?
</P>
<P>
   A Quiggle supporter objected in a letter to the former
president's office in Los Angeles. Was the president choosing sides
in a party primary, generally a big political no-no?
</P>
<P>
   Back came a letter _ to Crenshaw, signed by Joanne Drake, chief
of staff in the office. It read:
</P>
<P>
   ``I must ask you to cease and desist the use of such photo
immediately. Photographs that have been taken with President Reagan
in his office or at various events throughout the years are
strictly meant for personal use and never for solicitation,
campaign or marketing purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw pulled the advertisement. But his campaign insisted it
was never meant to imply an endorsement, only to show that he'd
been a loyal Republican for years.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, Quiggle said. He, too, he noted, was well acquainted _
and well photographed _ with Reagan, having once been a White House
intern. But, he crowed, he ``respected the wishes of the Reagan
family'' and chose not to use his pictures in a campaign
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   And Lastly, a Word or Two From the Mrs.
</P>
<P>
   Louisianans may practice the quirkiest politics in the nation.
Among other things, candidates there are permitted to list their
nicknames on the ballot, no small concession in the South, where
often as not, the game is the name.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Milton Vicknair, an Ascension Parish councilman, runs as
Milton ``Needlenose'' Vicknair and Merlin Fleury, a sometime
candidate for state representative from New Orleans, runs as Merlin
``Piece of Meat'' Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   So can Joyce Glapion, who is running to fill the New Orleans
city council seat vacated when her husband, Roy, died, run as Joyce
``Mrs. Roy'' Glapion?
</P>
<P>
   Depends, ruled Assistant State Attorney General Andrew Benton.
</P>
<P>
   If she is using her husband's name to capitalize politically on
it, held Benton, the answer is no. But if her husband's name is
really her nickname, Benton said, then the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   So is Glapion really known to friends and neighbors as ``Mrs.
Roy?''
</P>
<P>
   Initially she told The New Orleans Times-Picayune that she
wanted to use ``Mrs. Roy'' to communicate to voters that she was
trying to carry on the work of her late husband. Then she said she
wanted to use it so that she would not be confused with another
Glapion on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Final answer?
</P>
<P>
   It's her real nickname, she said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called that for 40 years, practically all the
time,'' she insisted. ``I like it, find it a term of endearment.''
</P>
<P>
   Final note:
</P>
<P>
   There's an important precedent here. After Lindy Boggs of New
Orleans succeeded her husband, Hale, in the U.S. House of
Representatives following his death in a plane crash in 1972, she
sometimes ran as Lindy ``Mrs. Hale'' Boggs.

   Drug Policy Loophole Revealed in an Appeal
</P>
<P>
   The soap opera-like saga of the Miami Dolphin's J.J. Johnson,
who will most likely start at running back this season, finally
ended late last week.
</P>
<P>
   It did so with a cryptic statement from the National Football
League that said reports of his pending suspension for steroid use
were in error and that he faced no such penalty. The statement
actually left more questions than answers about what happened in
Johnson's puzzling situation that may be a landmark drug case for
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's situation again put under a microscope the larger
issue of steroid use in the NFL and illustrated how difficult a job
professional football has in catching players who use
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is clearly making an effort to catch cheaters. Masking
agents and the more recent phenomenon of players blaming positive
tests on dietary supplements sometimes thwart those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Dolphins official, it was indeed over-the-counter
muscle-building supplements that were at the center of the Johnson
case.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Johnson failed his steroid test last November.
Johnson appealed the suspension, saying the team gave him an
over-the-counter supplement that elevated his testosterone level,
and he said he should not be suspended since the team gave the
supplement to him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's version illustrated the problem with steroid testing
in relation to supplements since Johnson's explanation created a
large loophole in the league's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what happened, the Miami official said: After the
positive test, Johnson told the NFL that he received the supplement
from one of the team's trainers. The trainer, however, told the NFL
that he did not give Johnson the supplement that led to his
positive test. The trainer was giving the supplement, a legal one,
to many of the Dolphins players, and none of those players has
tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Miami official said, Johnson changed his story and
said he purchased the supplement over the counter. When the NFL
said that was not a valid excuse, Johnson then changed his story
for the final time, saying the positive test was because of the
muscle-building supplement creatine and because he had received it
from the trainer, it was the trainer's fault.
</P>
<P>
   This put the NFL in a difficult position. The league did not
necessarily believe Johnson, the Miami official maintained, but
could not disprove his story. Even though the NFL sends players and
trainers a list of banned over-the-counter substances, some of
those substances are not listed on the bottles of the products; so
it is conceivable that Johnson used an over-the-counter product
that contained an illegal substance and that substance was not
listed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a kicker tested positive for steroids and used a
similar supplement defense. He was not suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The league gave Johnson a similar break and did not suspend him
the mandatory four games for a positive steroid test.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson case was an important one for this reason: Aware
that Johnson's defense could reveal a loophole in its steroid
policy, the official said, the NFL needed to take immediate steps
to close it. Imagine if every player who tested positive for
steroids could simply blame it on supplements.
</P>
<P>
   So the league took action. First, the NFL has recently made it
clear to teams that blaming positive tests on supplements will no
longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about one month ago, according to several team executives,
the NFL, in a memo to all teams, warned that any trainer who
knowingly or unknowingly distributes a supplement that contained a
prohibited substance is subject to a fine, as is the team.
</P>
<P>
   Before the NFL made public his successful appeal, The Miami
Herald, CBS Sportsline, ESPN and a sideline reporter on ``Monday
Night Football'' all reported that Johnson was going to be
suspended for violating the league's steroid policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the NFL responded with a statement that said:
``Reports that J.J. Johnson of the Miami Dolphins will be suspended
for violating the league's policy on steroids are not true. We
cannot comment any further due to the confidentiality of the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguous statement did not exactly exonerate Johnson. It
did not say reports that he failed a steroid test were false. Was
Johnson fined? Was he warned that if he again tested positive _
supplement excuse or not _ he would be suspended? No one will say.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Johnson dodged a major blow to his season.
But as the NFL toughens its stance on steroids, any player who
tries to cheat in the future might not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Black Quarterbacks Popular
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in the NFL when black quarterbacks were
routinely discriminated against. Now, the league seems to be
embracing the black quarterback. In the 1999 draft, four black
quarterbacks _ Akili Smith, Donovan McNabb, Daunte Culpepper and
Shaun King _ were drafted in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick declares himself
eligible for the draft after this season, scouts say he would most
likely be the first player selected.
</P>
<P>
   Black quarterbacks are aware of the changing NFL culture and of
their place in professional football history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was coming into the league, believe it or not, there
were people still saying black quarterbacks weren't smart enough,''
McNabb said, ``or we were only good athletes, or we couldn't read
defenses. Now people recognize everything we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller Ruffles Owner's Hair
</P>
<P>
   Several team executives and one owner went out of their way this
week to bash ``Monday Night Football'' analyst Dennis Miller, who
they feel is taking too many cheap shots at NFL personnel during
the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to irk some in the league was Miller's reference to
an owner's supposed toupee and Miller's remarks questioning the
competency of an official.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before Miller began saying things
that would upset some league personnel, who can be extremely
thin-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he planned to complain to ABC Sports or the NFL,
the owner, who asked not to be identified, said: ``Not yet. But
it's only the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   General manager Carmen Policy of the Cleveland Browns met with
NFL officials last week about his role in possible salary-cap
violations when he was in the San Francisco 49ers' front office. In
an interview, Policy maintained he had done nothing wrong and
wanted to make clear he has no ill feelings toward the current 49er
ownership ... Philadelphia Eagles' running back Cecil Martin
blocked for the Giants' Ron Dayne when both played at Wisconsin.
Martin was told that in New York there was some worry about Dayne's
at times sluggish preseason. ``The only people who should worry
about Ron are the people who will try to tackle him,'' Martin said
... The Jacksonville Jaguars may be $25 million over the projected
salary cap for the 2001 season, but they are not panicking. The
Jaguars never use escalator clauses or voidable years in their
contracts. That means they have more flexibility when it comes to
restructuring deals ... San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf is
continuing his comeback from oblivion. After two disastrous years,
Leaf may be turning his career around after a solid preseason and
will most likely start in the opener at Oakland next Sunday. &QL;

SENSING VOTER INTEREST, GORE PUSHES HEALTH PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.M., Ore., Wash., Conn.)  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Riding a wave of success on his prescription-drug
plan, Vice President Al Gore plans to dedicate all of next week to
a cross-country discussion of health care issues and a comparison
of his proposals with those of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers, who outlined the strategy in a conference call
Saturday morning, said that prescription drugs had emerged as the
``top issue,'' and that Gore had surged in the polls in part
because he had dedicated so much time to the issue. The Republicans
are clearly nervous about the inroads Gore has made with discussion
of his plan and are running $7 million worth of television
commercials criticizing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on health care reflects in part the shifting
demographics of the nation. The 1992 presidential campaign focused
on the uninsured and people who did not have health care coverage.
Now, with the baby boom generation facing retirement, the focus is
on coverage for the elderly and the prices of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gore plan, people 65 and older with low incomes _
falling below 135 percent of the official poverty line _ would get
free prescription-drug coverage. Bush's plan also covers the
elderly poor.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore offers a broader package of prescription drug
coverage through Medicare to all elderly patients, while Bush does
not. Under the Gore plan, they could pay premiums of between $25
and $44 per month for coverage of prescription drugs. The plan
would cover half of all drug costs up to $5,000 and 100 percent of
costs beyond $5,000. The patients would also have the option of
buying coverage for catastrophic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sets aside $253 billion over 10 years to cover prescription
drugs. Bush has not specified what he would set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Gore begins the week in Tallahassee, Fla., with a round-table
discussion of his prescription drug plan. On Tuesday in
Albuquerque, N.M., he is to talk about children's health care. His
topic will be Medicare on Wednesday in Eugene and Portland, Ore.,
and on Thursday he plans a rally in Seattle on the patients' bill
of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning's conference call was joined by Dr. David
Kessler, the former food and drug commissioner and now dean of the
Yale School of Medicine. Kessler, speaking from Woodbridge, Conn.,
said Gore ``has real commitment and real expertise'' on health care
issues.

   Most In-Season Acquisitions Producing Nicely &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several days after the All-Star Game break, members of the
Yankees' brain trust, led by George Steinbrenner, sat around the
table in the owner's suite at Yankee Stadium and talked about
possible players to pursue to bolster the team's sagging offense.
They had a list of 14 players, and a visitor strongly recommended
they seek one who was not high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner and his guest, Tom Reich, have been the targets of
media critics who have questioned deals they have done over the
years for some of Reich's free-agent clients. But no one will
second-guess the agent's recommendation in this instance because in
his first 67 times at bat in the Yankees' lineup, Glenallen Hill, a
Reich client, slugged 12 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, whose right-handed power was desired to counter the team's
vulnerability to left-handed pitching, has clearly been the star
among the three dozen or so players who have been acquired by
contenders to aid them in their pursuit of division championships
and playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, in fact, have clearly outclassed the field with
their in-season acquisitions, each one of whom has made
contributions to their division-leading status. Of the six position
players the Yankees picked up, five were hitting better than .300
entering the weekend: Hill, .429; David Justice, .331; Luis
Polonia, .344; Jose Canseco, .333; and Luis Sojo, .310.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, on the strength of his home run power, had driven in 23
runs in 21 games, and Justice had hit 13 home runs and knocked in
36 runs in 44 games. The five players had hit 30 home runs, nearly
one-fifth of the team's total.
</P>
<P>
   Only four other in-season acquisitions were hitting .300: David
Segui of Cleveland, .369; Jack Clark of St. Louis, .364; Lenny
Harris of the Mets, .317; and Charles Johnson of the Chicago White
Sox, .306.
</P>
<P>
   The five players not obtained by the Yankees who had the most
home runs had hit a total of 20, fewer than the combined total of
Hill and Justice. Clark led with five, four of them in the first
four games he played with the Cardinals. Hill and Justice have
connected regularly for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs have been alien to Cleveland's Wil Cordero, who was
hitting .256. Rico Brogna won a game for Boston the other night,
but the hit he did it with was only his fifth in 24 at-bats for a
.208 average. Mike Lansing, the second baseman the Red Sox acquired
from Colorado, was hitting .212.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant had four home runs for Anaheim but was hitting .205.
Harold Baines was hitting .216 for the White Sox, but he was the
only player traded from Baltimore this season who was not hitting
well. Besides Johnson, Mike Bordick was at .295 for the Mets and
B.J. Surhoff at .292 for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On the pitching side of the pennant-race pickups, the Yankees
and the Braves looked at first as if they had made brilliant moves,
the Yankees in adding Denny Neagle and the Braves by gaining Andy
Ashby for their rotation. But the brilliance has dimmed in recent
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby won his first three starts, allowing two runs in 23
innings. But he has lost four of his last five starts, giving up 24
earned runs in 29 innings as his record has fallen to 4-4 and his
earned run average to 4.53. The difference in the two periods has
been home runs. No one hit a home run against Ashby in his first
three games, but he was rocked for eight in the next five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle produced nifty performances in his first two starts for
the Yankees; both were complete games, and he gave up a total of
one run. Since then, however, he has compiled a 1-4 record in six
starts and allowed 21 earned runs in 21 and one-third innings in
the four losses.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of Neagle's ineffectiveness could be a change
in the Yankees' postseason plans. If Neagle continues to struggle
and David Cone continues his newfound effectiveness, Neagle could
be the odd man out of the postseason rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling will be very much a part of Arizona's October
plans, if there is an October for Arizona. In six starts for the
Diamondbacks, Schilling has a 4-2 record and a 2.57 ERA, making him
the most successful in-season pitching addition.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays and the Indians each added two starting
pitchers. All four have earned run averages that begin with a 5:
Steve Trachsel (0-1, 5.56) and Estaban Loaiza (2-3, 5.10) for the
Blue Jays and Steve Woodard (0-2, 5.85) and Jason Bere (3-2, 5.59)
for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   After trading Ismael Valdes to the Chicago Cubs last winter, the
Los Angeles Dodgers brought him back for the stretch run, but he
has an 0-2 record and 6.65 ERA in five starts and one relief
appearance. The White Sox, short on starters, signed Ken Hill after
Anaheim released him, and he didn't last three innings in his first
start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have until midnight Thursday to make trades and have their
new players be eligible for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella on Payroll and Parity
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella, in his 14th season as a major league manager and
his 32nd year as a major league employee, acknowledged this month
that ``payroll disparity is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, he added: ``There seems to be more
parity than before. There's a lot of parity in baseball; there
really is. Teams can all beat you. I don't think there's a place
you can go and find you can take a breather.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days after Piniella offered that seemingly contradictory
observation, his Seattle Mariners took a seven-game lead in the
American League West, their biggest advantage this season. Five
days later, the Mariners' lead had plunged to three games.
</P>
<P>
   Two losses to Cleveland, a team trying to climb back to the top
of the AL Central, and three to Detroit, a team climbing out of a
gaping early-season hole, brought the Mariners back to the reality
of a division race. Three more losses to the Indians, and the
Mariners suddenly had an eight-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   They ended it with a victory over the Tigers last Tuesday, but
the Tigers came right back and won the other two games of the
series, leaving the Mariners only two and a half games ahead of
Oakland. The Tigers, meanwhile, reached .500 (63-63) for the first
time since the second day of the season. Until the last two months,
they had played much of the season 12 to 14 victories under .500.
Since June 25, they had a 34-21 record, a .618 winning percentage
that would translate to 100 victories for a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Averting Another Labor War
</P>
<P>
   Labor peace will reign for another year, but don't get too used
to it.
</P>
<P>
   The players association is expected to notify management in the
next day or two that it is exercising its option to extend the
collective bargaining agreement for another season, until Oct. 31,
2001. The option has to be acted on by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists say the two sides will peacefully negotiate a new
agreement. The realists say: are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier years of the agreement, representatives of the
two sides held informal discussions about a possible extension, but
the talks basically ended last spring. Maybe the participants were
getting too close and comfortable for the liking of the more
militant members of management. They would be the corps of
hard-line owners who still dream about a salary cap and will push
to revive the idea or a luxury tax on payrolls that would be so
steep it would act as a cap.
</P>
<P>
   A critical outcome of the last negotiation, the luxury tax is
not in effect this year and will not be next year. However, the
clubs' enhanced revenue-sharing plan will operate at 100 percent
for the first time this year and will continue at that rate next
year.

STATEMENT SHOWS CONSERVATIVE LIST OF INVESTMENTS 
(WITH LIEBERMAN-BUSINESS) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman's personal financial statement _ which includes
the investments of his wife, Hadassah _ shows a conservative list
of investments, with the bulk of his net worth coming from mutual
funds, a blind trust and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   According to financial records for 1999, Lieberman earned
$141,300 as a senator and received $45,000 in book royalties. He
also received $10,735 in state pension money and income from being
an estate trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's investment portfolio is valued between $139,000 and
$645,000, according to government statements that list all amounts
as ranges and not as specific numbers. His largest investment is a
blind trust valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and he has an
individual retirement account consisting mainly of government
securities valued at $9,000 to $135,000. In 1999, he listed capital
gains of $30,000 to $122,000.
</P>
<P>
   His investment portfolio also lists a Merrill Lynch account
owned jointly with his wife, valued at $10,000 to $150,000. It
consists of mutual funds and government securities. He also has
bank savings accounts worth $20,000 to $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's portfolio consists of stocks and mutual funds valued
at $18,000 to $90,000, and an individual retirement account valued
at $63,000 to $405,000. Stocks held by his wife include 800 shares
of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, and 150 shares of Verizon,
the telecommunications company, as well as shares in Viacom-CBS,
Fox Entertainment and WorldCom. In the last year, the Liebermans
sold 200 shares of Pfizer, 100 shares of CVS, a drug store chain,
500 shares of Occidental Petroleum and 50 shares of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The Liebermans own an investment condominium in New Haven valued
at $52,500, according to tax records, and earned between $5,000 and
$15,000 in rent from the condominium. They also have a house in the
Georgetown section of Washington valued at $547,157, and a
condominium in Connecticut valued at $150,486. The Georgetown house
has a $285,000 mortgage, and the Liebermans have a mortgage of
$50,000 to $100,000 on the second condominium.

POLICE SHOOTING NEAR DIALLO SCENE UPSETS RESIDENTS
</HEADLINE>
 By   C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 51-year-old Bronx man was shot by the police early
Saturday morning when he brandished a butcher's knife at another
man and two officers, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Michael Jones, was not seriously injured, but the
shooting in Soundview neighborhood _ where two unarmed black men
have been shot and killed by police since early 1999 _ led to an
encounter between the officers and a small crowd that gathered and
shouted anti-police remarks.
 &UR;  &LR; The police said the incident began shortly before midnight in a
sixth-floor apartment where Jones lives with Denise Evans and her
children. Jones punched Evans and fractured her nose, the police
and residents of the building said. He then ran from the apartment
with a large knife, the police said, and was pursued by Evans' son,
Leshan Evans, 23, who caught him in a parking lot behind a row of
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers on patrol duty saw the men arguing and ordered them
to separate. Jones refused to comply and one of the officers
sprayed him with pepper spray as he lunged forward with the knife,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers used the spray first, but he did not drop the
knife,' said Lt. Stephen W. Biegel, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Officer Jose D. Casiano, 35, fired twice at
Jones, grazing him once in the right leg.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred near the area where four plainclothes
officers killed Amadou Diallo in a barrage of 41 shots in February
1999, and near the site where a narcotics officer killed Malcolm
Ferguson last March.
</P>
<P>
   As more officers arrived, a small crowd converged on the parking
lot and began to heckle the officers, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Tillery, 17, who arrived at the parking lot just moments
after hearing the two gunshots, said she saw Jones handcuffed and
lying on the ground, asking for an ambulance. She said he worked
for years as a maintenance man at a movie theater and was
well-liked by his neighbors. The small crowd began to jeer the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were screaming, `Why are you guys always trying to kill
people?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested Tillery and held her on a charge of
disorderly conduct until late Saturday morning, when she was
released pending a court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was treated at a local hospital and released, was
being held Saturday on charges of attempted assault, menacing and
criminal possession of a weapon.

A PHOTOGRAPHER CHRONICLES HOMELESS, AND HAS A BRUSH WITH THEIR
FATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By LYNDA RICHARDSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Salvo Galano used to nail a simple burlap canvas on a
wall across from a soup kitchen run by the Church of the Holy
Apostles in Chelsea. Then the photographer would wait patiently for
the homeless men and women who frequented the place to drift over
and pose at his makeshift studio.
</P>
<P>
   Galano set out on a journey two years ago to show an unseen face
of the homeless population in New York City. The 32-year-old
Italian photographer was convinced that people in America would be
shocked if they saw what he saw on the city sidewalks. He was
certain, too, that he would find a publisher for his book, his
social document that told a broader truth: that the homeless were
not so different from anyone that he knew.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of Galano's journey last month, he was unable to
pay the rent on his apartment, living a couple of days here and
there with friends. He became a homeless man, in other words, with
a cell phone. His book is a dream deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Every obsession has its risks. Galano found that he cared,
perhaps too much, about a social issue that has persisted for two
decades now, so long that it has lost the power to shock.
``Sometimes when I think about what happened in my life, I want to
laugh, not to cry,'' Galano said in a telephone interview from
Milan, where he recently returned, after five years in New York, to
live with his father, a retired factory worker. ``I had a good
career,'' he said. ``All of a sudden, with a fellowship, my life
turned to the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Galano was awarded a prestigious fellowship from the John Simon
Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1998, which had sponsored some of
his role models in photography, Diane Arbus and Robert Frank. He
was one of the youngest recipients of what is considered a
midcareer fellowship. Galano invested the entire $35,000 Guggenheim
award, in addition to his life savings of $15,000, in the book. He
had been dreaming of the project since 1996, when he began to
volunteer at the soup kitchen on Ninth Avenue near 28th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer had no interest in shooting the kind of
traditional photographs often seen of homeless people, surrounded
by misery and detritus. He had something else in mind, portraits
that looked more like fashion photography, taken against a blank
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Conarroe, the president of the Guggenheim Foundation said
he was stunned by Galano's photographs. The foundation took the
unusual step of agreeing to pay $10,000 toward the book's
publication. ``This was a real work of love,'' said Conarroe, who
helped edit the profiles of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Galano's photographs, including some of the homeless, have
appeared in leading newspapers and magazines in his native Italy
and throughout Europe. But the photographer's work is not so well
known here.
</P>
<P>
   Galano said he first believed that he had a publishing deal with
the Aperture Foundation in Manhattan, but no contract was signed.
He said Aperture held on to his project for nine months, then sent
him an e-mail message stating that editors had decided the book was
not marketable. Galano said he knew the nonprofit foundation was
already planning to publish a book, ``Fragile Dwelling,'' due out
this fall, by a New York-based photographer, Margaret Morton, who
has a reputation for her photographs of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Thompson Reid, an Aperture book editor, denied that
fatigue with the homeless issue played a role in the decision not
to publish Galano's book, but she declined to elaborate. ``I can't
make an authoritative statement about exactly what went into every
aspect of the decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, friends and colleagues watched with
wonderment as Galano's book _ called ``Sidewalk Stories'' _ became
the focus of his daily routine. He befriended about 15 homeless men
and women. Night and day, he was in their company. They preened for
him in a small park across from the soup kitchen. The project so
consumed the photographer that he gave up other work assignments,
maybe even a bit of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the circumstances, one might say that it is imprudent,
but when you have a passion, you have a passion,'' said Clyde
Kuemmerle, programs coordinator for the Church of the Holy Apostles
soup kitchen. ``And there he was, with a beautiful representation
of people who do live on the streets, and there he was himself, all
of a sudden living on the streets.''

LUKAS IS PLAYING DOWN TALK OF SARATOGA SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Will be led after the Travers, scheduled for 5:12 p.m. ET.) 
By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ D. Wayne Lukas, it can be argued, is to
training horses what John Wooden was to coaching college
basketball, an apt comparison considering that before he became a
trainer, Lukas was an aspiring coach.
</P>
<P>
   Racing's most successful handler over the last two decades,
Lukas is never short on confidence. So when his remarkable streak
without a victory here this summer was brought up at his barn early
Saturday morning, Lukas not only brushed it off. He also predicted
that it was a sign of good things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things like this happen, we usually roll into the next
stop and have a hell of a meet,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   It is just that sort of hubris that has made the trainer of 20
Eclipse Award winners one of the least popular players among his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   So when Lukas was asked if he thought that any of his fellow
trainers were sympathetic to his plight _ coming into Saturday, a
Lukas-trained horse had not won at Saratoga in 28 consecutive
starts since Aug. 2 _ he just shook his head and let out a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hell no,'' he said. ``They're not sympathetic at all.
That's not the kind of game it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Since switching from quarter horses to thoroughbreds on a
full-time basis in 1978, Lukas, more than any other trainer, has
changed the nature of the horse racing game to fit his style. He
has won four Eclipse Awards as the nation's outstanding trainer,
and his biography in the New York Racing Association media guide
takes up more than three pages. His biography, in other words, is
nearly as big as his barn.
</P>
<P>
   That stable has come up empty here this year. Lukas had three
horses scheduled to run in Saturday's Travers _ the centerpiece of
the Saratoga meet _ including Commendable in the 131st running of
the Travers, long known as the midsummer Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas won the Travers twice before, with Corporate Report in
1991 and Thunder Gulch in 1995. But some might argue that not even
an upset victory by Commendable, the 19-1 winner of the June 9
Belmont Stakes, could make Lukas' meet a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in slumps before, if you want to call it a slump,''
said Lukas. ``But it will probably equate into a pretty strong
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin-born Lukas, who turns 65 on Sept. 2, based his
optimism on a number of factors. He has been so good for so long _
since 1984, Lukas had been out of the top 10 in the trainer
standing here only once, in 1997 _ that he had to think things
would turn around. And soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at it week-to-week or meet-to-meet,'' Lukas
said. ``You have to look at it in five-year increments. And I'm
very comfortable in the season we're having. Depending on how you
look at it, we're second or third in the national standing. And
that's where we're accustomed to being.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might even say that with just one winner among 38 starters,
Lukas was having a decent meet. That is because he has also had
nine second-place finishers and 10 third-place finishers, giving
him 20 horses out of 38 in the money.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas would not take the easy way out and blame his lack of
winners on the inclement weather this month. Instead, he said that
most of his horses did not fit the conditions of the uniquely short
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come in here, you have to have an arsenal of maidens,''
said Lukas, long regarded as one of the finest trainers of
2-year-olds around. ``To saddle 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 winners, you
usually have to win with five or six maidens. We won 17 maiden
races before we got here. We used all those bullets up. As a
result, we haven't won many races here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Travers, Lukas lost at the track. He was fined
$500 Saturday for what stewards called a ``display of temper''
after the Ballerina last Sunday; he had claimed a foul, then
criticized the stewards' decision when the claim was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Lukas remained optimistic as the meet headed into its
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not discouraged at all,'' he said. ``We had a wonderful
midsummer meet at Churchill Downs. So I'm not as caught up in it or
as concerned about it as everyone else seems to be. We're pointing
toward a big fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall season culminates in the Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup at
Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. Saturday, Lukas was quick to
point out that the 1988 Breeders' Cup _ where his horses won three
races and scored three second-place finishes _ might have been his
best day ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``And from top to bottom, we'll be a factor again in the
Breeders' Cup this year,'' Lukas said. ``And that will put all this
to rest.''

STRIPED BASS TAKE A BIG LIKING TO RAINBOW TROUT AS BAIT
</HEADLINE>
 By NICHOLAS KARAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARPENTERSVILLE , N.J. _ The evening humidity was so dense that
it was difficult to distinguish individual trees a scant hundred
yards away on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River. ``It
usually doesn't get that bad,'' Cliff Tinsman said in apology,
``but after all, it is August.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsman, 45, and I were killing time, mesmerized by the flowing
river while buried in huge, overstuffed chairs on the large
wraparound veranda of his fishing lodge. The lodge sits high on a
wooded bank on the Jersey side, just above where Pohatcong Creek
joins the much larger river. We had finished a sumptuous venison
dinner he had prepared and were waiting for it to get dark enough
to go striped bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth getting out too early,'' Tinsman said. ``The
river gets very warm during the day, too warm for bass to feed. I
checked it at noon. It was 78 degrees. The bass are lying in a
30-foot hole, over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsman pointed just beyond the mouth of Pohatcong Creek. ``Bass
are a lot like trout,'' he added. ``They don't like water above 70
degrees. They hole up where cooler water from the `Poh' comes in.
But at night, hunger gets them out and they head for the shore to
feed. They've taken a special liking to rainbow trout I stock in
the creek and concentrate at the mouth looking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Tinsman has run the One That Got Away
Club, a fishing and hunting lodge on the edge of the Delaware
River. He now leases a mile and a half of Pohatcong Creek, a
half-mile of the Delaware's shore on each side of the Pohatcong,
and a half-mile of the nearby Muscanetcong River, probably New
Jersey's best trout water.
</P>
<P>
   His club has nearly a hundred members, and for an initiation fee
and an annual maintenance fee they can use his facilities and fish
as often as they like. Tinsman stocks the Pohatcong Creek with
browns and rainbows from a hatchery in Carpentersville, less than a
mile upriver.
</P>
<P>
   Not the slightest hint of a breeze broke the night air at 10
p.m. as we walked the few hundred yards from the veranda to the
edge of the river just below the creek. A steep bank backed us up
and Raubs Island, in the river before us, narrowed its flow and
quickened its pace to tidewater 70 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, efforts to end the pollution spurred by
industrial growth in the Philadelphia-Camden area were started. For
the last 10 years striped bass have been incrementally reclaiming
their river and moving farther upstream each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness, Tinsman pulled down several plastic lawn chairs
he had hidden in the brush higher on the bank and handed them to me
and my companions as we untangled our spinning rods. He then handed
us wire rod-holders that were driven into the hard mud next to our
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is easy fishing, gentleman-like fishing,'' he said. ``You
don't have to hold the rods unless you want to. Leave on the reel's
clicker and you'll know the instant a bass has your bait. Some of
the bass we've caught have been big, the biggest a 25-pounder. Now,
for the piece de resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric, one of the lodge's guides, had been carrying a large
minnow bucket. As soon as he got down to the river he submerged the
inner sieve part, Tinsman held the flashlight on the sieve while
Eric removed a squirming six-inch rainbow trout.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsman has been using rainbow trout for striper bait since one
spring four years ago when he discovered that bass moving into the
Pohatcong at high water were feeding on trout he had stocked.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to where I should cast. ``Don't throw it too far,''
he said, ``the bass will quickly find it if they're out of the
hole. Just let it swim around and enjoy itself for the time being.
As bait, it's not a bad swap at about a buck a piece for a striped
bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, the limit is two bass, 28 inches or longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness the air was so dense, so stifling that you could
feel it enshroud you. Relief did not come as a cooling breeze but
as a psychological response to the unexpected appearance of a
large, orange moon that broke above a hilltop to the south. The
river before us sparkled like diamonds and the shape of the
surrounding hills came into focus.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware seemed filled with catfish as we landed nearly a
dozen, one about 6 pounds. For most of the night it seemed as if
that was all we would catch. Then around midnight, the reel on Dick
Nelson's rod began to sing. In the semidarkness a fish tore line
off the spool and elevated the sound of the clicker to an unknown
octave.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no catfish,'' Tinsman yelled as he used his flashlight
to search for a landing net, ``that's a striped bass.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, but it was an inch short of being a keeper. ``I would
have released it anyway,'' said Nelson. ``Maybe April 1, when the
trout season opens in New York, I'll catch it again at Junction
Pool in Roscoe.''

IN A SURPRISING MOVE, JETS RELEASE STOUTMIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Just when Omar Stoutmire thought he had
returned as the Jets' starting free safety, he was dealt the
severest football blow of all _ he was cut Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That was the most surprising move of the 10 players Coach Al
Groh dropped in paring the roster to 53. Stoutmire had started two
of the four preseason games, including the finale against the
Giants. He was also the incumbent starter.
</P>
<P>
   And this year's starter is? Most likely, it will be Scott Frost,
but Kevin Williams said that he had rotated with Frost at Saturday
morning's practice as the Jets' bye week ended.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain symmetry to all of this. In 1998, Frost and
Williams were rookies, both picked on the third round. Williams won
out as the starter, only to be benched. Since then, the Jets have
used four other starters at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   This appears to be Frost's moment, though. He has taken to heart
Groh's advice when camp started. Groh told him, ``Every day you
walk in here, think, `Why not me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Frost was the quarterback of Nebraska's co-national championship
college team in 1997, but he was drafted into the pros as a safety.
Bill Parcells liked his size, 6 foot 3 and 219 pounds. He had
battled Stoutmire and Williams at free safety all summer. Williams
is faster than Frost, but 3 inches shorter and about 25 pounds
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Groh also cut Yatil Green, the former Dolphins first-round
choice, whose injury-plagued career made him expendable in Miami
but an inexpensive pickup for the Jets. Until late in training
camp, though, Green showed little, and his number was up when the
Jets landed another free-agent receiver, Vincent Brisby. He will be
the third receiver behind Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Groh said he would not disclose his reasons for Saturday's cuts
_ among the others were quarterback Jim Kubiak, centers Mike Gisler
and Keith Short, and defensive end Anthony Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand this is very important to them,'' Groh said. ``To
talk about why they're not on the team would denigrate their
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say that Frost had progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the Frost has thawed,'' said Groh, who likes to speak
in metaphors. ``He's come a long way. He was resolute in his
efforts. A very aggressive tackler. He had to find out coming in as
a quarterback _ one, how to tackle, and, two, it didn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Groh paused for effect and added, ``All the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh said he had not formally named Frost as his starter. Both
Williams and Frost said they hoped to learn soon. But there is only
a week left before the regular season begins Sept. 3 at Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Williams proclaimed himself totally recovered from the serious
heart and lung infection that hospitalized him last season, led him
to drop to 158 pounds from 193, and put him in a life-threatening
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know there's not a lot of people who would have made it
back,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   And Frost described the merry-go-round free safety situation as
``a bit of a mess'' since he has been a Jet. He even admitted that
when he tried to make the transition, ``I felt like a fish out of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he feels confident now about his tackling. Williams
said he feels good about being healthy again. In a sense, both
Williams and Frost have had to re-learn who they are as football
players.

VENUS WILLIAMS COMES INTO HER OWN
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just down the road from her parents' roomy but unassuming
Colonial, with its green shutters and patchy lawn, the sawdust has
settled on the construction of Venus Williams' gated home in South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In an upscale enclave, where prices hover well above the
half-million-dollar range, the home could stand as a stucco symbol
of Williams' journey from the beaded curiosity out of Compton,
Calif., to an independent young woman with a Grand Slam title of
her own, from the gangly 10-year-old who used to cup giggles with
her hand to the sleek 20-year-old who strides into rooms with the
same detached stare as a model on a catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really mature at all,'' Williams said as she stood
just a few yards from her father, Richard Williams, last week.
``Really, I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   While articulate and thoughtful on grown-up subjects, she
delights in pulling benevolent pranks, was among the first to snap
up the latest Harry Potter tale and often misses the coziness of
her old bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still miss my old room when it comes down to it,'' said
Williams, who shares her new home in Palm Beach Gardens with her
18-year-old sister, Serena. ``I miss my bed. My new bed is too big,
I think. It's a king, and it fits the size of the room, but I miss
my old bed. Something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was familiar, comfortable, just the right size for a
teen-ager. And just as with anyone dipping her toe into adulthood,
a part of Williams wants to hold on to the past. Unlike others in
her position, however, her growth spurts and sputters in maturity
have been caught on film.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Venus Williams was uncovered as a late bloomer.
From beneath her hood, she watched stoically as Serena Williams won
the first Grand Slam championship of the Williams family at the
U.S. Open. Now, after a mesmerizing Wimbledon title in July, and a
19-match winning streak, Venus Williams will arrive in Queens this
week as a player who has come into her own.
</P>
<P>
   Although Williams recoils at the notion that a sibling rivalry
prompted her refocused rise _ and uses her patented glare to turn
mortals to dust if they mention it _ Serena Williams' title did
provide her big sister with a template for how a Grand Slam
tournament is won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a turning point for Venus,'' said Tracy
Austin, an analyst for the USA Network and an Open champion
herself. ``I will never forget the look on Venus' face when Serena
won. She had the hood over her head, hands under her chin, and
didn't look excited. I think she expected to be the first. And that
fall, Serena beat her for the first time in a match. Then you
didn't see Venus for six months.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a time to heal. Wrist tendinitis was the official injury,
but there is a suspicion that Venus Williams needed a chance to
mend her passion for the game. To fill her time, she took a fashion
design class and stayed low while her father talked of her imminent
retirement, and she discovered how much she missed the game.
Playing beat studying, beat an office job, beat everything. Once
Williams returned, there was dedication in everything she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of all, I've just changed my whole attitude,''
Williams, who is seeded No. 3, said. ``I try to go for my shots. I
don't just let something happen. I'm focused on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I don't think there are too many players who say,
`Hey, I want to play Venus Williams,' even if I'm playing badly. No
matter which Venus comes, it's not going to be that easy. What I'm
trying to do is be consistent. I'm not No. 1, but I hear once you
get to the top, it's hard to stay there. What I'm doing now is just
preparation for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no primer for handling fame. When discovered a
decade ago, Williams was viewed as a novelty act hatched from her
eccentric father's imagination. As she grew into her 6-foot-1-inch
frame before everyone's eyes, no one knew if she would fill out her
potential, too. She was well known, but by winning Wimbledon, her
image saturated the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the players I've known who have come up and then won a
Grand Slam, it just puts closure on their goal, so to speak,'' said
Lynne Rolley, the director of programs for the U.S. Tennis
Association. ``And then the popularity, admiration and appreciation
comes from that Grand Slam, but they don't know that's going to
come with it because their focus has been just on playing well,
improving and winning a title.''
</P>
<P>
   As with everything else, Williams is growing into her amplified
celebrity. Few have the ability to disarm a crowd with her charm or
leave them laughing with her colorful anecdotes, but sometimes the
demands on her time leave her in a petulant mood. While she
realizes her impact on society _ and recently told the story of an
African-American child she met at a Best Buy who was playing a
tennis video game while wearing a golf glove like Tiger Woods _
Venus Williams does not campaign to be a role model.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Wimbledon, her mother and father said, ``Venus,
you're a star now.'' Sometimes, she revels in it, other times she
wants to go unnoticed. As a result, she buys hats now and wears
sunglasses, too. But while competing at the Pilot Pen tournament
last week in New Haven, she couldn't camouflage her fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week hasn't been easy for me because when I'm walking
down the street, I'm not having any peace,'' Williams said with a
sigh. ``When I'm in the elevator of the hotel, even the operator
doesn't leave me alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think people don't understand that I have to deal with
a lot of people every day. If I say, `No, I don't want to do
autographs' or `No, I don't want to take pictures,' it doesn't mean
I'm a bad person. Everyone needs their own space.''

   She has that in her new home. Although she lives in an upscale
community, the house is not garish. A real estate agent in the area
described the home as classy. Part of growing up means gaining
perspective on money and lifestyle. Over the past couple of years,
Williams has started driving more cautiously _ ``because seeing the
lights in your mirror is worse than losing'' _ and remaining
grounded in her spending. She and her sister bought their Wimbledon
champions' dinner dresses at a mall, and they are more likely to
seek out the Olive Garden over a chic bistro when they come to town
this week.

   ``I don't actually have a budget, but I don't spend recklessly
at all,'' Venus Williams said. ``I'm conservative, yeah. The most
expensive car I ever bought was a truck. I don't want to spend
money on things that will devaluate. I won't buy cars. I just have
to find a way to get one free. If I can't, I'll just have to drive
what I have. But I'm happy with my truck.''

misses the old box springs and some other homespun comforts, but
some things she is glad to leave behind.

<P>
   ``There was no home cooking,'' Williams said. ``It was like,
find your own meal and hide it in the refrigerator, and hope no one
eats it. If I went and bought some baked chicken, I'd have to put
in the back, like put it in the vegetable section so no one would
know it was there. I don't have to do that anymore.''

PROSECUTION MAY BE URGED IN CIA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A special prosecutor investigating John M. Deutch,
the former director of central intelligence, has told law
enforcement officials that he is wrapping up his inquiry and
expects to recommend that Deutch be prosecuted on charges of
mishandling classified information, government officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Paul E. Coffey, has not yet made any
recommendations to Attorney General Janet Reno, the officials said.
But Coffey, who was brought out of retirement for the Deutch
matter, has told others in the Justice Department that he is
inclined to conclude that Deutch be charged with storing government
secrets on his home computer, a security violation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno initially declined to prosecute Deutch, who had
acknowledged a breach of security and apologized. But she ordered a
new inquiry in February after a report from the CIA inspector
general questioned how the agency's leadership had handled the
matter. In addition, the issue of how Deutch's case was dealt with
drew criticism from Congress and elsewhere for its sharp contrast
with the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, is
being prosecuted on charges of illegally transferring and copying
secret nuclear data from the laboratory, an offense some Justice
Department critics have argued is similar to what Deutch may have
done.
</P>
<P>
   The government officials spoke after Bloomberg News Service
first reported on the matter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was director of central intelligence from May 1995 until
resigning in December 1996. As he was leaving, a CIA computer
security official found that he had stored information at his home,
including details of covert operations. The agency's security
office began an investigation into whether he had mishandled
classified material but that inquiry soon bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department was not notified that he might have
broken any laws until more than a year after the breach was
discovered. In 1998, a CIA employee told the inspector general's
office that the initial investigation had been improperly handled.
The inspector general then opened his own inquiry and notified the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Six senior agency officials have been disciplined for their
roles in the initial investigation of Deutch.

REAL ESTATE: FAMOUS BEAT POET WAS HERE _ BUT NEW RESIDENTS ARE NOT
IMPRESSED 
</HEADLINE>
  By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  NEW YORK _ When the plaque went up on the East Village building
saying that it was where Allen Ginsberg once lived, the two young
men who now occupy the poet's old apartment had only this to say:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who was he?
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg, one of the century's most famous writers, and a
longtime East Village resident who died in 1997, would probably
have found the whole thing pretty funny. (Unless it threw him into
absolute despair.)
</P>
<P>
   The plaque placed this summer by the Historic Landmarks
Preservation Center on the building at 170 East Second Street
between Avenues A and B notes that Ginsberg lived there from August
1958 until March 1961. It was there, in apartment No. 16, that he
wrote ``Kaddish,'' a mournful elegy for his mother, Naomi that is
considered one of his best works.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque describes Ginsberg as an ``internationally acclaimed
poet and member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.'' It
doesn't note that he also celebrated every kind of freedom,
behaving outrageously whenever possible, showing up at every be-in,
love-in and demonstration imaginable (or in these days,
unimaginable) and coming out of the closet before celebrities did
that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment up several flights of stairs in one of those large
nondescript East Village walk-ups still looks like the kind of
place where Ginsberg would have lived. The first thing you see when
you enter is a sink; to the left is the rest of the bathroom. The
kitchen is just a wall of the living room. But there are two real
bedrooms, each with a window.
</P>
<P>
   The building has a big sign on the front door saying that many
things are not allowed: ball playing, carriages, peddling, or
sitting in front of the building Not long ago, this was drug
territory, and landlords had to defend their turf assiduously; now
it is being infiltrated by students from New York University, which
is steadily expanding its presence to the east of Washington Square
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Noah P. Melnick and Mark Lazaro, both students at NYU, found the
apartment a little more than a year ago. Looking for apartments was
even worse than they had anticipated; every time they showed up at
an available place, it was already taken, or there were 10 people
in line in front of them, all wanting it. And so when they found
the apartment on Second Street, and realized they were the first
people there, they jumped at it. The rent is $2,000 a month. It's
not a bargain, says Lazaro, but ``we're not getting ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Their only complaint, really, is noise. ``I like it, but I like
to sleep,'' says Lazaro, who is kept awake late by the sounds of
children playing in the street. He is astonished that they stay out
so late. ``When I was in high school I couldn't stay out until
midnight,'' says Lazaro, who grew up in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
``And they're 6.''
</P>
<P>
   They say the neighborhood is changing for the better. When they
first arrived, Melnick says, ``we had to walk two blocks for
laundry.'' Now there is a new laundromat across the street. And
increasingly people their age are moving into the neighborhood. But
it still, he says, has more than its share of people who are ``a
little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Melnick and Lazaro didn't notice the plaque right away. But then
one day ``the girl upstairs told us, you live in Allen Ginsberg's
apartment,'' Lazaro said. The name didn't quite ring a bell.
``We're both generally well read,'' said Melnick. ``We both read
lots of poetry. Aristotle, Plato. But Allen Ginsberg _ no.'' They
said their landlord asked whether they get any special vibes from
the apartment, maybe an urge to write, but they had to confess _
no.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't yet been tempted to go out and buy one of his books
to see what all the fuss is about. They're probably too busy.
Melnick works full time at Phoenix Global Investments during the
day but also goes to school full time. He leaves the apartment at 6
a.m. and often doesn't finish work and classes until 11 p.m. As
soon as he graduates, he plans to go to law school.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro is a finance major and during the summer has been working
full time for a hedge fund run by Mario Cibelli. Someday he hopes
to have his own hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't know what that is, you probably do know who
Allen Ginsberg is.

HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE BEYOND 100 MPH
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATT: Md., N.C.) By   HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is difficult to describe the feeling of disorder, but it's
something like taking the wheel of a high-performance automobile
barreling down the freeway at speeds well beyond the legal limit.
The car is weaving through traffic, but the responsibility for
maintaining control is being shared with the passenger beside you,
who has sole command of the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, he is laughing and hooting, and his friends and
colleagues have confided to you that he's a brilliant maniac.
</P>
<P>
   All you can do is steer, react and hope for the best. And that,
in essence, describes my first 100-plus-mile-an-hour experience
last Thursday on the Chesapeake Bay at the helm of a Super Vee
Light twin-engine rocket called Pier 57. The man at my side was Art
Lilly, who holds numerous powerboating records in the sport and was
named the 1999 American Power Boat Association throttleman of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The four-boat, Tennessee-based Pier 57 team arrived in Baltimore
the previous evening for this weekend's 15th annual Chesapeake
Challenge Offshore Powerboat Race. The action continues on Sunday
on the Patapsco River, where dozens of boats in numerous classes
are competing in a lead-in event to the association's national
championships in Washington, N.C., in October.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's Chesapeake stop, Lilly and his driver, Jeff
Harris, narrowly averted tragedy when the driver of another boat
lost control on a turn and spun out across their deck. ``He was
upside down and his props ran right down the side of our boat and
missed our canopy by about 20 inches, which was pretty scary,''
Lilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Harris and Lilly went out the next day and took the
checkered flag for their class.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between driver and throttleman clearly has its
Butch and Sundance moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The throttle guys usually have different attitudes than the
drivers,'' said David Woods, the Pier 57 owner, who is also a
throttleman for one of the Fountain-built Super Vee racers. ``It's
a known fact. If you're on the throttle, you're the one pushing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one to miss a setup line, Woods' driving partner, Fred Tull,
agreed. ``The driver does tend to be more level-headed,'' he said.
``You always need to calm the throttle guy down a bit. Right there
you've got your responsible individual, and your irresponsible
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Joking aside, the teamwork between a driver and a throttleman as
they negotiate tight turns over the course of a typical 100-mile
Super Vee race is intricate and exhausting. In addition to
governing the speed of the 39-foot boat, the throttleman also
controls the attitude of the trim tabs and the outdrives for the
850 horsepower engines, which must be constantly adjusted depending
on the water conditions.
</P>
<P>
   With no small measure of trepidation _ my last voyage under
power had been on a leaky inflatable dinghy with a cranky
five-horsepower outboard _ I accepted an offer for a spin with
Lilly aboard one of the two Pier 57 Super Vee Lights. After donning
a helmet and a life jacket, fastening my seat belt and shoulder
harness, and taking note of the oxygen regulator in the event we
flipped over, we got underway.
</P>
<P>
   Jogging at about 10 mph out of the marina, it was with a huge
sigh of relief that I saw before us a long, glassy expanse of calm,
reflective water. Lilly, who relishes racing in big seas, seemed
exasperated by the lack of bumpy chop and liquid moguls.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking into a helmet headset, his voice was as flat as the
seaway. ``It's never like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his mood picked up when the throttle went down, and in an
instant we were doing 60 mph and climbing fast. We bolted past a
schooner full of tourists and I caught a glimpse of them along the
starboard rail: their heads snapped in unison, from left to right,
like a row of midcourt spectators at a tennis match taking in Pete
Sampras' first serve.
</P>
<P>
   To my left, a Global Positioning System navigation set could
barely keep up with our progress. Though too intent on my clammy
hands at the wheel to give it a fixed gaze, I saw we were at 80
mph, and a nanosecond later we were over 95. When Lilly asked for
an update, we had topped off at 106, which earned a chuckle and a
satisfied ``all right'' over the walkie-talkie. In the rearview
mirror, the Key Bridge was rapidly shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Lilly eased the throttle back for the return trip to the
marina and said, ``I could do this all day, but we've got to save
those engines for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   As the responsible one, I couldn't disagree.
</P>

DRUG POLICY LOOPHOLE IS REVEALED 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The soap opera-like saga of the Miami Dolphins' J.J. Johnson,
who will most likely start at running back, finally ended late last
week.
</P>
<P>
   It did so with a cryptic statement from the National Football
League that said reports of his pending suspension for steroid use
were in error and that he faced no such penalty. The statement
actually left more questions than answers about what happened in
Johnson's puzzling situation that may be a landmark drug case for
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's situation again put under a microscope the larger
issue of steroid use in the NFL and illustrated how difficult a job
pro football has in catching players who use performance-enhancing
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is clearly making an effort to catch cheaters. Masking
agents and the more recent phenomenon of players blaming positive
tests on dietary supplements sometimes thwart those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Dolphins official, it was indeed over-the-counter
muscle-building supplements that were at the center of the Johnson
case.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Johnson failed his steroid test last November.
Johnson appealed the suspension, saying the team gave him an
over-the-counter supplement that elevated his testosterone level,
and he said he should not be suspended since the team gave the
supplement to him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's version illustrated the problem with steroid testing
in relation to supplements, since Johnson's explanation created a
large loophole in the league's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what happened, the Miami official said: After the
positive test, Johnson told the NFL that he received the supplement
from one of the team's trainers. The trainer, however, told the NFL
that he did not give Johnson the supplement that led to his
positive test. The trainer was giving the supplement, a legal one,
to many of the Dolphins players, and none of those players has
tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Miami official said, Johnson changed his story and
said he purchased the supplement over the counter. When the NFL
said that was not a valid excuse, Johnson then changed his story
for the final time, saying the positive test was because of the
muscle-building supplement creatine and because he had received it
from the trainer, it was the trainer's fault.
</P>
<P>
   This put the NFL in a difficult position. The league did not
necessarily believe Johnson, the Miami official maintained, but
could not disprove his story. Even though the NFL sends players and
trainers a list of banned over-the-counter substances, some of
those substances are not listed on the bottles of the products; so
it is conceivable that Johnson used an over-the-counter product
that contained an illegal substance that was not listed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a kicker tested positive for steroids and used a
similar supplement defense. He was not suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The league gave Johnson a similar break and did not suspend him
the mandatory four games for a positive steroid test.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson case was an important one for this reason: Aware
that Johnson's defense could reveal a loophole in its steroid
policy, the official said, the NFL needed to take immediate steps
to close it. Imagine if every player who tested positive for
steroids could simply blame it on supplements.
</P>
<P>
   So the league took action. First, the NFL has recently made it
clear to teams that blaming positive tests on supplements will no
longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about one month ago, according to several team executives,
the NFL, in a memo to all teams, warned that any trainer who
knowingly or unknowingly distributes a supplement that contained a
prohibited substance is subject to a fine, as is the team.
</P>
<P>
   Before the NFL made public that Johnson's appeal was successful,
The Miami Herald, CBS Sportsline, ESPN and a sideline reporter on
`Monday Night Football'' all reported that Johnson was going to be
suspended for violating the league's steroid policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the NFL responded with a statement that said:
``Reports that J.J. Johnson of the Miami Dolphins will be suspended
for violating the league's policy on steroids are not true. We
cannot comment any further due to the confidentiality of the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguous statement did not exactly exonerate Johnson. It
did not say reports that he failed a steroid test were false. Was
Johnson fined? Was he warned that if he again tested positive _
supplement excuse or not _ he would be suspended? No one will say.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Johnson dodged a major blow to his season.
But as the NFL toughens its stance on steroids, any player who
tries to cheat in the future might not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Black Quarterbacks Popular
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in the NFL when black quarterbacks were
routinely discriminated against. Now, the league seems to be
embracing the black quarterback. In the 1999 draft, four black
quarterbacks _ Akilli Smith, Donovan McNabb, Daunte Culpepper and
Shaun King _ were drafted in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick declares himself
eligible for the draft after this season, scouts say he would most
likely be the first player selected.
</P>
<P>
   Black quarterbacks are aware of the changing NFL culture and of
their place in professional football history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was coming into the league, believe it or not, there
were people still saying black quarterbacks weren't smart enough,''
McNabb said, ``or we were only good athletes, or we couldn't read
defenses. Now people recognize everything we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller Ruffles Owner's Hair
</P>
<P>
   Several team executives and one owner went out of their way this
week to bash the ``Monday Night Football'' analyst Dennis Miller,
who they feel is taking too many cheap shots at NFL personnel
during the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to irk some in the league was Miller's reference to
an owner's supposed toupee and Miller's remarks questioning the
competency of an official.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before Miller began saying things
that would upset some league personnel, who can be extremely thin
skinned.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he planned to complain to ABC Sports or the NFL,
the owner, who asked not to be identified, said: ``Not yet. But
it's only the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Carmen Policy of the Cleveland Browns met with
NFL officials last week about his role in possible salary-cap
violations when he was in the San Francisco 49ers' front office. In
an interview, Policy maintained he had done nothing wrong and
wanted to make clear he has no ill feelings toward the current 49er
ownership. ... Philadelphia Eagles running back Cecil Martin
blocked for the Giants' Ron Dayne when both played at Wisconsin.
Martin was told that in New York there was some worry about Dayne's
at times sluggish preseason. ``The only people who should worry
about Ron are the people who will try to tackle him,'' Martin said.
... The Jacksonville Jaguars may be $25 million over the projected
salary cap for the 2001 season, but they are not panicking. The
Jaguars never use escalator clauses or voidable years in their
contracts. That means they have more flexibility when it comes to
restructuring deals. ... San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf
is continuing his comeback from oblivion. After two disastrous
years, Leaf may be turning his career around after a solid
preseason and will most likely start in the opener at Oakland next
Sunday.

CLINTON SAYS NIGERIA COULD BE `MORAL SUPERPOWER' FOR AFRICA  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ President Clinton celebrated Nigeria's infant
democracy Saturday, calling the nation an emerging ``moral
superpower'' for Africa, and urged Nigerians to find strength
rather than conflict in their religious and ethnic differences.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the first presidential visit to Africa's most populace
nation in more than 20 years, the president delivered few specifics
on how America can help Nigeria solve the daunting economic
problems that threaten its fragile democracy.
</P>
<P>
   However, he planned to offer help Sunday in the fight against
another threat to its national security _ AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of a two-day visit, Clinton and President
Olusegun Obasanjo talked about oil production, peacekeeping in
Sierra Leone, combating AIDS and drugs, and some economic
development help the United States can provide Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The president elicited a promise from Obasanjo to push for
increased oil production at an OPEC meeting next month in Venezuela
that would lower oil costs around the world. Obasanjo said he
would, ``work to bring an element of stability to the price of
oil.``
</P>
<P>
   Also, the presidents signed an open skies agreement that will
permit unrestricted international air traffic between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will, before he leaves Sunday promise Nigeria about $20
million to develop its telecommunications industry, educational
programs and fight AIDS, experts said. That is in addition to $109
million in annual U.S. aid to Nigeria. Adding the $42 million the
U.S. Marine mission to train Nigerians will cost, that brings U.S.
aid to Nigeria to $170 million this year, triple that of any other
African nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue on most Nigerians minds, seen in signs lining the
route of all of Clinton's events Saturday, was debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria owes $32 billion, most to Europe and Japan. About 4
percent of that debt is owed the United States. Clinton promised
that the United States would consider adding Nigeria to a list of
countries poor enough to be given U.S. debt relief. Because of its
oil wealth, Nigeria has not qualified for that relief. But he could
deliver no concrete debt-reduction program.
</P>
<P>
   At a state dinner late Saturday, Obasanjo called Nigeria's
foreign debt a ``gushing wound'' and said it was a ``moral
responsibility'' for the United States to cancel the debt it holds.
Otherwise, ``there is no light at the end of the tunnel, we will
perpetually remain in debt.``
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response was vague. ``I will do my best to help
Nigeria succeed economically,'' he said in a toast at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton told Nigerian legislators that because of a
democratic government elected last year, ``people will know Nigeria
as a great nation. I know that decades of misrule and deprivation
have made your religious and ethnic divisions deeper. ... but that
is no reason to let the idea of one united Nigeria slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Nigeria for expensive peacekeeping operations in
West Africa, saying the country was ``building the record of a
moral superpower.``
</P>
<P>
   That comes as U.S. troops arrived in Nigeria this week to train
five army battalions to attempt a peacekeeping mission to Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders, packed along with American dignitaries into
Nigeria's national assembly, reacted positively to the rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gana, Nigeria's minister of information, said: ``The
speech was deep, supportive and encouraging. Coming from a mature
democracy like the United States where there are over 200 ethnic
groups, the talk about finding strength in diversity was very
profound.``
</P>
<P>
   While lavishing praise on Obasanjo and the Nigerian legislature
for their democratic steps, Clinton _ at least publicly _ ignored
some of the harsher realities here. Obasanjo's military razed a
village in the southern oil region earlier this year after sabotage
to oil pipelines. Human rights groups like Amnesty International
urged Clinton in advance of this visit to raise the issue of
punishing rights violators, but Clinton made no mention of that in
Saturday's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria faces many crippling problems that have snuffed out past
attempts at democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The annual per capita income is around $300, and about 70
percent of people live in poor rural villages. Great oil wealth has
been squandered by government corruption. Crime is epidemic, and
AIDS afflicts hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton noted that the most dangerous threat to democracy
was divisions among Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, as well as among
Christians and Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Several northern Nigerian states have announced that Islamic law
will prevail there. And in the southern oil delta, insurgents are
demanding a greater return to the region of oil wealth that
represents nearly all of Nigeria's exports, including $4 billion to
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is worth noting for the entire world that against
the background of vast cultural differences, a history of
repression and ethnic strife, the hopeful fact here today is that
Nigeria's 250 different ethnic groups have stayed together as one
nation,`` Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president arrived in Nigeria shortly after 8 a.m. Saturday,
accompanied by daughter Chelsea. The president was saluted by three
howitzers, a military honor guard and a colorful display of
Nigerian drumming, dancing and chanting.
</P>
<P>
   Abuja is Nigeria's makeshift capital, begun in the 1970s and
never really completed during a cycle of oil booms and busts. Most
of the government business is still in the coastal city of Lagos,
but officials privately conceded that city was considered too
insecure for a presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's visit is designed to be a tribute to a budding
democracy and increased freedoms here, westerners in Abuja said
last week that scores of homeless people were rounded up and bused
out of the city for the duration of the presidential trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit is the first by an American president since
Jimmy Carter. Obasanjo was the leader of Nigeria then as well, but
it was a government run by the military. In the interim Nigeria has
suffered through a series of benign or brutal dictatorships, some
more disastrous to the economy than others. Among the victims of
those regimes was Obasanjo himself, who spent three years in prison
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, power was seized by defense minister Sani Abacha, whose
rule led to widespread human rights abuses and a deep estrangement
with the United States, which including travel sanctions, a ban on
arms sales and a reduction of U.S. economic aid to only $7 million,
about six cents per Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha died of an apparent heart attack in 1998, opening the
door to the democratic election of Obasanjo last year which Clinton
is here to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Clinton is to visit a village to see how the vast
majority of rural Nigerians live. He will meet with health workers,
school officials and a tribal chief, and is expected to announce
details of enhancements to the $109 million in annual U.S. aid to
Nigeria for education and to combat infectious diseases, especially
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, unlike some African nations, has embraced a U.S. call
to begin a campaign against HIV infection which afflicts 600,000 of
Nigeria's estimated 114 million people and at least 11 million on
the continent. &QL;

HUDSON RIVER KAYAK EXCURSIONS OFFER VIEWS, EXERCISE AND OCCASIONAL
THRILLS  
 (JOURNAL) 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jessica Sung clutched the chain-link gate and stared
at the river. About a dozen people were putting kayaks into the
water at Pier 26 in TriBeCa. The air was crisp, the skies blue. All
this had inspired Sung to get up early on a Saturday morning, but
not early enough.
</P>
<P>
   Her face pressed against the gate, she pleaded with the river
guide to let her join the group.
</P>
<P>
   The guide, John Nocera, glared at her. People always did this.
They arrived late, after the gate was shut at 8 a.m., and expected
to be taken on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been kayaking before?'' he asked Sung and her friend,
Metta Murdaya.
</P>
<P>
   The two young women looked at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long trip,'' Nocera said. ``We go to the Statue of
Liberty and back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been white-water rafting,'' Sung said. ``Does that
count?''
</P>
<P>
   Nocera sighed in exasperation. But there were still two open
slots, and he was in a generous mood. He unlocked the gate and told
the women to dump their belongings in a locker, fill up bottles of
water and put on life vests. Then he asked them to sign a sheet of
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says that if you drown, you can't sue us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so began another paddling trip on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The excursions are run by volunteers from the Downtown
Boathouse, a building on Pier 26 that houses dozens of kayaks
belonging to paddlers in New York. Few would mistake the Hudson for
the coastline of Baja or the rapids of Nepal. But every weekend
morning from May to September, weather permitting, experienced
kayakers lead 14 people on a three-hour excursion across its
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the tides, they head to Liberty Island or up-river
to the USS Intrepid, docked near 46th Street.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen people sometimes show up for the 14
vacancies. After word spread about the trips, which began in 1995,
some people started lining up as early as 5:30 a.m. Fisticuffs
broke out a few times. So last year, the boathouse started a
lottery system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most difficult part of the trip,'' said Tim Gamble,
secretary of the boathouse. ``People get upset. There's high
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so Saturday morning, Aug. 19. No more than 14 turned out,
and of those, most had paddled before.
</P>
<P>
   The group bobbing in the river included two photographers, a
chef and a tourist from San Antonio, Texas. Water lapped the sides
of their boats, sometimes splashing inside. Every now and then, it
resembled dirty dishwater; smelled that way, too, only saltier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple things you should watch out for,'' yelled
Nocera, a litigation lawyer. ``Piers, ferries and speedboats. And
if you fall into the water, always hold onto your paddle, because
you'll need a way to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The kayakers' hands curled tighter around their paddles, and
they began following Nocera, like ducklings, across the Hudson.
Their arms stroked madly. Water splashed into their faces and sweat
ran down their brows. The current helped push them toward Liberty
Island without threatening to overturn the boats.
</P>
<P>
   Near the New Jersey shore, they paused to let a Circle Line
ferry glide past. Its green-and-white hull dwarfed the kayakers.
Sitting in the kayak felt a little like being an ant on a floating
leaf. Speedboats raced up and down, though none came close to the
paddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy with a couple of daiquiris in him comes by, you're
dead meat,'' John Staples, a boathouse volunteer, warned a
straggler.
</P>
<P>
   The current incarnation of the Downtown Boathouse was founded in
1995, when a dozen or so kayakers heard that city and state
transportation departments had condemned the pier. They persuaded
the agencies to lend it to them on the conditions that they would
clean it up and provide free kayaking for the public.
</P>
<P>
   That meant having kayaks on hand for people to take out for
half-hour runs and for leading trips along the Hudson. The number
of people using the 30 or so public boats each summer has surged,
from 100 in 1995 to 11,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although few mishaps have occurred on the kayak trips,
Christopher Howard, one of the founding guides, recalled a
particularly bad excursion in 1997. As paddlers neared Ellis
Island, a small Cessna airplane plummeted from the sky into the
Hudson, right behind them. One woman burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Howard ended up towing the weakest paddler back to shore and
leading the group a quarter-mile out of the way to avoid the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nocera's trip, no plane ditched into the Hudson near the
kayakers, nor were there any perfect storms.
</P>
<P>
   The kayakers rested in the water in the shadow of Lady Liberty.
Seeing her and the Manhattan skyline from this perspective was like
looking at them with virgin eyes. The kayakers paddled around the
island, beneath a low bridge and into a sheltered cove on the New
Jersey shore, where they clambered out of the boats.
</P>
<P>
   A few said they were grateful they had gotten this far. Their
muscles burned. They gulped down bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some points, it's hard work,'' said Liz Maxwell. ``My
shoulders are a little sore; my arms are a little sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sung, the woman who had pleaded at the gate, held her glasses up
to the sun. They were splattered with brown muck. It looked like
the kind of dirt that would require industrial-strength cleanser.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trip seems like an insider thing,'' she said to her
friend, Murdaya.
</P>
<P>
   ``What determines insider?'' Murdaya asked. ``If it's not in the
tourist books?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess so,'' Sung said. ``Or if it's not in the newspaper.''

MINOR LEAGUE BALL IN QUEENS   HAS EVERYTHING BUT CROWDS
</HEADLINE>
  (Also filed in `s' category) 
 By   SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before 7 p.m. on Friday, George Perez,
right-handed pitcher for the Queens Kings, a minor league baseball
team playing in what was, until recently, an exclusively major
league town, strolled into the team's ballpark looking a little
forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   He was itching to play, but by now he had to wonder: how many
fans would be watching?
</P>
<P>
   ``The attendance has been kind of poor,'' said Perez, before
heading for the dugout. ``But we're new and we didn't know what to
expect. We came ready to play, and whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Friday night's game, a 9-4 win over the
Pittsfield Mets, drew a spirited crowd of 1,390, a respectable
turnout for a first-year team with a record of 38-26 that has
struggled to attract fans.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators were clustered in small groups across the team's
temporary 3,500-seat stadium, on the campus of St. John's
University in a residential section of Jamaica, N.Y., in Queens
County. Still, there were rows of empty stands, and the parking lot
was less than half full.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish there was a better environment fan-wise,'' said Frank
Insalco, a New York City police officer who lives in Queens and
attended his first minor league game Friday night with his son and
daughter. ``But I make my own fun, and at this level, it's pure
baseball. You don't need that Shea Stadium, Yankee Stadium
spectacle. You're here to watch baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance, as low as 600 fans on some nights, has hovered at an
average of 930, ranking the team last in attendance among the 14
Class A clubs in the New York-Penn League, according to latest
figures from the Minor League Baseball Association.
</P>
<P>
   (The Staten Island Yankees, a club in the same league as the
Kings that started its first season last year, has drawn more fans;
crowds have averaged 2,800 so far this season.)
</P>
<P>
   The sparse attendance in Queens came on the same week that the
city broke ground on a 6,500-seat ballpark in Coney Island for a
minor-league Mets franchise that next season will replace the
Queens Kings, now an affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The
Pittsfield Mets franchise will move to Brooklyn, and the Queens
Kings will no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Coney Island stadium is expected to cost the city $39
million and is fiercely opposed by the Brooklyn borough president,
but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has defended it and a $71 million minor
league ballpark under construction in Staten Island, saying they
will help the economy of the two boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and members of the Queens Kings insist the low
turnout at St. John's is not an indication of the city's appetite
for minor league baseball. At the Coney Island groundbreaking,
Giuliani said that once the Mets farm team has a home in the city,
rivalry between it and the Staten Island Yankees would ``fuel
attendance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kings' season began with a series of problems, the biggest
of them involving finding a field. At first, the city planned to
build a temporary ball park in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, but a
lawsuit and political opposition thwarted that idea. The city then
turned to St. John's, but residents and civic groups in the area
also sued to block the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens lawsuit is still pending, but the case is likely moot
with the plan for the Coney Island stadium well underway. And with
attendance being lower than expected, residents' worst fears _
traffic and noise overrunning the quiet nearby neighborhood of
Jamaica Estates _ were not realized. The lights and loudspeaker
from the stadium have annoyed residents, but life around the
stadium on game nights has been a lot quieter than people expected,
several residents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully, for whatever reason, the team hasn't drawn well,''
said Barry Weinberg, a dentist who lives near the stadium and is
chairman of the Jamaica Estates Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could have happened could have been a complete
disaster.''

ANALYSIS: FOR SOME, LESS (CHOICE) MAY BE MORE AFTER RECENT
DEREGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the last 20 years, a free-market theories
resurged in America that said people would be happier and better
off if they were all continually shopping for the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, according to laissez faire theories, should be free
from the business monopolies and the dictates of bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   So airlines were deregulated, and telephone companies. And then
the Internet arrived, giving people the ability to choose from
among 10 different sellers of the same merchandise. The bull market
on Wall Street brought 5,000 mutual funds vying for attention.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of people, especially in New York and
California, the doctrine of the sovereign consumer has come into
question this summer around a commodity that most had taken
completely for granted: electricity. A recently deregulated energy
market that was supposed to increase choices and reduce prices has,
for most residents, done nothing of the kind.
</P>
<P>
   Some community leaders and politicians, calling for
investigations and caps on rising electricity bills _ up 30 percent
to 40 percent from those of last August in some areas _ have
denounced energy deregulation as either a failure or a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Some social scientists say that the anxiety over energy is
exposing something even deeper in human behavior. At a time when
protesters have rampaged in Seattle and Washington against chain
stores and global branding, and prominent social critics have
denounced the intrusion of endless choice into every corner of life
_ a phenomenon that Barry Schwartz, a psychologist at
Pennsylvania's Swarthmore College, calls ``the tyranny of freedom''
_ the public's worries about electricity may have more to say about
human nature than about kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, this alternative theory says, there is a point at which
people no longer wish to be autonomous, rational consumers at all.
Maybe there are some transactions about which they would just as
soon delegate their thinking and protection, as New Yorkers did
when Consolidated Edison was the only electricity provider in town
and government was assigned to make sure the company played by
government rules. Maybe when it comes to electricity, a mysterious
and dangerous thing that is also the foundation of modern living,
Americans are just a little afraid to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we trusted that state regulators who were
appointed by our elected officials were watching out for us, which
may or may not have been true,'' said Edward Smeloff, a former
utility industry official who runs a research group on electricity
at Pace University in New York. ``The new model is, `Figure it out
for yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists and energy industry experts say that the sense
of powerlessness and confusion that many people feel is perhaps as
much a source of anxiety and anger as higher electricity bills. The
players have all changed and no one really seems to be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The old Brooklyn Union Gas Co., for example, still remembered by
many New York residents for the fuzzy, feel-good images of its
advertising, has become the cool and metallic-sounding KeySpan
Energy. The old Con Ed, on the other hand, was like a crotchety
grandfather who sometimes had to be prodded and yelled at, but who
nonetheless presided over the system.
</P>
<P>
   The company now throws up its hands and says it is not
responsible for recent price increases; Con Ed's wires are simply a
delivery mechanism for the unregulated corporations that own
generating plants, Con Ed's chairman said at a recent hearing at
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion poll-takers say that anxiety about deregulation may also
have something to do with a contradiction in the American psyche
that they say has emerged in recent years, a contradiction about
what people really want. Surveys conducted by Yankelovich Partners,
a research and consulting firm based in Norwalk, Conn., have said,
for example, that a majority of people want more control over the
details of their lives, but a majority also want to simplify their
lives, a result that Barbara Caplan, a partner at the firm, has
called ``the paradox of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Deregulated energy arrived right in the middle of those
conflicting goals. Because only a handful of energy competitors
have been attracted into the New York market, most people still do
not have much choice in their electricity providers, and yet it
seems more complicated than ever, as well as more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, some researchers say, may be a result of timing.
People have had experience with deregulation, and they have seen
that it did not always unfold to their benefit. The hub-and-spoke
system developed by the airline industry, for example, has given
airlines near-monopoly power at many airports around the country,
resulting in less competition, not more. Consumers have also seen
that although tools like the Internet have made buyers more
powerful in getting good prices, corporations on the other side of
the transaction have become more powerful, too, in gathering
information about consumers and their buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, you went into an auto dealership and had to
negotiate to buy a car, but only the corporate side had knowledge
of what the real costs were,'' said Mark Gillenson, a professor of
management information systems at the University of Memphis. ``Now
you go into the Internet, and lots of places will give you that
information for free.'' On the other hand, Gillenson said, the data
that corporations are collecting about people are creating what the
old car dealer could never have imagined either: knowledge about
what people want before they even ask.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind all those forces, some psychologists say, is the
growing sense that people are simply being asked to decide too
much. Economic deregulation has accompanied what may be called
social deregulation, as issues that were not even considered
decisions in the past have become issues of conscious choice, as,
for example, whether to get married and have children.
</P>
<P>
   And the more choices there are, the more it might seem possible
to achieve an ideal result in every case, leading to a
treadmill-like behavior for people who continually change their
long-distance telephone service as they endlessly seek an
incremental price advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over what domains in life are you supposed to have control?''
said Swarthmore's Schwartz. ``Nobody gets depressed when you can't
control the weather, and years ago nobody got depressed because
they couldn't control your telecommunications or electricity either
because those things couldn't be controlled,'' he said. ``But now
you can, or you're told that you can, and so you're going to be
continually frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   And electricity is also just different. Unlike a telephone call,
or an airline ticket, nobody ever really wants to buy electricity
itself _ rather people buy its result: cold beer in the
refrigerator, light to read by. By the standards of American
marketing, it is barely a product at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to make choices about clothes and restaurants and
what houses they live in, but a lot of us would rather not be
bothered with having to make a choice about electricity,'' said
Wendy Kaminer, a public policy fellow at the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's not a desire to be
disempowered,'' Kaminer said, ``it's a desire not to be bothered.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some experts think that the long bull market for stocks
has made people forget a fundamental about how laissez faire
markets work: they are genuinely fair only over the long run, while
at any given time, there are likely to be as many losers as
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation and privatization were sold implicitly on the
assumption that everybody can win from this, but I'm hard-pressed
to find an example in the real world where that has happened,''
said Willis Emmons, a professor in the strategy, public policy and
ethics department at Georgetown University's business school. Right
now, Emmons said, ``maybe somebody is winning, but it isn't the
consumer.''

EDITORIAL: BUY LOW, SELL HIGH, IN DECIMALS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 24 brokers signed an agreement to trade with one
another beneath a buttonwood tree outside 68 Wall Street in 1792,
the New York Stock Exchange has quoted all stock prices in
fractions. On Monday, that will change.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that should prove beneficial to consumers, the NYSE is
going decimal. This week, seven of its listed companies will be
quoted in actual dollars and cents, the same way groceries are
priced. A second wave of 52 companies will be switched in late
September. The American Stock Exchange is starting its own trial
with six issues. The Securities and Exchange Commission has
required that all U.S. stocks be traded in decimals by April. No
longer will investors have to scratch their heads while figuring
out how much they have made when their stocks rise in value from,
say, 17 3/16 to 17 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   The move to dollars-and-cents pricing should help further
demystify the stock market in the public eye. This newspaper's
business section, as of last week, provides stock quotes in
decimals. Many brokerage firms have also made the decimal
transition in the statements sent to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most commodities were once priced in fractions, reflecting the
influence of the Spanish empire on global trade in the 17th
century. Spanish coins were hammered into eighths, and ``pieces of
eight'' were a form of global currency. The convention stuck in
financial markets, long after the sun had set on the Spanish
empire. But it stuck longest in the United States. All other major
financial markets have gone decimal.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has not been eager to give up its cherished
fractions. The market's middlemen make their living on the spread,
the difference between a stock's best bid and ask price. Because
NYSE stocks move in sixteenths, the narrowest possible spread on a
NYSE stock is 6.25 cents, or one-sixteenth of a dollar. With prices
in dollars and cents, buyers and sellers can presumably set spreads
lower than that.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC-mandated shift to decimals poses a challenge to the
industry's computing power, explaining the need for a gradual
transition. But in this era of peripatetic capital, the shift will
help American markets remain globally competitive.

EDITORIAL: SEASON OF THE BOUNCE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 27:
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential campaign has produced an unusually intense
post-convention period. The tradition that the nominees spend a few
sleepy weeks resting before Labor Day seems a thing of the distant
past, thanks to an unusual volatility in the polls and increasingly
heated exchanges between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush. Even Gore has got to be a little surprised at the way he has
been lifted in voter surveys since the Democrats adjourned their
convention. After a smooth run-up to the Republican convention,
Bush has been looking defensive and has even been publicly
self-critical about his problems in making the case for his huge
tax cuts. The candidates are mischievously making feints into each
other's friendly territory _ Gore in Florida and Bush in several
states carried by the Democrats in recent elections. All told, the
voters have reason to believe both men's predictions that this will
wind up as a tough, tight race.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' fortunes and the lead in the polls are likely to
change several times before the election. But the most striking
feature of the past 10 days has been the ``bounce'' experienced by
Gore after his selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as a running mate
and after a spirited convention in Los Angeles. Many polls show him
slightly ahead of Bush for the first time. Some independent voters
have swung to his side, and Gore increased his support among
Democrats to levels that are traditional, suggesting that the party
faithful may have come home. He has also strengthened his ratings
as a convincing leader, whereas before voters rated Bush more
highly on leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also had some success in switching the campaign focus
to budget issues and away from the personality terrain that favors
Bush. The vice president has done an effective job in attacking the
Bush tax cut as a giveaway to the wealthy. Last week, Bush trotted
out some low- to middle-income taxpayers whose federal tax bills
would be cut by as much as three-quarters. But these individual
cases do not erase Gore's basic point that the overall distribution
of the Bush plan is toward the most wealthy taxpayers. Bush's case
was not helped by his difficulty in getting his numbers straight.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's stands on health, schools and the
environment are also more favored by voters. But the Texas governor
may still do damage with his charge that under the Democrats, the
military has deteriorated _ an echo of the chimerical ``missile
gap'' raised by John F. Kennedy in 1960. He also sought to show a
statesmanlike side by meeting on Friday with Vicente Fox, the
president-elect of Mexico, and calling for improved ties with Latin
America. Gore had a good response on the military issue, however,
noting that military spending had begun declining when Dick Cheney,
Bush's running mate, was defense secretary. Wearing his veteran's
cap, Gore noted that he (by implication, unlike Bush) had
volunteered for Vietnam, and he condemned the governor's talk of
American weakness as sending a dangerous signal to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign's challenge remains to escape the shadow of
President Clinton and the scandals of the last several years.
Knowing this, Bush's strategists are sorting out their options as
to how to attack on the character issue. On Bush's order, the
Republicans withdrew a television ad tying Gore directly to
Clinton's problem with telling the truth. They apparently feared
the ad might create a backlash. But Bush will continue to argue
that most Americans want to restore ``honor and dignity'' to the
White House by a total change of administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides also indicate that the governor plans to attack Gore
over the 1996 Democratic fund-raising scandals. That issue came
into the news last week when Attorney General Janet Reno decided
not to seek appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate
Gore's denials that he had been aware of fund-raising
irregularities in that campaign. Reno's repeated refusal to bring
in an independent prosecutor on the fund-raising issue has amounted
to a disgraceful dereliction of duty. But as this page said two
months ago, installing a special prosecutor at the height of the
campaign would disrupt the electoral process. Since Gore has
released all his deposition statements on this matter, voters can
decide how to judge him, and Bush is fully entitled to raise this
issue throughout the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Any presidential election comes down to a complex mix of issues,
performance records and personality. But it is still the issues
that offer the biggest contrast between these two men. A race
decided on what to do with the surplus, how to manage American
military strength and on social concerns like the environment,
abortion rights, guns, schools and poverty could lay the groundwork
for progress, no matter who wins.

ENQVIST ADVANCES TO HAMLET CUP FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ In the space of a very few minutes at the
beginning of his Hamlet Cup semifinal match against Arnaud Clement
Saturday, Thomas Enqvist found himself trailing the flashy young
Frenchman, 0-3, 0-30. Was the third-seeded Enqvist concerned?
Worried? Nervous?
</P>
<P>
   He did not look it, and two points later, a glance at the board
displaying service speed showed why, as the first of Enqvist's aces
in the match was clocked at 125 mph. Enqvist, a 26-year-old Swede,
held serve to get on the board, won his second game with four
straight aces and, after breaking back in the seventh game,
dominated in the tiebreaker with his 12th and 13th aces of the
match.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was all but over for the 15th-seeded Clement, who
had beaten Michael Chang in straight sets Friday evening to reach
the semifinal. Enqvist needed only one more ace in the second set
to cruise to Sunday's final with a 7-6 (2), 6-1 victory that took
only 1 hour 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making those serves comes with a lot of confidence,'' said
Enqvist, who will face the winner of Saturday night's other
semifinal between his countryman, the No. 1-seeded and defending
champion Magnus Norman, and No. 11 Richard Krajicek of the
Netherlands. ``I think even had I lost that tiebreaker, I had
confidence I would win. It's easy to relax and play your best
tennis when you're confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Enqvist has been playing that way this week, dropping
not a set as he reached the semifinals for the second time.
Enqvist, who lost to Patrick Rafter in the Hamlet Cup semifinals in
1997 and reached the quarterfinals last year, defeated Paul
Goldstein, 6-2, 6-3; Nicolas Massu, 6-3, 6-2; and 12th-seeded
Fabrice Santoro, 7-6 (4), 6-4, in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's match started a little like yesterday's,'' said
Enqvist, who also fell behind by 0-3 on Friday. ``It was a tough
first set.''
</P>
<P>
   Enqvist said he did not know if Clement got tired, but he felt a
difference in the second set when Clement was serving. ``I was able
to take control of the point easier,'' Enqvist said. `Both he and
Santoro are very difficult to come to the net against.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement said that ``at the start I was able to break his rhythm,
throw in some moonballs, but I could only slow him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he faced a break point,'' Clement added, ``he'd
serve incredibly well.''
</P>
<P>
   Enqvist, who is 41-16 in singles matches this year _ and 29-8 on
hard courts _ said Sunday's final would be tough whether he faced
Norman or Krajicek. And no matter what happens in the championship,
Enqvist said, he was confident he would have a good run at the U.S.
Open, which begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year's Open is pretty open,'' said Enqvist, who
is seeded No. 7 in it. ``All the top players think they have a very
very good chance to win. You have to be prepared to play well from
the first point on. I think I am playing well now and I am
prepared.''

 &HT;    Florida's Palmer has no regrets
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The jersey had hardly cooled from
quarterback Danny Wuerffel's body heat when the freshman requested
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse James Palmer, the eldest of three brothers named after
Western gunslingers, had played in No. 7 most of his life, he said.
He'd always planned to continue that tradition in college. It
wasn't pressure that Wuerffel, the Heisman Trophy winner who'd
taken the Gators to their first national championship just days
before, wore the same number.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' Palmer said, ``it's more
coincidence than anything that Danny wore it before I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years after asking for Wuerffel's jersey _
essentially seeking constant comparison to his coach's most beloved
player _ Palmer doesn't regret the decision or the one that brought
him to Florida for a roller coaster of a career so far.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't change anything, he said, even though he begins his
senior season Saturday against Ball State with only a loose hold on
the starting job and a talented freshman haunting him from the
third spot on the depth chart. Coach Steve Spurrier has called it
Palmer's job to lose, but expectations are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I told Jesse,'' Spurrier said. ``He's got to play
better than he ever has for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing better than last season should be a snap. He started
twice, threw five interceptions and just two touchdowns and won
just one of those games. He was better in 1998, starting six games
and building the nation's third-best pass efficiency rating
(173.87) before a broken collarbone ended his season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he expects to start every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel I'm the best player. I'm the best quarterback for
this team,'' Palmer said. ``But what it comes down to is what coach
thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring that out isn't always easy, but it can't be much harder
than the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer came to UF as a phenom from Nepean, Ontario, near Ottawa.
He enjoyed many of the same compliments from Spurrier as freshman
Brock Berlin is getting this year. Like Berlin, he committed early,
graduated from high school in December and enrolled at UF in
January.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled first with culture shock, differences in food,
clothes and, most significantly, language. He even saw a speech
therapist for help changing his pronunciation of ''o'' and ''u'' so
he could say ``hut, hut'' instead of ``hoot, hoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the players didn't understand his accent, but it goes
two ways,'' said Sue Palmer, his mom. ``A lot of times, players
would talk to him and he'd nod his head but wouldn't have a clue
what they were saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The accent and his naturally rapid-fire speech combined for
trouble in the huddle when he was calling plays, particularly as
the clock wound down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse's problem was that he would get excited. He'd let the
moment catch him,'' tight end Kirk Wells said. ``He knew what he
wanted to say, but he wanted to get out of the huddle and onto the
line and run the play. He'd run his words together.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in pace with a slow-ticking metronome helped him slow
down and improve his diction, said Bill Palmer, his father. Since
then, teammates have learned to listen and ask questions when they
don't understand. Most say it isn't a problem anymore, and in
regular conversation, Palmer's accent is rarely detectable although
he still talks quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had less control over last year's troubles, when Spurrier
gave the starting job to Doug Johnson. Palmer thought he might sit
out and save a year of eligibility, but the offense struggled and
Spurrier went _ unsuccessfully _ to the backup. Johnson clashed
with Spurrier and didn't get along with Palmer, creating what
Palmer called a ``cold war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone makes a big deal of it, but we were just two
teammates who happened to be guys with clashing personalities,''
Palmer said. ``Doug and I didn't have that chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Palmer, a former linebacker in the CFL who coached his son
through high school, noticed difficulties too. Palmer's ability to
get along with Spurrier, despite his visor-throwing rampages, while
Johnson feuded with Spurrier probably didn't help the players'
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug was very extroverted and more aggressive in nature than
Jesse,'' Bill Palmer said. ``Jesse's more laid-back, quiet. I think
the tensions between the two of them might not have been so bad had
they not been placed in arguably the most competitive position in
college football. They might have been better friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it still leaves Palmer just one season to add his
own story to the legend of No. 7. Some teammates admit they're
rooting for Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job before he got injured,'' fullback Rod
Frazier said. ``I just want to see him do that again, prove
everybody wrong, prove that he can lead this team. There is no
question he is the quarterback of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Kenyatta Walker has similar faith in the player who
organized the offense's summertime workouts, knows the plays well
and carries himself with the confidence a starting quarterback
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jesse's going to do good. As long as he doesn't get to
stuttering in the huddle,'' Walker said, smiling, ``he'll be all
right.''

President Ken''? The joking perhaps was inevitable when the
nonprofit group the White House Project teamed up recently with
Mattel and Girls' Inc. to launch a President Barbie doll. With a
politically correct helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand
nuclear war and an unintentionally funny advisory on the back of
her box _ ``Podium not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this
Leader of the Free (Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous
light. But many people aren't laughing these days when the subject
turns to a woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican and
Democratic conventions, and both George W. Bush and Al Gore
reportedly included a woman on their ``short list'' of potential
running mates (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes

Lopez, 15, said she was willing to do anything if she could just
get to the United States. ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take
care of babies,'' the Salvadoran teenager said earnestly, her eyes
as wide as saucers. But Lopez never made to Houston or El Paso, her
dream cities. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all teen-age
girls _ ended up in a jail cell here for undocumented migrants
crossing into Mexico's southernmost Chiapas state. While U.S.
officials conduct their own battle to stem illegal crossings,
Mexican officials here say they've seen a 30 percent increase over
last year in the number of undocumented immigrants they're catching
along the southern border with Guatemala. Although they've taken
South Americans into custody, too, the vast majority detained are
Central Americans bound for the United States. An increasing number
appear to be willing to take perilous journeys to avoid capture,
suffocating in cargo trailers or drowning at sea. Those captured
often say they're looking for a way out of poverty that hasn't

section from the Dayton Daily News:FALLSTYLE-INTRO _ DAYTON, Ohio _
Whatever happened to good manners? It's a question that's been
asked often in recent years. About the time we all fell in love
with blue jeans and sweats, it seems we stopped minding our P's and

one of those who mourns the loss, take heart. If this year's fall
fashions are any indication, significant changes are in store.

<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ As Canada's health department
looks this fall for a reliable supplier of almost 1 million
marijuana cigarettes for clinical trials, some Canadians say they
need to look no farther than ``British Colombia,'' where relaxed
attitudes about smoking marijuana have helped turn the province
into a major North American producer for some of the drug's
strongest strains.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexicans can grow bales of the stuff on plantations, cold
weather Canadians have genetically tweaked their indoor plants to
reach potencies of 10 times the levels of the Woodstock-era grass,
putting it on a par with prized Jamaican weed.
</P>
<P>
   Now marijuana is estimated to be a $1 billion-a-year export
here, right behind lumber and tourism as the leading business in
British Columbia. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police estimate that
there are about 9,000 ``grow operations'' in the Vancouver area.
Across the bay from here, in the city of Nanaimo, the Mounties
estimate that there are 1,000 residential grow operations, about
one every two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my neighborhood, it's one house in 10,'' said Chris, a
40-year-old grower. ``I walk around late at night, after work, and
I can smell it, from the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, marijuana turns up in the oddest places. In May, a
newspaper here reported that a man had been caught growing plants
in a garage of a house he rented from the attorney general of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, two Canadian men wearing military uniforms were
arrested in Blaine, Wash., after crossing the border in two
Canadian military trucks: The U.S. Customs Service said one truck
was loaded with five duffel bags, containing 240 pounds of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of marijuana growing stems from many factors.
</P>
<P>
   Judges, mirroring local public opinion, tend to give lenient
punishments. An arrest for growing 500 plants, the average size of
a bust here, often yields an $800 fine _ compared with a short
prison sentence in California or a life sentence in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid my partner's fine, $500, with money from the business,
it's a business,'' said Buck, an engaging 30-year-old in a polo
shirt. He said he talked his way out of any charges when a
policeman his age discovered his grow operation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the local newspaper, The Vancouver Sun, found that of
112 people convicted here of growing marijuana in the late 1990s,
one quarter served no jail time and paid no fines, and that 58
percent paid fines of less than $1,800. Fewer than one in seven
served any jail time.
</P>
<P>
   With prices for ``B.C. Bud'' double on the American side of the
border, marijuana is indeed lucrative in a province with some of
North America's highest tax rates, stagnant economic growth, and
high unemployment among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver also offers the technical support a serious grower
needs. With cultivators here approaching their indoor marijuana
farming with the solemnity of Japanese bonsai gardeners, the number
of stores specializing in hydroponic gardening equipment mushroomed
in Vancouver during the 1990s, from three to 30. Growing plants
without soil, in a mix of rock pellets and nutrient-rich water,
requires an array of electric gadgets _ from 1,000-watt lamps to
cooling systems to special systems that neutralize telltale odors
before ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   At one store, Jon's Plant Factory, the offerings do not seem
geared to growing hydroponic tomatoes. In the electronic section,
there is a $1,400 sophisticated pager, sort of an electronic plant
sitter that can alert the long distance gardener of system failures
_ water pumps, air fans, fertilizer drips _ even if an intruder has
opened a window or a door.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to complex growing systems, Chris, an experienced
electrician and plumber, said during a store tour: ``Some people
will sell their feeding schedules for $6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper technical support comes from Marc Emery, Canada's
leading cannabis capitalist. Emery offers 350 varieties of
marijuana seeds through his Web site and publishes Cannabis
Culture, a magazine of gardening tips. Earlier this year, he
started two Internet media productions, Pot Radio and Pot-TV
Internetwork, a 24-hour online broadcast of marijuana news.
</P>
<P>
   For marijuana broadcasters like Emery, the news from Canada this
summer has been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   In separate rulings in late July, Ontario Court of Appeal judges
ruled against employee drug testing and invalidated Canada's law
against marijuana possession. In the latter case, Judge Marc
Rosenberg suspended his ruling for a year to give Parliament time
to rewrite the law. His ruling, however, immediately granted Terry
Parker, a 44-year-old Toronto man, the right to smoke marijuana to
help control his epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   With Parliament scheduled to return in September, Canada's two
national newspapers, The Globe and Mail and The National Post, have
editorialized in favor of decriminalizing marijuana for medical
uses. Anne McLellan, Canada's justice minister and a member of
Parliament for the governing Liberal Party, has said such
decriminalization ``is a legitimate question.''
</P>
<P>
   On that subject, Canadians, as usual, are cautiously looking at
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outright legalization would cause serious trouble with the
United States,'' The Globe and Mail editorialized after the Ontario
decision. Calling for decriminalization, a path favored by the
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the newspaper concluded:
``Therefore, Canada should follow its historical nature and take a
middle path.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey here in May for The Vancouver Sun, 56 percent of the
people agreed that provincial courts should ``ignore the Americans
and hand out sentences we think are appropriate.'' A virtually
identical percentage said that possession of marijuana should not
be a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   With 61 seriously-ill people authorized by Health Canada to
smoke marijuana for medicinal purposes, the government plans to
start clinical trials of marijuana next year.
</P>
<P>
   When smugglers are cornered at the border, the smart ones sprint
north. Even so, the border is lightly patrolled and few people are
caught, compared with the intensely watched U.S. border with
Mexico. In the federal fiscal year ending last September, the U.S.
Customs Service agents seized 50 times as much marijuana coming in
from Mexico, 988,310 pounds, as they seized coming in from Canada,
19,753 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans hope that if Canada decriminalizes marijuana
possession it would show the United States a different path.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some hope on our part that Canada and other foreign
countries can provide models to the U.S. for alternatives,'' said
Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center, a New
York-based drug policy center that provided much of the funding for
the lawsuit this summer that overturned Canada's possession law.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Vancouver police have raided marijuana growing
operations at twice the rate of last year. But they are careful to
publicize their raids as efforts to break up vicious Asian gangs,
to protect children from fires in houses with faulty wiring, or to
break up smuggling rings where hockey bags stuffed with marijuana
are traded for guns and hard drugs from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have houses burning down, we have explosions, we have
organized crime in our neighborhoods,'' said Sgt. Chuck Doucette,
the Mountie spokesman here. Noting that anonymous tips about grow
houses have flooded his office this year, he added: ``We cannot
keep up with the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, decriminalization for casual use seems to be a reality
here in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, hundreds of people gathered for a marijuana
``smoke-in'' on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery, five blocks
from the British Columbia premier's office. Vancouver police
ignored the event.

CLINTON COURTS EGYPTIAN LEADER AS TIME EBBS FOR PEACE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Adds remarks by Clinton from Nigeria and makes corrections
throughout) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After accusing Egypt of undermining the Camp David
summit meeting, the Clinton administration is now focusing on the
Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, as a key to finding a solution in
the Middle East, particularly on the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is due to see Mubarak in Cairo on Tuesday, and
will be working on ideas on the Jerusalem problem, as well as the
broader settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, a
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the Egyptians involved is key, and they want to be
involved,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Nigeria Saturday, President Clinton,
responding to questions, said he did not anticipate that his
meeting with Mubarak would yield a breakthrough, but said it was
``inconceivable'' to pursue peace in the region without his
support.
</P>
<P>
   The courting of the Egyptian leader as a central figure in the
peace effort comes as a last round of diplomacy unfolds before time
vanishes for a Middle East deal. The White House and the Israelis
view the end of September as effectively the last moment for
reconvening a Camp David-style summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with a sense of urgency, given the timetable
the parties have set for themselves,'' Clinton said. ``And we don't
underestimate the continuing difficulties, but I'm pleased they're
still working.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of September, the precarious political position of
the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, could worsen, and the onset
of Jewish religious holidays, which run from late September into
much of October, will make negotiations more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators say it will be more difficult for Clinton to be the
heavyweight mediator once the American presidential campaign is in
its final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House has said that Clinton would only
consider another summit meeting if the gaps between the parties
were small and there was little risk of failure. After meeting with
Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in New York in
September at the United Nations' Millennium Summit, Clinton expects
to have a better idea whether a new Mideast meeting would be
worthwhile, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived in Cairo Saturday to see Mubarak for a meeting in
which the administration hopes the Egyptian leader will lend Arafat
some cover for compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is one issue Arafat cannot act alone on,'' the
administration official said. ``And the Arab and Muslim countries
are very skittish.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Camp David meeting last month, Arafat insisted that
East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state. He
rejected proposals for shared sovereignty between Israelis and
Palestinians over the most contentious site, Temple Mount, known by
Muslims as Haram al Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of negotiating over how to share sovereignty in East
Jerusalem is a high-wire act for Arab leaders _ especially Mubarak
_ who have long feared major opposition to such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis said they were pleased that the Clinton administration
had brought Egypt onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that Egypt is key in giving Arafat a feeling
that there is a milieu out there for an agreement,'' an Israeli
official said.
</P>
<P>
   After the senior Israeli negotiator, Shlomo Ben Ami, met with
the Egyptians in Alexandria, Egypt, on Thursday, the Egyptian
foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said the idea of ``shared
sovereignty'' was a ``departure from international law and Egypt
cannot agree to that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Egypt ``is not negotiating with the Israelis over the
Palestinians, but trying to deal with the Israeli position and
bring it back to international law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moussa was quoted by Ben Ami as offering an idea of
``postponed sovereignty'' for the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said it still remained the
preference of the White House to wrap up a deal that included all
elements of disagreement between Arabs and Israelis _ Jerusalem,
the fate of refugees, the borders of a new Palestinian state, and
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Camp David meeting broke down last month,
a close aide to Clinton attacked Mubarak for flying to see the
royal family of Saudi Arabia during the last days of the meeting
and sending signals that a compromise on Jerusalem by Arafat would
be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House also appeared to recognize that it had not
done enough preparatory diplomacy with Arab leaders before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a general assessment that there was a technical
blunder by the administration in not properly consulting the
Egyptians before Camp David went sour,'' a senior Middle East
diplomat said.

   HOUSTON _ They traded clutch shots and dramatic moments into
overtime Saturday in a classic championship game that neither the
New York Liberty nor the Houston Comets deserved to lose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a sign in the raucous and adoring crowd summed up
the emotions around professional sports' latest dynasty: ``Coop! Is
that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper headed into retirement in glorious fashion as the
Comets won their fourth straight WNBA championship with a thrilling
79-73 victory over the gutsy and stunned Liberty at the Compaq
Center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who led all scorers with 31 points, drilled a 3-point
shot with 14.6 seconds left in regulation that tied the score at
64-64. Then she made two baskets in overtime and danced a tearful
and joyous farewell dance with her teammates at halfcourt.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The series appeared headed for a third and final game when Tari
Phillips made a strong move inside and hit a basket that put the
Liberty ahead by 64-61 with 31.8 seconds in regulation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But once again, the heroics belonged to the Comets, who are the
only champions in the WNBA's four-year history. For the third time,
they beat the Liberty in the finals and swept through their
two-of-three-game playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty made its final move with a 7-0 charge for a 49-48
lead with 6 minutes 20 seconds to play. Teresa Weatherspoon took
control, knocking down a 3-pointer and following with a jump shot.
Tamika Whitmore's two free throws finished the run and pushed these
teams toward another dramatic ending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Comets appeared to have the Liberty beaten midway
through the second half. But the Liberty _ behind by 9 points, on
the verge of being blown out _ made sure that the Comets would not
walk away with this title. Vickie Johnson started the rally with a
3-pointer to cut Houston's lead to 44-38.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty then switched strategies for the next few
possessions and worked hard at passing the ball inside to Phillips,
who scored two quick baskets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Comets held on, keeping the lead at 6 with Cooper
hitting a jumper and sinking two free throws, before the Liberty
put together its 7-0 run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty fell behind by 10 points and rallied to lead by 3
before Sheryl Swoopes' 3-point shot gave the Comets a 27-25
halftime lead. Swoopes, despite missing three minutes because of an
injury late in the first half, led Houston with 11 points, followed
by Cooper with 8. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shot 38.2 percent and outrebounded the Liberty by
17-10. The Liberty, which shot 36.4 percent thanks to a slow start,
was led in the first half by Crystal Robinson's 8 points and
Whitmore's 6. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 12-2, the Liberty suddenly looked capable of
spoiling the Comets' plan for a postgame celebration with the
sellout crowd of 16,285. The Liberty outscored the Comets by 19-6
and took a 21-18 lead on Robinson's 3-pointer shot from the left
corner. It was her second 3-pointer during the run and came after
Phillips made one of two free throws to tie the score. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the game continued to swing in the Liberty's
favor when Swoopes hurt her ankle after a collision with 5:45 to
play. She stayed on the floor for a few minutes while being
examined by trainers, before limping to the sideline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Houston (and the United States Olympic
basketball team) Swoopes' injury was not as bad as it appeared, and
she returned with 2:47 left _ just in time to drill a 3-pointer
that put the Comets ahead at halftime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The key basket was a fitting way for the WNBA's Most Valuable
Player to finish the half. Swoopes also led Houston's offense soon
after the opening tip. She scored the Comets' first 6 points on a
baseline drive, a jump shot and a steal followed by a layup as
Houston raced to a 10-2 lead with 14:46 to play in the first half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought we'd get back to this championship series,''
Swoopes said. ``No one expected us to win another one. That's going
to make this one a little more special for us.'' &QL;

AN EMISSARY WITH SKINNED KNEES
</HEADLINE>
  By SOPHIA HOLLANDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tony Hawk strode through an open Manhattan plaza with
a small smile, scanning the stone seats and wide spaces as a soft
California accent crept into his voice. He was searching for No
Skateboarding signs, the kind he sees all over back home, and
pointed out the worn blackened edges of steps signaling skaters who
had skimmed up and down.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no prohibitive sign. Hawk looked almost
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the kind of place that would have one, for
sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there had been one, would he have been bothered by the proof
of skating's outsider status?
</P>
<P>
   The most decorated skateboarder in the world shook his head,
grinning. ``That doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaters may no longer be considered outlaws _ an image, the
32-year-old Hawk said ruefully, that ``everyone wants to focus on''
_ but they are still bound together by the intimacy of a
subculture.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk has certainly had time to get used to the disapproving
stares and snide remarks. His professional career began at 14 and
continued until he retired from competition last year, although he
still skates regularly at demos. Slipping between roles of high
school nerd-social outcast and skateboarding superstar, Hawk won 10
world championships, invented 85 tricks and is the only person to
have completed the 900 trick _ a feat that demanded 13 years, and
the sacrifice of a straight spinal cord and one rib to complete 2
1/2 midair turns.
</P>
<P>
   The jacket of his new book, ``Hawk'' (Regan Books, 2000),
trumpets his victories and details visits to the MASH unit for
everything from a broken elbow and burst bursa sack to fractured
ribs and sprained ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk takes his emergence as the sport's laid-back, happily
married unofficial ambassador seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of media people know skateboarding is popular
and write `there are these punks with mohawks and blood on their
skateboards.' If I'm going to be doing this, I'm going to portray
it correctly. In the '80s it was, `you're going to wear this
ridiculous outfit and dye your hair.' They didn't know any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawk speaks of the need for unionization among skaters, to
ensure a minimum scale for exhibitions, the rights to video footage
and prize money that is more commensurate with revenues generated
by companies putting on an event. He also signed a three-year deal
with ESPN to announce skateboarding contests and runs his own
company, one of the few things, he said, skateboarding did not
prepare him for.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from how he began the first 10 years of his
life: Attacking his nanny at 18 months by throwing objects as hard
as he could at her back, being expelled from preschool, throwing
violent tantrums if he was losing at board games or didn't get
enough ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the terrible 2s that just kept on going,'' he said.
``My parents' friends would come over and say, `Your kid's a
nightmare.'''
</P>
<P>
   But one day, not long after he had started skating, Hawk's
mother asked him to clean up the dishes, more of a rhetorical
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She stared at him in astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   Skating provided an outlet where Hawk channeled his ferocious
stream of energy into landing tricks, and competing in contests,
which provided him with a place where he was completely in control.
</P>
<P>
   But he was too skinny for the rented equipment, forced to wear
smelly elbow pads on his knees and a helmet that rattled around his
head. He was knocked unconscious twice, and cracked his two front
teeth in half. His clothes and skin were torn to shreds, his shoes
held together with duct tape. When he was 11 a doctor accused his
parents of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never enough to make me want to quit,'' Hawk said. ``I
still don't really mind walking around with bruises. It's just a
part of life. With everything else I was doing, I never really felt
I was progressing that much. In skating I felt like I got better
every single time. I liked that it was totally up to me. No one was
telling me to go practice. In basketball you can do well, but
everyone else does terrible and you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was told during his sophomore year in high school by his
careers teacher that he would never succeed, Hawk was making
between $40,000 and $50,000 a year on the professional circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that I took a hobby that I did as a kid and
built my life and career around it ... ,'' Hawk said, trailing off.
``I just wanted to keep getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, skating through one backyard ramp, skateboarding
park and No Skateboarding sign at a time.
</P>
<P>

A GOOD START COULD BRING SCHUMACHER A STRONG FINISH
</HEADLINE>
  By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium _ Michael Schumacher's long,
humiliating fall from grace with Ferrari's fans could end at
Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, one of the driver's luckiest,
and favorite tracks. Provided he passes through the first corner
intact.
</P>
<P>
   In his last three races, Schumacher lost everything before the
first corner after the start. In Austria and Germany, his poor
starts knocked him off the track and out of the race. In Hungary,
although on the pole, he let Mika Hakkinen slip past at the first
corner, essentially handing the Finn both the victory and the lead
in the drivers' series.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari's Italian fans are not happy. Two months ago, after the
Canadian Grand Prix, Schumacher held a 24-point lead over Hakkinen,
his biggest rival of the last two years. But after scoring points
at only one of the last four races, Schumacher now lies two points
behind Hakkinen with only five races left.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Italian fans usually blame poor results on the
team rather than on the driver, they are now beginning to criticize
Schumacher for his poor starts.
</P>
<P>
   At Spa this weekend Schumacher tried to defend himself, saying,
``I did quite good starts already this year but you can't always do
them.'' He added that people tend to look for trends in one's
driving ``rather than doing a proper analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of his starts from the front of the grid reveals
what may well be the German driver's Achilles' heel. Schumacher
earned only 10 of his 40 victories from his 28 career pole
positions. But he won 15 of the 25 races that he started from
second position, and the other 15 victories from the 84 races where
he started beyond the front row.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a bit of luck involved,'' Schumacher said.
``Because you have a lot of horsepower available, you have a fairly
small clutch and a lot of heat, so a lot of things can go wrong
during a start, and it's a fine edge to get right.''
</P>
<P>
   But his pole position failures have come at some of the most
crucial moments. In the championship-deciding race at the Japanese
Grand Prix in 1998, Schumacher stalled the car while on the pole
and had to start from the back of grid while Hakkinen, who
qualified second on the grid, inherited Schumacher's pole, and won
the race and the title.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Schumacher's race start statistics from the front
of the grid are getting worse. Since the beginning of the 1998
season he has had 11 pole positions and only two victories from
those poles. And of those two victories, he made a bad start in one
of them _ at Imola in 1998 _ and only succeeded in leading from the
start through the first corner and winning the race in Canada this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Brawn, Ferrari's technical director, acknowledged that the
team was beginning to feel the problem: ``We have to get ourselves
out of that trough with Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his problem may be the pressure a driver undergoes
driving for the sport's most legendary team, which is more closely
scrutinized by the Italian fans and media than probably any other
team is by its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being at Ferrari when you are competitive is fantastic, but
when you are not, it's really difficult,'' said Alain Prost at Spa.
Prost nearly won the title at Ferrari in 1990, but failed to win a
single race with the team in 1991. ``It's always more difficult at
Ferrari because you get more pressure,'' he said.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: LIBERTY MAY HAVE FORMED A MENTAL BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  By   IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In that woozy, merry, end-of-the-party kind of voice,
Dean Martin warbled a hit song years ago in which he was ``goin'
back to Houston, Houston, Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times, George Strait got a little more personal,
and melancholy. ``All my exes live in Texas,'' he sang, ``and
that's a place I'd dearly love to be. But all my exes live in Texas
_ that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Comets, defending champions of the Women's National
Basketball Association and leading in this year's finals against
the Liberty by 1-0, had surely connected in a positive way with
Dino, for they returned home to the Compaq Center for Saturday's
Game 2 after slipping past the Liberty at Madison Square Garden on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   And given their druthers the Liberty players, to be sure, would
like to have joined George in Nashville, or Knoxville, or wherever
it was he was ducking any former frau.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-of-three-game series, the Liberty understood that a
victory at home to begin the series _ with the next game, and the
third game, if necessary, set for Houston _ was significant. More
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imperative,'' Teresa Weatherspoon, the Liberty point
guard, said before Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital,'' Liberty guard Becky Hammon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do,'' Liberty forward Sue Wicks said, ``is
steal a game in the Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Steal a game! They were playing at home in New York. The Liberty
had won 13 straight games at home. The team had even beaten Houston
the last time they played in the Garden, a 69-64 regular-season
victory. You don't steal a victory at home, you take it!
</P>
<P>
   But such desperate talk may well have accorded insight into the
hearts and minds of the Liberty players. It seemed they were
digging themselves a mental hole, but no one could contest that
they had a reason.
</P>
<P>
   For the amateur psychologists, they'd have another think coming.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shot out to a 14-2 lead on Saturday, and it looked
like it would be curtains well before the intermission. Oh no, not
this team.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberty came back and came back and came back. Here was
Teresa Weatherspoon dropping in a 3-pointer and Tamika Whitmore and
Tari Phillips scoring big buckets. It took a spine-tingling 3-point
shot by the indomitable Cynthia Cooper with 14.6 seconds in
regulation to give the Comets at tie, and force an overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was not only up against the only team to have won
the WNBA championship in the four-year history of the league, one
seeking to become the first team since the 1980-83 Islanders of the
National Hockey League to win four straight titles. But the Liberty
was also playing against a team that boasted the spectacular Sheryl
Swoopes, the league's most valuable player; Tina Thompson, the MVP
of the league's All-Star Game; and the grand Coop. A formidable
trio to say the least for any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the 37-year-old, 5-foot-10-inch super-duper star, has
the ability to turn on her greatness at a moment's notice _ like
pressing elevator buttons for higher and higher floors. She did it
in the first game at the Garden, hitting 20 points, including the
drive that sealed the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Cooper given teams fits, she has given them
nightmares, and indigestion as well. She has been the most valuable
player in the finals in each of the last three seasons. And MVP
finals trophy No. 4 was within grasp.
</P>
<P>
   She was also the league MVP in its first two years, an honor
Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith won last season and Swoopes won this
season. Cooper has announced her retirement after this series. She
has been to this league what that guy with the Bulls was to his
league, what Beethoven was to his, and Matisse to his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw snapshots in my head of me sobbing after the game,''
Wicks said Friday afternoon. ``I don't want to experience that
again. It's a horrible feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice trailed off for a moment. After all, she has been with
the team for all four years of its existence and had been on the
two previous teams that came up short in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we have our backs against the wall,'' Wicks said, ``but
I think we play our best at times like that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the poet may wish for another expression, the cliche was
excusable in this case because the Liberty responded just as she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   What wondrous energy and heart the Liberty demonstrated was not
quite enough to subdue the Comets. The Liberty was outscored, 15-9,
in the five-minute overtime, and wound up on the low end _ it is
difficult to write ``loss'' or ``defeat'' in so valiant an effort _
of the 79-73 score.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Wicks said: ``There are two sides to the game.
Someone's going to celebrate, and someone's going to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, the capacity crowd of 16,285 went wild for
its hometown darlings, and confetti cannons under each basket shot
up red, white and blue paper to create a literal blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets ran around the court holding up four fingers,
indicative of their remarkable achievement, and Cooper got her
fourth finals MVP, narrowly beating out Swoopes. The Liberty
players trailed off the court, disappointment etched on their
faces.
</P>
<P>
   The snapshots in their heads, as time goes on, will surely
remain vivid. One hopes that the pictures recall a thrilling,
courageous challenge to a true champion. Both teams deserve that. &QL;

DR. GUILLERMO C. SANCHEZ, 75, INTERNIST AND MEDICAL HISTORIAN
</HEADLINE>
 By   WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Guillermo C. Sanchez, an internist and medical historian
associated with Massachusetts General Hospital for five decades,
died on Aug. 17 at his home in West Newton, Mass. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, a prominent figure in Boston medicine, published
articles on a variety of subjects, including the early development
of ether anesthesia in the 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   Besides treating thousands of patients at the hospital and at
his private practice in West Newton, Sanchez engaged in historical
research that made him a regular visitor to hospital archives going
back 190 years.
</P>
<P>
   He worked to improve the accessibility and scholarly usefulness
of those archives and, in 1995, was elected founding chairman of
Massachusetts General's new archives committee. He held that
position until his death.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis did not bring the Rollerblades for her
Central Park skate this U.S. Open. Too much baggage.
</P>
<P>
   She had them when she won her first and only U.S. Open in 1997,
back when she was 16 and unafraid, grinning and winning tournaments
as if she were taking an afternoon joy ride. She is still grinning,
still the No. 1-ranked player. But no blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have brought them, I won that year,'' she said
Saturday, laughing, before joining the festivities at Arthur Ashe
Stadium for the fifth annual Arthur Ashe Kids Day. It was a
sun-bleached tennis and entertainment bonanza at the National
Tennis Center, brimming with 20,838 people, mostly children, some
barely bigger than their rackets.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis enters the 2000 U.S. Open as the top-seeded woman, but
for the first time in four years she comes without having won a
Grand Slam tournament in the current year. She has won five
tournaments this season but has not captured a Grand Slam title
since the 1999 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has been overpowered by the hard-hitting Venus and Serena
Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Mary Pierce at the Grand Slam
events. ``I'm proud of my success at this tournament,'' Hingis
said. ``But this is the future, so let's see what I can make of it.
I'm going into it very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, she has reached both finals, but lost to Davenport
in 1998 and Serena Williams last year. At the Canadian Open last
week, Hingis was leading Williams, 3-0, in the third set when
Williams retired with a sore foot. But Hingis lost to Davenport in
the Australian Open finals, the French Open semifinals to Pierce
and the Wimbledon quarterfinals to Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's still very confident and very focused about what
she wants to do,'' said Davenport, seeded second for the U.S. Open.
``She's had a hard time counterattacking the power game. When she
gets to these players she plays hard but she doesn't dictate the
points. She's usually in control, so that's kind of an awkward
situation to be in.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, the harder hitters weren't that consistent. They are
more consistent now and there's more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hingis, who has been doing limited weight training and speed
work, would like to prove at this U.S. Open that the game is not
overpowering her. ``I can't say it, I have to go out and show it,''
she said. ``I feel like the best time is ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, 24, is hoping the same. She is recovering from a
sprained left foot she sustained 12 days ago, and while the foot is
not 100 percent, Davenport has been able to practice nearly to her
usual level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the last two weeks was the best I've hit the ball
since January or February,'' she said. ``In the middle of the year,
even at Wimbledon, I was just getting through matches, I was
struggling against people I shouldn't have, just trying to get the
ball back. But I feel my shots are there now.''

REAL ESTATE: NEW DEVELOPMENTS REVITALIZING BALIMORE'S WATERFRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES BELFOURE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ A 32-story hotel that will be the city's largest is
nearing completion as part of a $500 million redevelopment of a
gritty industrial area that links the original Inner Harbor project
with two gentrified historic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Inner Harbor East, with 3 million square feet of space on 18
acres, is considered the linchpin in the redevelopment of the
32-block industrial area that connects the Inner Harbor with the
residential neighborhoods of Fells Point and Canton. With several
other pending projects, it will help create a continuous path of
development along two miles of the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by H &AMP; S Properties Development Corp. of Baltimore,
Inner Harbor East will eventually be nine contiguous blocks of
residential, retail, office and entertainment space. The
construction is actually the second phase of the development. It
began in 1995 with the construction of the 130,000-square-foot
headquarters for Sylvan Learning Systems and the Promenade, a
113-unit rental building, at a total cost of $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   When finished in February, the 750-room Baltimore Marriott
Waterfront will be the first hotel to be built here in 15 years.
Aside from providing guest rooms for business travelers and
tourists, the $135 million concrete tower will provide critically
needed space for convention visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has a separate entry and lobby for busloads of
conventioneers. Two levels are specifically for convention
activities, including column-free ballrooms of 20,000 and 17,000
square feet that can be divided into smaller meeting spaces. Rooms
with hospitality suites for seminars surround the ballrooms, and
there is a space designed as a command post for meeting planners. A
large freight elevator can bring displays and equipment, including
automobiles, directly from the street to the ballrooms for
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The new hotel has already had an effect on convention business,
according to Michael Beatty, a vice president of H &AMP; S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shriners convention is booked for 2005,'' he said.
``That's 30,000 visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular guests will arrive under a porte-cochere about 20 yards
from the edge of the harbor and enter a vaulted lobby. The
penthouse level contains rooms of usual size as well as luxury
suites with views for five miles in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the hotel tower is a 50,000-square-foot office-retail
complex, with 600 parking spaces, being built for $20 million. A
210,000-square-foot office building, already fully leased, that
shares a two-story retail base with an adjacent hotel is under
construction on the block bounded by Fleet Street, Central Avenue,
Exeter Street and Aliceanna Street four blocks away. The 207-room
hotel will fly the Marriott Courtyard flag, and be intended for
business travelers. The $22 million complex, to be completed in
November, will have a Fresh Fields supermarket on the first floor
and a 370-space parking garage above it.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in early 2001 across from the Marriot Courtyard on
Exeter Street, construction will start on a 90,000-square-foot
entertainment complex that will include an 18-screen movie theater
and 40,000 square feet of retail stores on the street level.
</P>
<P>
   A 450,000-square-foot office and retail building with 1,200
spaces of underground parking is due to begin early next year in
the adjacent block. The residential part of the project along
Lancaster Street will begin as well, with the construction of a
225-unit long-term-stay hotel and two luxury apartment buildings
with 225 and 90 units. A 300,000-square-foot office building by the
edge of the water is also being considered.
</P>
<P>
   H &AMP; S was not the original developer of the project. The first
developer assembled the parcels in the 1980s, but got into
financial difficulties and came close to foreclosure. When the bank
was about to call its loan, city officials asked John Paterakis
Sr., who owns H &AMP; S Bakeries, a major supplier to regional food
stores, a few blocks to the east, to buy the loan. He did,
expecting the city to acquire the property from him at the same
price he paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   When it did not, Paterakis, with no development experience to
speak of, reluctantly started the project himself. He brought in a
co-developer to obtain approvals and create a master plan. In 1995,
frustrated by delays, Paterakis became more active, Beatty said,
constructing the Sylvan building and the Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   For all its early reticence about development, H &AMP; S is now
diving headlong into two more projects directly south of Inner
Harbor East. It has formed a joint venture with a major Baltimore
developer, Streuver Brothers Eccles &AMP; Rouse, and is completing the
acquisition of the vacant Allied Signal site from Honeywell Corp.
About $300 million is expected to be spent to turn the 27-acre
parcel into a mixed-use development to be called Harbor Point, with
1.8 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Near the southeastern edge of the Allied Signal site is a 6-acre
parcel along Thames Street, on which Streuver Brothers Eccles &AMP;
Rouse and H &AMP; S will build 141 residential units and 330,000 square
feet of office space. That project will cost $90 million and be
completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Other pending projects, a few blocks away, include an
80,000-square-foot four-story building for Whitman Requardt &AMP;
Associates, one of the oldest engineering firms in the city. The
Living Classroom Foundation will build the nation's first museum
dedicated to black seamen and shipbuilders a few blocks east of the
Allied site.
</P>
<P>
   H &AMP; S Bakeries, which started in a row house in East Baltimore
60 years ago, owns several blocks and buildings east of the
project, but has no plans to relocate or to redevelop that
property.
</P>
<P>
   Inner Harbor East's tower was criticized as out of scale with
the adjacent neighborhood of Little Italy, criticism that was
rejected by its developers, who cited zoning that would have
allowed them to build a taller structure. ``We could have built a
430-foot hotel, but we kept it at 330 feet and reduced the bulk of
the other buildings so they wouldn't overwhelm the streets,''
Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics still complain about the scale of the Inner Harbor East
project, but accept its economic value for Baltimore's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our project will be a huge driver for people who want to live
down here,'' Beatty said. ``We've tried to create a 24-hour
environment with a mix of residences, offices, retail and
entertainment.''

providing directory assistance. And they are doing so with varying
degrees of accuracy and efficiency. Sandra L. Frankel, town

VENUS WILLIAMS ROLLS PAST SELES TO CAPTURE PILOT PEN CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ With her younger sister Serena, whom she
hopes to dethrone as the U.S. Open champion, looking on, Venus
Williams put on a virtuoso performance in overpowering Monica
Seles, 6-2, 6-4, Saturday to win the Pilot Pen tennis tournament
for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has not been beaten since she won at Wimbledon in July.
She has won four tournament titles and 19 matches in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that she will be a top contender at the U.S. Open,
which begins Monday and at which she will be seeded third, Williams
beat Seles in a final for the second time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She played brilliantly. No matter what the 26-year-old Seles did
_ and she played well _ Williams, 20, had a riposte, usually a
sizzling ground stroke winner or a spectacular retrieval. Typifying
Seles' frustration was an apparent winner she hit in the 10th and
last game of the second set. With Williams on the left side of the
court, Seles hammered an overhead into the right corner. The
6-foot-1 Williams sprinted to her right, stretched fully and
whipped a forehand winner down the line, electrifying the crowd of
8,363 at the Connecticut Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Even Williams said she was surprised by the shot. ``That doesn't
happen very often,'' said Williams, who has now won four of the
seven tournaments she has played this year since returning to
competition in May after taking five months off because of
tendinitis in both hands. ``I was just going for broke.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of 28 outright winners by Williams, 20 of which
came in the second set. The second-seeded Seles, by contrast, had
13 winners and 23 unforced errors, against 17 unforced errors by
Williams. The top-seeded Williams, who is ranked third in the
world, also had a big edge on service, getting in 56 percent of her
first serves and hammering in nine aces compared to Seles' two.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Williams ran down apparent winners. And her
strategy of focusing on Seles' backhand proved effective.
</P>
<P>
   Williams struggled somewhat in winning her first two matches
here against Yelena Likhovtseva and Patty Schnyder, and conceded
earlier in the week that she was prone to lose focus against lesser
players. But she raised the level of her play against top-echelon
players. That, she said, was the case Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference today was that I was playing Monica, who is a
caliber above a normal player, and I know I wanted to win this
match not only going into the Open but because she has never
defeated me before,'' said Williams, who has beaten Seles all four
times they have met. Williams has dropped only one set to Seles, at
their last meeting, in San Diego on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing the opening set easily by breaking Seles three
times, Williams held serve at 15 to lead by 5-3 in the second set.
She closed out the match at love with consecutive aces that each
registered about 110 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Williams' superb performance, Seles said she thought her
rival was playing about the same as a year ago. ``I would say she
is playing about the same,'' said Seles, who has won three
tournaments this year and is ranked sixth in the world. ``Everyone
says she is playing better, and obviously her serve is very strong,
and physically she gets back a lot of balls. So that is a tough
combination and puts a lot of pressure on your own serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the crowd after her victory, Williams apologized for
her slow start in the tournament. ``I was not putting on a good
show,'' she said with a smile, ``but with the help of my dad I
cleaned up my act.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams earned $87,000, bringing her earnings this year to
$1,196,900. Seles won $43,500.

REPUTED HEAD OF DRUG RING TAKEN TO U.S. AFTER ARREST
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wrapping up a huge international anti-drug
operation, the United States has brought the reputed leader of an
international cocaine smuggling ring to Florida to face federal
charges, the U.S. Customs Service announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with additional arrests by South American and European
authorities, the apprehension of Ivan De La Vega effectively
brought to a close one of the broadest international anti-drug
operations ever mounted, one that involved authorities from 12
nations, officials said Saturday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A freighter, one of several said to have been used in the global
trafficking scheme is also being confiscated, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case demonstrates what can be achieved when nations of
the world work together against a common enemy,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation was based in Colombia and Venezuela, and
Venezuelan officials arrested De La Vega, the alleged leader of the
drug organization, on August 16, as part of a series of raids that
used about 200 anti-drug officers with an array of helicopters,
airplanes and boats, the authorities said. A U.S. Navy ship stopped
the Maltese-flagged ship, the Suerte I, off the coast of Grenada on
Aug. 17 after Venezuelan authorities had intercepted smaller
boatloads of cocaine headed to the Suerte I. No cocaine was found
in a search of the larger vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested and sent to Florida for prosecution was Luis
Antonio Navia, a Cuban national with U.S. residence status who was
a fugitive wanted on prior federal drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Europe, authorities in Greece made eight arrests
in connection with shipping firms that they said were linked to the
operation. There were also two related arrests in Italy and another
in France.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. officials said that arrests and seizures effectively
wrapped up ``Operation Journey,'' a two-year, multinational
crackdown that resulted in the seizure of nearly 25 tons of
cocaine. That much cocaine would have a street value in Europe of
roughly $1 billion if sold in individual doses, they said. The drug
ring is thought to have transported as much as 68 tons of cocaine
to Europe and the United States during the past three years.

LAZIO AND CLINTON CONTINUE DEBATE ON TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYACK, N.Y. _ The debate between Rep. Rick Lazio and Hillary
Rodham Clinton over their tax cut plans continued on Saturday, with
Clinton calling Lazio's proposal ``fiscally irresponsible'' and
saying that it was likely to increase the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, meanwhile, said that Clinton's plan was not in the best
interest of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a group of Democratic women at the Nyack Center,
Clinton, the Democratic candidate in this year's New York Senate
race, portrayed herself as a key member of the Clinton
administration team that was able to reduce the national debt. She
tried to tie Lazio to conservative Republicans in Congress who had
proposed large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the first day that Clinton directly criticized
Lazio's tax plan. In the past few days, Clinton's aides have
criticized Lazio's proposal for using a projected $4.4 trillion,
10-year federal budget surplus. The plan, which Lazio outlined
Thursday in a speech in Amherst, N.Y., includes as its centerpiece
a proposal to allow taxpayers to deduct the payroll tax that
finances Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech here Saturday, Clinton said she believed that the
Lazio plan would waste the surplus and stifle the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lazio has a tax plan that is fiscally irresponsible and
the numbers don't add up,'' she said. ``It's not going to give one
penny to prescription drug benefits, Medicare or putting down the
debt, things I've supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Lazio's proposal mirrored many of those
advocated by the Republicans in Congress who served under former
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is right out of the Newt Gingrich, George W. Bush,
Republican playbook,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lazio campaign defended its plan Saturday, saying that
it would actually bring prosperity to blighted areas of the state.
``Mrs. Clinton doesn't trust New Yorkers and believes only
Washington bureaucrats know how to spend our hard-earned money,''
Lazio said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would trim taxes by $496 billion over 10 years,
and include a cut in the so-called marriage penalty, but not an
elimination of it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lazio, who has been a congressman from Suffolk
County for eight years, said his tax proposal would include a menu
of tax cuts long advocated by congressional Republicans, among them
the elimination of the inheritance tax and the marriage penalty.
Lazio's speech came in a week that Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, was defending his $1.3 trillion
federal tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said his plan would result in $776 billion in tax cuts
over 10 years. It was meant to distance himself from the Bush plan,
while still advocating more reductions than Clinton. But Clinton
campaign aides said that because of an error in calculations,
Lazio's plan would actually produce $1.24 trillion in cuts, rather
than the $776 billion he cited.

BRIBERY CASE REVEALS MILLIONS KEPT SECRET  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national and ``f'' financial news
files.) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Exposed by the largest bribery scandal in recent
court history, Superior Court officials admit they wrongfully kept
secret an $81.6 million trust account containing $18 million in
interest owed to local governments and individuals, the Los Angeles
Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after an Encino attorney discovered the account by
chance and bribed a Superior Court Finance Division auditor to feed
him the names of those owed money that officials lifted the
confidentiality from the account.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were caught, the lawyer and clerk split $1.5 million
in fees by telling cities and other government agencies how they
could collect $5 million in forgotten money owed them.
</P>
<P>
   While Superior Court officials have revised procedures for the
account, no outside audit of the account has been conducted.
Officials relied on an internal county audit and the District
Attorney's Office investigation of the bribery case instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, the court's position for a long time was this
money was confidential,'' said Alf Schonbach, the Superior Court
finance and accounting administrator who oversees the fund. ``The
court made no effort to contact persons to whom the money might be
owed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Condemnation and Interpleader trust account currently has
$63.6 million in deposits in 1,333 cases, some dating back to the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deposits were made by cities and redevelopment
agencies after condemnation of someone's property under eminent
domain laws. Over the years, the fund accrued $18 million in
interest from investment in U.S. government securities.
</P>
<P>
   Schonbach acknowledged that the courts did nothing until
recently to notify people about the account but said there now
seems to be little interest by the cities that have a
responsibility to homeowners involved in the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The court has been sending out notices every six months to
cities with cases but has received only six responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the responsibility really falls on the attorneys
in these cases,'' Schonbach said. ``Given the number of cases heard
in Los Angeles Superior Court, it's unreasonable to believe that a
small accounting staff within the court is going to play nursemaid
and remind these attorneys that they have forgotten to complete
their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money is deposits made by cities and redevelopment
agencies, but Schonbach estimates a small amount is due to
homeowners and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of these older cases, people may have moved or are
deceased,'' he said. ``Probably less than 3 (percent) to 4 percent
of the total in that fund is awaiting its rightful owners to come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The bribery case revealed that for decades the Superior Court
failed to make public the individuals, businesses and
municipalities that are owed money from the account.
</P>
<P>
   Schonbach said the informal policy was in place before he and
the court clerk took their jobs in the early 1990s and that as a
result of the bribery case, the County Counsel's Office recommended
they make the fund public.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the court has been sending notices to cities
every six months telling them about money principal and interest
owed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never made a deliberate attempt to conceal the
information,'' Schonbach said.
</P>
<P>
   But retired Assistant County Counsel Fred Bennett, who advised
the courts for 25 years and retired in April, said nobody ever gave
the court legal advice that the fund was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this matter was first brought to my attention, I advised
the court I could not see any compelling reasons that would warrant
nondisclosure of this kind of information,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett became suspicious about the potential of someone
exploiting the account when he learned an attorney was contacting
cities and telling them he could get them their lost funds if they
paid him half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned that their record-keeping system - that
they didn't have a good paper trail on whether the money had been
paid out,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a person at the meeting named Gregory Pentoney. I
recalled my fears when I later learned of the investigation of
Pentoney. I took all my notes to the District Attorney's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In the scheme, Pentoney, 32, of Downey gave secret county
account data to Encino attorney Robert Fenton, 51, who collected
``bounty fees'' for tracking down forgotten funds owed to cities,
mostly in interest, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea bargain in March, Fenton pleaded no contest to
giving a bribe to a ministerial officer. Pentoney pleaded no
contest to accepting a bribe. Without the plea bargain, they each
faced 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, Fenton began a 16-month state prison term. On Sept.
8, Pentoney is expected to begin serving a two-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Fenton distributed $5 million to cities, involving 99 separate
cases, and collected fees of about $1 million for himself and
$463,165 for Pentoney, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   The public agencies put money into the account when a property
owner contested an eminent domain proceeding. The deposit was based
on the assessed value of the properties being sought for public
works projects. Such cases can wind through the court system for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Fenton discovered the fund after his parents' property in North
Hollywood was condemned, said James Blatt, an Encino attorney
representing Fenton.
</P>
<P>
   Blatt said Fenton, who is married and the father of five, had
the ``best intentions'' when he developed his plan to profit from
returning the money to the rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenton's conduct in this case was the result of his unlikely
discovery of funds wrongfully possessed by Los Angeles County and
his desire to obtain the return of those funds,'' Blatt said. ``In
so doing, Fenton's judgment clouded, and what he now understands
were bribes were paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so shocking about this case is that over the years Los
Angeles County did not make any effort to return these monies to
the rightful owners,`` Blatt said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cities Fenton contacted was Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Chief Assistant Attorney Ron Braden said his finance
director received a letter from Fenton stating he could recover
money for the city for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Piquing his interest, Braden discovered that no one in the city
had thought to recover interest on deposits made with the court on
eminent domain cases over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened not only to Glendale, but a whole bunch of other
government entities,'' he said. ``I understand that it wasn't done
as a matter of practice, where attorneys for cities go back into
court to get whatever balance is owed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking Fenton up on his offer, Braden contacted the
court to find out which cases the city could collect on. He
intended to get the money by himself.
</P>
<P>
   After several unsuccessful attempts to find the cases, Braden
contacted Pentoney, who suggested he look through a court index.
After looking at the index, he got a call from Fenton, who told him
he had found only a small portion of the cases. Fenton told him he
would help him find the rest.
</P>
<P>
   So Braden agreed to pay Fenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found about $400,000 worth of cases on our own and he
probably found $1.3 million above that,'' Braden said, adding that
the city paid Fenton about $2,800 and was about to pay him an
additional $33,000 when an investigator called and told him Fenton
was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got that call I did not release that check for $33,000
to him,'' Braden said. ``I was outraged and incensed, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Fenton sued the city to recover the $33,000. The
lawsuit is on hold while he is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that bothers me frankly is that Mr. Fenton sued
us,'' Braden said. ``And Mr. Fenton said in our open court through
his attorney during sentencing that he intends to proceed with his
lawsuit against us. I think that's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: People who believe they might be owed money can call
Superior Court administrator Alf Schonbach's office at (213)
974-5147 and pay $25.50 for the list of cases.

</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, the court's position for a long time was this
money was confidential,'' said Alf Schonbach, the Superior Court
finance and accounting administrator who oversees the fund. ``The
court made no effort to contact persons to whom the money might be
owed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Condemnation and Interpleader trust account currently has
$63.6 million in deposits in 1,333 cases, some dating back to the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deposits were made by cities and redevelopment
agencies after condemnation of someone's property under eminent
domain laws. Over the years, the fund accrued $18 million in
interest from investment in U.S. government securities.
</P>
<P>
   Schonbach acknowledged that the courts did nothing until
recently to notify people about the account but said there now
seems to be little interest by the cities that have a
responsibility to homeowners involved in the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The court has been sending out notices every six months to
cities with cases but has received only six responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the responsibility really falls on the attorneys
in these cases,'' Schonbach said. ``Given the number of cases heard
in Los Angeles Superior Court, it's unreasonable to believe that a
small accounting staff within the court is going to play nursemaid
and remind these attorneys that they have forgotten to complete
their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money is deposits made by cities and redevelopment
agencies, but Schonbach estimates a small amount is due to
homeowners and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of these older cases, people may have moved or are
deceased,'' he said. ``Probably less than 3 (percent) to 4 percent
of the total in that fund is awaiting its rightful owners to come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The bribery case revealed that for decades the Superior Court
failed to make public the individuals, businesses and
municipalities that are owed money from the account.
</P>
<P>
   Schonbach said the informal policy was in place before he and
the court clerk took their jobs in the early 1990s and that as a
result of the bribery case, the County Counsel's Office recommended
they make the fund public.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the court has been sending notices to cities
every six months telling them about money principal and interest
owed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never made a deliberate attempt to conceal the
information,'' Schonbach said.
</P>
<P>
   But retired Assistant County Counsel Fred Bennett, who advised
the courts for 25 years and retired in April, said nobody ever gave
the court legal advice that the fund was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this matter was first brought to my attention, I advised
the court I could not see any compelling reasons that would warrant
nondisclosure of this kind of information,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett became suspicious about the potential of someone
exploiting the account when he learned an attorney was contacting
cities and telling them he could get them their lost funds if they
paid him half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned that their record-keeping system - that
they didn't have a good paper trail on whether the money had been
paid out,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a person at the meeting named Gregory Pentoney. I
recalled my fears when I later learned of the investigation of
Pentoney. I took all my notes to the District Attorney's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In the scheme, Pentoney, 32, of Downey gave secret county
account data to Encino attorney Robert Fenton, 51, who collected
``bounty fees'' for tracking down forgotten funds owed to cities,
mostly in interest, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea bargain in March, Fenton pleaded no contest to
giving a bribe to a ministerial officer. Pentoney pleaded no
contest to accepting a bribe. Without the plea bargain, they each
faced 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, Fenton began a 16-month state prison term. On Sept.
8, Pentoney is expected to begin serving a two-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Fenton distributed $5 million to cities, involving 99 separate
cases, and collected fees of about $1 million for himself and
$463,165 for Pentoney, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   The public agencies put money into the account when a property
owner contested an eminent domain proceeding. The deposit was based
on the assessed value of the properties being sought for public
works projects. Such cases can wind through the court system for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Fenton discovered the fund after his parents' property in North
Hollywood was condemned, said James Blatt, an Encino attorney
representing Fenton.
</P>
<P>
   Blatt said Fenton, who is married and the father of five, had
the ``best intentions'' when he developed his plan to profit from
returning the money to the rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenton's conduct in this case was the result of his unlikely
discovery of funds wrongfully possessed by Los Angeles County and
his desire to obtain the return of those funds,'' Blatt said. ``In
so doing, Fenton's judgment clouded, and what he now understands
were bribes were paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so shocking about this case is that over the years Los
Angeles County did not make any effort to return these monies to
the rightful owners,`` Blatt said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cities Fenton contacted was Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Chief Assistant Attorney Ron Braden said his finance
director received a letter from Fenton stating he could recover
money for the city for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Piquing his interest, Braden discovered that no one in the city
had thought to recover interest on deposits made with the court on
eminent domain cases over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened not only to Glendale, but a whole bunch of other
government entities,'' he said. ``I understand that it wasn't done
as a matter of practice, where attorneys for cities go back into
court to get whatever balance is owed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking Fenton up on his offer, Braden contacted the
court to find out which cases the city could collect on. He
intended to get the money by himself.
</P>
<P>
   After several unsuccessful attempts to find the cases, Braden
contacted Pentoney, who suggested he look through a court index.
After looking at the index, he got a call from Fenton, who told him
he had found only a small portion of the cases. Fenton told him he
would help him find the rest.
</P>
<P>
   So Braden agreed to pay Fenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found about $400,000 worth of cases on our own and he
probably found $1.3 million above that,'' Braden said, adding that
the city paid Fenton about $2,800 and was about to pay him an
additional $33,000 when an investigator called and told him Fenton
was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got that call I did not release that check for $33,000
to him,'' Braden said. ``I was outraged and incensed, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Fenton sued the city to recover the $33,000. The
lawsuit is on hold while he is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that bothers me frankly is that Mr. Fenton sued
us,'' Braden said. ``And Mr. Fenton said in our open court through
his attorney during sentencing that he intends to proceed with his
lawsuit against us. I think that's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: People who believe they might be owed money can call
Superior Court administrator Alf Schonbach's office at (213)
974-5147 and pay $25.50 for the list of cases.

YANKEES BEAT OAKLAND, 10-6 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The mastery of Orlando Hernandez is fragile,
each ingredient of his pitching reliant on the other ingredients.
Take away his slider or changeup and he is just another veteran
with a mediocre fastball. Take away his control and hitters will
hammer him.
</P>
<P>
   Working along this fine line, Hernandez is trying to reassemble
all of these pieces and recreate the pitcher who dominated in the
postseason the last two years. His progression may be the most
important issue facing the Yankees in the last five weeks of the
regular season, other than going about the business of clinching a
playoff berth, and Hernandez pitched well Saturday, striking out 11
in seven innings in a 10-6 demolition of the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams made his first start in a week
and drove in the Yankees' first run with an infield single, Clay
Bellinger hit two triples and Jose Canseco played left field for
the first time since July 9, 1999, and slammed a tremendous home
run. The Yankees had a 10-3 lead going into the bottom of the ninth
before reliever Mike Stanton allowed a three-run home run to Frank
Menechino. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 71-55. The were three and a half games ahead of
the Boston Red Sox at the completion of Saturday's game; the Red
Sox were scheduled to play at Kansas City Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who allowed five hits, three walks and three runs in
seven innings Saturday, has about six more starts remaining. Out
for almost a month with elbow and back trouble, Hernandez lost his
first three starts after being activated from the disabled list
Aug. 6, and in no way did he resemble the pitcher the Yankees have
come to trust. He seemed disconsolate on the mound at times,
sullen; he had no swagger, and exuded no confidence or
combativeness. After a particularly bad start in Anaheim, Hernandez
said repeatedly that he had no understanding of why he was having
such trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But he was back to moving gracefully Saturday, striding
steadily; Hernandez moves with the same gait as Michael Jordan.
When he allowed hits, he kept his head up, his expression placid:
just give me back the ball, he seemed to be saying.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, he did not like a call made by the plate
umpire, Tim Tschida, and summoned Jorge Posada to the mound,
prattling with the webbing of his glove held high to cover his
mouth, in case anybody wanted to hear what he is saying.
</P>
<P>
   A teammate said recently that El Duque has appeared more content
lately, possibly because he's feeling truly healthy for the first
time in months. His back sometimes aches _ recently, Hernandez
brought a chiropractor into the Yankees' clubhouse, only to have
him ejected by club officials _ but not to the point that he cannot
function on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (10-10) has regained his fastball _ he threw 92 to 93
miles an hour consistently, radar gun readings that are as good or
better than any he has had since joining the Yankees. Empowered by
the six runs his teammates scored for him in the first three
innings off Mark Mulder (7-10), Hernandez challenged the Athletics
with high fastballs, blowing away Mike Stanley, whiffing Miguel
Tejada and catcher Ramon Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   He greatly complicated matters by mixing in his other pitches,
his changeup and curveball against lefties and his slider against
right-handed batters; otherwise, his fastball would be vulnerable.
Hernandez rarely threw his changeup in his first outings after
coming off the disabled list, shaking off Posada when the catcher
called for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez used the changeup extensively Saturday, striking
out Jason Giambi with it on a 2-2 count in the third inning,
keeping left fielder Ben Grieve off balance with it in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Like David Cone, Hernandez has had trouble maintaining a good,
hard-breaking slider this season. Rather, his slider has tended to
move dully, easily tracked by hitters, and even in the first few
innings Saturday, he had trouble keeping that breaking pitch close
enough to the plate to entice right-handed batters. If Hernandez
cannot make the pitch attractive to hitters, they will allow it to
sail out of the strike zone harmlessly and sit on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, however, Hernandez spun a slider against
the right-handed hitter Randy Velarde, the pitch veering quickly
and with a downward trajectory, fooling Velarde completely.
Finally, a good, sharp slider, and Hernandez threw a few more
sliders like this, generating a couple of more strikeouts with it.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is not pitching with total effectiveness yet. He
walked three in spurts of wildness Saturday, and required a
whopping 134 pitches to get through seven innings. Hernandez's most
effective pitch in 1998 and 1999 was his sidearm slider, a pitch he
used to finish off right-handed batters when he got ahead in the
count, and whether because of his back trouble or because of
mechanics, he has not had this weapon this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is time left in this season, a half-dozen starts to
re-establish himself.

PATERNO WALLOWS AT LEVEL OF SWITZER, SHERRILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One NFL guy, talking recently on the criminal element that has
tarnished his league, had an interesting, although somewhat
self-serving, commentary about the hand that feeds his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary part,'' he said, ``is these players not only got
into a college, but they stayed in school three, four and five
years. Sure, we drafted them, so that's our problem to deal with.
But I think of a college football program as being a more pristine
element, where academics are supposed to matter, and so is
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure not naive. I know the routine. But when they come
into our league it still hits you pretty quick with some of them
that academics couldn't have been involved, and certainly not
character. It was obviously a blatant case of trying to win
football games, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, makes a college coach basically no different
from his NFL brethren. And for those who finally wake up and smell
the tequila, one truth remains self-evident:
</P>
<P>
   College football has always been the most unpure of all sports,
including any of the pro leagues. College basketball would be the
only thing close, but in football there are four times the players,
so four times the rules to break. And with the NCAA red tape to cut
through, the rule book is thicker than Joe Paterno's specs.
</P>
<P>
   On this cheery note, welcome everyone to another college
football season which kicked off this weekend, to be highlighted by
this afternoon's Penn State-USC encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is no soap-box climbing involved with this
morning's dispatch from the front lines, and certainly no morality
speech from the pulpit. No matter the warts, I enjoy college
football, and the more big-time the programs, the better. How do
you clean it up? Don't know that either. Also don't own a broom.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, with college football being a highly successful,
billion-dollar corporation, who says the high-and-mighty university
element is going sleepless ]in their concern over purity?
</P>
<P>
   But even those of us who sometimes wink and shrug when a coach
is successful with a well-executed quick-pitch-sweep around NCAA
Rule No. 5,150, by gosh, we even have our standards. And also our
breaking point when one of those standards comes tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a college coaching hero died. Not died in body. At
age 73, he's alive, well, and in the end, will probably spit on all
our graves.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, last rites were read over the spirit of the
man, and everything he seemed to have represented.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to the aforementioned Mr. Paterno. Oh, no Joe. You
have now become one of them.
</P>
<P>
   A famous quote from like 15 years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot retire and leave college football to the Barry
Switzers and Jackie Sherrills.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Switzer is now laughing. And with a grin, Sherrill is
scribbling on that rolled up sheet of paper he always carries on
the sidelines. It's hard to make it out from here, but it appears
Jackie wrote, ``hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, Paterno will
officially flush his reputation by starting a multi-talented
quarterback, Rashard Casey, against USC in the Kickoff Classic. The
Texas Aggies qualify as one team able to personally testify about
the football ability of Casey, having been devoured by him in the
Alamo Bowl last December.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony of another kind was heard ``against'' Casey this
summer. He is charged by police in his hometown of Hoboken, N.J.,
with aggravated assault against an off-duty police officer, and
there are also hate-crime implications. This alleged felony is
heavily tainted in black and white. If convicted, Casey will be
doing hard-time.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, the case involves a white police officer who was
visiting a bar with a black woman companion, when three black men,
including Casey, allegedly became violent over the woman's choice
for a date. First, words were exchanged, then the officer was
knocked to the ground, kicked and beaten. The police reports, using
witnesses, said Casey was the leader in the attack. Casey says he
was there, but didn't do what he was charged with.
</P>
<P>
   The courts will eventually sort this out, but Paterno shocked
many by not only defending his quarterback, but also by choosing to
play him anyway. I don't know for sure, but did even Switzer or
Sherrill, with their reputations for anything goes, ever play a
player charged with a serious felony?
</P>
<P>
   Paterno needs seven wins this season to surpass Bear Bryant as
the winningest coach in Division I. He also needs a good
quarterback to get there. And Casey is his only quarterback of
note.
</P>
<P>
   Casey is innocent until proved guilty. Paterno, however, is
guilty of making a decision here that goes against everything he
supposedly stood for. Casey should be nowhere near a football field
this weekend, or until there is grand jury involvement, one way or
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Casey's supporters are now claiming the district
attorney's case isn't as strong as previously thought. But Paterno
refused to wait for another two, three weeks, to see if there's an
indictment delivered or not. He's Switzer. He's Sherrill. He's an
old man who wants to win right now, whatever the image cost.
</P>
<P>
   And for those multitudes who have questioned Paterno on this
decision, he becomes increasingly defiant and bull-headed.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Wojnarowski, a columnist for the ``Bergen'' (N.J.)
``Record'', had this pertinent point in print:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chris Simms picked Penn State two years ago, as Paterno had
planned, would the coach be standing so strongly on Casey's side
now? Or would he have sought the high moral ground and cut him
loose?''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the college game is back for another season.
Unfortunately, it's minus one coaching hero.

WITH HIS FOURTH NFL TEAM, DEION SANDERS IS STILL HIS OWN MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. _ Deion Sanders never was a Cowboy. Or a 49er. Or a
Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   Never more than in name, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He always has been just Deion, a hired gun never defined by the
team for which he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's his own man,'' said Hall of Fame linebacker Sam Huff, an
analyst for the Redskins Radio Network. ``You've got to understand
that that's Deion Sanders, and he's going to do it his way. As long
as he fits in, and he does fit in wherever he is, he's a guy you
want on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his 12-year NFL career, Sanders is running
out of the tunnel to the cheers of Washington Redskins fans. Not
that he cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel no different, man. I don't feel no different,''
Sanders told the ``Star-Telegram''. ``It's great to be part of
another team, but I don't care who I got on. I've got a job to do.
I'm not even worried about what people think or what people say or
the cheers or the jeers. I'm focused, and I've got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Redskins fans, who once booed him and surely took his name in
vain when he returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown in the
Cowboys' 38-20 victory against their team last season, now proudly
call Sanders their own. Only cornerback Darrell Green, who has
spent his entire 18 seasons with the Redskins, is more popular in
Washington these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first day Deion returned a punt here in practice
against air, against no one, the fans in the stands cheered like
everything,'' said Hall of Fame quarterback Sonny Jurgensen, an
analyst for the Redskins Radio Network. ``He had them then.''
</P>
<P>
   As Redskins owner Daniel Snyder has discovered, Prime Time
sells.
</P>
<P>
   Washington became the first NFL team to charge admission to
training camp this year. Despite the $10 admission fee, Redskins
fans flocked to the team's practice facility near Dulles Airport.
On one overcast Sunday this month, 8,000 fans showed up to scream
Sanders' name, beg for his autograph and sing his praises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like Deion when he was down there, but we love the
kid now,'' said Michael Torbert, the head of The Hogettes
cheerleading group. ``He's on our side, and we're loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he no longer has the star on the side of his helmet,
Sanders has retained star power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been Humpty Dumpty,'' Sanders said. ``I've always
sat high on the wall, and people have always tried to make me
fall.'' \Nsubheds:MONSTER SEASONS Deion Sanders in any other
uniform still is Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is not the quintessential Falcon or 49er or Cowboy,
Sanders, 33, has a chance to do something no other player in NFL
history has done. Sanders, who won Super Bowl titles with the 49ers
in 1994 and with the Cowboys in '95, can become the first player to
win rings with three teams, according to Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``No player in history has had such a significant impact on
championships like Deion has,'' said ESPN analyst Joe Theismann, a
quarterback for the Redskins from 1974-85. ``He is certainly the
type of football player that I think can make a world of difference
in your football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins bought themselves the role of Super Bowl favorites
when they signed Sanders, defensive end Bruce Smith, safety Mark
Carrier and quarterback Jeff George to $114.75 million in
free-agent contracts that include $17.25 million in signing
bonuses. But Sanders, with his 49 career interceptions, his 22
career touchdowns and his unique ability to take away half the
field merely with his presence, is the linchpin in the Redskins'
bid to return to the Super Bowl for the first time in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   When Redskins coaches handed him their defensive playbook,
Sanders said they instead could have just given him a picture of
the receiver he was to cover every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know where he is at all times,'' Redskins
quarterback Brad Johnson said. ``He can definitely take away one
side of the field. You say it doesn't change your game plan, but it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders missed seven games the past two seasons with an injured
left big toe that required surgery on April 28, 1999. Despite
arthroscopic surgery on Jan. 24 to repair the meniscus in his right
knee, Sanders said he feels better than he has in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   He promises ``a monster season,'' before quickly adding, ``every
year for me is a monster season.'' \Nsubheds:PRIME TIME PERSONALITY
Sanders is an equal-opportunity employee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he left the Atlanta Falcons, the team that drafted him
with the fifth pick in the 1989 draft, for the San Francisco 49ers.
Upon signing his one-year, $1.1 million contract with the 49ers,
Sanders said, ``They've won four Super Bowls; I'm here to make it
five.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' 136-day career with the 49ers ended with an
interception and a victory in Super Bowl XXIX.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1995, Sanders signed a seven-year, $35 million
contract with the Cowboys. In five seasons, he made 16
interceptions, caught 52 passes, scored nine touchdowns. In 1996,
he became the league's first two-way starter in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, on June 2 the Cowboys voided his contract, which would
have counted $12.7 million against their $62.172 million salary
cap. Four days later, he signed a seven-year, $56 million contract,
including an $8 million signing bonus, with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good man's steps are ordered by the Lord,'' Sanders said.
``People really need to understand that I've been a Christian for
four years, and even before then, my steps were being ordered.
There was no way I could make the moves I've made career-wise, and
they've always come out right, without them being ordered by the
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   When he walked off the field after a 27-10 wild-card playoff
loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Sanders knew it was the last time he
would wear a Cowboys uniform. Sadly, so did Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who lists Sanders among his all-time favorites and refers
to him as a friend, had to listen to the bottom line instead of his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, very hard, for me not to have him on this team,''
Jones said, choking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said Jones' business decision has not affected their
relationship. He maintains a fondness for the Cowboys' owner
despite playing for the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry will be a friend until the end. He really will,'' said
Sanders, who is building an off-season home in Fort Worth-Dallas.
``He wasn't just an owner to me. He was more than that to me, much
more. Jerry is a good man, a very good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Sanders' ``Prime Time'' image belies his off-field
generosity. He recounted an unplanned fishing trip Sanders once
took with the grandson of a Cowboys front-office employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Deion came here, he could have gone several other places
at the same numbers or even more,'' Jones said. ``Because of the
size of his salary and compensation, it on the surface appeared
that it was all about money. I know it was not and is not all about
money with Deion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the joys that I've had in my entire life as it
pertains to sports or other things. He's loyal. He is very
compassionate, especially for the underdog. ... He is very generous
with his time and his money. I've seen him encourage his teammates
as well as coaches. When you have the kind of stature he has, you
can do that with a wink or a tap, and he inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Sanders serves as inspiration for the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who leads by example,'' Washington cornerback Champ
Bailey said. ``He talks when he has to, but he's more of a guy that
just goes out and does it. ... We're going to try to follow.''

MICKELSON CUTS WOODS' LEAD, THEN MAKES BLUNDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ An insect stung Tiger Woods on Saturday, but the
final two holes bit Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   After cutting Woods' lead from 11 strokes to 6 during Saturday's
third round of the NEC Invitational, Mickelson made crucial
blunders: a bogey at No.17, followed by a three-putt double-bogey
at No.18. Meanwhile, despite being stung on his left ring finger on
the 15th green, Woods shot his third consecutive round in the 60s
(67) and he will enter the final round at Firestone Country Club
with a comfortable nine-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a tournament scoring record for 54 holes (192, 64-61-67)
and extending the seven-stroke lead he began the day with, Woods
was cruising at 18 under par heading into Sunday's final round. Hal
Sutton, Mickelson and Phillip Price were tied for second place at
nine under par, but does anyone really expect the world's No.1
player to lose a nine-stroke lead with 18 holes to play?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the tournament ends Sunday. Realistically, Woods has
secured his eighth victory this season, and if he captures the
$1-million first-place check in this World Golf Championships
event, it will raise his earnings this year to more than $7.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' three-round total of 192 broke the previous Firestone
54-hole tournament record set by Jose Maria Olazabal (195) in 1994.
But more than records, Woods wants victories. And after three
sparkling rounds, including a nine-under-par 61 on Friday that tied
the course record, he was in position to coast home on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can just make pars on Sunday, somebody is going to have
to shoot really low to beat me,'' said Woods, who is trying to
become the first back-to-back winner at Firestone since Jack
Nicklaus in 1962 and '63. ``I had a big lead, and with a big lead,
all you need to do is make a bunch of pars. That's what I did
today. You don't need to put a lot of pressure on yourself with an
11-stroke lead. They have to come and get you.''
</P>
<P>
   The most precarious part of Woods' day came on the 15th green,
when he was stung on the left ring finger by an insect that was
walking across his putting line. Woods was uncertain whether it was
a bee or a wasp. But he was certain that it was painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my glove on, I tried to pick him up and throw him away,
and he whipped his tail around and got me,'' Woods said. ``I got
stung. It doesn't feel very good. The stinger is still in me. It
hurt quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not deter Woods from his mission, as he ended his day
making par on the final 14 holes after a torrid start to his round.
He built his 11-stroke lead with a birdie-eagle-birdie barrage that
thrilled his huge gallery and immediately put the rest of the field
on notice. Apparently, Woods had enough drama last weekend, when he
won the PGA Championship in a thrilling three-hole playoff against
Bob May.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, a playoff should not be necessary. Instead of
easing into his round, Woods crammed most of his best shots into
the first three holes. He birdied No. 1 with a 10-foot putt. He
made eagle at the par-5, 497-yard No. 2, using a driver and a
6-iron to reach the fringe in two shots, then making a 15-foot
putt. Woods then birdied No. 3 with a gorgeous pitching wedge
approach shot from 127 yards that he hit within 2 feet of the hole,
setting up an easy tap-in for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Before Mickelson could break a sweat, Woods had gone from 15
under par to 19 under, increasing his lead to 11 strokes over
Mickelson, who was still at eight under. Give Mickelson credit for
playing solid golf from that point through No. 16. He chipped in
from 22 feet for birdie at No.15, then at the par-5, 620-yard
No.16, Mickelson hit a huge drive, hit his second shot over the
green, then got up and down for birdie to reach 12 under par, while
Woods was still at 18 under.
</P>
<P>
   If Mickelson could have made par at No.17 and No.18, he would
have entered the final round down by six strokes, with a much more
realistic chance to win. Instead, he hit his second shot at the
par-4 No.17 over the green into deep rough, left his chip short,
then missed a 12-foot par attempt. And at the par-4 No.18, after a
poor drive into the rough, followed by an approach shot that landed
short of the green, Mickelson gave away crucial strokes. His chip
shot landed 6 feet from the hole. Then he missed the 6-footer for
par and shocked everyone by missing his 3-foot putt for bogey,
forcing him to settle for double-bogey, and a share of second
place, nine strokes behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson left the green with a stunned look on his face.
Meanwhile, Woods appeared well on his way to adding another runaway
victory, perhaps similar in size to his 15-stroke triumph at this
year's United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be more drama for the people watching to have a finish
like we did last week,'' Woods said. ``But I would have much rather
have it where it's a lot like the U.S. Open.''

EDWARD C. WALKER, LAVA LAMP DESIGNER AND A NATURIST, IS DEAD AT 82
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England)  By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Craven Walker, Royal Air Force squadron leader, champion
of what the British call the naturist way of life and designer of
the Lava lamp, a quintessential accessory of the 1960s and 1970s,
died on Aug. 15 at his home in Ringwood, England. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was a man of many grooves who made his first fortune on
the nudist movie ``Traveling Light'' (1960), filmed off Corsica and
featuring a nude woman performing underwater ballet to
Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Song of India.'' (Another nudist film, ``Eves
on Skis'' in 1958, was less of a hit.) Profits from his films went
toward promoting naturism and founding the Bournemouth and District
Outdoor Club, a nudist club in Dorset, England.
</P>
<P>
   Wider acclaim followed with his serendipitous transformation of
an unusual egg timer that he saw at a pub into an icon of the
1970s. The mesmerizing multicolored ooze, sloshing up and down in
slow motion inside a hurricane lamp with a space-age glow,
perfectly embodied the spirit of the psychedelic age.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-70s the Astro Lamp, as Walker named it, was selling
around the world at the rate of 7 million a year. Murray Moss, an
entrepreneur and design critic in New York, said of the must-have
for dormitory students: ``It was devoid of function but rich in
emotional fulfillment. It could momentarily free your mind like a
warm bath.''
</P>
<P>
   The lamp, introduced in 1963, lost its cachet in the late '70s
as the culture moved on to black-matte minimalism, but it has
recently made a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was born on July 4, 1918, in Singapore, where his father
was a shipping agent. At the age of 3 he was sent to England, where
he attended Charterhouse, a boarding school. In the 1930s he went
to work for British-American Tobacco. During World War II he served
in the Royal Air Force, flying photographic reconnaissance
missions. According to recent interviews in the British press, he
maintained the trim fighting figure and brisk demeanor of an RAF
officer throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, while living in a trailer behind a pub, he
established a successful travel agency and home-exchange program in
London. It was called En Famille, and Walker hoped it would foster
better relations between people from different lands.
</P>
<P>
   His lifelong interest in nudism was inspired by a trip to the
Ile du Levant off the southern coast of France, where, under the
pseudonym Michael Keatering, he made one of his three films
promoting the cause. Eventually he founded the nudist club at
Bournemouth and helped to establish other nudist colonies
throughout England.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who was married four times and had four children, was
never joined by family members in his naturist enthusiasms. He is
survived by his fourth wife, Sue Craven Walker of Ringwood; two
daughters, Gail Kincaid of Wales and Debora Storch of Boston; and
two sons, Antony, of Brussels, and Christopher, of Ringwood.
</P>
<P>
   It was a casual visit to the Queen's Head pub in the New Forest,
southwest of London, that sent Walker in a new direction. On the
bar he noticed a glass cocktail shaker filled with oil globules;
when heated, they rose through a column of water in just the time
it took to hard-boil an egg. He bought the patent from the
inventor's widow. Over the next 10 years, Walker worked in his
backyard, making improvements on the lamp. His recipe for a mix of
oil, wax and water that does not emulsify in shipping is still
closely held by Mathmos, the company that now makes the lamp in
England.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's Astro Lamp quickly caught on and was sold through
leading British stores like Selfridge's, Fortnum &AMP; Mason and
Habitat. (A buyer from Harrods said it was disgusting and refused
to carry it.)
</P>
<P>
   Walker's slogan at the time was, ``If you buy my lamp, you won't
need drugs,'' and the lamp soon became a fixture on the psychedelic
scene. It was featured on style-minded television shows like ``The
Avengers'' and ``The Prisoner.'' Walker himself consulted on a
James Bond film that showed gigantic Lava lamps as the four posters
of a bed.
</P>
<P>
   As the fad passed, Walker continued making other light fixtures,
none as popular as his Astro Lamp. (The Lava brand name was coined
in the United States and is now a trademark of Haggerty Enterprises
of Chicago.) He also continued to operate the Bournemouth club,
causing a stir in the late 1970s when he tried to bar overweight
customers _ he called them ``fat fogies'' _ from coming to his
camp, a place, in his mind, of health and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Walker was approached by a young entrepreneur who
wanted to revive interest in his lamp, which never went out of
production. It was reintroduced in England and is selling briskly
again.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with The Daily Telegraph, Walker listed two
reasons for his lamp's enduring appeal: ``It's like the cycle of
life. It grows, breaks up, falls down and then starts all over
again. And besides, the shapes are sexy.''

SMALL ITEM BIG NEWS FROM MONTREAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement out of Canada on Wednesday didn't generate so
much as a line in the ``briefly'' section of the baseball notes in
many newspapers. Hey, it was a big news day, what with the Dodgers
apologizing to a lesbian couple and a rift between Ken Griffey Jr.
and an announcer.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement could turn out to have a significant impact
on the sport. It could herald the first franchise move(s) since the
Washington Senators came to the Texas prairie and became the
Rangers before the 1972 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, according to the Canada Lands Corporation, have
withdrawn their request to purchase a parcel of land where the team
had hoped to build their new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That simple statement marks not the beginning of the end of the
franchise's stay in Montreal, but the acceleration of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day,` said Denis Coderre, federal minister for
amateur sports. ``The countdown has begun. We've always said that
the team's future is linked to the construction of a new stadium
downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing partner Jeffrey Loria claims it isn't necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is public knowledge that Canada Lands has had serious
interest expressed by other potential buyers for this property that
has been vacant for 20 years,'' Loria said in a prepared statement.
``The Expos do not wish to stand in the way of an opportunity for
Canada Lands to sell the property while the issues we face remain
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, although we realize there are no guarantees regarding
the eventual availability of the land, we fervently hope that
before Canada Lands finalizes a sale to another party, it will the
give the Expos a chance to purchase it.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter part of the statement indicates that Loria hasn't
given up on building a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So why withdraw their option on a prime piece of real estate the
club had targeted for a new ballpark?
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we couldn't give Canada Lands a precise date for
the start of construction of a new stadium,'' Loria spokesman Andre
Bouthillier told the ``Toronto Globe and Mail''. ``Secondly, Canada
Lands has said publicly it hoped to sell that land as soon as
possible, and we don't want to leave them in a situation where they
can't sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   The club, Bouthillier said, ``would be willing to talk to them
again if they can't sell it. We don't think Canada Lands will sell
the land right away, so we still have time. ... There have been no
discussions with any American city about moving the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Loria's limited partners aren't buying any of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years we wasted $25 million on office space \Rto
promote the concept of a new ballpark\S and on consultants and
architects,'' one of them told the ``Globe and Mail''. ``The option
couldn't be much more than $1 million _ or could even be negotiated
for less _ so why wouldn't you just renew it if you wanted to keep
the team here?`
</P>
<P>
   No one could blame Loria for wanting to move the team. Few
citizens in Montreal seem to care about the team. The Expos rarely
draw more 10,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   But putting the action to the desire has been all but impossible
since 1972. Major League Baseball has frowned on franchise
relocations, favoring poorly financed local buyers over well-heeled
out-of-towners who might move the team.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``blue ribbon'' economic panel recommended that franchises
be allowed to move as part of its plan to close the gap between
baseball's have and have nots, and MLB now is prepared to let that
happen.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of commissioner Bud Selig, former Giants vice
president Corey Busch, has begun updating and collecting data on
potential franchise locations. Busch is conducting site visits to
determine location stability in the event that a team relocates.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos aren't the only club that might have to pull up
stakes. The Twins, Athletics and Marlins also have been stymied in
their attempts to get the tax payers to fund new revenue-generating
stadiums needed to boost payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday means the Expos could be the first.
They won't, however, be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Spotlight Ex-Rangers reliever inspired by Paige
Chuck Smith can relate to Satchel Paige to a certain extent. Both
are pitchers, and both had to wait a while before making it to the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Paige didn't pitch in the majors until 1948, when he was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former Rangers farmhand traded to the Marlins in June,
toiled nine years in the minors before making it to the majors this
year, at the age of 30.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not really much of a comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Paige had to wait so long was because of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Smith had to wait is because he didn't have that
certain something _ a blazing fastball, knee-buckling curve or
darting slider _ that catches the eyes of scouts or coaches.
</P>
<P>
   And although Smith has held his own since the Rangers traded him
to the Marlins in June with a 2-4 record and 3.67 ERA, no one is
suggesting he has anything close to Paige's ability.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith will take any comparison to the old Negro Leagues star
that comes his way. After all, he wears a T-shirt of Paige under
his uniform every time he makes a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have certain things for inspiration,` Smith said. ``My
main inspiration is my dad. Other than that you use other players
in history who played they game to motivate you. Satchel Paige was
the one who gave me the motivation and the hope.`
</P>
<P>
   Smith became a Paige fan because of his coach in the Cleveland
City League, Johnny Roscoe, who always told his players about Negro
Leagues legends, even going as far as nicknaming the 7- and
8-year-olds after the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember this big center fielder,'' Smith said.
``\RRoscoe\S called him Josh Gibson \Rafter the slugging Negro
Leaguer\S because he hit a lit of home runs. Sometimes he called me
Satchel or Little Satchel. The names were always spoken so we knew
about those players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the bases loaded, he'd tell everybody in the field to
'Sit down, sit down,' and I'd strike out the next three guys. He
did that all the time because Satchel used to do that, only Satchel
made the guys go into the dugout.`
</P>
<P>
   Smith has a collection of Paige memorabilia, including photos
and plaques at his house in Chicago and a button he rubs before
each start.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Short hops
\Nsubheds:Wish come true Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley provided a
happy moment for a teen-ager stricken with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Make A Wish Foundation flew Cara Grodsky, 14, to Los Angeles
from Commack, Long Island, to meet Hundley last Sunday. After
spending part of the morning with Grodsky and her family, Hundley
hit two home runs in the game that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two home runs were for her,'' said Hundley, whose mother
has cancer. ``They are dedicated to Cara. I almost told Cara I'd
hit her one, but I didn't want to jinx myself. It was nice to put a
performance like that on for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a girl that age going through what she's going through
makes you realize what we're going through is nothing in
comparison. It's really humbling to see a girl that age going
through what she's going through and handling it that well. I'm
going through it with my mom. I know how tough it can be, what a
heartache it is.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Eyewitness to strange history Bobby Cox was a rookie
third baseman for the Yankees when outfielder Rocky Colavito took
to the mound and beat the Tigers in the first game of a
doubleheader on Aug. 25, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time a position player was the winning pitcher
in a big-league game until Rockies catcher Brent Mayne did it on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Cox was an eyewitness. Mayne pitched a scoreless
inning to beat Cox's Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Cox remembered that Colavito had to work a little harder for his
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were trailing, 5-0, when Colavito took over for
starter Steve Barber in the fourth inning. He pitched 22/3 shutout
innings, allowing one hit. He got the victory when the Yanks
mounted a comeback in the sixth inning, with Colavito scoring what
eventually proved to be the game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky could throw,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne entered the game against the Braves in the 12th inning,
after the Braves already had used nine pitchers. He allowed a hit
and walked a batter, but didn't surrender a run. He got the win
when the Rockies scored a run in the bottom of the inning off John
Rocker.
\Nsubheds:Slammin' Sammy Enron Field is only a few months old, but
it already has a legendary home run.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa smashed a home run Monday that hit near
the top of a light tower in left field, about 120-125 feet above
the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Cubs pitcher Kevin Tapani said. ``He made this look
like a Little League park.''
</P>
<P>
   The official estimate was a mere 457 feet, tying the Expos' Andy
Tracy for the longest ever at the Astros' new home. But players on
both teams disputed the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that ball went a foot, it went 550 feet,'' Astros left
fielder Lance Berkman said. ``There are only a handful of guys who
can hit a ball 550 feet, and he's one of them. I can guarantee you
that ball was approaching that distance. It wasn't even on its way
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Astros pitcher Scott Elarton, who gave up the homer, was
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't watch them,'' he said. ``But when that one
came off the bat, I turned around. I wanted to see it. That's the
most impressive home run I've ever seen. It was a pleasure to
watch.''
\Nsubheds:Bell puts Walker on DL During his playing days, Buddy
Bell was known for having a high pain tolerance. He supposedly once
had his knees drained between games of a doubleheader and played
both games.
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that it was the Rockies
manager's choice to put Larry Walker go on the DL after growing
tired of wondering from day to day when the oft-injured outfielder
could play.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who has an elbow injury that's curtailed his playing
time and reduced his effectiveness, didn't want to go on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still dumbfounded right now,` he said. ``It's their
decision, and I'm going to live with that. I'm not going to bash
the organization for doing this ... but I can still go out there
and play.`
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't play enough _ he's missed 43 games _ or well enough
_ he's batting .309 70 points lower than his average last year,
with just nine homers and 51 RBI _ to suit his manager, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the inconsistency of his playing time is what forced us
to make this decision,` Bell said. ``This is not something he's
real happy with, but we thought this is the right thing to do.`
\Nsubheds:Thomas grows from criticism Frank Thomas was ripped by
some of his old teammates after clashing with manager Jerry Manuel
during a spring training clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be the man, but he doesn't know how,'' former
White Sox shortstop Ozzie Guillen said. ``He's not the kind of guy
to be around young talent. He's not going to pull a player over and
explain something to him. He's not that type of player. The White
Sox thought he'd be the man to teach the kids how to play the game.
They were wrong, because he doesn't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sulk, Thomas took some of the criticism to heart.
Not only is he having an MVP-type season on the field, he has tried
to become more of a positive presence in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely made more of an effort to be a better teammate
this year,'' he said.
\Nsubheds:Around the NL
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, out since surgery on his left knee earlier this
season, has started taking batting practice. He still can't run,
but wants to return sometime next month. If he doesn't return and
prove he can play, the Padres could have a tough decision to make.
The 40-year-old outfielder intends to play next season, but the
club holds an option on his $6 million contract. The Padres have to
pick it up by the day after the World Series ends or Gwynn becomes
a free agent.

   Randy Johnson had 2,971 strikeouts before his start against the
Mets on Friday, 29 short of becoming the 12th player to reach 3,000
in his career. He also needs 29 to become the second player to
strike out 1,000 in a span of three seasons. Nolan Ryan fanned
1,079 from 1972-74.
</P>
<P>
   Third base has been a weak spot for the Cubs all season, but
manager Don Baylor has the solution for next year. Baylor hopes
that Tampa Bay will trade the underachieving Vinny Castilla, who is
due to make $7 million in next year. ``If we can put a big deal
together, \Rhealth\S will be the deciding factor,'' said Baylor,
who managed Castilla in Colorado. ``It's not going to be the money.
It's going to be whether he's the best guy we can get. To me, he's
not an American League guy because this is more of a fastball
league where \Rpitchers\S challenge you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield, who wasn't good enough to pitch for the Angels
in the wild-card race, has pitched well for the Phillies. He went
1-1 with a 2.89 ERA in his first four starts, displaying better
velocity than he did with the Angels. Bottenfield credits trainer
Jeff Cooper's shoulder stretching program for that.
</P>
<P>
   Padres third baseman Phil Nevin had reached base in 44
consecutive games going into the weekend. He was hitting .360
(59-for-164) with 13 doubles, 11 homers and 30 RBI in the streak.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles is the first Pirates player to hit 30 homers in
consecutive seasons since Willie Stargell did it in 1972-73. ``Good
players in this game are consistent,'' Giles said. ``You're not
going to get identical numbers as the year before, but if you can
stay in the same area and are consistent, that's when people think
of you as a pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are not optimistic that they'll be activate Mark
McGwire when active rosters expand on Sept. 1. McGwire last played
July 6 before a severe case of patella tendinitis in his right knee
put him on the bench. ``It hasn't really improved much and he's
been doing everything for it,'' manager Tony La Russa said. ``He's
been on time and hasn't missed one treatment, and hasn't gotten an
attitude about it. But when you're doing all that and it doesn't
improve, you start to worry.''
\Nsubheds:Around the AL The Indians faced a crossroads moment after
being swept by the Athletics from Aug. 14 to Aug. 16 to drop three
games out of the wild-card race. The A's completed the sweep by
rallying for three runs in the bottom of the ninth on Aug. 16.
``That ripped my heart out,'' GM John Hart said. ``In my tenure
here, only losing the seventh game of the 1997 World Series to
Florida hurt more.'' But rather than fold, the Indians recovered to
sweep the Mariners and take two of three from the A's. ``I'm
impressed,'' third baseman Travis Fryman said. ``I really felt we
could have gone one of two ways after losing that last game in
Oakland. But we've really played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics thought the Twins were just making a public-relations
gesture designed to persuade voters to give them a new stadium when
they signed pitcher Brad Radke to a four-year, $36 million deal,
but when they gave second-year shortstop Cristian Guzman a deal
that could pay him as much as $14 million over five years it proved
that they might be serious about rebuilding. ``He's an important
part of our future,'' GM Terry Ryan said. ``It's a lengthy
contract, but he's a young player with a high upside, and we like
what we see in him.'' The Twins want to get outfielders Matt Lawton
and Jacque Jones, pitcher Eric Milton and third baseman Corey
Koskie signed to long-term deals in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   A's hitting coach Thad Bosley scuffled with third baseman Eric
Chavez in the dugout in the late innings of a loss to the Tigers on
Monday night. According to one photographer, the coach and player
had to be forcibly separated by teammates. Bosley, already upset
that Ramon Hernandez swung at the first pitch and grounded out to
kill a rally in the seventh-inning, wasn't pleased when Chavez
offered at Danny Patterson's first pitch of the eighth and popped
out in foul ground. ``A lot of our young players do not know how to
play the game on the major-league level,'' Bosley said. ``As part
of the growing pains, you inadvertently put yourself in situations
you could avoid or don't put yourself in situations you could take
advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' 8-7 victory against the Rangers on Thursday raised
their record to just 17-14 in one-run games. It also was the first
time in five tries they were able to get 16 games over .500. They
were 26 games over at the same point last year.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox are trying to reduce lefty reliever Kelly Wunsch's
workload. He had pitched in just three of the team's past 10 games
through Thursday. But the former Texas A&AMP;M pitcher still led the
league with 66 appearances, four more than the Rangers' Mike
Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins' Guzman hit his 19th triple of the season on
Wednesday, putting him on the brink of becoming the first player
with 20 in a season the Mets' Lance Johnson in 1996, and only the
second since 1985.
\Nsubheds:The week ahead While four of the top five teams in the AL
wild-card standings all have at least one series against a
contending team, the resurgent Tigers have a chance to climb into
the race. They are at Baltimore for three games before returning
home for three games against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In the National League, the Cardinals play host to the Mets next
weekend in the only series between contending teams.
\Nsubheds:The last word ``What happens if I hit .399? I'm just
trying to have a good year, and help my team win. I think
everybody's making too big a deal about this.` _ Todd Helton, on
the quest for .400

   ``What if the sun rose in the west?
</P>
<P>
   What if the South won the Civil War?
</P>
<P>
   What if JFK dodged his bullet, Elvis kicked his habit and Nicole
Simpson lived to tell her story?
</P>
<P>
   And just what if Dwight Clark dropped the damn ball, Bill
Buckner caught the ball, John Havlicek didn't steal the ball and
other monumental sports moments likewise took drastically different
forks in the road?''
SOMEWHERE IN A PARTIALLY PARALLEL, YET COMPLETELY ASKEW UNIVERSE _
Helllllooouuu! and welcome to The NPSE (Neatly Packaged Sports
Entertainment) SportsCenter. I'm Keith Olbermann and from way
downtown, BANG!, we've got a show with more biscuits in baskets
than happy hour at Cracker Barrel. So, gentlemen, start your
digestive tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Later, an examination of how we put a man on Mars thanks to the
stupendous Challenger Space Shuttle, yet are still cheated out of
German imports like Dirk Nowitzki, Steffi Graf and Beck's thanks to
the stubborn Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   But first to the U.S. Open where, surprise!, Woods has done it
again.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Tigress Woods captured her fifth tennis major
today with a dramatic three-set victory over Venus Williams in New
York. After failing to lose a single set at the French Open and
Wimbledon, this time Tigress was tamed _ for a while anyway.
</P>
<P>
   To the highlights and there's Richard Williams, staring down
Earl Woods in the guest box. Venus in her beads, Tigress with her
trademark red Nike dress. The kind of classic matchup that's
pushing tennis to unprecedented popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won the first set and didn't trail until late in the
third, when Woods lofts this perfect drop shot on break point. Look
at the excitable Tigress, running and pointing to the ball as it
skims over the net and paints the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the touch, now the torch. Match point, Tigress. And
she hit the ball, real hard. A 142-mph serve! Ace. Set. Match. Fist
pump.
</P>
<P>
   A valiant Venus gets more respect than even Rodney Daingerfield.
But at just 24, Tigress gets to join the game's all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think,'' said Tigress' mom, Tida, ``when I got pregnant
we were hoping for a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes ...
</P>
<P>
   Chew on that terrifying image, then come back for head-first
baseball info from Hall-of-Famer Pete Rose after these commercial
questions ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Buddy Holly missed his flight?
</P>
<P>
   What if Brandi Chastain forgot her sports bra?
</P>
<P>
   What if Wally Pipp didn't take a day off?''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose here in Boston where the Ruthian Rune is alive and
well in baseball's city of champions.
</P>
<P>
   A dynasty with formidable footsteps back to the gutsy signings
of Shoeless Joe Jackson and Jackie Robinson, the Red Sox today
earned a chance for their record 26th World Series by again
pounding the cursed Yankees in the American League Championship
Series. This time the Red Sox held their own Boston Three Party _
consecutive shutouts by Pedro Martinez, Roger Clemens and Bill
``Spaceman'' Lee. The sweep continues almost 100 years of dominance
over the Yankees, dating back to the best deal never made _
deciding not to sell Babe Ruth to the Bronx Bummers for $100,000 in
1919.
</P>
<P>
   On hand were former Sox Series heroes Ted Williams, Luis
Aparicio, Bill Buckner and _ I'll bet you anything _ somewhere the
Babe was smiling down on Fenway as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some centuries you're the home run, some centuries you're just
the long strike,'' opined Red Sox GM Carlton Fisk. ``I'd hate to be
a Red Sox fan today if Babe ever played in pinstripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Also of note, the Rangers re-signed 60-homer star Sammy Sosa.
That's the same Sosa Texas actually once flirted with trading for
has-been Harold Baines and never-was Fred Manrique. Without Sosa,
that pitching rotation of Kevin Brown-Nolan Ryan-Wilson
Alvarez-Kenny Rogers-Rick Helling wouldn't have been so imposing
during their World Series run in '93 ...
</P>
<P>
   Next to Pittsburgh, where NFL insider Jackie Smith tries to
latch onto knowledge like he did that sliding touchdown catch back
in Super Bowl XIII ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What if John Lennon stayed in for room service?
</P>
<P>
   What if Bill Clinton told the whole truth?
</P>
<P>
   What if Bo Jackson only bruised his hip?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Smith reporting from Two Rivers Stadium where these fans
are crying in their tear-able towels after another dry playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled coach L.C. Greenwood's Steelers have served as
launching pad for the NFL's last three dynasties, the first for the
Raiders ignited by Franco Harris' Immaculate Deception
incompletion. Then the Cowboys, who benefited from a pair of
controversial offensive interference penalties on Lynn Swann to
beat Pittsburgh in Super Bowl X. And finally the Bills, who beat
the Steelers in their first playoff game and have since won four
consecutive Super Bowls, the first when Scott Norwood sneaked that
dramatic game-winning field goal just inside the right upright
against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the Steel Curtain is Still Hurtin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when Drew Pearson dropped that Hail Mary from Kevin
Sweeney against the Vikings,'' said interim owner Mickey Rooney,
who accepted the floundering franchise when founder Art Rooney
found no takers to keep it in the family. ``Or when Dwight Clark
made The Drop from old, um, whatshizname in San Francisco. Or when
Roger Staubach decided to stay in the Navy and owner Clint
Murchison covered the hole in Texas Stadium in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources tell me that Rooney has an offer to buy the team from
Arkansas oil man Jerry Jones, and that Jones is considering any of
500 coaches, including Notre Dame's two-time championship boss,
Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, the NFL has sympathetically decided to put former
Packers coach Vince Lombardi's name on a trophy _ the Tokyo
American Bowl. Lombardi, you'll remember, sent his franchise into a
tundra tailspin by forgoing a game-tying field goal for a risky
quarterback sneak late in the Ice Bowl against the Cowboys.
Quarterback Bart Starr slipped on the frozen field, sending Dallas
to its first title and ensuring the engraving of the Tom Landry
Super Bowl trophy ...
</P>
<P>
   He overcame a broken finger for the Mavericks in Game 7 of the
'88 Western Conference Finals. Next, he'll put his healthy thumb on
the pulse of the NBA. Mark Aguirre shoots straight ahead ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Cindy Crawford's mole was on the tip of her nose?
</P>
<P>
   What if Bobby Riggs beat Billie Jean King?
</P>
<P>
   What if Shawn Bradley was 6-foot-7?''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Aguirre live in Portland where Michael Jordan is announcing
his retirement from the Blazers to pursue a career as a mortal
owner. The move, on the heels of Portland's sixth championship in
eight years, closes the book on the NBA's most successful dynasty
since my Mavericks' run around the turn of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   After leading North Carolina to the NCAA crown in '82, Jordan
was drafted second by the Blazers, sandwiched between No. 1 Akeem
Olajuwon to the Rockets and Sam Bowie to the Bulls at No. 3.
Flanked by athletic, scoring forwards Len Bias and Hank Gathers,
Jordan won an unprecedented eight scoring titles and six MVPs as
the game's best all-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little cocky since he wasn't cut in high school,''
said Blazers coach Phil Jackson. ``But, Zen-amee Christmas, he's
good enough to win multiple championships with the Washington
Generals.''
</P>
<P>
   In other news, ho-hum, the Mavericks' foundation will be back
next season with the re-signing of the NBA's winningest coach, Dick
Motta, and star forwards Karl Malone and Roy Tarpley. Malone has
been a 12-time All-Star since the Mavs drafted him over Detlef
Schrempf in '85 and rumors of Tarpley's addiction problems vanished
during Dallas' four-championship run kick-started by the upset of
the Lakers in '88. The team also announced its new downtown arena
will be named Carter Coliseum after founding father Don Carter ...
</P>
<P>
   Now back to the NPSE studio, where Keith Olbermann will wrap-up
this show tighter than Allen Iverson's snug shorts ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Magic Johnson stayed monogamous?
</P>
<P>
   What if Mike Tyson was human, even humane?
</P>
<P>
   What if Brett Hull's goal was disallowed?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, our random news and notes start in golf where Bob May
held off Thomas Bjorn to win the PGA, making him the eighth
consecutive different winner in a major. That result was received
as apathetically as reality-based TV by a gallery still groaning
that Ben Hogan could've won four of five majors had he not been
disabled after that '49 car crash ...
</P>
<P>
   Looks like the NHL isn't migrating south after all since owners
again voted down expansion to Southern cities Miami, Phoenix and
Dallas. Analysts say L.A. Kings owner Bruce McNall's failed attempt
to lure Wayne Gretzky to the U.S. might abort the birth of the game
south of the Mason-Dixon ...
</P>
<P>
   In boxing, Joe Frazier was honored as the greatest fighter of
the 20th Century. In a fiery acceptance speech, Frazier bristled at
skeptics claiming Cassius Clay would have been the better fighter
had he not complied with his U.S. Army drafting and subsequently
become the most decorated soldier in Vietnam, and later promoted to
five-star general Muhummad Ali ...
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Did You Know that me turning down the offer from MSNBC
was the best career move since Alvin Harper stayed with the
Cowboys, John Daly stayed on the wagon and Sonny stayed with Cher?
</P>
<P>
   Tip strong, drive safe and, as Rush Limbaugh mandates on Monday
Night Football, ``Right is right and left is wrong, this party's
over, so douse the bong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What if everything in sports _ from Martina Navratilova's
sexuality to Lance Armstrong's cancer _ occurs not by happenstance,
but for a predestined purpose with far-reaching tentacles and
incomprehensible, domino-effect ramifications?
</P>
<P>
   Or not.
</P>
<P>
   What if it's just that ... sport happens?''

SUSPENSIONS DONE, BUT NOT FLU BUG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Gary Sheffield's five-game suspension is over, but his
flu bug remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers went 4-1 during Sheffield's suspension and he's
eligible to play in today's series finale with the Chicago Cubs.
But the Dodgers aren't expecting Sheffield back until Monday in
Milwaukee _ and that's at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awful congested and still not feeling well,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' plan is to have Sheffield fly to Milwaukee today
and join the team at the hotel after they bus from Chicago. But
that's contingent on Sheffield's health, which trainer Stan
Johnston said is improving.
</P>
<P>
   While Sheffield's last five games were missed due to the
suspension, he's actually missed the last six. He became ill before
the Dodgers' win Tuesday, but he didn't drop his appeal of the
suspension until Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, flu-like symptoms have also kept Dodgers right-hander
Kevin Brown in his Chicago hotel room and his start Monday in
Milwaukee is in jeopardy. Of course, Brown has a history of
pitching well when he's not feeling his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been able to throw and he normally likes to throw
two or three times,'' Johnson said. ``I don't know (about his
start). If he's not here, he must be sick.''
</P>
<P>
   SUBPOENA TALK: A day after seven members of the Dodgers
organization were served with subpoenas to testify in the criminal
case of Ronald Camacho's charge of disorderly conduct stemming from
a fight with fans at Wrigley Field on May 16, several more players
were served with subpoenas for the criminal case of Charles Carlin,
also arrested for disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mike Abernathy, the Chicago-based attorney representing
the Dodgers players, is expected to file a motion to strike the
subpoenas, a Dodgers official said.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone, manager Davey Johnson, coaches
Rick Dempsey and Glenn Hoffman and players Gary Sheffield, Shawn
Green and Chad Kreuter were each served subpoenas, through
Abernathy, in the Camacho case.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Shelby, Hoffman and Dempsey and the 16 players
originally suspended by baseball Sheffield, Kreuter, Green, Carlos
Perez, Mike Fetters, F.P. Santangelo, Geronimo Berroa, Todd
Hundley, Eric Karros, Eric Gagne, Darren Dreifort, Alan Mills, Onan
Masaoka, Chan Ho Park, Antonio Osuna and Terry Adams were notified
Saturday they were served with subpoenas in the Carlin case.
</P>
<P>
   No subpoenas were served in the disorderly conduct cast of a
third person arrested, James Maness, in the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   DEVO DOING BETTER: Upon further review, the Dodgers coaching
staff said center fielder Devon White's left quadriceps, which he
injured in the ninth inning of Friday's second game, isn't as bad
as initially thought. A stint on the disabled list seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   White, who missed nearly three months with a partially torn left
rotator cuff, said he felt much better and added he was day-to-day.
However, he also said team doctors told him he'd likely miss at
least five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you haven't played, it doesn't matter what kind of shape
you stay in,'' White said. ``I played in what, 35 games (actually
45)? Your body isn't used to it. When you play 18 innings and play
going hard, you can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the injury isn't severe, the Dodgers still recalled
outfielder Bruce Aven from Triple-A Albuquerque and sent
right-hander Mike Judd back to the minors so they would not be left
short-handed.
</P>
<P>
   With White's and Sheffield's predicaments, Aven became the
Dodgers' third healthy and able outfielder and started in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired in an Aug. 6 trade with Pittsburgh, Aven was batting
.281 with three RBI in nine games for the Dukes. He hit .250 with
five homers for Pittsburgh. &QL;

UNSHADED TAKES TRAVERS WITH LATE SURGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ It was a tale of two owners' boxes as
the 131st running of the Travers Stakes on Saturday roared into the
final hundred yards, with two 3-year-olds hip to hip, trading the
lead snout by snout. In one box, the trainer Nick Zito and the
owner Tracy Farmer stomped their feet and talked to a television
screen, urging their colt Albert the Great to please, please hang
on.
</P>
<P>
   In the other, the trainer Carl Nafzger and the owner James Tafel
alternated glances between the hard-striding Unshaded and the
encroaching finish line. With a record crowd for the Midsummer
Derby of 54,116 in full-throated suspense, it was Nafzger and Tafel
who got to leap to their feet victoriously as Unshaded got his head
in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane, baby, did you win that race or what?'' Nafzger said to
the winning jockey, Shane Sellers, when the two finally got to talk
minutes after the race.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, indeed, was the difference in the stretch duel after
spotting Jorge Chavez and Albert the Great 6 lengths with a
half-mile left in the mile-and-a-quarter race. Twice before, in the
Belmont and in the Jim Dandy Stakes, Sellers and his closer had
loped behind the field and found a finishing kick only good enough
for third place. Not this time. Sellers turned his gelding lose at
the final turn, picked off Milwaukee Brew and Curule, then split
the favorite, Dixie Union, and Commendable. Only Albert the Great
remained, which was something of a surprise after he finished dead
last in the Jim Dandy, 28{ lengths behind the winner, Graeme Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But Zito believed his colt was better than that; after all, he
had won four straight before the Dandy debacle, and Zito replaced
the jockey Richard Migliore with Chavez. As Albert the Great
rocketed forward in midstretch, Zito looked as if he would win his
first Travers in eight tries with a colt dismissed by the public at
8-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fighting neck and neck, head and head,'' said Chavez.
``It was tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Unshaded, with Sellers smacking his right hind side with the
whip, was bounding up on Albert the Great with strides that just
skipped over the ground. ``From the eighth pole to the sixteenth, I
wasn't sure we were going to get there,'' Nafzger confessed. Tafel
was also not too sure he would collect the $600,000 first-place
check. ``They were ding-donging at each other, and I was just
praying that pedigree of Unbridled would kick in,'' he said,
referring to Unshaded's sire.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers knew it would. He had ridden Unshaded for four races
since winning the Lexington Stakes in April and knew the strapping
gelding was difficult, bordering on ornery. The same has been said
of Sellers, who acknowledged that he was on medication for anger
management.
</P>
<P>
   In their box, Zito and Farmer were on the edge of their seats as
Albert the Great held the lead up until the last 20 yards. But as
Unshaded surged forward and stopped the clock at 2:02.59, they went
silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the toughest races I've ever experienced,''
said Zito, who finished second to Will's Way here with Louis
Quatorze in 1996. ``Jorge rode the race I wanted him to ride.
Unfortunately, he came a nose short. We just missed; that's what it
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sellers, it was about moving on. He confessed the victory
was especially gratifying at a time when he was trying to mend
fences with trainers he had alienated along the way. ``I've tried
to change my attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Nafzger, it was about keeping his promises. Since February,
he has said Unshaded would become just the fifth gelding to win the
Travers and that Tafel would have his colors painted on the canoe
in the lake of the infield as tradition dictates for the winners.
It was also about family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my foot in my mouth and he pulls it out,'' he said of
Unshaded.

DODGERS WIN STREAK ENDS AT FIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The bullpen was tired _ not exhausted, but a little
worn from a doubleheader. And reliever Gregg Olson was offered the
opportunity to get back into the meaningful mix.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a one-run Dodgers lead turned into a two-run deficit
and eventually a 6-4 Chicago Cubs win on Saturday that stopped the
Dodgers' Wrigley Field winning streak at eight. The Dodgers also
had their five-game winning streak halted.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges' five innings against the Cubs was his shortest
start, but he was in line for the win until Olson allowed a
sixth-inning RBI single to Rondell White to tie it 4-4. White left
the game after dislocating his left shoulder on a stolen base
attempt two batters later.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs went ahead on Ricky Gutierrez's homer to start the
seventh inning. Jeff Reed then walked, moved to third on Gary
Matthews Jr.'s infield single and throwing error by catcher Todd
Hundley and scored on Eric Young's sacrifice fly. That was also
Olson's last batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of frustrating to me,'' said Olson, thrust into his
first meaningful appearance since returning from the disabled list
late last month. ``I didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance proved that while the Dodgers starting rotation
may be more consistent with rookie right-hander Matt Herges in it,
the bullpen is left thin when lefty Carlos Perez starts.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, after watching Perez pitch a strong 61/3 innings in
winning the second game of Friday's doubleheader, and seeing Herges
allow three runs on four hits in five innings Saturday, the two are
expected to flip roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'd prefer not to (switch back), but I totally
understand,'' Herges said. ``If I was out there and won four games
and was dealing, it would be difficult. But that's not the case.
I'm not going to be upset about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A switch in the other manner is how Herges wound up in the
starting rotation after going 8-0 in relief, and how Perez wound up
in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Herges didn't figure in this loss, but he's 0-3 with a 5.25 ERA
as a starter and the Dodgers have lost each of his four starts. He
had a 3.04 ERA as a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson stopped short of announcing Perez
was returning to the starting rotation, but all indications are the
left-hander will start Thursday's series finale in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herges pitched well enough for me to stay in there,'' Johnson
said. ``Sometimes in the course of a game he'll get to rushing to
hold a guy on base. The problem is he's also needed in the bullpen
and he's more suited to do stuff in the bullpen than Carlos. Plus,
we're going to be facing a club that Carlos should have pretty good
success against.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the role Johnson used Olson in is the same one in
which Herges prospered much of the season. Holding leads was
Herges' specialty, but when he was added to the rotation early in
the month, that role was transferred to Terry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has pitched a lot lately, including getting five outs in
Friday's second game. With Mike Fetters under the weather and
having pitched the day before, as did Antonio Osuna, the options in
the bullpen were limited.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hopeful that Perez can take the success he's had
in the bullpen and become an effective starter. He was 0-0 with
1.90 ERA in seven relief appearances, and his start Friday proved
he can still get people out as he won for the first time since May
20.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to have a knack for stepping up at crucial times and
giving us what we need,'' Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen
said. ``He probably does that better than he's in the starting
rotation. It shows he's capable of pitching well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key with all pitchers that pitch like that is making
pitches to get people in big spots. He did that. Another
improvement he's made is not nearly as many pitches, particularly
on his splitter, are cutting in on the hitters. He's staying behind
the ball.'' &QL;

IF YOU LIKE NUMBERS, LIKE THE GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a month left in the season and Arizona and San Francisco
should battle it out to the end for the National League West title.
But why wait?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not waste a month watching how the addition of Curt
Schilling pans out, how the recent dominance of Livan Hernandez
factors in or the managerial styles of Dusty Baker or Buck
Showalter aid or hurt their respective teams. Forget about the
possibility of great showdowns in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, let's boil the pennant race down to what baseball has
become _ a numbers game that offers only a slight bit of substance.
</P>
<P>
   A thought crossed the mind to get a few accountants to help out,
ya know, with all the numbers that are going to be involved. But
the accountants start talking about tax shelters for players or
managers who are free-agents-to-be, and they lose sight of the real
matter.
</P>
<P>
   This about finding out who's going to win the West.
</P>
<P>
   So, since baseball writers are experts anyway, here's a go at
it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Diamondbacks' last 35 games, 22 are against teams with a
record better than .500. They played on Saturday and again today,
have six left with the Atlanta Braves and Dodgers, and eight with
the Giants. The Diamondbacks also play 10 games against Florida
(62-65) and Colorado (64-64). The remaining three games are at
Montreal, where Arizona's won four times in 12 tries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Giants' 34 remaining games, 22 are against teams with a
losing record. They also play 16 games against the National
League's worst teams in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   EDGE: Giants.
</P>
<P>
   But opponent record isn't the only factor. The Diamondbacks play
12 of their last 35 games at Bank One Ballpark, where they're
42-27. Arizona is 28-30 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are home for 29 of their final 34 games, and they're
43-20 at Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely have a tougher schedule than we do,'' Giants
first baseman J.T. Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an advantage right now, you can say the schedule
looks in our favor,'' said Giants shortstop Rich Aurilia. ``We're
probably playing more teams under .500. Hopefully, in our scenario,
we can gain some ground before we play them in September.''
</P>
<P>
   EDGE: Giants.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Arizona remains tight with the Giants, who led by 3{
games entering Saturday, they have a shot. Arizona and San
Francisco play one another eight times in the final 11 days of the
season. They have a five-game series at Pac Bell Park, which
includes a doubleheader, and they end the season with three games
at Bank One Ballpark. That means four games started by Randy
Johnson and Schilling for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona should also get a lift from right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre. He pitched in a rehab start Wednesday and is slated to
pitch either Sept. 2 or 3 for the Diamondbacks. Stottlemyre is a
great clubhouse guy who brings grit and moxie to the mound. His
return should provide lift to a starting rotation in need of one.
</P>
<P>
   Numerology, in the warped baseball sense, says the Giants should
walk away with the division. Talent, especially in the starting
pitching, says Arizona could win it late.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would love to be factored into the equation, and
they have a numerological right. They're seven games into a stretch
of playing 21 straight against teams with losing records. And they
were 44-26 against teams with a current record below .500.
</P>
<P>
   However, they also play 19 of their final 29 games at home. And
there's nothing good about the way they play at Chavez Ravine.
While the Dodgers have the second best road record (35-31) in the
National League, their 32-30 mark at home is the worst of any NL
club above .500.
</P>
<P>
   So when it comes down to it, flip a coin, call heads ... and
figure the Giants will win. Chances are 50-50. &QL;

LIEBERTHAL: PHILLIES NEED ARMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Lieberthal has a multiyear contract, he's
having another solid season, and Philadelphia management is secure
in his standing. And the Westlake Village, Calif., native is also
feeling good about his place.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal, for the second year in a row, has told management
how important it would be for the last-place Phillies (53-74) to go
out and get some pitching in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is the key,'' said Lieberthal, batting .286 with 15
home runs and 70 RBI. ``We've got to go out and try to get what we
can get. It's definitely a need.
</P>
<P>
   Atop that list is finding a No.1 starter, which, of course, is a
monumental task. The Phillies already gave up one of the best
pitchers in baseball when they traded Curt Schilling to Arizona
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball isn't overflowing with pitchers that can anchor a staff
_ there's maybe 10 tops _ and Mets left-hander Mike Hampton is the
biggest name in the free-agent market. But it's unlikely the
Phillies are going to want to spend $60 to $70 million to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been losing a lot of games lately,'' Lieberthal said,
``and it would be nice to get a No.1 guy to fill Schilling's spot.
I don't know what management is thinking, but if there's money
available, I think they have to try to spend it and make a
difference because of the young starting players were have here
like (Bobby) Abreu, myself, (Scott) Rolen, (Pat) Burrell, (Travis)
Lee. We've got to do something because we have a good lineup. We
need to address our needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only chance we'll have is with better pitching. There's a
desperate need to do something. I think it would be really hard to
compete if we don't. Look at our division. The Mets and Braves are
always trying to get better. And I'm sure they'll both try to make
changes after the season that they need to make. I think we need to
do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYNE MAN: Rockies catcher Brent Mayne became the first position
player in 32 years to win a decision when Colorado used him in the
12th inning against Atlanta on Tuesday. The Yankees' Rocky Colavito
last accomplished it Aug. 25, 1968. Ironically, Braves manager
Bobby Cox was at both games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unique, that's why I remember now,'' said Cox, who
first had to be reminded he was there. He played third base for the
Yankees that day.
</P>
<P>
   NOW THAT'S IMPRESSIVE: Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa hit a homer
measured at 457 feet at Houston's Enron Field, though the folks at
the new ballpark have shown an ability to underestimate the
distance of mammoth homers hit by opposing players.
</P>
<P>
   When Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield homered off the light
tower, it was estimated to travel 450 feet. Sosa's shot, by
accounts of players at the game, hit the light tower about 100 feet
above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that ball went a foot, it went 550 feet,'' Houston left
fielder Lance Berkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Scott Elarton, the guy who gave up the homer, took a
glimpse at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't watch them,'' Elarton said. ``But when that
one came off the bat, I turned around. I wanted to see it. That's
the most impressive home run I've ever seen. It was a pleasure to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNTAINS: All is not going well in Colorado, especially
the relationship between one-time Coors Field darling Larry Walker
and manager Buddy Bell. Walker, the ever-injured right fielder, was
placed on the disabled list because the Rockies grew tired of
needing a daily update on Walker's playing condition.
</P>
<P>
   Walker missed 94 games the last two years with elbow problems,
and he's missed 45 this season because of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy,'' Walker said. ``It's the decision they made.
They really caught me off guard. ... I didn't know what to say when
I was in his office.'' &QL;

<P>
   The story can now be told. Tom Grieve's secretary saved the day.
If Judy Johns had not intervened that fateful day 11 years ago, the
unthinkable would have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa would probably be still playing for the Chicago White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I probably wouldn't be general manager anymore,'' said
Grieve, retelling the now familiar story from his office at The
Ballpark in Arlington. ``I'd probably be back in group sales or
doing the color on the television broadcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   He shuddered at the thought as he glanced at the diamond-studded
World Series ring on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately,'' Grieve said, closing his eyes. ``Nature called
at the right time ... ' ''
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang and Johns picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Grieve's office,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this is Larry Himes with the Chicago White Sox. I need
to talk to him urgently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he's taking care of another urgent matter. I'll have him
call you back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just tell him this,'' Himes said. ``I have another offer for
Harold Baines. If he doesn't get back to me in 10 minutes, Baines
is going to Baltimore. I'm ready to accept his offer, but if he
doesn't call back in 10 minutes, he loses out on Baines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm ... what's our offer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Sosa, Wilson Alvarez and Scott Fletcher for Baines and
Fred Manrique.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind, just tell Tom to call me in 10 minutes or no
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mr. Himes.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns hung up the phone, and Grieve returned a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody call?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Johns said. ``Larry Himes called. Said he was going to
have lunch with Jerry Reinsdorf but to call him back in an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieve chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine,'' he said. ``We really almost traded Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine where the Rangers have been without
him, although Grieve admitted that the first three years were
tough. Sosa was barely adequate in center field in 1990-92, he was
terrible at the plate and he was hurt half the time. Grieve became
extremely frustrated, and admitted that Sosa's lousy performance
was just one of many reasons why Bobby Valentine was fired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a scoop for you,'' Grieve said. ``Remember Himes
getting fired by the White Sox and then hired by the Cubs? He was
still hot after Sosa. I almost traded Sosa for George Bell in
1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness he didn't, because it all came together in 1993,
the first year of Kevin Kennedy's glorious reign as Rangers
manager. Sosa hit 33 home runs and drove in 93 runs, teaming with
Jose Canseco, Juan Gonzalez, Dean Palmer, Ivan Rodriguez and Rafael
Palmeiro to form the greatest lineup in the history of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did Sosa have a great year, but he turned into a
great team leader,'' Grieve said. ``Let me give you an example.
Canseco wanted to pitch. Said it was his dream. Kennedy was fool
enough to give him the chance. But Sosa got in his face, said Jose,
knock it off, get serious, we're trying to win. Threatened to beat
the living tar out of him if Canseco tried to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   With a formidable pitching staff of Alvarez, Kenny Rogers and
Kevin Brown, the Rangers marched through the playoffs, taking the
Toronto Blue Jays in six and sweeping the Philadelphia Phillies in
the World Series. Grieve still remembers weeping after Alvarez's
two-hit shutout in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you another scoop,'' Grieve said. ``You remember
Palmeiro was a free agent after 1993? We almost lost him.''
</P>
<P>
   Really?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' Grieve said. ``Sosa saved us again. He was the
one who realized we were only a couple million apart. He went to
Palmeiro's house, grabbed him by the neck and dragged him into Tom
Schieffer's office. Told 'em they had 10 minutes to get it done. We
were two minutes away from signing Will Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy saved us so many times,'' Grieve said. ``After the
strike was over, he was the one who got Kevin Brown and Schieffer
to sit down and settle their many differences. Otherwise, Brown
would have been gone, too. Plus it was Brown who convinced Kenny
Rogers to stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   That's almost unthinkable, the Rangers without Brown, Rogers,
Alvarez, Palmeiro, Palmer or Sosa. The heart of the greatest
dynasty of the '90s scattered to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still bothers me that Cleveland beat us out in 1995,''
Grieve said. ``Schieffer was so mad he almost fired me and Kennedy.
Thank goodness] we won the World Series the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but it was Sosa, Gonzalez and Brown who saved
baseball in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly a remarkable year,'' Grieve said. ``I never thought a
guy could hit 75 homers in one year. Boy, did McGwire pick a bad
year to hit 70. I never thought a guy could drive in 200 runs. I
never thought a pitcher could win 30 games anymore. Of course, I
never thought a team could win 130 games either.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Grieve ever expect a $150 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as people keep paying $25 for bleacher seats, we'll be
all right,'' Grieve said. ``Thank goodness for Sammy. I'll give you
another scoop. After last season, Detroit called, heard we needed
to cut payroll and asked if we'd trade Sammy. They offered six
pretty good players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them there no way I would ever trade Sammy Sosa.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   After throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to Drew Pearson to ice
the Cowboys' 27-17 victory against the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl
XVII, quarterback Danny White leaped into the arms of offensive
tackle Pat Donovan. Another season, another title.
</P>
<P>
   It could've happened.
</P>
<P>
   If only Dwight Clark had been an inch shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys have to live with the nightmare of ``Brown
Left, Slot Sprint, Right Option.'' Or, as it is referred to in San
Francisco, ``The Catch.''

   The greatest ``what if'' in Cowboys' history is the 6-yard
touchdown catch by the 6-foot-4 Clark on a pass from Joe Montana
with 51 seconds remaining in the 1981 NFC Championship Game. The
play changed the course of both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the one single play I can remember
in Cowboys' history had more to do with the future history of the
team than any other,'' said Tex Schramm, the team's president and
general manager from 1960-1989. ``I think it changed the whole
progress of our team. We went downhill from that point.''
</P>
<P>
   What if ``The Catch'' hadn't happened?
</P>
<P>
   Would Clark have become Jackie Smith, a player best remembered
for the catch he didn't make?
</P>
<P>
   Would Montana have become Dan Marino, the greatest quarterback
never to win a Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Would White have become Troy Aikman, a three-time Super Bowl
winner?
</P>
<P>
   Would the 49ers have become the Buffalo Bills, the league's
lovable losers?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Cowboys have become the Team of the 1980s, a title
bestowed on the 49ers?
</P>
<P>
   Would Aikman and Emmitt Smith be Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   Would Jerry Jones be an unknown pizza parlor owner?
</P>
<P>
   Would Jimmy Johnson be sailing in the Keys?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how you can look at one play, and it changes
``everything'','' said Joe Theismann, the Washington Redskins
quarterback in their 31-17 victory against the Cowboys in the 1982
NFC Championship Game and Super Bowl XVII victory against the
Dolphins. ``This is where I get a kick out of players. Players love
to make excuses and say one play did not make the difference in the
game. Baloney. One play in a football game can be extremely
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who had lost seven of their past nine meetings with
the Cowboys, including two postseason games, trailed the Cowboys,
27-21, with 4:54 remaining. In 13 plays, Montana drove the 49ers 89
yards to the Cowboys' 6, where they faced third-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline before the play, 49ers coach Bill Walsh told
Montana, ``If you don't get what you want, then simply throw the
ball away. OK? You know what I mean? Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Not
there, away it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana took the snap and rolled to his right, away from the
pressure of defensive end Harvey Martin. Clark danced around in the
back of the end zone, trying to free himself from rookie cornerback
Everson Walls.
</P>
<P>
   With Martin about to sack Montana, and defensive end Ed ``Too
Tall'' Jones in his face, Montana tried to heave the ball out of
the back of the end zone. Instead, Clark jumped high enough to pull
the ball down with 51 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   As legend has it, Montana knew what happened only because of the
deafening cheers from the Candlestick Park crowd of 60,525. One of
the Cowboys players reportedly said to him, ``You just beat
America's Team.'' To which Montana responded, ``Well, you can join
the rest of America and watch the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers went on to defeat the Cincinnati Bengals, 26-21, in
Super Bowl XVI, the first of their five championships over 14
seasons. The Cowboys had to wait 11 more years for their third
Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had gotten past us that day, I think they would have
won the Super Bowl, because they were a hell of a team,'' said
Clark, now the director of football operations for the Cleveland
Browns. ``I think Tom Landry has another Super Bowl ring and trophy
if not for `The Catch,' and then who knows what would have
happened. They went to the championship game \Ragainst the
Redskins\S the next year, so maybe they would have parlayed that
into an additional Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who replaced Roger Staubach as the Cowboys starter in
1980, completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 21,959 yards and 155
touchdowns in 13 seasons. But White ended his career forever known
for his inability to win the big game.
</P>
<P>
   After their back-to-back championship game appearances in 1981
and '82, the Cowboys made the playoffs only twice, with no
victories, in Landry's final six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a tragic turning point in the career of Danny
White,'' Schramm said of ``The Catch.'' ``If we had won that game,
he gains confidence and everything that comes with having won that
game and the Super Bowl. He would have gone on to become a great
quarterback, not necessarily a Roger Staubach, but better than most
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   White, now the coach of the Arena League Arizona Rattlers, would
rather not replay the past. He said he is satisfied with his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that winning the big game is how quarterbacks
are measured,'' White said. ``There have been a lot of very average
quarterbacks who have won Super Bowls. A great quarterback on a bad
team is remembered a lot less than a great quarterback on a great
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very lucky to have come along when I did and have the
success I did in the National Football League. I don't feel
deprived at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, however, knows his life changed forever on Jan. 10, 1982.
Although he retired after the 1987 season as San Francisco's
all-time leading receiver with 506 receptions, Clark made only one
catch anybody remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't happened, I think my career would have continued,
but there wouldn't be one defining moment I don't think,'' Clark
said. ``There were no defining moments during my career other than
that one. There were several other catches, but nothing like that
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been a drop, now that that's a different story. I
may have been out of there the next year. I may have been out of
there the next day. I know there was a lot of frustration from the
fans in playoff games against Dallas. The 49ers just couldn't beat
the Cowboys. The pressure may have been too much on Bill Walsh to
keep me around if it had been a dro]p. But at least I would have
been able to travel through Texas without being a hated man. I like
Texas. I'm just scared to go there.''

IMAGINE THAT ... MODANO IS STAR OF AVS, NOT STARS 
WITH WHAT-IF PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine Mike Modano brandishing at least one, if not two,
Stanley Cup rings on his fingers. In Denver.
</P>
<P>
   What about defenseman Derian Hatcher being Public Enemy No. 1?
In Dallas. Or Reunion Arena rocking with chants of ``Patty's
better'' for Texas' favorite goalie, Patrick Roy?
</P>
<P>
   Not to be melodramatic, but if the Minnesota North Stars had won
the Stanley Cup in 1991, all of this could very well be reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still would've moved,'' longtime North Stars broadcaster
Al Shaver said adamantly. ``Just probably not right away and
probably not to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the power of ``what if,'' the ability to change one moment
in history and then ponder the trickle-down effect on everything
else. Many a good water cooler discussion has begun with those two
little words: What if ...
</P>
<P>
   So speculate for a second the consequences if Minnesota had won
the Stanley Cup in 1991 and if that in turn caused a delay in the
North Stars' retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Does that prevent Lord Stanley's Cup from visiting the Lone Star
State?
</P>
<P>
   Does that prevent puckheads from rivaling helmet heads in Valley
Ranch?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe most important, does that prevent Texas from getting an
NHL franchise?
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL was going to come to Dallas,'' Stars president Jim
Lites said. ``Eventually. Certainly in the next round of expansion
if another team hadn't already moved here. Could've it have been
Phoenix or Denver? Likely.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lites figures that without the North Stars as a second
tenant for Reunion Arena sporting types in Dallas probably would
begin searching for another NHL franchise eager to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The next available franchise would've been the Quebec Nordiques
(better known in these parts as the Colorado Avalanche). Denver
lured them south of the border before the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
   So what if a Stars-less Dallas had beaten the Mile High City to
the punch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very likely,'' said former Stars owner Norm Green, who moved
the North Stars from Minnesota to Dallas before the 1993-94 season.
``We thought this would be a great market to come to. I'm sure
another team would've seen that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if Quebec ownership had seen what Green saw?
</P>
<P>
   What if the Nordiques jumped to Dallas?
</P>
<P>
   What if the North Stars, without their first option, then bolted
for Denver or Phoenix or Anaheim _ all cities considered by Green?
</P>
<P>
   On the moving thing, just about everybody familiar with the
situation agrees: The North Stars weren't long for Minnesota. Not
even a Stanley Cup championship could've rooted the struggling
franchise to the great white north forever. They were losing money
faster than the Rangers lose games nowadays, and, even after the
Finals appearance, there were high school tournaments drawing
bigger crowds that next season. Significantly larger crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we opened up in '90 averaging 7,000 a game, \Rgeneral
manager\S Bobby Clarke said this is not going to work and we
started looking for another market,'' Green said. ``Once we were in
the Finals, we thought maybe. But going to the Cup only delayed it
a year. Shaver might've been right. Winning the Cup may have gotten
Minnesota an extra year or two. Now, had we been allowed to move
downtown \Rto Minneapolis\S there would've been no Dallas Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't, so there was.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Dallas was taken and Denver became the place Modano
and Hatcher and goalie Ed Belfour roamed?
</P>
<P>
   That means Stars fan (and get a pencil and paper handy because
you're going to need to write this down) would love, not like,
former Avs forward Claude Lemieux; think Peter Forsberg, not Mike
Modano, is the best player in the NHL; and probably boo Belfour
every time he touched the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Fans would've seen their Avs, or whatever they would have been
called, get bounced from the playoffs for a second consecutive
season because of how well Belfour played.
</P>
<P>
   And all that if the North Stars had won the 1991 Stanley Cup
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Seem unrealistic? Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the North Stars had snuck into the NHL playoffs with an
unbelievable run to end the season. But they won Game 1 against the
Penguins in Pittsburgh and had a 2-1 series lead after a 3-1
victory in Game 3. They went on to lose three straight, but
everybody thought they'd be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things are big-time elixirs, winning and almosts,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``And I know from my standpoint when you
win, it can carry you for a long period of time emotionally. You
feel like it stays with you, the positive thoughts, the commitment,
the sacrifice. They stay with you as a coach so you feel like you
can get them back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, leads to a whole other set of what-ifs.
</P>
<P>
   What if then-North Stars-coach-now-Stars-general-manager Bob
Gainey had been bitten by the bug and stayed with coaching longer?
Does Hitchcock become an NHL coach?
</P>
<P>
   What if then-North Stars-general-manager-now-Philadelphia-GM
Clarke had remained to build a dynasty? Does Clarke's most famous
sparring partner, Eric Lindros, have piece of mind and that elusive
Stanley Cup ring?
</P>
<P>
   If the North Stars don't move when they did, Lites says he
doesn't know if he'd be with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' Lites said. ``A year later or year
earlier, it might not have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars aren't in Texas, then owner Tom Hicks probably
doesn't buy the team, and he is the reason many people believe a
perpetual loser like the Stars were able to turn it around in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Because, without Hicks, is there money for a Belfour or a
Nieuwendyk or a Hull?
</P>
<P>
   And Minnesota might not have wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not have been this team in Minnesota,'' Stars
play-by-play announcer Ralph Strangis said. ``They became this team
in Texas.''

KNIGHT TO ATTEND UNLV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ USC linebacker Darryl Knight, who quit
the team following a disagreement with an assistant coach last
week, has decided to transfer to Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Knight spent his freshman year at USC playing for John Robinson,
who is now the head coach at UNLV. He left training camp at
University of California-Irvine after being kicked off the practice
field by defensive coordinator Bill Young during a walkthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Although Knight started two games last season at outside
linebacker, he had fallen off the depth chart this season and was
relegated to playing for the scout team. He needed to make a quick
decision about his future because USC begins classes Monday and he
would be forced to stay for a full semester if he went to class.
</P>
<P>
   Knight must sit out this season and will have one year of
eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   PALMER VS. PATERNO: USC quarterback Carson Palmer was stunned
when he read about Penn State coach Joe Paterno's accomplishments,
but not enough to be intimidated for today's game at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a coach, he's not going to try and tackle me,''
Palmer said. ``I won't have to play against him.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that Paterno was an ex-quarterback at Brown, Palmer
said, ``He might try to tackle me but he's not as fast as he used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   THE KING: Paterno needs seven more victories to surpass former
Alabama coach Bear Bryant as major college football's all-time
leader in coaching wins. Paterno is 317-83-3 in 34 seasons at Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he downplayed the possibility of making history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how close I am,'' Paterno said. ``I think winning
seven games this year with this team and schedule might be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR OF THE DAY: USC officials were amused by a rumor being
spread that Palmer was out of the game with a shoulder injury. The
story was relayed after Palmer had successfully completed Friday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   TALE OF THE TAPES: In order to avoid being burned on long runs
by Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey, USC has gone baCasey, USC
has gone back and watched game films of former Oregon quarterback
Akili Smith and former Arizona quarterback Keith Smith, who were
known for their scrambling ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back at those games and it was all a matter of one
player blowing his assignment that made the difference,'' USC
linebacker Zeke Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   JUST ANOTHER GAME? USC defensive tackle Ennis Davis didn't think
playing in New York, er, New Jersey, would affect the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's a big game because everyone's watching it, but
I'm from L.A., and even though New York is big media, so is L.A.,''
he said. ``I could be playing in a hole but it would still be a big
game, and it'll still be on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   ON A ROLL: Penn State has won 10 consecutive season openers and
29 of its past 30 nonconference games since joining the Big Ten in
1993. The only loss was to Florida in the 1998 Citrus Bowl. &QL;

USC LOOKING FOR LEADERS ON EVE OF KICKOFF CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ USC always has plenty of bravado at this
stage of the season, but with the Trojans having only one bowl
appearance in four years, defensive tackle Ennis Davis knew the
usual preseason confidence was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of today's season-opener against Penn State in the
Kickoff Classic, the senior co-captain decided the Trojans needed a
massive attitude adjustment to avoid a disaster on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't change things, we'll get embarrassed,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   So he met with another captain, senior center Eric Denmon, and
the pair agreed it was time for their teammates to be held
accountable for their performances, something that hasn't happened
much recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we've lacked is leadership,'' Davis said.
``We have a lot of talent this year. We've had players that were
more talented in the past, but there's been a ton of egos. You
couldn't say anything to anyone without them taking it personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand they are not as great as they think
they are, and they have to be open to accept criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis included himself in that statement: ``If I'm not getting
to the ball and someone says something, I have to take it and just
do my job. In the past, people would get upset. That can't happen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an extraordinary change in the relationship between
players, but whether it actually makes a difference will not be
known until sometime this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The 15th-ranked Trojans are experienced and riding the highest
expectations in coach Paul Hackett's three seasons. But even
against a Penn State team that the returns only two full-time
starters on defense, USC is the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans certainly think they are a better team, but they
have yet to prove it, and there are certain obstacles they will
face in Giants Stadium that account for Penn State being the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions will basically be playing a home game, with
about 90 percent of the crowd expected to be pro-Penn State. They
also have to figure out a way to contain quarterback Rashard Casey,
an equally gifted runner/thrower who led the Big Ten in pass
efficiency and was the offensive most valuable player in the Alamo
Bowl, running for a touchdown and throwing for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best quarterback we will face all year,'' Hackett
said. ``Their offense is the best we will face all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey was arrested for felony aggravated assault in May, but the
controversy has been almost buried as he returns to play before
family and friends from neighboring Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   History is also against the Trojans. Legendary Penn State coach
Joe Paterno is 3-0 against Hackett, and the Nittany Lions have
defeated USC three straight times.
</P>
<P>
   But Paterno has been his self-deprecating best in New Jersey,
pumping up the Trojans while questioning his own team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ever remember a year where we were less stable. I
don't know of a situation where we had so many unknowns,'' Paterno
said. ``There's an anxiety on this team right now about how good we
are, and are we ready to play a team as good as Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be a year away. We may be four games away. We may have
some nervous nellies out there until they get punched in the mouth
and remember it's a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments like these cause Hackett to roll his eyes, especially
when Paterno said he might not have scheduled the contest if he
knew how good USC was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sometimes says that about Akron,'' Hackett said. ``How good
are we? We were a .500 team last year. But I appreciate the
compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno does have a point. The Trojans appear to be the better
team on paper. But that hasn't been an unusual position for USC in
the late '90s, only to discover afterward that it provided a false
sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is neither team is quite sure what to make of
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is West vs. East,'' Hackett said. ``They don't have a
clue who our players are, and we don't know their players. The
first quarter of this game will be a very interesting matchup.
We're going into this a little bit blind.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not provide much comfort that Arizona was in a similar
position a year ago. With supposedly its best team ever, the
Wildcats were humiliated 41-7 by the Nittany Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frankly were not a great football team,'' said Arizona
defensive coordinator Rich Ellerson. ``We were an average team
going into the game with a lot of hype. We were not well prepared
or especially healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other differences from that game which Hackett was
careful to avoid. First, this game will not be played in Happy
Valley, but at the Meadowlands. And the Trojans arrived three days
early to avoid jet lag. Arizona flew in the day before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't understand the jet lag,'' Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, here's another difference: Penn State is without
Courtney Brown and LaVar Arrington, the top two picks in the NFL
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted we're not playing last year's defense,'' Hackett
said. ``But a lot of the guys who we will see do show up on the
tapes from last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett, who usually believes he has these things figured out,
only predicts that the teams will need awhile to feel each other
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first half will be much different than the
second,'' he said. ``Because these teams are going to try to get a
handle on each other.'' &QL;

REED APPRECIATES BASEBALL AFTER `SCARY' SETBACKS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Last year there was the scrape on his elbow
that turned into a rapidly spreading strep infection his doctors
initially feared was a flesh-eating disease. The year before that,
there was the blood clot which had him fearing for his life.
</P>
<P>
   After the incidents that sidelined him the past two years, tasks
such as coming out to the field early for some extra running on a
warm Southern California day are nothing for Steve Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chatsworth (Calif.) High graduate, a relief pitcher for the
Cleveland Indians, entered the season with a deeper appreciation
for the game and the same determination he has had for years to be
in shape and work as hard as he can to help his team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like guys that work hard and he's that type of a player,''
said Indians manager Charlie Manuel. ``His work ethic is a good
example for the younger guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed prides himself on conditioning that has kept him off the
disabled list throughout his career, but admits what happened the
past two seasons scared him.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being traded from San Francisco to Cleveland in
September of 1998, Reed started experiencing numbness and coldness
in the fingers of his right hand. He didn't say anything about it
for more than a week, but when he did, a blood clot in the wrist of
his pitching arm was determined to be the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary,'' Reed said. ``When you here the word blood
clot, it's pretty severe. I wasn't too worried about my career at
that point, I was more worried about just staying alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the blood clot was dissolved, Reed was pitching within a
few days and able to help the Indians in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's injury had longer-lasting effects. When he scratched
his elbow on a clubhouse wall in late May, Reed didn't think
anything of it until two days later when his elbow was swollen and
the upper portion of his arm became discolored. Reed was out for
about 10 days, but his weakness from the infection lingered.
</P>
<P>
   For someone used to averaging nearly 70 appearances a season,
the thought of not being able to be counted on every day was
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be able to know that every day, I'm available,''
Reed said. ``That's something I've prided myself on. When I come to
work, I'm able to go out everyday and pitch for this club and know
they can rely on me.''
</P>
<P>
   His work ethic dates back to high school, where as a senior in
1983 he helped Chatsworth win its first City title. Lacking
overpowering stuff made him realize he had to do that much more to
be successful.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant his prospects of playing professionally appeared
dim. Reed attended Lewis &AMP; Clark College, an NAIA school at the
time, and was not drafted after his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the hard way,'' Reed said. ``I've always had to work a
little bit harder than the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It took five years in the Giants' minor-league system before he
made his major-league debut late in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 34, is the oldest member of Cleveland's bullpen. Players
look to him for guidance whether they're dealing with finances or
baseball. His work ethic and the success it's brought him _ he
entered this weekend's series at Anaheim with a 2-0 record and
having retired 37 of the last 46 batters he faced _ are the reasons
Reed believes he is respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work as hard or harder than any of the younger guys,'' he
said. ``They see that and they know I'm not just someone that's
blowing smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a guy that makes excuses. If I give it up, I give it
up, but I don't want to look in the mirror and say `God, if I would
have just done this or I would have done that, I maybe could have
pitched a little better or lasted a little longer.' So I've always
worked hard at it.'' &QL;

TRAINING, TESTING TO BECOME WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ At 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the goal posts at
Missouri Western State College's football stadium shimmered in the
101-degree temperature. The asphalt near the running track was
soft. The black rubber track itself radiated with heat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's too hot for sandals. Too hot even for football practice.
The college team moved its practice to outside the stadium, on a
partly-shaded field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But inside this concrete bowl of bleachers and asphalt, the
concentrated heat makes for a perfect setting to test the mettle of
would-be wildland firefighters, who will face much harsher
conditions than a muggy Missouri summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For them, their first step to getting certified _ and a paid
two-week adventure to the fires out West _ is to pass this wildland
fire class. After four, eight-hour days of lectures and quizzes,
along with one grueling physical fitness test, they will be
certified as Type II basic wildland firefighters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``the pack test,'' they must carry a 45-pound backpack
for a distance of three miles in 45 minutes. The test is an annual
litmus exam for all wildland firefighters nationwide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This day, it will feel like carrying a metal sousaphone in a
desert parade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen persons, ranging in age from their early 20s to late
40s, are gathered on the track. Most of them work for the Missouri
Department of Conservation in offices all over the state, except
for two Lawrence, Kan., firemen who are members of the Wakarusa
Township Fire Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most have heard the war stories from others: walls of flames 150
feet high, helicopter rides deep into the wilderness, airplane
drops of the brilliant red fire retardants. They know the hours are
long: 18 hours of slamming the earth with a hoe or shovel or a
Pulaski _ an ax//hoe tool _ to create a fire line. And the pay is
low: Type II's make $10 to $12 an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's hard work but it's also fun,'' said Russell
Schmidt, an instructor and a veteran firefighter. Schmidt is
Missouri's fire training coordinator, who organizes the fire crews
in Missouri that head out West. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see places you would never see. For most people,
after their first time, firefighting gets in their blood.
Sometimes, they absolutely hate it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Replacements are desperately needed this year. This class, like
others taught across the country this week, was organized to train
fresh recruits. Missouri Department of Conservation offices around
the state issued a memo last week encouraging everyone in their
offices, not just forestry personnel, to sign up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an office potato for 10 years but I'd really like to
go. I've been hearing the stories for years,'' said Marcia
Pfleiderer, an employee at the conservation office in St. Joseph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Becky Fletcher, a forester from Eminence, Mo., is a veteran of
two national fires, in Minnesota and Florida. But she's never been
to the Western infernos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at work tease me. They say you're not a real
firefighter until you've gone out West,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Kansas have sent fire crews and fire trucks.
Missouri has sent seven pumper trucks and 465 persons; Kansas has
sent one fire engine and about 50 firefighters, including a student
crew from Hutchinson Community College and 16 students from Haskell
Indian Nations University who worked in the elite Hotshot squads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, nearly 5.8 million acres have burned, or about
8,900 square miles, approximately the land size of New Hampshire.
However, the number of trained firefighters has reached the maximum
available across the country, according to the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most firefighters are only permitted to work two weeks at a time
because of the extreme conditions and long hours. Longer than two
weeks, fire experts say, and accidents begin to happen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the government's desperate when they start training
the military to come in,'' said Schmidt to the class, when he
learned that a 500-soldier Army battalion from Fort Campbell, Ky.,
was also training this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are young and strong, but they've never worked a
fire. The first time you see a fire like thatanyone who has not
been around that kind of fire, usually panics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most seasoned soldier.'' &QL; 
 &LR; brkstr:I I I &QL; 
 &LR; tx:On Monday, the course opened with a movie of the 1988
Yellowstone fire. There were images of trees bleeding yellow and
orange fire. Sounds of crackling sticks amplified over miles. Winds
screaming as uphill mountainous air collided with the downslope
Foehn winds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for us from the Midwest to imagine what these fires
are like in the mountains,'' said Mark Humphrey, another veteran
firefighter and forester at the Department of Conservation based in
St. Joseph. ``Out there, the flames reach 100 to 150 feet. Here,
they're usually around eight to 10 feet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And one thing the film doesn't show you is how much smoke and
dirt you suck in just to breathe. Everyone who goes comes back with
respiratory problems.You will too.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students learned how fires can react differently in the
mountains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fires race more quickly if they're burning upslope. A beautiful
mountain view could be deadly if it creates a chimney effect,
feeding the fire into a frenzy. Even hiking in the mountainous
terrain is something that a Midwesterner needs to keep in mind,
especially when planning an escape route. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The students learned how the weather can be their enemy.
Meteorologists travel with some fire crews to monitor wind speeds,
relative humidity and storm buildups at regular intervals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just this week two firefighters in Utah were killed when they
were struck by lightning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that you need to be aware of,'' warned
Humphrey. ``We tell you not to scare you but for you to understand
how to protect yourself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most important protection a firefighter has is the fire
shelter, a special four-pound tent carried in yellow pouches on
each firefighter's belt at all times. The tent, affectionately
called ``the shake-n-bake'' or ``turkey roaster,'' is a last
resort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tents are made from a thin layer of aluminum foil laminated
to fiberglass cloth with a nontoxic adhesive. The foil will reflect
95 percent of the fire's radiant heat. Inside the tent, the
firefighter lies with his face pressed into the dirt. That's where
the coolest and cleanest air source is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shelter can get as hot as 150 degrees Fahrenheit, but that
temperature is survivable. Saunas often reach 190 degrees
Fahrenheit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey demonstrated how to shake open the shelter, and he
reminded them to clear away debris around the site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I've never had to deploy one of these,'' he said, stepping
into a practice fire shelter tent and wrapping it around his body,
``and I hope I never have to. When you're told to deploy your
shelter, somebody has really screwed up. Bad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But whatever you do, don't lift your head up to see what's
happening around you. You'll hear others screaming, and panicking,
trying to outrun the fire, but hold still. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This could save your life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the class practiced opening their shelter and
throwing themselves on the ground wearing it. Under the tent, with
their arms and legs spread-eagled on the floor, each student
imagined how that moment would feel. &QL; 
 &LR; brkstr:I I I &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Tuesday evening back on the track, the pack test started.
Twelve students hoisted their back packs on. The two firemen from
Lawrence have opted to take their tests at a different time _ they
have a shift to work that night. A third student, Becky Fletcher,
took her pack test in February. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The packs contain everything from five bars of window weights to
shotgun pellets to simulate what a 45-pound pack filled with gear
would feel like. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure most of the weight is on your hips and not your
shoulders,'' called out Schmidt as the students adjusted their
packs. ``Suck in your gut and cinch the waist strap as tight as you
can stand itIt'll help.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some students wore jeans and green T-shirts. A few wore their
8-inch high-top leather hiking boots. Their faces squinted into the
sun, thinking what 12 laps would feel like to their legs. Many
stooped forward against the weight of the pack. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget about three miles. Just walking to the starting line
makes faces red, sweat roll down foreheads, arms glisten with
sweat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, pace yourselves,'' Schmidt said. ``We'll call out
the splits on your laps and let you know if you are falling
behind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few jokers crouched down as if preparing for a racer's sprint.
Humphrey held his left arm high like a track official. His right
thumb paused above the starter button on his stopwatch.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``On your markgo.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His arm dropped down, and a dozen hikers awkwardly lurched
forward. As they walked, some were bent from the waist; others
pressed down painfully on their thighs. From the sidelines, a
construction crew was taking a break from applying hot asphalt and
enjoying the sight. Finally, they took pity and unfurled a watering
hose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to get wet?'' one worker asked Randy Hulse, 46, a
forester from Hannibal, Mo., as he passed one lap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hulse was sprayed with a heavy mist. Most of the water
evaporated before hitting the track. A colorful rainbow gleamed as
the water cascades. For a brief moment total relief crossed Hulse's
face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After two laps, Marcia Pfleiderer was lagging behind. She
stopped. Shaking her head, she wrestled her backpack off and
collapsed in the meager shade the stadium walls provide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop,'' she said, between breaths. ``I was getting
too familiar with my lunch.I've been exercising but not at this
intensity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the next lap, two more students dropped out. Then two more.
Finally six students, half the class this day, abandoned the test. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too damn hot,'' said one. ``Even a fireline won't be this
hot. No way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, six students /{did/} pass, including Hulse, one
of the oldest. Those who failed can retake the exam in a few days
if they choose. But already, a few have decided not to bother. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's OK,'' said Schmidt, consoling those who have opted
not to try it again. ``Not everyone is cut out for this. This is a
national emergency, a crisis. It feels good to know you're
helping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But anyone who signs up for this just to have the bragging
rights, well, that macho stuff wears out real quick when you're
there. We're proud that the Missouri crews we've sent have all
received good ratings. We want to keep that up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those who passed, the call to head west could come as early
as Monday morning. &QL;

FINLEY THINKS WHITE SOX CAN BE CAUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Chuck Finley has been on the other side. He
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is with a veteran Indians team that is not only
contending for the American League wild-card spot, but still
considers itself in a race to win the AL Central for a sixth
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox got off to a blazing start and led by as
many as 11 games. Now their lead is eight, but it is far from over.
Especially, Finley says, because the White Sox are a young team
dealing with success for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? It is to Finley, who was with the 1995 Angels
team that blew an 11-game lead they held as late as Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of similarities,'' Finley said. ``The
difference is they got off to a great start, and we ('95 Angels)
took off and won a bunch of games right after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've (the Indians) felt all along if we kept playing solid
baseball they'd hit a bump in the road. We still feel they can be
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made the biggest difference for the Indians, Finley
says, is the trade-deadline deals made by the club. They acquired
starters Jason Bere and Steve Woodard, closer Bob Wickman,
outfielder Wil Cordero and first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trades we made made us a totally different team,'' Finley
said. ``It was a shot of adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox's recent acquisition says a lot about how they're
feeling about themselves and their youth. They signed Angels
castoff Ken Hill, who was ripped for six runs in 21/3 innings in
his first start.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE NOT BOOING: The fans at Fenway Park have taken a liking
to the Red Sox's new third baseman Lou Merloni, chanting
``Looooooooou'' every time he comes to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a month ago that Merloni was toiling in Japan,
sitting on the bench for the Yokohama BayStars. He was released by
the BayStars and signed by the Red Sox, who assigned him to their
Triple-A team in Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   He was called up after only a week and had 14 hits in his first
seven games with the Sox to win over the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This call-up was real unexpected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS: Blue Jays right fielder Raul Mondesi had
season-ending elbow surgery two weeks ago, but the procedure
revealed the damage was not as bad as feared. Mondesi had about a
dozen bone chips removed from the elbow, but there was no ligament
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to the ligament would have meant more extensive surgery
and put him out until the middle of next season. Instead, Mondesi
is set to begin a throwing program in the next two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NO CAN DO, CHAD: Chad Curtis' playing time with the Rangers had
dropped so much, he came up with an idea to get some more action _
join the Olympic team. Curtis was willing to forfeit his salary for
the rest of the season to play for the U.S. team in Australia and
the Rangers gave him permission.
</P>
<P>
   However, the International Baseball Federation prohibits taking
players from the 25-man roster of any major-league team.
</P>
<P>
   BOO-BIRDS TAKE FLIGHT: The fans in Minnesota don't have much
patience with pitcher Brad Radke, who recently signed a four-year,
$36 million extension, booing him in the Metrodome. But Radke says
he isn't fazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the people that boo you are the people that only
come out here when they give stuff away,'' Radke said. ``So I don't
care about all that. I heard them. Fans are fans.'' &QL;

PAUS VS. PAUS IS POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looks like all those dinner-table discussions
at the Paus house _ who's the better quarterback, Cory or Casey? _
will be settled the only way it can: on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Paus, a senior quarterback at Lincoln Way High in New
Lenox, Ill., will not follow in the footsteps of his brother and
attend UCLA. Instead, he's going to Pacific-10 Conference foe
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Which means they could be playing against each other _ either on
Oct. 13, 2001 at the Rose Bowl or Nov. 2, 2002 in Seattle. Their
parents, Rick and Nancy, have no doubt booked their flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I committed (last month), of course he had to make the
first comment,'' Casey said of his brother, a sophomore at UCLA.
``He said, `You know I'm going to have to beat you.' It would be
the opportunity of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who is 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds and more of a drop-back
passer than Cory, narrowed his choices to Michigan, Miami, Arizona
State and Colorado before deciding on Washington. Huskies coach
Rick Neuheisel had previously recruited Cory while coaching at
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He said UCLA didn't recruit him by mutual consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd talked to the coaches and been out there enough, and they
were very up-front with me,'' Casey said. ``They said, `We've got
your brother and plan on having him start for three years. We'll
leave it up to you. If you want us to recruit you, we will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best playing situation where I could get a
chance to play early. If I had to follow him I would, but I kind of
wanted to find my own way and do my own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A SKIPPER, FINALLY: Jim Skipper, the father of Bruins running
back coach Kelly Skipper, left his post as assistant head coach of
the New York Giants this week to become the head coach of the San
Jose club in the XFL, the spring football league spawned by the
World Wrestling Federation's Vince McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to me about it,'' said Kelly Skipper, whose father
was a member of Toledo's staff at the University of the Pacific and
got his start in pro football in the USFL. ``He's excited. Being a
head coach is something he's always wanted to do. He's been in the
NFL 15 years. He's got a lot of friends he can always go back. I
told him to do what's going to make him happy.''
</P>
<P>
   PICKED UP BY TAB: There are four freshman who have earned their
way to second string on the depth chart, but there's no question
who has the chance to make the biggest impact: receiver Tab Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 218-pounder from Milpitas, Calif., is a hybrid of
the two starters: Brian Poli-Dixon and Freddie Mitchell. He has
Poli-Dixon's size and ability to break tackles and Mitchell's
elusiveness and flair for spectacular catches.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Perry get on the field as a receiver, but he'll
return kicks. The only hiccups in his play in fall camp came
Thursday when he dropped at least four balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an impressive athlete,'' receivers coach Ron Caragher
said. ``He's very athletic and physical. He has the ability to make
big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   BABE WHO? Toledo was asked recently if he was following Colorado
Rockies first baseman Todd Helton's pursuit of .400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' asked Toledo, who knew Helton only as the quarterback
who played for Tennessee against the Bruins in 1994. &QL;

RUNNING BACK HURT IN SCRIMMAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Running back is one of the few positions where Cal
State Northridge has depth. Even that position took a blow
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore tailback Alan Taylor went down on the third play of
the intrasquad scrimmage with a left ankle injury. CSUN coach Jeff
Kearin believes it may be a high ankle sprain, which could take as
many as several weeks to rehabilitate. Taylor will go in for tests
Monday to determine the extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the most experienced of the four tailbacks vying for the
starting spot, hobbled off the field and left not long after the
scrimmage on crutches. Taylor declined to discus the injury, saying
he just wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumor is that it's a high ankle sprain and that's not
good,'' Kearin said. ``I don't feel good about that. He has a high
tolerance for pain but he was in a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was injured on an 8-yard gain _ his second carry of the
scrimmage. Running backs Terrelus Wright and Bruce Molock weren't
able to do much against the uncharacteristically stingy CSUN
defense, which had three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Marcus Brady looked solid. He completed 12 of
15 passes for 121 yards with one touchdown and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   While the offense was able to move the chains, it stalled inside
the red zone, scoring only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to where it matters most and, gosh darn it, we fumbled
a snap and had a couple of busts with the quarterback and a couple
of busts with the line,'' Kearin said. ``We executed well and did
move the ball, which is promising. That's what we'll work on this
week, refining what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Joseph Roberson had two sacks and one
interception. And the defense contained the running game. It will
be interesting to see how the defense fares against Air Force's
option in the season opener Saturday at Falcon Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're happy with the effort we put forth,'' Roberson
said. ``We're happy but can we be content with that? Everybody
knows we have a formidable foe against Air Force. We'll have to put
forth a great effort against a team like Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's passing game showed flashes. Brady hooked up with senior
receiver Gil Rodriguez six times for 63 yards, including a 23-yard
gain to set up a 3-yard scoring strike from Brady to Drew Amerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week we'll fine-tune and everything will be introduced,''
Rodriguez said. ``This week we'll work probably a good 50 to 60
plays with the first offense. Right now we're just seeing who's
going to play. We should be ready to shock the world Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady's only blemishes were a fumbled snap and an interception.
He said the offensive line wasn't allowed to cut-block in the
scrimmage, which was part of the reason the play broke down on
Roberson's interception of a short pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed and I think we looked pretty good as far as the
first group,'' Brady said. ``We were working on some new plays to
get film on us. We really didn't open it up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Derek Brown made 5 of 8 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   HICKS TO PRACTICE: Running back Matt Hicks _ a transfer from Air
Force _ is scheduled to practice Monday. Even though he hasn't
practiced yet, Hicks could play in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good chance to play against Air Force,'' Kearin
said. ``I think he's ready. We'll throw him in the fire Monday.'' &QL;

 HOPE - 2 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA, Kan. _ It's after 9 a.m., and Ottawa University
professor James Tarrant's lecture is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   The class is Freedom and Responsibility. Already Tarrant has
invoked George Orwell and Jonas Salk, handed out the syllabus and
warned the 15 freshmen gathered that they will be re-examining
everything they think they know.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up a marker and prints a phrase on the board:
``Perception vs. Reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, freshman Sarah Clark walks through the door.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is she is late. Not five minutes, not 10 minutes,
but on this morning, Aug. 23, Sarah is 35 minutes late for the
first class of her college career. She is the only late arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Perception: She looks unfazed, cool.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: She is embarrassed. This is not the way she wanted to
start college. She forgot to set her alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair still wet, she sheepishly makes her way to an empty
chair. The students, in groups of four, are giving each other
two-minute interviews about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   She takes out a sheet of paper. Two minutes? In a way it's
almost laughable. Sarah, 18, could spend an entire day telling them
how much her life had changed in the last two months alone. She
could tell them how fortunate she felt. How much pressure she was
under.
</P>
<P>
   As she would say later, after class: ``I just don't want to mess
up.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 25 the The Kansas City Star began a three-part series,
``Sarah's Hope,'' chronicling Sarah's turbulent life and struggles
in her four years at Schlagle High School in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Readers followed Sarah from her days as an overweight
eighth-grader trying out for the Schlagle freshman cheerleading
squad through her senior year and her fight to become
valedictorian. In those years Sarah faced overwhelming obstacles:
her father and stepfather in jail; her mother often absent; her
family beset by poverty, violence and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end those difficulties slowed her. She never applied for
a scholarship, never even applied to college, but she still managed
to graduate near the top of her class.
</P>
<P>
   At graduation Sarah envisioned a summer of working at Subway and
sleeping on a futon in a friend's home. Her desire to leave her
miserable life behind and go away to school seemed a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Sarah's story, The Star received more than 400
calls, letters and e-mails. People wanted to send money to get
Sarah to college. Channel 9 put her on the news. So did Channel 41.
Six area colleges offered to help pay her way.
</P>
<P>
   Public donations have gone into an education trust fund for
Sarah. So far, $11,709 has poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Sarah said. ``All of a sudden I was like a
celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon while Sarah was at work, a woman stopped by and
handed her a card with $50. Another came with a shopping bag full
of presents. On the street, people hugged her. Others offered
therapy, jobs. They offered to be her mentor, to take her shopping
_ offers she was hesitant to accept.
</P>
<P>
   She was dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the attention was nice. In other ways it was odd,
surreal. Sarah felt utterly revealed. Thousands of people knew the
most painful parts of her life, trials she had not even shared with
her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like everyone knew my story,'' she said. But to her all
these people were strangers, albeit strangers who now offered
generous support and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The help she wanted most came from Ottawa University, a private
college 50 miles south of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa, with 430 students, is a tiny school in a tiny town. Its
limestone buildings occupy hardly more than a city block. Most of
its students _ kids from small Kansas towns like Derby and
Wellsville, Chanute and even Ottawa _ are the first in their
families to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah was drawn to the school's small size and the fact that her
best friend, Rachel Vernon, went there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa graduates who read the stories urged admissions people to
admit Sarah and pledged money to support the $15,000-a-year cost.
One alumna in Topeka who had not given to her alma mater in a
decade sent $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And so it happened. Within weeks Ottawa University offered Sarah
a package of scholarships, financial aid and trust fund donations
that would cover room, board, fees and tuition for four years. The
commitment totals $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I feel Ottawa University is about is transforming
lives,'' said Paul R. Rittof, dean of student development. ``Sarah
is the perfect example of what our university ought to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1865, Ottawa University was named for the Ottawa
tribe and grew out of a Baptist mission to serve the underserved
Indian population. Any young member of the Ottawa tribe, now based
mostly in Oklahoma, can attend the school tuition-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if we're not about helping someone like Sarah who's had the
hard knocks she's had,'' Rittof said, ``then I don't know what
we're all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Perception: Rittof said the tricky goal now was to show Sarah
that they cared about her life, happiness and success at Ottawa
without making her feel overly scrutinized. Although hundreds of
people are invested in her success and future, they want her to
feel like a normal student.

 HOPE - 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reality: She feels the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not just about me anymore,'' Sarah said.
</P>
<P>
   Walking on campus, she can tell from the way faculty members nod
her way or ask about her welfare _ ``Hey, Sarah, how you doing?''
``Finding everything OK, Sarah?''_ that most of them know her
story. She's right. They do.
</P>
<P>
   Back in her Freedom and Responsibility class, professor Tarrant
asks each student to fill out a questionnaire. One line says to
name something you fear. Sarah writes: ``Failure and being
ridiculed.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows, as trite and yet as momentous as it sounds, that she
has been given a once-in-a-lifetime gift. That's daunting. But she
also realizes that everyone's high expectations may be a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   It's just foreign. For so long, so many of the forces in her
life were negative.
</P>
<P>
   As Sarah tells it, today she has almost no relationship with her
mother. When she visits her mother in rural Kansas, she's there to
see her younger brothers, Brian and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anything from her,'' Sarah says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, when Sarah headed to school, she turned to her high
school cheerleading coach and friend, Kerry Kubicki, for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like the real mother I never had,'' Sarah said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kubicki who helped Sarah straighten out paperwork at
orientation, who took her to Wal-Mart to shop for school equipment.
It was Kubicki who hugged Sarah like a daughter and encouraged her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a bright future ahead of you,'' she told her.
``You'll be OK. If you need anything, call me. I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kubicki left the campus, it was time for Sarah to settle in
her new home with her roommate, sophomore Heather Maxwell, 20, of
Olathe.
</P>
<P>
   Perception: They're different.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: They're astonishingly different.
</P>
<P>
   Heather has never smoked. She doesn't drink. She likes country
music, has braces, wants to be a biology teacher, and has decorated
her side of the room with a puppy calendar, a Noah's Ark snow globe
and stuffed animals. She has three of Tigger, her favorite from
Winnie-the-Pooh stories.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah likes to party. She listens to rap and has decorated her
side of the room with her cheerleading pictures, dolphin figurines
and a poster with scores of drink recipes you can make in a shot
glass.
</P>
<P>
   The girls aren't hanging out together, but Heather hopes she and
Sarah eventually will be close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to get along great,'' she said. ``When I
found out we were going to be roommates, I was real excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather, in fact, followed Sarah's story in the newspaper but
has not brought it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to overstep the bounds,'' Heather said. ``I do
know her story, but I don't care. I just hope we can be wonderful
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sarah's closest friends say that one aspect of her life may
very well matter. Sarah is hardly shy about her love of staying out
late, hanging with her friends and smoking pot.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, she said, she would sleep until 3 p.m., head to
work and then party late. But her friends said that to make it at
Ottawa, she would need to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just got to work hard,'' said Sarah's friend Rachel, an
Ottawa sophomore. ``Actually, I'm hoping she'll calm down in some
of the partying she's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, although the faculty knows part of college is having
fun, administrators emphasize that the rules of behavior will not
change for Sarah Clark. They want her to succeed, but they will not
tolerate flouting their rules.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah says she doesn't intend to. She plans to have fun, but not
at the expense of her education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get it (the partying) all in before I had to get
all serious,'' Sarah said.
</P>
<P>
   Before classes began, Sarah followed the usual college rituals:
</P>
<P>
   A pre-law and political science major, she got her books: The
Stoic Philosophy of Seneca, The Divine Comedy, Maker of World
History...
</P>
<P>
   She picked up her schedule: World Civilizations; Lifetime
Fitness; Intro to Theater; intermediate Spanish; Freedom and
Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   At night she found her friends and celebrated at events planned
for the entire school. The symbolic passing of the torch on the
football field. A late-night dance.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the evening before her first class, she and
Rachel and another friend went to Lawrence for dinner. They ate
Greek food, and for the first time Sarah had hummus.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward they headed to a coffee shop, where the three girls
took out paper to write sentiments and poetry on how they were
feeling the night before classes.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah wrote of her worries, the pressure she was feeling and her
wish to do well.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, in her Freedom and Responsibility class,
those same themes arise. Sarah scans the questionnaire and focuses
on the last question: How do you feel about your life?
</P>
<P>
   Sarah pens her answer: ``Blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first class is over. Sarah checks her schedule. Her next
class is in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   This time she won't be late. (END)

FEMALE RHINOCEROS BORN AT THE KANSAS CITY ZOO 
</HEADLINE>
 RHINO BIRTH-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 65-pound bundle of baby rhinoceros arrived
early Saturday at the Kansas City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The female calf was born at 4:40 a.m., and within 50 minutes she
was nursing and making high-pitched yeeps. Both baby and mother
appeared healthy, zoo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She follows mom around, and mom adjusts her height to allow
the baby to nurse,'' said Conrad Schmitt, zoo curator. ``She's
doing exactly what we would want her to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth is of international significance because this
subspecies, called the eastern black rhinoceros, is critically
endangered. The main threats are poaching and loss of habitat. The
International Rhino Foundation estimates there are just 660 eastern
black rhinos left on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are 661.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the things that zoos need to be doing,'' Schmitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation officials are especially pleased that this baby is
female. In recent years, births among captive eastern black rhinos
have been disproportionately male.
</P>
<P>
   The captive population needed new blood to enlarge the gene
pool, so the Kansas City Zoo forged a relationship with the South
African National Parks Board to collect animals from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The rhino mother, named Luyisa, was brought here from Addo
Elephant National Park in 1997. The Kansas City Star went along to
document the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The sire, named Rudy, was born in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Zookeepers had developed a trusting relationship with Luyisa,
who allowed veterinarian Kirk Suedmeyer to take regular ultrasound
readings of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Zookeeper Wendy Shaffstall had been on a 24-hour watch with the
rhino when the baby came. She immediately called Suedmeyer and
Schmitt. Mark Wourms, zoo director, left early Saturday for Africa
and was unaware of the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Luyisa was the second female imported from the wild by Kansas
City. The first one died last year of a blood ailment. She also had
been pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Luyisa was brought here, the Cleveland
Metroparks Zoo also imported a female rhino. That animal is
pregnant and due to give birth this fall, said Denise Rendina,
Kansas City Zoo spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At the time they were in Africa, Schmitt and Cleveland mammal
curator Alan Sironen made a bet over who would produce a baby rhino
first. Schmitt won.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's baby is scheduled eventually to be transferred to
the Cincinnati zoo, which is developing a rhino program. The move
will not be made for a few years, however, because young rhinos
have a long nurturing period with their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The gestation of this baby rhino, which is as yet unnamed, was
about 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear when the baby rhino would be on public display.
KMBC-TV, Channel 9, has two cameras installed in the rhino barn.

 &HT;    Winning comes first for Moss, Heisman later
 &HT;    By Jorge Milian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES _ What's the hottest Santana CD on the market
today?
</P>
<P>
   Among Heisman Trophy voters it's the one featuring University of
Miami receiver Santana Moss and not the Grammy Award-winning
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of CD roms were sent across the country recently by
UM's Sports Information department in an effort to boost Moss'
chances of joining quarterbacks Vinny Testaverde (1986) and Gino
Torretta (1992) as University of Miami Heisman winners.
</P>
<P>
   Moss' campaign also includes posters, billboards and his own
site on UM's athletic department web page.
</P>
<P>
   But is any of that going to make a difference when the Heisman
Trophy recipient is announced on Dec. 9?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say his chances are slim and none,'' said Lee Corso, an
ESPN analyst and a Heisman voter.
</P>
<P>
   Corso said his judgment is shaped by the award's history. Of the
past 40 winners, 36 were either quarterbacks or running backs. With
four quarterbacks _ FSU's Chris Weinke, Purdue's Drew Brees,
Virginia Tech's Michael Vick and Nebraska's Eric Crouch _ entering
the season as the Heisman frontrunners, the odds are heavily
stacked against Moss, according to Corso.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those four quarterbacks is going to win it,'' Corso
said. ``I don't care if Santana Moss has 1,800 yards and 18
touchdowns. If one of those quarterbacks has a great year, Santana
Moss won't win it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moss' chances may not seem as dire as Corso suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Heisman history has been far kinder to players other than
quarterbacks and running backs. Since Notre Dame's Tim Brown won in
1987, three of the past 13 Heisman winners have played another
position. It probably would have been 4-of-13 if FSU wide receiver
Peter Warrick hadn't been arrested for shoplifting last season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and the Michigan combination of receiver Desmond Howard
(1991) and cornerback Charles Woodson (1997) proved that Heisman
voters are willing to consider players who are multiple threats.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, Howard and Woodson were outstanding at their positions,
but it was their special teams' contributions that gave them an
edge against the quarterbacks (Don McPherson, Casey Weldon and
Peyton Manning) that finished as runner-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Moss') chance is similar to Desmond Howard's and Tim
Brown's,'' said UM coach Butch Davis. ``If he has a chance to win,
it won't be based on how many catches he has. It will be because of
his versatility and how he helps us win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss' abilities as a receiver are documented.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the 5-foot-10, 180-pound Miamian led the Hurricanes
with 54 receptions for 899 yards and six touchdowns. Moss, a
semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award, enters the 2000 season
needing 626 yards to surpass Michael Irvin (2,423) as UM's career
leader in receiving yardage.
</P>
<P>
   But it is on special teams where the fleet-footed Moss could
catch the nation by surprise. Moss didn't begin returning punts
full-time until last season and only toward the end of the year did
he become comfortable in the role. In UM's final three regular
season games, Moss returned 11 punts for 250 yards (22.7 average)
and 2 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, you would have had to ask me a million
times to return punts,'' Moss said. ``Now, I'm loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss may get an opportunity to further showcase his versatility
and improve his Heisman chances by returning kickoffs this season.
Davis has been divided on the matter, weighing the risk of
stretching Moss too far with the desire to get his game-breaking
speed and ability in the game as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Moss has proven he's dangerous on kickoff return. In the Gator
Bowl victory last Jan. 1 against Georgia Tech, Moss brought back a
kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown only to have it negated by a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Like Moss, Torretta began the 1992 season as a darkhorse for the
Heisman. Torretta believes he locked up the award after completing
28-of-40 passes for 363 yards and three touchdowns in a
nationally-televised win against West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Torretta's advice to Moss?
</P>
<P>
   Play big in the big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need those games and you need it at the right time,''
Torretta said. ``If you come down neck and neck with someone, you
need a game on TV where you dominate the other team . . . that's
going to do more than sending out a CD rom or getting hits on a Web
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss will get plenty of exposure. Six of the Hurricanes' games
will be on either ABC, CBS or ESPN and two more could be televised
by ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Moss says he's unmoved by the chances of winning the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that much to me,'' said Moss, who began his UM
career on a track scholarship. ``If we win 12 games, I'll think
about the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>

thinking about it.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore pushes health plan
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)

<P>
   Riding a wave of success on his prescription-drug plan, Vice
President Al Gore next week will launch a cross-country discussion
of health care issues and a comparison of his plan with those of
Gov. George W. Bush. Gore's advisers, who outlined the strategy
Saturday, said that prescription drugs had emerged as the ``top
issue,'' and that Gore had surged in the polls in part because he
had dedicated so much time to the issue. Under Gore's plan, people
65 and older with low incomes would get free prescription-drug
coverage. Bush's plan also covers the elderly poor. Gore wants a
broader package of prescription drug coverage through Medicare to
all elderly patients; Bush does not.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will talk about his plan starting Monday in Tallahassee.
Tuesday he discusses children's health care in

<P>
   REACHING OUT TO MUSLIMS
</P>
<P>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman plans to
reach out to Arab American leaders during a campaign swing through
Michigan today, hoping to reassure Muslims who worry that his
election could hurt their agenda and tilt U.S. policy in the Middle
East. ``I'm going to talk about the basic themes of the campaign
and how much I feel the Arab American community . . . is an
important and growing community in our country,'' Lieberman said.
``I want them to have a seat at the table and to feel that I'm
accessible to them.'' Sen. Lieberman, who is Jewish, said he has a
strong record of supporting the rights of Arab Americans, and was
co-sponsor of a Senate resolution protesting discrimination against
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   VOTERS WANT MORE FACTS
</P>
<P>
   The public's interest toward the presidential campaign is on the
rise, but only about half of Americans polled say they don't have
enough information yet to pick a candidate, according to a survey
released Friday by the Annenberg School for Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania. Men were more likely than women to feel
informed enough to choose. About 55 percent of men, and 47 percent
of women said that after the two conventions they knew enough about
the two candidates to make a choice. The poll found voters are most
confused over Bush's position of allowing people to invest some of
their base Social Security benefits, and over Gore's proposal that
people can invest money in addition to a guaranteed Social Security
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH SUES OVER DAUGHTER
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, who as governor
advocated and signed legislation limiting civil lawsuits, filed a
case of his own in Texas against a rental car agency over a minor
accident involving his daughter Jenna. Bush in April 1999 sued
Enterprise Rent-A-Car in Austin for the Sept. 8, 1998, accident in
which Jenna was driving Bush's jeep when she was hit by a rented
car, according to an article in Saturday's New York Daily News.
Bush's lawyer Sean Breen said that although Bush had insurance, he
paid for the repairs and that was why he was suing. ``We
exhaustively tried to resolve it short of a lawsuit, but they
refused to pay,'' Breen said. The lawsuit alleged Enterprise shared
blame because it had rented a car to a driver whose license was
suspended. The case was eventually settled for about $2,000, Breen
said.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE RULES ON PETITIONS
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge on Friday ruled that Illinois must accept
contested petitions to place Green Party candidate Ralph Nader on
the November presidential ballot. The petitions had been rejected
by the State Election Board because they failed to meet a new
filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN A CONSERVATIVE INVESTOR
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential hopeful Joseph Lieberman's personal financial
statement _ which includes the investments of his wife, Hadassah _
shows a conservative list of investments, with the bulk of his net
worth coming from mutual funds, a blind trust and real estate.
According to government financial records for 1999, Lieberman
earned $141,300 as a senator and received $45,000 in book
royalties. His largest investment is a blind trust valued at
$100,000 to $250,000 and he has an individual retirement account
consisting mainly of government securities valued at $9,000 to
$135,000.

 &HT;    Smith, Batch show up when whistle blows
 &HT;    By Ken Segiura
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dallas and Detroit are two teams that many people
expect to make strong bids for playoff appearances. Sporting News
magazine even predicted a Super Bowl title for the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams, though, will enter the season with two important
pieces not having played a single down in a preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith missed the first two games
with a strained big toe and then missed the last three after
straining a calf. Detroit quarterback Charlie Batch is expected to
be back from a broken tibial plateau (the bone behind the kneecap)
for the opening game next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be ready to roll by the first game, without a
doubt in my mind,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith last missed preseason in 1993, in a contract holdout.
After missing the first two games of the regular season that year,
Smith went on to rush for a league-leading 1,486 yards. A
significant difference is that Smith was 24 then and 31 now.
</P>
<P>
   Smith admitted that it would help to get some snaps, but figures
it isn't worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to ask yourself this question: Are we going to win
a Super Bowl in the preseason?''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, the Cowboys didn't win anything in the
preseason. They lost 24-17 to St. Louis Thursday for an 0-5 summer.
They have lost 14 of their last 15 preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Of Batch, Lions coach Bobby Ross said, ``I'm really counting on
Charlie now to come back and be ready. He may not, in which case
we'll still move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Batch's recovery became more urgent when backup Mike Tomczak
broke a leg against the Raiders Aug. 18. Batch only began
participating in full 11-on-11 drills last week. He looked sharp,
although Ross instructed the defense to run at Batch but not bump
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to worry me about Charlie, I can tell you that,''
Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   To win, the Lions will need Batch healthy and in the lineup.
Last year, they were 6-4 when he started and 2-5 without him.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUAR AILMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor probably will miss at
least the first two games, which means he will have missed action
because of injury in each of his three NFL seasons. Taylor, one of
the league's best backs when healthy, sprained the medial
collateral ligament in his left knee in Jacksonville's Aug. 11
preseason game against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has been taking heat from fans for his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them go out and take 100 reps,'' Taylor said. ``It's a
physical sport. Stuff happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has been spending 12 hours a day rehabbing his knee and
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   One of his injured teammates, Pro Bowl safety Carnell Lake, was
a little miffed that the team ended his season by putting him on
injured reserve. Lake was with the Steelers when they kept
cornerback Rod Woodson on the roster after he tore his anterior
cruciate ligament in the first game of the season. Woodson made it
back to play in the Super Bowl that same season.
</P>
<P>
   Lake, who had surgery for a broken bone in his left foot, could
conceivably be ready to play by January, when the Jaguars expect to
be making their Super Bowl run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could get back, and it would have been nice to hold
a spot,'' Lake said, ``but I understand the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TEAL CURTAIN
</P>
<P>
   Panthers coach George Seifert plans at times to use his four
big-name defensive linemen _ ends Reggie White and ex-Falcon Chuck
Smith and tackles Sean Gilbert and Eric Swann _ together as a unit.
The four played together in a preseason game against Baltimore Aug.
18 and looked strong.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping them healthy _ Swann is the youngest at 29 _ will be
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantee through this whole deal,'' Seifert said.
</P>
<P>
   CULPEPPER SPRAY
</P>
<P>
   The two NFC Central games between the Buccaneers and Bears just
got more interesting. After Tampa cut veteran defensive tackle Brad
Culpepper, the Bears quickly picked him up. Culpepper had a few
insights about his old team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that team's peaked,'' he said. ``Defensively, I don't
know that they're where we were last year, and ung might be the
best line in the league for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I credit my success to them,'' said Martin, who ran for 258
yards on 42 carries this preseason. ``I'm not getting hit in the
backfield like I was previously, and that makes a world of
difference for runners like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   POPE COPES Cincinnati Bengals punter Daniel Pope said he felt
good about his chances to make the team through the preseason, but
that didn't stop him from occasionally stressing out.
</P>
<P>
   Pope won the job when the team released punter Brad Costello on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always trying to read what the coaches are saying.
You're making mountains out of molehills,'' Pope said. ``You're
thinking, `Oh, man, they like him better than me.' That's when you
have to tell yourself to stop and say you just have to go out and
kick the football.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The name of the new NFL franchise in Houston is expected to be
the Texans. It will be revealed Sept. 6 at a Houston Astros game. .
. . Among the Lions' cuts Tuesday was Charlie Sanders Jr., son of
assistant director of pro personnel Charlie Sanders, and Joe
O'Neill, younger brother of Lions linebacker Kevin O'Neill. . . .
In 2001, the 10 highest-paid Cowboys will count $35.8 million
against the salary cap, plus another $8 million in money for
players no longer on the team. With the cap projected to be about
$67 million, that leaves them less than $24 million for their 43
remaining players.

 &HT;    Al Gore to fight for Fla.'s 25 votes
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He was supposed to be gone by now. A smile. A wave.
``Don't forget me in November.'' A fond adieu.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Gore, like a tourist who doesn't know the season is over,
seems to be staying. He likes it here so much that after visiting
South Florida on Wednesday he is dropping by North Florida on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is not what Florida Republicans had in mind. They want Gore
to go away. Anywhere but here. And they still hope to drive him out
of the Sunshine State long before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as state GOP Chairman Al Cardenas explained it, is Plan A.
Launch an all-out campaign against Gore. Television ads. Phone
banks. The whole bit. Drive the polls so that Texas Gov. George W.
Bush is so far ahead of the vice president that the Democrat,
shortly after Labor Day, takes a look at the numbers and gives up.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's 25 electoral votes, nearly 10 percent of the 270
needed to win, then go to Bush, who spends most of his money and
time in other crucial states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who said last week that he will ``absolutely not'' give up
on Florida, is giving every indication that he means it. When he
won the March southern primaries, he declared victory in
Tallahassee, not in his home state of Tennessee. At the Democratic
National Convention, he let Florida have the honor of casting the
ballots that officially made him the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Democrats have been running Gore commercials in the
state. When Gore is not here, his wife Tipper has campaigned for
him. In fact, Tipper will be with Gore on Monday, then stay an
extra day by herself to squeeze in campaign stops in Orlando, Tampa
and Jacksonville. Gore also has had private meetings with a small
group of Florida reporters to discuss his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has countered with his own visits to the state. He was in
Miami on Friday, and his running mate, Dick Cheney, will campaign
in Florida on Thursday. Bush has increased his advertising, with
commercials running in every major Florida market. He also is
inviting small groups of reporters from key battleground states to
Austin, Texas, to meet with him and his senior advisers.
</P>
<P>
   All this tells Cardenas that while he is still working on Plan
A, he needs to be prepared to quickly shift to Plan B: ``Doing
whatever it takes to make sure that we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Cardenas is the Republican machine of Gov. Jeb Bush, who
has publicly said he does not want to face the ``humiliation'' of
his brother losing Florida. But as powerful as the Bush machine is,
the younger brother can only point to one statewide victory.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Bush lost a painfully close race for governor in 1994
against Gov. Lawton Chiles, who died in 1998. After a dismal start
to his reelection campaign, Chiles managed to pull out a victory by
relying on bedrock Democratic votes in key counties. Four years
later, Bush won easily, but his opponent, then-Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKay, ran an anemic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's 25 electoral votes have become crucial in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest Gore has an edge in eight states, with 170
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has an edge in 23 states, including Florida, with 246
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore can flip Florida_ and recent polls indicate he may have
chance _ his total would go to 195 electoral votes and Bush's would
drop to 221, putting both candidates within reach of the 270 needed
to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the states still fluid, another revealing look at
Florida's role in this election is a breakdown of the 10 largest
states, which control 257 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is ahead in California (54 votes), New York (33), Illinois
(22), Michigan (18) and New Jersey (15), giving him 142 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ahead in Texas (32), Florida (25), Pennsylvania (23),
Ohio (21) and North Carolina (14), giving him 115 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore wins Florida, Bush drops to 90 electoral votes, and Gore
climbs to 167.
</P>
<P>
   Can Gore really win Florida? Democratic presidential candidates
have won 15 times since 1900, and Republicans have won 10 times.
Democrats won every presidential race from 1900 to 1948, except in
1928 when Floridians voted for Republican Herbert Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   By 1952, Dwight Eisenhower began a string of GOP victories
interrupted in 1964 by Lyndon Johnson and 1976 by Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton nearly won in 1992, losing to Republican incumbent
George Bush by 100,130 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Clinton easily defeated Republican Bob Dole _ making
Clinton, Carter and Johnson the only three Democrats to win Florida
since Harry Truman won in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a Gore victory can be found in the successful 1994
Chiles and 1996 Clinton campaigns. Both relied heavily on older,
dependable Democratic voters who fear that Republicans will not
protect their Social Security and Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns also depended on strong support in minority
communities, particularly among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chiles campaign, Gore can find another hopeful sign.
Chiles portrayed Jeb Bush as an unsteady, unproven politician with
no government experience. He suggested that Bush's lack of
credentials could hurt the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already seizing on these issues. He tells seniors he
will protect Social Security and Medicare and reduce the cost of
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tells minorities that the Democratic Party remains the
place where their voices will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore often reminds voters, sometimes in subtle ways, that he
is better prepared for the job than the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the 1994 and 1996 Florida election map shows where
Gore must do well if he wants to win the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chiles and Clinton won handily in Palm Beach, Broward and
Miami-Dade counties with their huge blocks of senior and minority
voters.
</P>
<P>
   As of June, there were 804,752 registered Republicans and
1,095,532 registered Democrats in those three counties, according
to state elections officials.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, there are 3,326,423 Republicans and 3,687,270
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiles/Clinton results also relied on wins in three central
West Coast counties: Pinellas, Pasco and Hernando.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper east coast, Democrats won Flagler and Volusia
counties. Plus, they won 10 smaller counties surrounding
Tallahassee. They also won the Gainesville area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't duplicate what Chiles and Clinton did, we can't
win,'' said one of Gore's Florida strategists. ``That's why MacKay
lost. He didn't win in Dade or Pinellas, and his margin in Broward
and Palm Beach was not as strong. A Democrat can't win without
those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Gore is staying in Florida is that his campaign
is hoping to be part of a trifecta of victories that includes wins
in key congressional races and for the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by Republican Connie Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Two congressional victories in particular are expected to be
helpful to Gore. Democrat Linda Chapin is favored to win the
Orlando-area seat being vacated by Republican U.S. Rep. Bill
McCollum. Popular and well known, Chapin is expected to push up
Democratic and crossover voters in an area that Republicans count
on as much as Democrats count on South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Another race expected to increase Democratic turnout, at least
marginally, is state Rep. Elaine Bloom's bid to unseat Republican
U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw from District 22, which stretches along the
coast from Miami Beach to Juno Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee has targeted both those races
as well as the bid by Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson to win the
U.S. Senate seat. With both national and state parties prepared to
spend millions on those races, Democratic campaign strategists say
that will help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican National Committee strategist scoffed at the
notion of coattails working in reverse. ``People don't vote for the
top of the ticket based on what they are doing down-ticket,'' he
said. ``If they really believe that is going to work, they are in
for a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   For Floridians, the biggest surprise may be that the state is
competitive at all. ``A lot of people thought we wouldn't be
here,'' said Karl Koch, who has worked for the Chiles and Clinton
campaigns and now works for Gore's. ``Anyone who counts us out is
making a mistake, and we hope they make that mistake.''

What would the founding fathers do?BC-FATHERS-AZR(a) 
 &HT;    U.S. FOUNDERS CHOSE REASON OVER FAITH(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BARBARA YOST(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush announces that Jesus is his favorite political
philosopher. Al Gore seeks moral guidance by invoking the pop
refrain ``WWJD? - What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   But as religious references infuse this year's presidential
campaign, another question arises: ``What would Jefferson do?''
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans in 2000, the answer would be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In his time, the author of the Declaration of Independence was
branded an atheist in some traditional religious circles. Like many
of the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson embraced a basic belief
in God - deism - but was also a man of science, intrigued by the
philosophies of the Age of Enlightenment, a European intellectual
movement that contended all of life, including religion, could be
understood through the process of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men who forged the new American nation embraced God
but distrusted organized religion, disdainful of abuses by the
powerful clergy who ruled the Church of England and held sway over
the English government itself. In one of his letters, Jefferson
charged that yoking church and state turned human beings into
``dupes and drudges.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to avoid such mischief, the framers of the U.S.
Constitution codified their concerns in the First Amendment:
``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson would interpret this as a mandate for the separation
of church and government. The article also would be construed not
only as freedom (beginitalic)of (enditalic)religion but also
freedom (beginitalic)from (enditalic)religion.
</P>
<P>
   Americans today who hope to paint a picture of the founding
fathers as a pious bunch risk rewriting history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is really overstated,'' says John Corrigan,
professor of American studies and religious studies at Arizona
State University. ``They (the founding fathers) were not
particularly religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Brook Simpson, ASU professor of history and humanity, calls them
men of reason and enlightenment who saw God's will as expressed in
the laws of nature and whose mixed bag of ideas cannot be
appropriated to fit a particular agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on today is that they treat the founders as a sort
of cafeteria, where they get to pick and choose,'' Simpson says.
</P>
<P>
   The beliefs held by these 18th-century men were often at odds
with prevailing thought in a time when church and faith held
central roles in society.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, Jefferson was a conventional Christian, an
Anglican - the Church of England in the New World. He served as a
vestryman in his parish. He believed that religion holds society
together and goes hand in hand with morality. In the Declaration of
Independence, he refers variously to the creator, nature's God and
divine providence.
</P>
<P>
   But while Jefferson embraced the teachings of Jesus as a good
moral foundation, he doubted Jesus' divinity. He even rewrote the
New Testament, cutting and pasting passages to remove references to
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson ``preferred a world of science and rationality,''
Simpson says.
</P>
<P>
   So passionate was Jefferson about religious freedom that his
tombstone lists as his three greatest accomplishments the writing
of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, authoring the
Declaration of Independence and founding the University of
Virginia, a purposely secular institution in contrast with his own
Anglican-run alma mater, the College of William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The epitaph he requested omits his role as president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's friend and philosophical confederate, James Madison,
also professed a general belief in God and wrote in
(beginitalic)Memorial and Remonstrance(enditalic) that an
individual's duty to his ``universal sovereign'' came before his
civic responsibilities. But he shared Jefferson's wariness of what
was then termed ``priestcraft,'' or clerical hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, an Anglican, had been educated at the College of New
Jersey, now Princeton University. Though the school had been
founded by the Presbyterian Church, he chose it for its aversion to
ministerial rule.
</P>
<P>
   As principal author of the U.S. Constitution, Madison was as
adamant as Jefferson about the Establishment clause. Like
Jefferson, he advocated ``a perfect separation between
ecclesiastical and civil matters.''
</P>
<P>
   During his presidency, Madison rejected requests to make
official religious proclamations or to declare religious holidays.
Citizens of the new United States, he insisted, would have to
accept the absence of a state religion - disestablishment.
</P>
<P>
   When creating the American government, its framers not only
believed fervently in disestablishment but also neatly avoided
choosing one religion from among the many faiths espoused in the
colonies, including Episcopalian (Anglican), Congregational (church
of the Pilgrims), Dutch Reformed, Presbyterian, Quaker, Methodist
and Calvinism.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland had been founded as a Roman Catholic colony but fell to
pressures from England to establish Anglican parishes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the American Revolution, Corrigan says there were
between 2,300 and 2,500 Jews living in America - with little
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complex figures in colonial religious life was
the venerable Benjamin Franklin. As a young man, Franklin had
undergone a conversion to Presbyterianism, but ``it didn't take,''
Corrigan says.

   In fact, for such a champion of democracy, Franklin was
something of an elitist when it came to religion, says Richard
Wenz, ASU professor emeritus of American religious studies. In a
letter to his daughter, Franklin encouraged her to attend church
services and to heed the message of the sermon. But for himself, he
believed he had evolved beyond the need for catechism.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jefferson, Franklin was more intrigued by science than
spirituality. Religion was an intellectual pursuit, useful for
moral grounding. A wise man graduated from the need for further
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he professed a belief in God and, just a month before his
death, answered a friend's request to state his Christian
principles, saying, ``I believe in one God, creator of the
universe. That he governs the world by his providence. That he
ought to be worshiped. That the most acceptable service we can
render to him, is doing good to his other children. That the soul
of man is immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   Immortality was a basic tenet of deism, along with a belief in
God and a love of freedom. America's second president, John Adams,
was solidly deist. For more than 60 years, he embraced the liberal
Unitarian church.
</P>
<P>
   Like his colleagues, Adams denounced the priestcraft and
believed the principles of Jesus had deteriorated into superstition
and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington wore his faith as humbly as he did his
political leadership, unfettered by doctrine. Though an Anglican
vestryman like Jefferson, he insisted that ``my tenets are few and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   To Washington, God was the ``grand architect'' of the universe,
``great ruler of events,'' ``higher cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The faith he expressed in conversation was generic.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, one of the richest and most provocative treatises
on early American religious thought was penned by master wordsmith
Thomas Paine, whose 1776 pamphlet (beginitalic)Common
Sense(enditalic) helped to incite passions favorable to the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1794, Paine published (beginitalic)Age of Reason.
(enditalic)Son of a Quaker, Paine said, ``I believe in one God and
no more, and I hope for happiness beyond this life.{hellip}I
believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving
mercy and endeavoring to make our fellow creatures happy.''

UNITED'S DEAL WITH ITS PILOTS MAY SOON END DISRUPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., fyi, this story replaces an AP story in early editions of
the paper)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airlines and its pilots reached a tentative contract on
Saturday that could bring an end to months of disruption that has
forced the airline to cancel more than 20,000 flights and has given
it the worst on-time record in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating around the clock since Wednesday at a suburban
Chicago motel, the two sides reached agreement on the final issues
of job security and compensation late Saturday, one week before
their self-imposed deadline of Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very pleased with this tentative agreement,''
said Capt. Rick Dubinsky, the chairman of the United branch of the
Air Line Pilots Association, in a message to members. ``By any
standard, it is truly industry leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the union nor the airline, which is the world's largest,
would divulge details of the tentative contract, which has not been
presented to the airline's 10,000 pilots. The union's executive
council and the pilots must vote to approve the deal before it is
official. But Dubinsky predicted that the pilots would ``embrace
the results enthusiastically.''
</P>
<P>
   James E. Goodwin, United's chairman, also described the
agreement as industry leading in a statement released by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said that the company's next priority would be to
conclude an agreement with the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 55,000 United
employees, including mechanics, customer service representatives,
and ramp workers.
</P>
<P>
   Their contract came up for renewal last month, leading to
further disruption as United reported that the number of its jets
taken out of service because of mechanical difficulties suddenly
soared.
</P>
<P>
   United declared an ``operational emergency'' in five cities last
week, initiating a contract clause that forces mechanics to work
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The airline rescinded the order on Friday after the union said
it would set back the contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge that this has been a difficult and frustrating
process, particularly for our customers, our front-line employees,
and our pilots,'' Goodwin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He might have added his own name to the list. The labor unrest
at United began just as the company announced its intent to buy US
Airways, the country's sixth largest carrier, for $4.3 billion. The
merger itself was highly controversial but coupled with United's
operational woes, opposition in Congress and among consumer groups
has grown stronger. Now, many analysts believe the chances of
winning government approval of the merger are slim.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's largest employee-owned company, UAL Corp.,
United's parent, was supposed to be immune from the kind of labor
unrest it has experienced in recent months. After employees gained
control of 55 percent of the company's stock in 1994 during one of
the airline industry's most difficult downturns, the company began
referring to them as ``owners.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the past six years, as both the industry and United
posted record profits, employees began to resent the wages and work
rules they gave up for stock that is locked away in their pension
plans. United managers raised expectations by promising to deliver
new, lucrative contracts before the previous ones came up for
renewal. That is a rare event in the airline industry, where talks
often drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot contract came up for renewal in April, and when no
deal was reached, pilots began refusing to fly overtime. Under
federal law, airline workers cannot strike until given permission
by a federal mediator. Short of a strike, the pilots' only
available tactic on the job was to decline overtime. The union said
it left that decision to individual pilots.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, United was forced to cancel many flights on their
day of departure, inconveniencing thousands of passengers. The
cancellations grew worse even as United began paring its schedule.
The airline estimates that from April to Aug. 17 it was forced to
cancel 23,211 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pilots and the machinists have contended that they
have not orchestrated any job actions and many of this summer's
delays and cancellations have been attributed to weather, it is
hard to know how much Saturday's tentative contract will affect
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the agreement would improve the airline's performance,
Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, said, ``I think this will help a
great deal.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 19 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

TROUBLED MAN KILLS 3 AND THEN HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For two years, Mark Cote, a 29-year-old phlebotomist
from Waterbury, Conn., had been seething at a firefighter who he
believed had broken up his marriage. The man taunted Cote
continually and accused him of harassment, said Cote's mother,
Rachel Cote.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Mrs. Cote said, something snapped in her son's
brain.
</P>
<P>
   He took a Tech-9 semiautomatic pistol out to the street; killed
his friend and upstairs neighbor, Brian Miller, as he sat in his
car; pushed Miller's body out; and drove off, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   He sped to the intersection where the firefighter, Jaime
Quinones, was collecting money from passing drivers for a muscular
dystrophy charity.
</P>
<P>
   He leaned out the window and shot Quinones dead, then raced five
miles across town to the home of a woman who had broken up with him
two weeks before and killed her mother, who also lived there, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with police officers converging on the house, he went
upstairs to his ex-girlfriend's apartment and put a bullet in his
head.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 20 minutes on a sunny Saturday morning, the police
said, Cote had left four people dead over a seven-mile swath of
Waterbury, a struggling old factory city of 105,000 people 85 miles
from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I live a million years I won't understand it,'' Mrs. Cote
said as she stared at the floor in the living room of the apartment
she and her son shared on Congress Avenue, a gritty street in a
rough blue-collar neighborhood. ``I can comprehend Quinones. I
don't condone it but I can comprehend it. But the mother and Brian,
I don't know. Brian was his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The police could hardly make any more sense of the killings. Lt.
Joe Pesce of the Waterbury police said of the first victim: ``Did
he shoot him to take the car? Did he shoot him because he was mad
at him? We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the shooting of Cote's ex-girlfriend's mother, Maria
Hernandez, 40, Pesce said, ``He may have just killed her out of
spite to get back at the ex-girlfriend.'
</P>
<P>
   As Cote went on his deadly rampage, the police were always one
step behind him, Pesce said.
</P>
<P>
   Cote fired his first shots at 10:51 a.m. in front of his home at
371 Congress Avenue, the police said. He shot Miller, 30, several
times inside his red Honda, hauled him out of the car, shot him
several more times _ there were at least eight shots altogether _
and left him on the pavement to die, Pesce said.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later and a mile and a half away, at the corner of
Highland and Sunnyside Avenues, Cote found Quinones, a 38-year-old
ex-Marine, leaning on the bumper of a firetruck, taking a break
from ``passing the boot'' for muscular dystrophy, the acting fire
chief, James Trainor, said. Cote shot Quinones several times, then
headed down a hill toward the center of town, Pesce said. His
ex-girlfriend, Maria Perez, 23, and her mother lived five miles
away, on Kenyon Street.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was in her kitchen cooking chicken, her relatives
said. Cote entered through the back door and shot her once, her
family and the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in Hernandez's house called 911, but the line went dead,
Pesce said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher called the number back. Cote picked up.
</P>
<P>
   He told the dispatcher that everything was fine and that the
children must have been playing with the phone, and he hung up, the
lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   He went upstairs to Perez's apartment. He did not threaten her
or her three children, Pesce said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told her that he killed her mother,'' the lieutenant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez apparently ran downstairs to her mother's apartment,
because when the 911 dispatcher called back again, she picked up
and screamed that Cote had just killed her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The police, who were already chasing Cote from the intersection
where he had shot Quinones, arrived at 16 Kenyon Street and saw the
red Honda they had been looking for sitting out front with its
engine running. As Perez ran out of the house with her children,
Cote shot himself in the head inside Perez's apartment, the police
said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Cote's mother said her son's life began to unravel in 1998 when
he found out that his wife, Naomi, was having an affair with
Quinones. He immediately left her and moved back in with his
mother, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinones had Cote's wife, but he was not content to let matters
rest, Rachel Cote said.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighter would drive slowly by Cote's house frequently
and was still doing it as recently as two days ago, she said. He
and Cote's ex-wife would come into the truck stop where Mrs. Cote
worked as a waitress and stay for several hours, ``just to rub the
salt in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cote's ex-wife got a restraining order against him, Mrs. Cote
said, and Cote was accused several times of violating it. The
charges never stuck, she said, but all the time Cote was spending
in court made it hard for him to hold onto a job, and he lost three
of them in less than two years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said, he began to grow more depressed, more
angry. He had a dispute with Miller a few months ago, but they
appeared to have patched things up.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his marriage collapsed, Cote began seeing Perez,
Mrs. Cote said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, she broke up with him, but Mrs. Cote insisted
that the break was amicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted more than she was ready to give, but they still
talked on the phone,'' Mrs. Cote said. On Monday, she said, Cote
had planned to buy clothes for Perez's children.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house where Perez and Hernandez lived, family
members recalled that Cote had a mean temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like him from the beginning,'' said Hernandez's
son-in-law Kevin Schock. ``He was argumentative, the way he
expressed his ways of showing emotion. He would get mad. He
wouldn't think before he did things. He shot her in the kitchen
while she was cooking chicken. He came in through the back door and
shot her. I hope he burns in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Barbara Schock, Hernandez's daughter, said: ``She was
a good mother. She didn't deserve none of that. She was loved by
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Schock said Cote was upset at Hernandez because Perez ``loved
her mother more than she loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's one of those triangle things,'' he said.
``Obsessive love, fatal attraction, however you want to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinones' colleagues in the Fire Department, where he had been a
firefighter for six years, described him as a private man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't discuss the personal issues that he had,'' said
Trainor. ``But if he had problems with somebody off the job, do you
think he deserved to get killed for it?''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; HEADLONG &LR; , by Michael Frayn. (Picador USA, $14.) The author
uses his skills as a playwright to create a fast-moving internal
novel about a philosopher named Martin who stumbles onto what he
suspects to be an unknown Bruegel masterpiece in the home of a
country gentleman. With dollar signs in his eyes, Martin plays
scholarly detective to uncover the painting's provenance, hiding
his scheme from his wife and gambling his career and marriage. In
this ``rueful and amusing'' tale, which was chosen by the editors
of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, ``the big
action is Martin turning a page _ movingly, comically,
delightfully,'' Randy Cohen wrote here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN: A Life of Diego Rivera &LR; , by
Patrick Marnham. (University of California, $18.95.) The great
Mexican muralist is portrayed as an amoral chameleon who managed to
befriend capitalists like the Rockefellers while attacking them in
his Marxist-flavored art. Last year our reviewer, Michael
Kimmelman, called this an ``urbane and entertaining biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LEPER'S COMPANIONS &LR; , by Julia Blackburn. (Vintage
International, $12.) In this novel, a bereaved Englishwoman
retreats internally from the modern day into her same village in
the year 1410, where she takes up with a band of pilgrims headed
for the Holy Land. In 1999 in these pages, Bruce Bawer praised the
book's ``hypnotic vision of the world's horror and beauty, banality
and sacredness _ and of the frailty and splendor of the human
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 'TIS: A Memoir &LR; , by Frank McCourt. (Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $14.) The author picks up his life story where ``Angela's
Ashes'' left off, describing his journey from Ireland to New York
at the age of 19 and his fitful development as son, lover, husband,
writer and teacher. His ``narrative gift'' and ``spirited
intelligence'' inform this ``exploration of the elusive American
dream,'' Maureen Howard wrote here in 1999. `` 'Tis a success
story.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE GREAT SHAME: And the Triumph of the Irish in the
English-Speaking World &LR; , by Thomas Keneally (Anchor, $18), the
author of ``Schindler's List'' tells the story of the Irish
diaspora in the 19th century, especially the thousands of men and
women sent in chains to penal colonies in Australia, among them a
core of political prisoners who continued to fight for an
independent Ireland. The result is ``an epic tale of courage and
ingenuity,'' Jay P. Dolan said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DONA INES VS. OBLIVION &LR; , by Ana Teresa Torres. (Grove, $13.)
Speaking to a variety of people, both living and dead, this novel's
narrator tells how her cloistered life as matriarch of a wealthy
Caracas family slipped into chaos and tragedy. ``Dona Ines' cranky,
engaging, importuning, resentful, obsessed and relentless voice
guides us through a family history that is also mired in Venezuelan
history,'' John Vernon wrote here in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEMINGWAY: The Final Years &LR; , by Michael Reynolds. (Norton,
$15.95.) In the final volume of his five-part life of Ernest
Hemingway, the author, who died last month at the age of 63,
describes the writer's experiences during World War II, his rocky
relationship with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh, and his dependency
on alcohol and prescription drugs. Last year in these pages, James
Wood called this an ``excellent and exhaustive biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WAY PEOPLE RUN: Stories &LR; , by Christopher Tilghman. (Picador
USA, $12.) Many of the lonely, middle-aged protagonists in these
tales continue to feel the afterburn of sibling spites and other
family hurts, yet are unable to match the intensity of their
childhood experiences. ``Tilghman has a deft, Cheeveresque way of
lending risky undertones to the rituals of suburban life,'' Rand
Richards Cooper wrote in the Book Review last year. ``These are
long stories'' that ``read almost like miniature novels.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CELEBRATION, U.S.A.: Living in Disney's Brave New Town &LR; , by
Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins. (Owl/Holt, $15.) A
correspondent for The New York Times and his wife (also a
journalist) describe the mixed blessings of living with their two
youngest children in Disney's micromanaged Norman Rockwell
fantasyland in central Florida. Their account ``reflects a
scrupulously maintained reportorial balance,'' David L. Kirp wrote
here in 1999. ``Its tales of family life ring true because they are
drawn directly from the authors' own experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ELUSIVE EMBRACE: Desire and the Riddle of Identity &LR; , by
Daniel Mendelsohn. (Vintage, $12.) A classical scholar explores his
family's complex history and the landscape of gay and heterosexual
desire. ``This charming apercu-filled memoir is ... a personal myth
about undoing family myths,'' Jonathan Lear wrote here in 1999.

EMMITT SMITH RETURNS TO COWBOYS PRACTICE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Emmitt Smith made the Cowboys' day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who did not play in any of the Cowboys' five exhibition
games, looked like the Emmitt Smith of old yesterday in his first
practice with the team since Aug. 8, when he strained his right
calf. He had missed the first two preseason games with a sprained
toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, he made some real good cuts in the running game,''
Cowboys coach Dave Campo said. ``... He felt good. He looked good.
He's ready to go. He feels refreshed. He's got fresh legs.
Obviously, it's exciting to have him back out there.''

   Receiver Jason Tucker (groin) and fullback Robert Thomas (knee)
also resumed practice yesterday, giving the Cowboys their full
complement of offensive players for the first time this season,
aside from tight end David LaFleur, who missed the 75-minute
workout to rest his sore groin after Thursday's 24-17 exhibition
loss to the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pieces are coming back into place. We're feeling real
good,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Smith left no doubt that he will be in the starting
lineup for the Cowboys' season opener against the Philadelphia
Eagles next Sunday at Texas Stadium. He pronounced himself rested
and ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing,'' he said. ``If you're thinking otherwise, you're
mistaken. I'm playing for as long as I can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is unconcerned about missing training camp, and he has
reason to be unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Smith missed the entire preseason and the first two
regular-season games in a contract holdout, but he finished the
season as the league's leading rusher with 1,486 yards and had a
career-best 5.3 yards per carry average.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Smith missed two of the team's four exhibition
games after having ankle surgery to remove bone chips. Still, he
was fifth in the league in rushing with 1,074 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all are worried more about it than I am,'' Smith, 31, said.
``... Just go play the game. The game ain't changed. There's
nothing to be worried about. The five guys up front do their thing;
I make my reads; and I do my thing. It's not like I just began
playing football. It's not. Nothing's changed but the date on the
calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith compared football to riding a bike. Now that he has his
two wheels fully healed, the only thing left is for him to get back
into playing shape. He figures that shouldn't take long, since his
rehabilitation included running and cutting drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get right back on,'' Smith said. ``I still know how to
catch. I still know how to carry the ball. I still know how to cut.
Just go out and do the same thing. \RI\S still know who to block,
know how to block. Ain't much changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has rushed for more than 1,000-yards in nine of his
10 seasons, is the catalyst to an offense that was revamped after
ranking 16th in the league last season. Without him, the Cowboys
scored only seven touchdowns in an 0-5 exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sum it up in a nutshell, he's the third all-time leading
rusher and second in touchdowns scored,'' Robert Thomas said.
``When you've got all that working for you, any time he's not out
there on the field, it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a machine, and he's one of the biggest bolts in this
whole machine. If he's not out there, it puts more pressure on
other aspects of the game. He means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will spend this week trying to get comfortable with the
game plan. He admits he is uncertain how many touches he will have
against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, though, is not worried about the running game. It is in
safe hands now that Smith is back and backup Chris Warren is
running as well as he has in his three seasons with the Cowboys.
Warren rushed for 45 yards on eight carries in the team's preseason
game against the Denver Broncos last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fortunate thing is we feel like we have some good
tailbacks along with Emmitt,'' Campo said. ``Obviously, Emmitt is
going to go as long as Emmitt can go, because Emmitt's the man. But
I'm very, very confident with Chris Warren, especially. Chris has
had a wonderful preseason. He's excited. We're going to get him the
football. There will be a combination there where we have an
opportunity to use two tailbacks.''
