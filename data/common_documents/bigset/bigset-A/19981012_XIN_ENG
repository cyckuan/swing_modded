<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim They Developed Nuclear Detector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists claim that
they have developed a nuclear detector which will help recreate
conditions of matter akin to what existed at the point of the
origin of the universe, Press Trust of India (PTI) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Teams from two of the country's premier nuclear research bodies
-- Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) and Variable Energy
Cyclotron Center (VECC) -- have developed a nuclear detector,
which will provide a plethora of information to get a feel of what
happened right after the "big bang" millions of years ago, PTI
said.
</P>
<P>
The detector fabricated at VECC in collaboration with several
universities and national institutes will be the first of its kind
at the Geneva-based particle physics laboratory, CERN, which has
embarked upon the construction of a huge new particle accelerator
-- the large hardon collidor (LHC), it said.
</P>
<P>
The detector, to be fitted in the LHC, will pick up shining
light particles out of a collision between two atomic nuclei.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Ready to Discuss Reduction of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Sunday that the Greek Cypriot side is ready to
discuss as a prior issue the reduction of armaments on the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remark in a speech at the 18th annual march
of the refugees from the Turkish controlled north of the island.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything possible to find a solution within the
framework of the U.N. decisions and resolutions," which provide
for a bizonal, bicommunal federation on the island, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the Turkish proposal for a confederation in Cyprus has
already been rejected by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Our political will is not sufficient. What is necessary is a
more determined intervention on the part of the international
community toward the Turkish side," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led "shuttle talks," proposed by Secretary General
Kofi Annan, will be conducted by U.N. resident representative in
Cyprus Dame Ann Hercus. The talks are aimed at reducing tension on
the island and breaking the deadlock in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Clerides said, "we will continue the policy of
reinforcing our defense with any weapon we consider strengthens
our security." This is the aim of the joint defense pact between
Cyprus and Greece, signed in November 1993, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said "our aim will be to find a solution to the Cyprus
problem through peaceful means, which will be just, viable and
functional."
</P>
<P>
He assured refugees taking part in the march that "we want a
Cyprus where all human rights are restored, including the right
of refugees to return to their homes."
</P>
<P>
The refugees held their annual march to protest the refusal of
the Turkish authorities to allow their return.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained 35,000-strong troops in northern Cyprus,
which was declared unilaterally by Turkish Cypriots as a breakaway
state, recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Over 50 Apply for Hangman Job in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland has been
flooded with more than 50 applications from regions as far away
as Europe and Asia after it advertized for a new hangman, the
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Swazi Justice Minister Paul Khumalo as saying that
he had received applications from Canada, Britain, South Africa
and even Japan. Khumalo said he had "more than enough"
applications.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland advertized the vacancy after its previous hangman
deserted his post more than 13 years ago and no local citizens
could be convinced to replace him.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's last hangman was reportedly a South African,
"disappeared without a trace," in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to Khumalo, there presently were eight prisoners on
death row at Matsapa Maximum Prison.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need any experience or degree but the applicant must
be a very brave and classically educated person," He said, but he
was unable to say when his department would start interviewing
the applicants.
</P>
<P>
A recent upsurge in the number of death sentences delivered by
courts had forced the Swazi government to "revive" the practice
of hanging criminals, a senior official of the Swazi Justice
Department said.
</P>
<P>
The last execution in the kingdom was in 1983 when a
businesswoman was hanged for the ritual murder of her domestic
servant's son.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Building Strategic Partnership with Uzbekistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Sunday that during his visit to Uzbekistan he will sign an
agreement on bilateral relations and a 10-year bilateral program
for deepening economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the Itar-Tass news agency before his left for
Uzbekistan's capital Tashkent Sunday morning that cooperation
between the two countries has become wider and more dynamic,
following his talks with Uzbek President Islam Karimov in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We have mutually defined our relations as strategic
partnership and comprehensive cooperation. They are based on long
history of friendship, mutual respect and sincere mutual
understanding," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin admitted that activities in the humanitarian
field fell far short of goals.
</P>
<P>
There are financial and economic difficulties, Yeltsin said,
adding that other things hindering bilateral relations were
reluctance and lack of vitality.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Yeltsin will discuss with leaders of
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan the situation in Afghanistan and along
the CIS southern borders, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss concrete steps for neutralizing a threat
posed by Afghanistan to the security and stability in the region,
Yeltsin added.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM to Visit Turkey on Turco-Syrian Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa is to come to Turkey Monday on a mission aimed
at easing the current tension between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Sunday afternoon by Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan at a press briefing in the port
city of Antalya, where the Balkan summit will be held from October
12 to 13.
</P>
<P>
Utkan said that Moussa will deliver a message from Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to his Turkish counterpart Suleyman
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem is to meet with Moussa in
Ankara on the latest developments of Turkish-Syrian tension, Utkan
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied that Turkey has seen some positive
responses from the Syrian side so far over the alleged Syrian
support of Turkey's Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has issued an ultimatum to give Syria 45 days to stop
aiding the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) militants and
threatened to use force to destroy Kurdish bases inside Syria if
Damascus fails to do so.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerilla war since 1984 for an
independent homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria denounced Turkey's growing military alliance with Israel
which its says imperils Arab security and undermines its
bargaining position in negotiating for the return of the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Ankara's threat of using force prompted serious concerns in the
Arab world that a military conflict between Turkey and Syria will
make the Middle East region more unstable.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak visited Ankara and Damascus last week in an effort to
defuse tension between the two neighbors, but no substantial
results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have long been at odds over the PKK issue, and
share of water resources.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Foreign Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA (TURKEY), October 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said here Sunday that Belgrade opposes
any form of military intervention by foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with his Turkish counterpart Ismail
Cem, Jovanovic told Xinhua that the Kosovo issue is a completely
internal affair of the Yugoslav Federation and should be solved
under the principles of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said the Balkan summit, which will open Monday
morning in southern Turkey's port city of Antalya, is of great
importance for peace and security in the region and Yugoslavia
hopes that the meeting will make a contribution to the settlement
of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds have died and thousands others been displaced since
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
February 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between the Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian armed
groups escalated over the past weeks and the U.S.-led Western
powers have vowed to launch an air strike against Yugoslav
military targets if Belgrade refuses to withdraw its forces from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, Jovanovic declined to directly comment on the possible
the military strike.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member and enjoying close ties with ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, has agreed to send troops to join a possible
NATO mission in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey also stressed that all political and
diplomatic means should be exhausted before a military action is
taken.
</P>
<P>
Prime ministers from the Balkan nations, namely Greece,
Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania, Macedonia and Turkey,
will attend the two-day summit.

<HEADLINE> No Progress in Afghan-UN, OIC Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The first day of talks
between the Afghan Taliban militia and the envoys of the United
Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on
easing the present Iran-Afghan tension ended here Sunday with no
progress made.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, OIC
representative Ibrahim Baker and Taliban representative Wakeel
Ahmed Mutawakil held two sessions during the day, but failed to
make any progress, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
AT the first session, Mutawakil, senior advisor to Taliban
leader Mohammad Omar, delivered a special message to Brahimi from
Omar inviting him to visit Afghanistan for detailed talks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's chief representative in Islamabad, Saeedur Rehman
Haqqani, told Xinhua that the two sides actually did not talk
about Iran-Afghan tension, but instead focused their discussions
on events that adversely affected their ties in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
He said they discussed matters relating to Taliban-U.N.
relations against the backdrop of "some unfortunate events" that
led to misunderstandings between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We apprised the U.N. team of the steps Taliban have taken to
address the problems faced by the U.N. in working in Afghanistan.
We also informed them about the progress of investigations into
the killing of one U.N. staff in Kabul a couple of months ago," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi and Ibrahim Baker, assistant General Secretary of the
OIC, arrived here on Thursday on the second leg of their mission
to reduce tension between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the Taliban were unable to finalize the venue for
their meeting until Friday, as Brahimi wanted the Taliban leaders
to come to Islamabad while the Taliban invited the U.N. envoy to
visit Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A special Pakistani plane brought Mutawakil to Islamabad
Saturday night. He met Pakistani officials soon after his arrival
and discussed with them matters relating to the U.N.-OIC mission.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan played a key role in persuading the Taliban leadership
to come to Islamabad to save the U.N.-OIC peace mission from
failure.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi and Baker opened talks Friday with Pakistani officials
and they discussed various options for peacefully resolving
disputes between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi's current visit to the region is in the context of
implementing the "Points of Common Understanding" that was reached
during the "Six Plus Two" Foreign Ministers' meeting in New York
on September 21.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers from Afghanistan's immediate neighbors
plus the U.S. and Russia evolved "Points of Common Understanding"
which include the cessation of hostilities in Afghanistan and a
number of confidence-building measures to promote the restoration
of durable peace in that country.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Release 10 Iranian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Sunday released 10 more Iranian prisoners on the occasion of the
visit by Muhammad Khader, special envoy of Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Khader, who Saturday visited Pakistan and met Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, visited the Taliban's headquarters of Kandahar and
met Taliban supreme leader Mohammad Omar, according to informed
sources.
</P>
<P>
He delivered a special message to Omar from Arafat and told him
that the current border tension between Iran and Afghanistan is
harmful not only for the peoples of the two countries but for the
whole Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He also said any conflict between the Taliban and Iran would
affect the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy hoped that Iran and Taliban leaders would
show restraint and settle their dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Omar for releasing 10 more Iranian prisoners and
said the step would help in reducing bitterness between Iran and
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his support for the Palestinian cause, Omar said
the Taliban have no objection to releasing more Iranian prisoners
but would seek guarantee for the release of Taliban prisoners
under the opposition's custody.
</P>
<P>
The freed Iranian prisoners are likely to arrive in Islamabad
Monday in a special plane along with the Palestinian envoy.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Rebels Agree to Leave Royal Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition party
supporters, holed up in King Letsie III' s palace in Maseru for
the past two months agreed Sunday to leave for their homes, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Malebo, spokesman for the opposition party alliance,
was quoted as saying that the 100 or more supporters had agreed
to leave the palace and "prepare for the re-elections" due to be
held within 15 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the supporters at the palace grounds was part
of a determined protest action by opposition parties against the
May 23 election result, which allegedly was in favor of the
ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his cabinet have
been pressurizing the king to remove the supporters from his
palace.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili accused the monarch, who is bound to be apolitical by
the Lesotho constitution, of taking sides and giving refuge to
opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
In speech intended for radio and television broadcasts on
Saturday evening, Letsie appealed to opposition supporters taking
shelter in his palace to disperse and go home peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Some political observers believed that the move to remove the
opposition party supporters from the palace could help thaw the
"icy relationship between the Lesotho king and his government.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.N.-Angola Difference Affects Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- As difference arises between
the U.N. and Luanda regarding the opposition National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), observers here expressed
worries that the Angolan peace process could deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
In early September, agonized by UNITA's failure in disarming
all its forces and handing over its key "territories" to the
government, Luanda cut off all contacts with UNITA led by its
chairman Jonas Savimbi and recognized the splinter UNITA
Renovation Committee as the only legal dialogist.
</P>
<P>
The government said it will work together with the Renovation
Committee to complete the tasks stipulated in the 1994 Lusaka
peace accord and solicit international support in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The government position has won support from the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and from central African
countries, but was not accepted by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On October 9, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
noted in a report to the Security Council that "These negative
developments pose serious threats to moving forward the peace
process" in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Angolan government and the UNITA to abide
earnestly by the Lusaka Protocol and make great efforts to avoid
the breaking out of another civil war.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan believed that the situation will be
complicated by dispelling one signatory of the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Although he put the total blame for the current crisis on
UNITA and its leaders, the U.N. chief still hopes that the peace
process be pushed forward with U.N. mediations.
</P>
<P>
Later, Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos asserted in a
letter to Annan that Savimbi will never give up war for peace as
indicated in the historical past. According to him, the only
possible way to settling the conflicts in Angola is for the
government to cooperate with the constructive Renovation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The president tried to persuaded Annan not to have any
illusion about giving Savimbi another opportunity, which he said
is against the clear and righteous stand of the Angolan
government.
</P>
<P>
The new U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, has assumed his
office for over a month, however, with no achievement.
</P>
<P>
He could not call the government, UNITA and the troika
observer countries (Portugal, Russia and the United States) to
sit down together for a joint committee meeting of the peace
process; his proposal for a meeting with Savimbi was also
rejected by the government on the grounds that no safety could be
guaranteed for him.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Annan has suggested to the Security Council that
the U.N. observer mission be given six more weeks after its term
expires on October 15.
</P>
<P>
If UNITA still cannot fulfill its obligations by then, and
dialogs cannot be held between the feuding parties, the U.N. will
gradually evacuate its personnel starting this December and pull
out all of them by the end of next January, Annan warned.

<HEADLINE> Albania Supports Turkey's Stand on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign
Minister Paskal Milo said here Sunday that Albania supports
Turkey's stand on the current tension in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his Turkish
counterpart Ismail Cem, Milo said that Turkey, as a NATO member,
made "a best decision" on the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Turkish parliament's approval of
Turkey's participation in a possible NATO air strike on Yugoslav
troops and police for their violence against separatist ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his Yugoslav
counterpart Momir Bulatovic concluded their talks and left without
talking to reporters. No details of the meeting were available.
</P>
<P>
Milo, who headed the Albanian delegation to attend the October
12-13 Balkan summit in this port city of Antalya, said that his
country was urged by Cem to do more in settling the Kosovo crisis
which has "constituted a direct threat to stability and security
of the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has decided to provide four F-16
fighters if NATO launches air raids on Yugoslav military targets
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko was not able to come to
the summit as a result of the continuing political turmoil in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting between the Yugoslav forces and ethnic
Albanian armed groups has made more than 280,000 refugees and many
crossed the border into Albania, according to Milo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Ends Visit to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen ended a short visit here Sunday afternoon after
having discussions with leaders of the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Cohen met and had talks with UAE President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan on bilateral cooperation and the
situation in the Gulf region and the whole Middle East, according
to the UAE News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here Sunday morning from Qatari capital of Doha
on the third leg of his Gulf tour. He has visited Bahrain and
Qatar and will also go to Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
This is his first Gulf tour since U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania was bombed on August 7 that killed more than 200 and
wounded some 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
The twin bombings are suspected of being related to Osama bin
Laden, a Saudi billionaire, No. 1 terrorist wanted by the U.S. for
a series of terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in security with the Gulf states for U.S. missions
in the region is considered one of his preorities of being here as
he said in Doha, Qatar that the U.S. has evidence to believe
that a number of terrorist actions have been planned and an
attempt will be made to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Doha, Cohen said to reporters that "we need
to work very cooperatively with all of our allies and all our
friends" to combat more terrorism actions.
</P>
<P>
In Bahraini capital of Manama, Cohen also said it has become
imperative for U.S. allies in the Gulf to acquire a ballistic
missile defense system to counter long range weapons owned by
countries such as Iraq and Iran.
</P>

BEIRUT, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Two civilians were wounded in
south Lebanon on Sunday in clashes between Lebanon's resistance
movement and Israeli occupying forces, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two civilians were slightly injured when guerrillas of the
Iran-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired mortars onto the
Israeli post at the village of Rihan in the eastern sector of the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualties raised to 53 the number of the Lebanese
civilians wounded in the south since the start of this year. Some
19 civilians were killed in the same period.
</P>
<P>
On the same site, two Hezbollah guerrillas were killed late
Saturday night by Israeli forces, the radio quoted the party
Sunday's statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war in Lebanon trying to
oust 1,000 Israeli forces and its proxy South Lebanon Army out of
the country.

Israel set up a self-declared security zone in parts of south
Lebanon in 1985 claiming to protect its north from cross-border

<HEADLINE> UK Chancellor Takes Global Financial Plan to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown is taking proposals of international
financial reform to his European counterparts as pressure grows to
solve the international economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to BBC ahead of his European Union meeting with fellow
finance ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, Brown called for
international "openness and disclosure" to help avert a financial
crash.
</P>
<P>
He attacked traders who "gambled" ordinary investors' money in
high-risk hedge funds, which place large bets on the movement of
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the three-point strategy to reform international
financial institutions would provide a structure which prevents
crises, rather than dealing with them as they occur.
</P>
<P>
According to BBC, the plan, already discussed with the U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, includes the follow aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- Introducing new international rules, such as transparency in
hedge funds;
</P>
<P>
-- Funding and reforming the International Monetary Fund;
</P>
<P>
-- Appointing a global financial regulator, who would oversee
economies worldwide, and report to governments through the IMF and
the G7 group of leading economic powers.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we have a rather ad-hoc and piecemeal way of
approaching problems," he said. "I want a more permanent facility
that prevents crises rather than dealing with them as they arise.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to wake up to the fact we are now into an
inter-dependent economy where the decisions that happen in one
country affect another," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Europe, as well as the rest of the world, to share
responsibility to create the conditions in which economic growth
and stability could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to ask the 15 EU countries to provide billions
of pounds worth of extra funding to strengthen the IMF, a BBC
report said.
</P>
<P>
"We have all got our part to play. Japan has got to sort out
its banking system," he said, adding that "America has got to
resist protectionism and has got to vote funds to the
International Monetary Fund."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Europe had to work at reducing unemployment
and creating conditions which would keep the economy buoyant, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he rejected suggestions that Britain was headed towards
recession, despite the fact that national growth would be only 1
percent, instead of the anticipated 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
He called the situation "a moderation of growth rather than an
absence of growth," saying that his "cautious and prudent"
strategies had ensured the U.K. was in a strong position to
withstand the fluctuations of the global economy.

TEHRAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Sunday welcomed an offer by British Foreign Secretary
Rabin Cook to sponsor dialog between the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran, the current chairman of the
organization grouping more than 50 Muslim countries around the
world, would make arrangements for the proposed dialog with the
15-member EU.
</P>
<P>
The dialog will better mutual understanding between the two
civilizations of Islam and the West, which would serve
co-existence among nations and promote ethics and morality, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi was
responding to Cook's call Friday for convening OIC-EU
negotiations on situation in the Balkans, the Middle East peace
process, events in Afghanistan and other related issues.
</P>
<P>
The principle of mutual respect and understanding of each
other's beliefs is a general norm in international relations,
Kharrazi said, Iran and Britain can develop relations on the basis
of internationally-recognized norms.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian King Fahd Bin
Abddullah Abdul-Aziz on Sunday congratulated Yemen on restoring
sovereignty over the Hanish archipelago.
</P>
<P>
This is the second friendly gesture from the Saudi royal family
in two days after the ruling of international arbitration on
Yemen's rights to sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
In a cable of congratulation to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh, Saudi King Fahd Bin Abddullah Abdul-Aziz said "I hope the
decision of the International Arbitration Committee (IAC) would
enhance relations between Yemen and Eritrea and serve their common
interest," the Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The London-based IAC ruled Friday in favor of Yemen in its
dispute with Eritrea over the Red Sea Islands of Hanish.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz sent a similar congratulation from Hawaii of
the United States where he was spending a private vacation.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to President Saleh, Abdullah also
reviewed bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and
the latest developments of Arab, regional and international
arenas.
</P>
<P>
The regional heavy-weight Saudi Arabia itself is also locked in
a territorial row with Yemen.
</P>
<P>
On July 19, a dispute over the Red Sea island of Duaima,
claimed by both Riyadh and Sanaa, led to an armed confrontation
between the two Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Since then, several rounds of high-level talks have been
held between Saudi Arabia and Yemen on ways to resolve the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed to do their utmost to prevent further
clashes on the island and other disputed areas.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urges More Investment in Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Oil Minister of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) has urged more investments in the energy
sector, especially in gas, to meet the growing demand of the world.
</P>
<P>
Obeid Bin Saif Al Nasir made the call when addressing the
opening session of 4th Middle East Gas Summit here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nasir said natural gas consumption across the world will jump
by 45 percent in 2010 and by 85 percent in 2020, compared with
1995, which necessitates more investment in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, which will deal with energy developments
in Asia, the Caspian region and the Middle East, and set prices of
liquefied gas, came as economic turmoil originating from Asia is
rippling through the world.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also study the influence of the current
economic and financial circumstances on the system of gas supply,
and on gas-related projects in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Major oil producers around the world showed up at the meeting,
including the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq,
Japan, Indonesia, India, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, China,
Bangladesh, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Nasir, also holding the current chairmanship of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), pointed out
that the economic ills will last for some time and will directly
affect the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices hit a nine-year low in March and intensive efforts
are badly needed to stablize and enhance the energy sector, Nasir
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged producers, consumers and all other sides concerned in
the energy industry to continue their discussion to come up with
ways that are based on mutual benefits in the long run.
</P>
<P>
He also called on OPEC and non-OPEC members to cooperate to
prop up the energy market to serve the interests of all parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted oil and gas productions in the Middle East
account for 30 percent and 7 percent of the world's totals
respectively, while its proven oil and gas reserves each made up
65 percent and 35 percent of the world's total deposits.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East, as a sustained major source of power supply,
should make more efforts to meet the growing demand, he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Encouraged to Develop Nigeria's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official has
said that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) would
encourage foreign investments and capital inflow into the
country's telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
NCC Chief Executive Ogbonnaya Iromantu told a forum of the
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) held Friday in Nigerian capital
Abuja that such investment was welcome in view of the large
amount of money required for the extension of telecommunications
infrastructure in the country, NAN reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria requires a minimum of three million
telephone lines for its immediate demand and a minimum of 200,000
cellular lines in order to meet the minimum international
standard of one telephone to 100 persons.
</P>
<P>
The country's telecommunications needs would require not less
than six billion U.S. Dollars which is more than what local
financiers could cope with, Iromantu said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a national communications policy has been
formulated and will be published in order to enable investors to
position themselves to place their investments.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, he said his commission had introduced 10
publications to guide the development of the country's
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The NCC executive stated that standards in cellular network,
wavelength services, rural communications, deregulation and
tariffs, tariffs, tariff structure and perception of the industry
are among the subjects of the publications.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is charged with monitoring and
supervising the telecommunications industry, has also published a
document to provide assistance and support for the on-going
privatization of the sector.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the NCC had held talks with operators of
Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) with a
view to exploiting possible ways of participating in the GMPCS
services.
</P>
<P>
The talks are part of the NCC's initiative to launch the
country into the emerging global information village, he said,
adding the GMPCS services would provide "the easiest and fastest
mode of communication".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official noted that Nigeria's withdrawal from the
regional African Satellite Communications Organization is being
revisited.
</P>
<P>
"I am aware there is a ministerial meeting that is revisiting
the issue" and the outcome of the meeting would enable the
country to develop an advanced documentation on the issue, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Eager to Join WTO: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Commerce Minister
Usama Faqih said Sunday that his country was eager to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the official Saudi Press Agency
(SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a speech inaugurating the meeting of the Saudi Industrial
and Commercial Chambers Council, Faqih said his country would hold
the fifth round of negotiations with the WTO on November 16 in
Geneva on matters related to its accession.
</P>
<P>
Faqih hoped the negotiations "would proceed more rapidly so
that membership requirements could be fulfilled as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry in charge of negotiations with the WTO
has presented two comprehensive documents, explaining trade
policies and foreign trade systems as well as service sectors in
Saudi Arabia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations began in 1996 and the coming round is
dedicated to highlight the main aspects of the Saudi economy and
the trade systems currently adopted, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the fourth round held last December was the
real beginning of negotiations at bilateral and multilateral
levels to specify principles and conditions to get into the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Faqih said his country had presented, during the past
negotiations, the primary offers of commodities and services, and
specified the needed flexibility and transitional periods to
implement the WTO agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi negotiation team made sure these offers meet the
comprehensive interest of various Saudi sectors and the demands
and interests of Saudi trade partners, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier media reports said that Saudi officials had in private
expected that the Gulf Arab country would become an effective
member of the WTO before the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that being a full member of the WTO could
enjoy a lot of special privileges, including better opportunities
for exporting products to member countries on a priority basis
without any discrimination or barriers.
</P>
<P>
Another special feature of the WTO is the presence of a body
for settling disputes among members, which would help protect
Saudi markets from strategies like market flooding, Saudi
officials said.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 5 Injured at Lesotho Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of unknown
youths, allegedly armed with fire arms and a bomb were beaten by
supporters of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) Sunday
afternoon when the ruling party was holding a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
Enraged LCD supporters cornered the youths, who had
infiltrated the rally at Lerepeng Sport Ground, six km east of
Maseru, the capital, after a shot was fired, wounding an LCD
supporter in a knee, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The LCD participants beat one youth to death and hurt four
others. The meeting ended in chaos, unidentified witnesses were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The shooting left LCD supporters scurrying for cover, with
some rushing to protect Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his
deputy Kelibone Maope.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili and Maope were whisked away from the rally shortly
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Police Commissioner Bolutu Makocaba said later that
one youth who had been attacked was found trying to plant a bomb
on the grounds. The LCD leadership blamed the opposition parties
for sending the youths to assassinate Mosisili and Maope.
</P>
<P>
The rally, to brief supporters on Southern African Development
Community (SADC)-initiated talks aimed at resolving the political
crisis in the country, was the first to be held by the LCD since
the SADC's military intervention on September 22.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 LCD supporters turned out at the rally.
</P>
<P>
At another Sunday rally in Maseru's Freedom Square, opposition
parties vowed to intensify the fight to install a government of
national unity.
</P>
<P>
The rally organizers accused SADC countries, especially South
Africa, of conspiring with Mosisili's government to deny the
opposition the right to a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The third round of multi-party talks between the ruling LCD
and opositon parties is due to be held on Wednesday, which,
hopefully, will pave way for peaceful settlement of the political
impasse in the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Highlights Iran, Iraq as Regional Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen Sunday warned that the spread of missile technology
threatens regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before leaving Al-Batin military airport
in Abu Dhabi, Cohen said "the Iranian Shihab-3 (Meteor) missile
that has recently been tested poses, for example, a threat to
countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
The efforts of Iraq and Iran to develop weapons of mass
destruction also pose threat to the security and stability of the
Gulf region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States made intensive and costly research to develop
defensive anti-missile systems, he said, urging the Gulf countries
to take part in the research to acquire up-to-date defense
technology.
</P>
<P>
Cohen ruled out the possibility of improving the U.S.-Iranian
relations as far as Iran continues developing weapons of mass
destruction and opposing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the holding of secret talks between the
United States and Iran to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed appreciation of the moderate policy of
the incumbent Iranian President Mohammad Khatami in dealing with
the country's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi is thee third leg of Cohen's Gulf tour, which has
taken him to Bahrain and Qatar, and will take him to Oman, Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia. These are all members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), an Arab political and economic group in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. regards Iraq and Iran as major threats to the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
In Bahraini capital of Manama, Cohen said it has become
imperative for U.S. allies in the Gulf to acquire a ballistic
missile defense system to counter long range weapons owned by
countries such as Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the deep friendship between the U.S. and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE). He said the two countries would go on
with their efforts to ensure security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He described his Sunday meeting with UAE President Sheikh Zayed
Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan as "highly significant."
</P>
<P>
He denied that his mission in the region is aimed at striking
military deals. The mission is aimed at strengthening the friendly
bonds and consultation between the United States and the GCC
members.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's possible air strikes against Serbian targets in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Cohen said a decision on this matter
necessitates a unanimous agreement by the 16 NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicted that the decision would be made within
two days to allow NATO forces to launch air strikes while
providing an opportunity to diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
Up to 420 fighters are getting ready for the attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the current Turkish-Syrian tension and their potential
conflict, Cohen said the U.S. supports the mediation efforts made
by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and hopes the efforts would
succeed in reaching a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Asked about that appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israel's
foreign minister and its impact on the peace process, Cohen said
"hardline characters are sometimes needed for reaching
agreements."

ABU DHABI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Sultan of Oman Qaboos Bin
Said on Sunday met with visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen on the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed the U.N.-imposed
sanctions on Iraq and highlighted the necessity of dealing with
Iraq according to the relevant U.N. resolutions, the Omani News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on the Middle East peace process. The
Omani leader underlined the importance of implementing the
relevant signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Oman earlier in the day from Abu Dhabi on the
fourth leg of his Gulf tour. He has visited Bahrain, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates and will travel on to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The tour is aimed at probing the possibility of creating a
defensive missile network in the Gulf region to protect U.S.
troops there.
</P>
<P>
In Bahraini capital of Manama, Cohen said it has become
imperative for U.S. allies in the Gulf to acquire a ballistic
missile defense system to counter long range weapons owned by
countries such as Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Security cooperation with the Gulf states is considered one of
his priorities of visiting the six members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Abu Dhabi, Cohen warned against the efforts of
Iraq and Iran to develop weapons of mass destruction that could
pose threat to regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. regards Iraq and Iran, which tested a long-range
missile recently, as major threats to the Gulf region.

GUILIN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000 fry will be released
into Lijiang River which flows through the popular scenic city of
Guilin in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>

The fry will be released between October 14-18 as part of an
effort to restore the ecological balance in the Lijiang River.

<HEADLINE> GA Committee Opens General Debate on Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The First Committee of
the 53rd General Assembly (GA) Monday began its general debate on
a wide range of disarmament initiatives, including nuclear
non-proliferation, curtailing the traffic in small arms and
eliminating chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Also top on the agenda will be to define the U.N. role in the
disarmament process, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The First Committee, in charge of disarmament and international
security affairs, kicked off its debate at a time when the
attention of the world is focused on disarmament issues with
particular intensity due to the underground nuclear tests
successively conducted by India and Pakistan in May this year.
</P>
<P>
As U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier, those tests
tipped "the balance on which the nuclear non-proliferation regime
rested" and dealt a serious setback to decades of international
efforts aimed at disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Annan delivered a speech at the Monday meeting, the first of
its kind since the opening of a new GA session on September 9,
which was presided over by the newly-elected committee chairman,
Andre Mernier of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief touched on the relations between disarmament and
development, saying that "disarmament and development are
intimately connected."
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament lies at the heart of this organization's efforts
to maintain and strengthen international peace and security,"
Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Mexico, Austria (on behalf of the European
Union), Fiji, South Africa, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Colombia and
Myanmar are scheduled to take the floor at the debate, U.N.
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Caretaker Cabinet Approves NATO's Use of Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy's caretaker government
Monday approved NATO's use of air bases in Italy for possible air
strikes against Serb targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But the government also announced that only parliament can vote
to commit Italy to providing men and aircraft, or even logistical
support, for any military intervention by NATO.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the Senate ruled Sunday that, although
it is only supposed to take care of day-to-day business, the
caretaker government can still implement international accords on
NATO's use of military bases in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Bases in eastern Italy have played a major role in NATO actions
in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Brussels, NATO's 16 members began talks expected
to end Monday evening by transferring authority for intervention
in Kosovo to supreme commander of allied forces in Europe,
U.S. General Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
The decision has to be unanimous; Germany, Portugal and Italy
are expected to grant the necessary OK the same day for the
so-called "activation order".
</P>
<P>
The International Herald Tribune Monday reported that an
agreement had been hatched on a legal basis for air strikes in
Kosovo and Serbia itself.
</P>
<P>
Until late last week, when the government lost a confidence
vote and Prime Minister Romano Prodi resigned, Italy was insisting
on a new mandate from the United Nations Security Council for any
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The NATO permanent council in Brussels is now reviewing the
state of talks in Belgrade aimed at averting military action.

<HEADLINE> Computer Institute Plans Staff Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of Computing
Technology, an affiliate of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),
plans to reduce its staff by 86 percent and retain a team of 100
professionals, mainly younger researchers, to conduct advanced
studies.
</P>
<P>
"The restructured institute will maintain close ties with the
Legend Group, the largest collective computer company in China,"
according to CAS Vice President Yan Yixun.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yan disclosed, the institute will assist Legend in
forming a technology innovation center, and the latter will either
provide positions for staffers subject to downsizing or otherwise
provide support for related individuals to establish new ventures.
</P>
<P>
The new institute, which is expected to enter operations in
January, next year, will administered by a board of directors
consisting of CAS officials, the Legend president and outside
experts, said Yan, adding that staffer will be employed on both
short- and long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
The institute, which was first established in 1956 and is the
most authoritative computer technology research organization in
China, has contributed greatly to the development of the nation's
hydrogen bomb, ballistic missile system, nuclear energy and
satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
The CAS holds 65 percent of share of the Legend Group, which
has been evolved from the institute's high-tech development
company into a collective group company with total assets of 1.6
billion yuan (192 million US dollars). Legend's 1997 sales volume
hit 12.5 billion yuan (1.5 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"CAS plans to invest a substantial portion of Legend's profits
in the new institute," said Yan. "Some 50 percent of the funds
will be earmarked for applied computer technology research, with
some 30 percent going for frontier scientific studies and other 20
percent for basic studies."
</P>
<P>
Yan said institute researchers will receive average funding of
200,000 yuan (24,000 US dollars) and noted that the downsized
restructured staff will greatly improve the efficiency of research
and development.
</P>
<P>
"The institute and Legend will enjoy a mutually beneficial
partnership," said Legend President Liu Chuanzhi. "A central
research institute is essential for embarking on frontier studies
and the institute needs high-tech company with marketing
expertise."
</P>
<P>
The restructuring program for the Institute of Computing
Technology represents a new CAS approach to reforming the
scientific system, said Yan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 12 (Xinhua)-- Quarrels over port tariffs
and security arrangements escalated at the coastal areas in
ferries started docking into the sea ports controlled by Somali
faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Southern port town of Kismaio, 500 Km south
of Mogadishu, said Monday that a serious dispute has erupted between
Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan and the business community in the town
over taxes imposed on the commercial goods. Morgan's
administration has increased the levy on the imported goods for
more than 20 percent in an attempt to compensate what is called
the various needs of the region,
</P>
<P>
According to the officials of General Morgan, the taxes are
increased so as to improve the security situation of the region
which has been deteriorating since last month. However, the
businessmen have rejected to pay such high taxes after expressing
their concern that the high levy will make the poor people of the
town incapable of buying their commodities.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the levies by Morgan's Majerten Clan has
obviously been prompted by the deployment of hundreds of heavily
armed militiamen and dozens of battle wagons in Middle Jubba
Region by their rival Marehan clan militiamen who had been
defeated and ousted from Kismaic and its surrounding areas in a
series of battles early in the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is suffering Tracheobronchitis, but will not be hospitalized, the
Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has tracheobronchitis, with a body temperature of 37.2
to 37.4 degree Celsius and cough, when he was on a one-day state
visit to Alma-Ata, Interfax said. And his visit had to be cut
short from two days because of the illness.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Yeltsin is treated with
anti-inflammatory medicines and antibiotics, but doctors haven't
told him to stay in bed. Instead, they recommended he reduce his
work load.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin, who is
accompanying Yeltsin on the Central Asia tour, told reporters that
hospitalizing Yeltsin was not under discussion, and that Yeltsin's
doctors have not resorted to anything extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin caught a cold since the weekend, after a
hard week of dealing with urgent social and economic problems and
serious international issues.
</P>
<P>
However, Yakushkin refrained from elaborating on Yeltsin's
symptoms, saying that he was not a doctor.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's plane is scheduled to leave Alma-Ata at 19:00 Moscow
time (15:00 GMT), and return to Moscow at about 23:00 (19:00 GMT),
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks in 1996 in the wake of the
June 16 presidential election. He also had quintuple heart bypass
surgery in November that year.

ADDIS ABABA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) has decided to focus on returnee, refugee and
internally displaced women and children for peace and development
drive on the continent, a senior OAU official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
OAU Assistant Secretary General Ahmed Haggag said that as
economic integration can be achieved only in an environment of
peace, peace can be sustainable when reconstruction,
rehabilitation and reintegration are successfully completed in
former areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Haggag made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the regional
seminar on enhancing the participation of returnee, refugee and
internally displaced women and children in reconstruction,
rehabilitation and peace building.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "In Africa, over 20 million people are
currently living within the borders of their own countries,
internally displaced from their surroundings, deprived of their
livelihoods, dignity and hope."
</P>
<P>
"Women and children form the majority of refugee and displaced
population of any country during and after conflict," He added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the four-day seminar to come up with a plan of action,
which "will constitute proposals for concrete and implementable
programs and activities for facilitating the reintegration of
vulnerable and marginalized groups in the development process and
resettlement in countries emerging from conflicts."

<HEADLINE> German Parliament to Convene Special Session on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament will convene
a special session Friday to give a vote on whether Germany would
participate in a possible NATO military intervention in the
troubled Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellory Minister Friedrich Bohl made the
announcement Monday after three-hour talks between Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and his newly-elected Social Democratic successor
Gerhard Schroeder as well as Joschka Fischer, the Greens leader
who is tipped as foreign minister in the coming Schroeder
government.
</P>
<P>
Bohl also announced after the consultations that Kohl's
government would authorize the incumbent foreign minister Klaus
Kinkel and defense minister Volker Ruehe to vote for a possible
NATO intervention in Kosovo, including the participation of German
military aircraft, at relevant NATO meetings.
</P>
<P>
The administration of Kohl, who was defeated by Schroeder and
his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Germany's general election on
September 27, has offered 14 German Tornado combat jets for a
possible NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
The offer had been put into question recently because a
necessary parliament approval is difficult to arrange during the
post-election transition of government.
</P>
<P>
A special session of the old parliament will now fill the
vacuum, but controversies could still arise given the different
views of German parties on the legality of a NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
SPD officials noted recently that in order to prevent a
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo they would favor a NATO
intervention even without a formal approval from the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the pacifist Greens, which is the most likely junior
partner in the coming German government, has so far insisted that
a U.N. resolution approving the use of force should be the
precondition for any German participation in a NATO military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
A NATO council meeting scheduled for late Monday in Brussels
will discuss plans for a possible air strike against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Erekat: Palestinians Ready for Washington Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side is well
prepared for the upcoming Washington summit which will focus on
breaking the stalemate of the Mideast peace process, said a senior
Palestinian official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator, said the Palestinian
side has completed its preparations and reports on various issues
to be discussed during the Washington summit among U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
All these reports have been approved by Arafat, Erekat told the
Voice of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit will discuss the scope of Israel's troop
redeployment in the West Bank and the Palestinian side has also
prepared maps for that, he said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also expressed hope that the Israeli side would adopt a
positive attitude towards the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip here
early this month, Arafat and Netanyahu agreed to attend the
Washington summit with Clinton due Thursday. The three-day
meetings will take place at three locations in the Washington DC
area.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the summit, Arafat called a meeting of the
Palestinian leadership in the West Bank city of Ramallah Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Arafat flew to Amman and briefed Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan on the Palestinian positions on various issues to be
taken up at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to leave for Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu is to call his inner cabinet ministers
for a meeting Monday evening to prepare Israel's position for the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Italian Doping Chief Quits Amid Drug Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua)-- Italy's anti-doping chief Ugo
Longo tendered his resignation here to the Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) for "work reasons" on Monday amid a haunting
doping scandal in Italy soccer.
</P>
<P>
Longo was the head of the anti-doping prosecution service
under CONI, the ruling body for national sport, whose own
president, Mario Pescante, quit exactly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Longo's service had failed to show any tangible results in two
years' work, while Longo had concluded a doping inquiry in August
saying that the phenomenon simply did not exist in Italian soccer.
</P>
<P>
The past six weeks, however, have seen a string of damaging
revelations about claims of widespread drug test failures and
cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
Italy's dope test laboratory has been closed down and all its
officials were sacked.
</P>
<P>
Longo's service, one of three parts to the bureaucracy of
doping officialdom in Italy, is responsible for investigating
allegations of doping by an athlete and making a recommendation
to a separate commission of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The commission considers them before making its own
recommendations to the athlete's sporting federation, such as
cycling or football, who then take any sanctions they consider
necessary.
</P>
<P>
But Longo's recommendations have been systematically ignored
by both the doping commission and the major sports federations,
rendering his team's efforts largely pointless.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn Yellow River Faces Peril </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists warn any
failure to adopt rational water conservancy measures will subject
the Yellow River to the possibility of major flood disasters,
interrupted water flow and course changes.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Valley, home to China's second longest river
following the Yangtze, has long been regarded as the "Cradle of
Chinese Civilization."
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
indicates frequent interrupted water flow in the lower reaches of
the river, with some 90 percent of silt accumulating in the main
river channel. Silting which has raised the riverbed above the
surrounding natural ground level has created a critical in what
scientists refer to as the "elevated river".
</P>
<P>
CAS Academician Liu Changming noted that prevailing conditions
seriously threaten the river's normal water volume and will
eventually create extremely grave situation.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the Yellow River experiences a course
change once each century, with current conditions in the lower
reaches similar to those which led to the last course change in
1855," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He warned that major flooding will adversely affect some 78
million people living in a 120,000 sq.km. area.
</P>
<P>
Liu and an expert team organized by the CAS and the Chinese
Academy of Engineering visited four provinces in the lower and
middle reaches of the Yellow River in July to document existing
problems.
</P>
<P>
Interrupted water flow in the lower reaches of the river
increased in both frequency and severity since the the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The CAS report indicated that Lijin Hydrometric Station in east
China's Shandong Province at the Bohai Sea estuary, reported dry
conditions for 330 days during 1997. Water ceased flowing in
sections of the river stretching a total of 704 kilometers, with
90 percent of the sections located in the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
Major tributaries in the middle reaches of the Yellow River
have also been subject to frequent interrupted water flows, and
scientists noted the distinct possibility that the Yellow River
will become nothing more than a "seasonal river."
</P>
<P>
Prolonged droughts increase salinization in the river delta
soil and create an imbalanced ecosystem which threatens over 8,000
species of marine animals, more than 100 varieties of wild of
plants and 180 species birds, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Report outlining problems and offering
suggestions has been submitted to the State Council, China's
highest governing body.

<HEADLINE> ISF Chief: Friendship Comes First at World Gymnasiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The '98 International
Schoolsports Federational (ISF) World Gymnasiade, a sports meet
for the highschool students, will make further contribution to
the growth of high school sports in the world, ISF president Jean
Louis Boujon said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Boujon said at a news conference that the ISF World
Gymnasiade, born in Europe, cannot develop fully without the
participation of all member countries.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, Shanghai's application to host the students
games this year was approved by ISF, making it the first one to
be held outside Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The '98 World Gymnasiade will open here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Before we came to China, we were worried about the
communication with the Chinese side. However, I can see clearly
that the local people are trying hard for the success of the
Gymnasiade," Boujon said.
</P>
<P>
"All the athletes are happy to come to China and it's a good
chance for young people from around the world to gather and
communicate with each other. At the same time, the event will
make the city better known," Boujon said.
</P>
<P>
The president added that sports is an important and useful
part of education.
</P>
<P>
"The ISF hope sports will be an efficient channel through
which young people of the world can learn from each other and
promote their friendly affection. The purpose of the ISF is to
educate by sports and enhance friendship through sports," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, the spirit of the Gymnasiade is more than
competition. All the young athletes pay more attention to the
friendship among them, established through sports.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a fair competition without doping and violence."
</P>
<P>
Boujon also explained the reason that the gymnasiade features
only four events -- track and field, swimming, gymnastics and
rhythmic gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
"The game is designed to fit in with the sport education for
high school students. These four sports are also popular in the
world, making it possible to gather student athletes from various
parts of the world, " he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Secretary
General's Special Envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi decided
here Monday to visit the Afghan Taliban's headquarters in Kandahar
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Brahimi has accepted Taliban leader Mohammad Omar's invitation
and assured us that he will proceed to Kandahar on October 14 for
talks," the chief representative of the Taliban in Islamabad,
Saeedur Rahman Haqqani, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Along with Ibrahim Baker, assistant secretary general of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, Brahimi held the third
round of talks with Wakeel Ahmad Mutawakil, a senior advisor to
Omar, Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour long talks, the two sides further dilated
on their respective positions on all aspects of their discussion,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held two sessions of talks here Sunday but
achieved no results.
</P>
<P>
Omar had invited Brahimi for talks to the Taliban militia
stronghold of Kandahar while Brahimi had insisted that the Taliban
send representatives to Islamabad.
</P>

Mutawakil flew into Islamabad on Saturday night carrying a
letter for Brahimi from Omar who in his letter reiterated his
invitation to the U.N. envoy to hold talks in Afghanistan instead
of in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy is on a visit to the region following the Six

<HEADLINE> Cold, Kosovo Crisis Prompt Yeltsin to Shorten State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
decided to cut short his Kazakhstan visit because of his cold and
Moscow's "great responsibility for the solution of the Kosovo
problem," his press secretary said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters that the decision to shorten
the visit was made during Yeltsin's flight to Alma-Ata from
Tashkent, where he just finished a two-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has been suffering from a cold since Sunday. According
to Yakushkin, he made the decision upon the doctor's insistence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin has been closely following the situation in
Kosovo and talked to Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov during the
flight from Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said that Yeltsin's stay in Kazakhstan was cut short
"only in formal terms," as the working part of the schedule will
be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his Kazahk counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev will
sign two documents and their ministers will sign six.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass news agency, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of
the Communist faction in the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament said that Yeltsin was very ill and was "even unable to
review a guard of honor" during his visit to Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov made the remarks at a press conference in Moscow
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cuts Military Service Terms by 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Monday to cut
the terms of military service by three months as of October 23.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the headquarters of the Armed Forces said
the term of service will be reduced to 21 months from the current
24 months.
</P>
<P>
The period will be further reduced to 18 months for those
serving in operational regions or deprived areas, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The decision will take effect as of October 23 and remain in
place for the next four years, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said those who have finished 20 months of their
service in operational regions or deprived areas, and those with
23 months service in other areas will be discharged on October 23.
</P>
<P>
Iran's military is under direct control of supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the commander-in-chief. The Armed
Forces comprise the Army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC) and the security forces, or armed police. Both the Army and
the IRGC have their own ground, air and naval forces.
</P>
<P>
The country also has a large number of Basijis, or volunteers,
who are usually under the command of the IRGC.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known why Iran take this move. In the
ongoing standoff with Afghan Taliban militia, Iran has massed more
than 250,000 troops along the border and carried out military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban killed 12 Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
August when its militants run over the northern opposition
stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Tehran demands the extradition and trial of the killers, return
of the remaining bodies of slain Iranians and an apology from the
Taliban, as pre-conditions for a peaceful solution of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Italian Cabinet Meets On NATO's Use of Its Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy's outgoing cabinet met
Monday morning to decide on the use of Italian air bases in any
NATO missions against Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Senate decided Sunday that, although it is only supposed to
take care of day-to-day business, the government that lost a
confidence vote on Friday can still implement international
accords on NATO's use of military bases in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Bases in eastern Italy have played a major role in NATO actions
in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But the Senate ruled that parliamentary approval is required in
order to commit Italy to providing men and aircraft or even
logistic support for possible NATO strikes against Serb targets in
Yugoslavia's rebel province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
United States Envoy Richard Holbrooke is still trying to get
Serbia and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a
NATO-Russian multinational peace force in Kosovo that would lift
the threat of military action.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels Monday, the 16 NATO member countries are expected
to transfer authority for intervention in Kosovo to supreme
commander of allied forces in Europe, U.S. General Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
The decision has to be unanimous; only Germany, Portugal and
Italy has yet to give the thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
France was reported Monday morning to be prepared to supply 40
or so planes for air actions against the Serb forces involved in
military conflicts in the independence-minded ethnic Albanian
province.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo leaders Sunday night voiced skepticism on the
possibility of Holbrooke's talks producing anything constructive,
claiming that Milosevic "only understands force".

<HEADLINE> Zambian Copper Mines Survival Plan to Fail: Citibank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A survival plan to improve the
performance of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) is
international credit markets, Citibank has predicted.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Monday quoted the lastest Treasury Letter
released by Citibank at the weekend as saying that Zambia's
conglomerate is likely to encounter difficulties in raising
credit due to its low credit standing internationally, and the
ZCCM Survival Plan announced last month could not be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The plan, unveiled by a task team comprising representatives
from the Zambian government, Bank of Zambia, Zambia Copper
Investment and ZCCM, aims at placing the country's largest
traditional foreign exchange earner on an improved financial
footing and accelerating the privatization of the company's
remaining assets.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the factors that are likely to weigh heavily
against ZCCM's ability to raise incremental credit include
adverse effects of the ongoing privatization process,
deterioration in operating performance and poor international
demand conditions.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that the donors would continue withholding their
pledged balance of payment support for Zambia if the survival
plan flops, said the bank in the letter.
</P>
<P>
With the failure of the plan, the bank predicts that problems
of poor employee morale, inadequate raw material supplies and
unsufficient working capital which have a direct and adverse
impact on the conglomerate's output will persist.
</P>
<P>
The negative impact on productivity, said the letter, will
accelerate with the longer it takes to privatize ZCCM's two
largest mines, Nkana and Nchanga, which account for 65 percent of
the company's total production.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM's copper production figure for September at 29,601 tons
was two percent below those in August.

LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- England soccer wonderboy
Michael Owen expressed his support to English manager Glenn
Hoddle on Monday after the disappointing 0-0 draw with Bulgaria
in Saturday's European championship qualifier.
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the crowd was not happy and were booing.
It's obvious what some people think but I don't feel that
personally. He's the right man for the job." Owen told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
"I think the players were partly to blame for the performance.
The manager's put a team on the pitch and you don't see many
people before a game complaining about the team selection."
</P>
<P>
"I can't see why virtually every bit of the blame is heaped on
the manager when it's the players who have stepped out on the
pitch," the teenager said.
</P>
<P>
Defender Gareth Southgate also came to Hoddle's defence,
saying that England's poor form in their last two games was
largely a matter of confidence.
</P>
<P>
"So much of it is to do with confidence. If you're getting the
results, players are free to express themselves. I don't think it
is down to the coach, to be fair."
</P>

England play Luxembourg on Wednesday after taking just one
point from their first two games in group five.

<HEADLINE> Natural Disasters Reduce Chinese GNP Heavily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Economic losses caused by
natural disasters have reduced China's gross national product (GNP)
by some 3-6 percent annually, with the percentage continuing to
rise along with the accumulation of national wealth.
</P>
<P>
Fan Baojun, vice minister of Civil Affairs, said today that
property losses resulting from natural disasters during the
1991-1995 period amounted to 656.2 billion yuan (82.6 billion US
dollars), with average annual losses standing at 131.2 billion
yuan. The 1995 figure alone hit 288.2 billion yuan, with the level
for 1997 standing at 197.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fan attended today's Beijing forum to mark the International
Decade For Natural Disaster Reduction and said that China is one of
the few countries in the world which suffer from annual natural
calamities which kill thousands of people, damage crops on
millions of hectares and affect over 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
This year's devastating summer flooding and various other
natural disaster killed more than 4,000 people, according to
Fan, who also serves as vice director of China Committee for the
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has allocated over 1,000 billion yuan
over the past 50 years for disaster reduction
programs.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the overall achievements have been far from
satisfactory when compared to developed countries, said Wang
Angsheng, a professor working for the Disaster Reduction Center
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wang called for the establishment of a national natural

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne Urged to Admit Alcohol Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua)-- Former England boss Graham
Taylor has urged Paul Gascoigne to admit he has a drinking
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Watford manager has also revealed he had tried to help the
wayward star when he played for Lazio and during England's failed
qualifying for the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"What Paul Gascoigne must do for his future life is stand up
and admit he has a drink problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic for alcohol
and stress problems over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for his premier league side Middlesbrough said he
would not play for the club again until he is given the all-clear
from doctors at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough paid Glasgow Rangers 3.5 million pounds (5.93
million U.S. dollars) for Gascoigne in March. He was dropped from
the England squad for the World Cup finals by coach Glenn Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
The latest chapter in Gascoigne's chequered career comes just
days after he was seen sporting a black eye following reports of
a three-day drinking session in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
And on Friday Gascoigne was found sobbing at a railway station
near his ex-wife's house.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Rally Violence Stage-Managed: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Political violence at a
ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) rally Sunday was
stage-managed to convince regional powers of the need to prolong
their military intervention in Lesotho, opposition parties
claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a ploy by the LCD to divert these governments'
attention to the current political problems," South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted opposition alliance spokeswoman Mamello
Morrison as saying.
</P>
<P>
One person was beaten to death and two others died of severe
head injuries in hospital after the LCD meeting erupted into
chaos Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The LCD public meeting ended in chaos when LCD supporters
attacked a group of youths allegedly armed with firearms and a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
Enraged LCD supporters cornered the youths, who had
infiltrated the rally at Lerepeng, six kilometers east of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho police commissioner Bolutu Makoaba said one of the
youths was allegedly found trying to plant a bomb at the grounds.
</P>
<P>
The LCD leadership immediately blamed opposition parties for
the incident, saying the youths were sent to assassinate Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his deputy, Kelebone Maope.
</P>
<P>
Morrison said Monday that the alliance knew nothing about an
assassination plot.
</P>
<P>
If the youths were from the opposition, she said, they could
have gone to the rally of their own accord.
</P>
<P>
"We never authorized any assassinations. If it is true that
these boys are our members then the leadership of the alliance
would like to disassociate itself with their action," Morrison
said.
</P>
<P>
Maope Monday still insisted the youths were sent by the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
"These people need to be a little bit more serious because we
were nearly killed there yesterday (Sunday)."
</P>
<P>
South Africa continued its behind-the-scenes mediation
Monday.
</P>
<P>
South African safety and security minister, Sydney Mufamadi,
was meeting delegations of the rival parties at an undisclosed
venue in South Africa in preparation for the round three of
multi-party talks in Maseru Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government and opposition parties agreed to hold
fresh general elections in 15 to 18 months, but failed to agree
on who should run the country during this period.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial growth rate
for September hit 10.2 percent, up 2.3 percentage points on the
August level, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicted that the figure will rise even more in the
fourth quarter of the year in line with new government policies to
increase investment and expand domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the incremental industrial output ended
September at 172.9 billion yuan. The industrial sector's
January-September value-added output stood at 1,439.2 billion
yuan, up eight percent on the same period last year and 0.2
percentage points higher than the this year's January-August
period.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed industrial growth to government policies
designed to increase investments in infrastructure construction and
reconstruction in the wake of devastating summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
Various other favorable factors for the industrial sector
include the rapid growth of large enterprises and the booming
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
The bureau reported that industrial sectors in most Chinese
municipalities, provinces and autonomous regions witnessed rapid
growth during September, with both state and non-state sectors
enjoying improved operations. State firms registered a September
growth rate of 5.8 percent, up 2.7 percentage points on August.
</P>
<P>
The sales/production ratio for the month grew by 0.9 percentage
points to 97.84 percent on an annual basis, according to the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Vows to Enhance Trade Despite Downturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday vowed to
continue with its policy of enhancing its level of external trade
although the country is facing an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Malaysia would
continue to look for opportunities and investments with its
foreign partners as this could reduce the pressure from financial
and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Through this policy, Malaysia recorded a trade surplus of 6.3
billion ringgit (about 1.657 billion U.S. dollars) in August and
the local industrial sector also managed to continue their
operations, he said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said, "Although the economic situation is not as good
as before, Malaysia is prepared to receive investments and enhance
economic relations with its foreign trading partners."
</P>
<P>
He said the government had implemented several measures
including selective exchange controls and providing opportunities
to foreign investors to evaluate and plan their investments in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said local investors were also aided by the fixed peg of the
ringgit at 3.80 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is confident that foreign
investors' interest in Malaysia would resume soon following the
implementation of several economic policies.

<HEADLINE> News Corp Rise Pushes Australian Stocks Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares shrugged off
firmer Japanese and Hong Kong markets Monday to close only
marginally higher, boosted by a 6-percent jump in News Corp
shares.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished 10.3 points firmer at
2,501.6, with News Corp's rise the standout.
</P>
<P>
The global media group's shares had gone into a tailspin over
the past two weeks, with a decision to pull back on the extent of
its Fox float seen as one of the leading factors behind the
selling.
</P>
<P>
The fortnight's fall saw the ordinary shares go from 11.20
Australian dollars to 8.64 before bouncing back 54.7 cents to 9.19
- in line with its trade in New York on Friday - as buyers took
advantage of the nine-month low. News Corp preferred shares added
46 cents at 8.11 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rise in News Corp shares was linked to the better
performance of the U.S. stock market on Friday. The Dow Jones
industrial average on Friday rose 167.61 to 7,899.52, a gain of
114.83 points for the week.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the market, non-institutional interest remained
tepid as global economic uncertainty lingered and the historical
fear of October financial markets contributed to the ill-will.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the Nikkei index jumped 5 percent on the back of new
proposals to prop up the nation's banking system.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the key Hang Seng index closed up 483.48 points
at 8,990.27, with late profit-taking eroding earlier even more
substantial gains.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the all industrials index was up 22.2 points to
4,345.0.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank, seen as a potential acquirer of
competitors, fell 38.3 cents. The other major banks were higher,
ANZ up five cents, Westpac was 11 cents better while Commonwealth
finished 16 cents firmer.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications major Telstra dropped 12.4 cents as
uncertainty remained over how much of the company would be
privatized, while final payment of installment receipts was due in
a little over a month.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index was unchanged at 1,024.6 points.
</P>
<P>
BHP was up 14 cents. It is expected that the company could be
close to announcing a new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The gold index fell 38.4 points to 1,212.6 as the bullion price
lost 1.80 U.S. dollars per ounce to 297.30.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 275.24 million shares at a value of 946.80 million
Australian dollars (587.02 million U.S. dollars), with 544 falls,
494 rises and 388 steady.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger as Buying Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar soared
one U.S. cent Monday, propelled by aggressive buying from overseas
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
According to portfolio manager at Perpetual Funds Management,
Glen Howard, the funds were most likely still buying to cover
short positions, or feeling very bullish towards the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
It ended the day at 62.58 U.S. cents from Friday's close of
61.58, after trading between 61.32 and 62.85 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Steve Chater, manager of foreign exchange at IBJ Australia,
said the Australian dollar's strength was not altogether a
straightforward currency play but a U.S. buyer had made a
significant impact on the day.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very large chunk," he said and fueled the rally in a
short market.
</P>
<P>
He said the Australian dollar was also helped by further
weakness in the U.S. dollar as the Japanese market came on board.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was buying 72.63 Japanese yen from 71.47 and
1.0274 German marks from 1.0038.

MACAO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The amount of freight transport

1.64 million passengers during the first nine months of the year,
an increase of 11 percent over that of last year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Housing Bank to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Government Housing
Bank will soon be privatized as part of a move to streamline the
banking sector, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first government-owned bank to be privatized
since Thailand took strides in reforming its ailing financial
sector following the financial crisis that erupted in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will consider a bill to privatize the bank when it
convenes later this week, the report quoted a Finance Ministry
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Once privatized, the bank's capital will be converted into
shares valued at 10 baht each (about 0.26 U.S. dollar at current
exchange rate).
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will be the major shareholder of the bank
in the initial stage, until the cabinet approves share transfers
to private partners.
</P>
<P>
Under the privatization bill, the bank will also be allowed to
expand its activities from loans on houses to those on furniture
and other kinds of household decorations.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will guarantee such loans, the amount of
which will not exceed 12 times as much as paid-up shares of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has closed 52 financial institutions and
taken over nearly 10 commercial banks in a sweeping reform aimed
at spurring an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The move to privatize the Government Housing Bank is seen as a
step-up of the privatization process in the country.

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of activists from
Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party (JKDFP) held a
demonstration Monday outside the United Nations office here
demanding inclusion of Kashmiris in the scheduled talks between
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
JKDFP chief spokesman Riaz Khewar said that the party was ready
to act as a bridge between the two neighboring countries to narrow
down their differences over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The vexed Kashmir issue would solved by the people of Jammu and
Kashmir themselves and nobody could speak on their behalf, Khewar
said at the rally.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan agreed last month to resume the foreign
secretary-level talks in Islamabad in November to discuss disputes
between the two countries including Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The party's president Shabir Ahmed Shah submitted a memorandum
to the UN office, which urged both India and Pakistan to stop
nuclear race and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, addressed to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
claimed that the people of Jammu and Kashmir through their true
representatives could work out a formula which would solve the
issue once for all.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to step into next millennium with prosperity and
peace," shah said after submitting the memorandum.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Renewable Energy Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 23
countries began here Monday a meeting on the role of renewable
energy technology for rural development.
</P>
<P>
A total of 68 papers are scheduled to be presented at the
three-day conference attended by countries in Asia, Africa,
Europe, North America and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims to disseminate successful renewable energy
technology (RET) undertaken in the participating countries,
exchange experiences and information, maintain closer cooperation
among the participating countries and explore the existing
engineering educational activities related to RET, said a press
release issued on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being organized jointly by the Alternative
Energy Promotion Center under the Nepali Ministry of Science and
Technology, the Institute of Engineering of Nepal's Tribhuvan
University and the Nepal Solar Energy Society.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, there are gaps and bottlenecks to optimize the use of
RET for the benefit of rural people, and the limited knowledge in
the area of technology, policy and program at implementation level
is the major reason of unsuccessful results in some RET-related
cases, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Recalls Envoys to NATO for Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia has recalled its
ambassador to Belgium and permanent representative to NATO Sergei
Kislyak for consultations on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Also back in Moscow, as reported Monday by the Interfax news
agency, was military representative to NATO Viktor Zavarzin.
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to be related to the Russian government's
strong objection to the Western military alliance's threatened air
strikes on Yugoslavia over the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The duration of the representatives' stay in Moscow will depend
on the circumstances, Vladimir Chizhov, director of the Third
European Department in charge of the Balkans in the Russian
Foreign Ministry, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the representatives for consultations is "quite usual
diplomatic practice," Chizhov said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO council meeting in Brussels scheduled for late Monday
to discuss plans for a military operation in Yugoslavia does not
seem to be the final step towards the operation, Chizhov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is continuing to act vigorously for peaceful resolution
of the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has repeatedly vented its opposition to NATO
strikes against Yugoslavia, said that any NATO force used there
without U.N. mandate would undermine the entire system of current
international relations.
</P>
<P>
Many Russian officials have warned that the NATO strikes, if
implemented, would make Moscow reconsider its cooperation with the
trans-Atlantic alliance.

CANBERRA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The new federal cabinet will
be sworn in next week as the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)
confirmed Monday that the coalition had a clear working majority,
Prime Minister John Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement, "The AEC has today confirmed that the

<P>
JAKARTA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 239 buildings and
public facilities in Donggala district in Indonesia's Central
Sulawesi province were damaged in two consecutive tectonic
earthquakes Sunday, according to Antara News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes registered 5.5 and 6.1 respectively on the
Richter scale, Secretary of the Donggala District Administration
Ahmad Abdul Rauf said.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorology and Geophysics Body reported that the epicenter
was at some 16 kilometers northwest of Palu, capital of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Rauf said the damage was done to state elementary and senior
high schools and markets.
</P>
<P>
In Palu city, 12 buildings were heavily and 51 lightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
Most of the damaged public and residential buildings were
permanent and semi-permanent structures. But they were generally
quite old and thus easily affected by violent earth movements.
</P>
<P>
Rauf said the figures he had given were not yet final as social
workers were still collecting data in the field.
</P>
<P>
The social service and the Indonesian Red Cross of Donggala
district had already distributed one ton of rice, 40 dozen packs
of instant noodles and one bag of sugar among people affected by
the earthquakes, Rauf added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Japan to Discuss Aid Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Monday he will
head a delegation to Japan for talks on obtaining the funds.
</P>
<P>
The package was proposed by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa last week at the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
About half the money is expected to be in the form of medium-
and long-term loans issued through the Export-Import Bank of
Japan. The rest will come as short-term financing to support
trade.
</P>
<P>
The package would help provide liquidity to Asian countries at
a time when international capital markets were all but closed to
sovereign and corporate borrowers, Tarrin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's sovereign bond maturing in 2007 now trades at 6.75-7
percentage points above U.S. treasuries, compared with a spread of
0.9 points at the time of issue in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Spreads on all emerging market debt have jumped sharply in the
past year as investors demand higher premiums to cover increased
risks.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government earlier this year approved borrowing up to
5 billion dollars in overseas funds to bolster domestic liquidity
and supplement public spending programs to spur the economy.
</P>
<P>
Plans had called for the issue of up to 2 billion dollars in
Yankee bonds, but difficult market conditions have caused Thai
officials to shelve the plans and consider alternatives, such as
syndicated loans or issuing yen-denominated "Samurai" bonds.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said foreign funds were still needed to supplement
increased public sector spending to stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand and other Southeast Asian representatives
attending the IMF-World Bank meetings warmly welcomed the Japanese
initiative.

which prompted the power firm to interrupt the normal flow of
electricity.

percent, to close at 352.17 points.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that share prices returned to the
350-point level since July 22, when the index was 362.07 points.
</P>
<P>
And this time, turnover rose to 135 million shares worth 758
billion won (about 580 million U.S. dollars). Winners overwhelmed
losers 674 to 132, with 72 shares remaining flat.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners' buying of index-sensitive shares boosted the prices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the rise to the strengthening Japanese yen
and falling interest rates in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Trading was heaviest for banking shares while securities shares
were also strong.
</P>
<P>
In the currency market, the strong Japanese yen and the inflow
of corporate funds made the South Korean won rally to 1,310
against the U.S. dollar Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said the market is overheated as the index
rose some 40-points over the past three days alone. They predicted
that the index would drop later this week.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM on Settlement of Kosovo Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis said Monday that peace and stability in the Balkan
region will face disaster if the Kosovo issue cannot be solved
soon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first day meeting of the Balkan summit held in
the southern Turkish resort city, Simitis said that the tensions
in Kosovo threaten stability in the region and can destroy the
fragile peace in the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian crisis would have disastrous consequences for
all our countries and put an abrupt end to economic development,"
Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the other Balkan nations to make joint efforts to
help solve the Kosovo issue because they are most affected by the
crisis and by punitive measures of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that Greece, which is both a NATO and EU member,
will do its utmost to play a positive part in easing tensions in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Although NATO has warned that it will launch air strikes to
drive the Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo, Athens said that all
diplomatic means should be tried before taking military action.
</P>
<P>
Greece fears that a NATO military strike against Yugoslavia
would intensify armed conflicts in Kosovo and further produce
negative impacts on other Balkan countries, including Greece
itself.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the meeting, Macedonian Prime Minister
Branko Crvenkovski said that his country supports an immediate
settlement of the Kosovo issue with political means and by way
of negotiations and dialog.
</P>
<P>
Crvenkovski stressed that the Kosovo crisis should be solved
within the framework of fully respecting the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia and human rights of all nationalities in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader and
Bosnian Ambassador to Turkey Besim Spahic, who are present at the
summit as observers, expressed the hope that the Balkan summit
would make a contribution to the settlement of the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan, Russia Steps up Economic, Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
capped a two-day state visit to Uzbekistan Monday with agreements
calling for closer economic and security cooperation and peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his Uzbek counterpart, Islam Karimov, also signed a
Russia-Uzbekistan-Tajikistan declaration on military assistance if
either one is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov had signed the trilateral
document earlier.
</P>
<P>
Under the declaration, the signatories will "develop dialogue
and cooperation in the field of security and defense on the
principles of equality and partnership."
</P>
<P>
The three countries will cooperate in coordination with the
United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
interested countries "for full political stabilization in
Tajikistan," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The signatories vow to work "for international peace,
stability and security on the regional and global scale by
supporting one another in every way, above all in preventing
threats to their sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Under the document, if one of the signatory countries believes
there is a threat to its security, territorial integrity and
sovereignty or to regional peace and security, the three countries
will immediately hold trilateral consultations directly or through
the international organizations where they are members to take
steps to avert the threat.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the trilateral mutual aid declaration "is open to
other states."
</P>
<P>
On Afghanistan, Yeltsin and Karimov urged the Taliban movement
and other influential groups in the Asian country to hold
constructive dialogue for the sake of maintaining Afghan statehood
and assuring a lasting peace and revival, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities must stop immediately, and other countries must
cease supplies of military hardware to any party in the Afghan
conflict, the two presidents said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the fratricidal war in Afghanistan is
continuing mainly because the Talibans have been acted in flagrant
defiance of U.N. resolutions, stressing that escalation of
fighting there may lead to serious negative consequences for
Central Asian countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin pointed to the need "to use political potential more
effectively for achieving peace and stability in the southern
flanks of the CIS."
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a number of documents on cooperation
in telecommunications, culture and protection of computer software.
</P>
<P>
"Islam Karimov and I definitely spoke for closer foreign
economic, political and military-technical cooperation," Yeltsin
said Monday after the signing of Russian-Uzbek agreements in
Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Karimov, for his part, stressed "the important stabilizing role
of Russia in Central Asia" and Yeltsin's firm and principled
stance "as an advocate of equal and mutually beneficial
cooperation between Uzbekistan and Russia."
</P>
<P>
"Together we stand for peaceful settlement of the conflict in
Afghanistan and restoration of stability in Tajikistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has left Tashkent and arrived in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan,
on the second and final leg of his Central Asia tour.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Peaceful Solution to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz Monday called on the Balkan leaders to make joint
efforts for a peaceful settlement of the current Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the two-day Balkan summit here, Yilmaz said that
the armed conflicts in the Yugoslav province is posing a serious
threat to the regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in Kosovo causes deep concern regionally and
internationally. A durable and viable solution needs to be found
as soon as possible, needless to say, by peaceful means," Yilmaz
said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz stressed that all legitimate rights of all inhabitants
of Kosovo should be respected within a fair and democratic
constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened to launch air strikes against the Yugoslav
military targets if the Yugoslav government still refuses to
withdraw its troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member, has agreed to play a role in the
possible NATO mission in that region, making Belgrade unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
On the current turmoil in Albania, Yilmaz said that Turkey is
very much concerned about the situation in the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
New and constructive initiatives must be worked out to help
Albania restore democracy and constitutional order, the Turkish
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the Balkan summit, Romanian Prime
Minister Radu Vasile said that his country supports the joint
efforts of the international community aimed at preventing further
deterioration of the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Vasile, however, said that Romania would not assume a direct
participation in military operations against Yugoslavia that
might be launched by NATO.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi and the Taliban delegation held their
third round of talks here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the two sides further dilated on their
respective positions on all aspects of their discussion, said
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic
Conference Ibrahim Baker also attended the talks, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi and Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakil, senior advisor to Taliban
leader Mohammad Omar, held two sessions of talks Sunday, but their
talks ended with no headway.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy is on a visit to the region following the Six
Plus Two meeting in New York on September 21, which had called for
despatching the Secretary General's Envoy on Afghanistan for a
peaceful end to standoff between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Before flying here Thursday night, Brahimi spent four days in
Teheran as part of his peace mission last week and invited the
Taliban militia to Islamabad for talks on the Afghanistan
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban on their part had invited the U.N. official to
visit Afghanistan but Brahimi had not undertaken the trip to the
war-shattered country citing security reasons.

<P>
TOKYO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited enactment of a
set of banking-reform bills injected confidence into the Tokyo
stock market Monday and boosted the Nikkei index by 5.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the move by the Diet, or parliament, the Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange surged 675.04 points to close at 13,555.01.
</P>
<P>
It was the year's fourth largest single-day points gain.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First Section
issues, advanced 40.84 points, or 4.16 percent, to 1,023.34.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section was heavy at about 570 million
shares, slightly down from 581.84 million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares, as a sector, soared 8.01 percent on prospects that
a much larger-than-expected amount of public money would be pumped
into major lenders to help ease the current credit crunch.
</P>
<P>
The strong gains were the result of the new legislation, deemed
by investors as a signal of the government's desire to prevent
Japan's biggest banks from collapsing, traders said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sharp rebound on the Wall Street, of the
United States, on Friday helped restore some confidence in Japan's
battered big-name exporter shares.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,337 issues listed on the First Section at the Tokyo
market, gainers outpaced losers 966 to 196, with 115 issues ending

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav PM: Kosovo Issue Brooks No Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA, TURKEY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime
Minister Momir Bulatovic said here Monday that the Kosovo issue
is a domestic question and brooks no military intervention by
foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first day meeting of the Balkan summit held in
southern Turkish port city of Antalya, Bulatovic stressed that
attempts are being made by certain countries to "create
artificial tensions" in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) threats of military
intervention are unacceptable, absolutely counterproductive and
cannot resolve anything, but can only contribute to
destabilization of the region with unforeseeable consequences,"
Bulatovic said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the military action that might be launched by
Western countries is aimed at furthering disintegrating the
Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights, the rights of nations and national minorities
were abused for the purposes of particular separatist or
hegemonic interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to regional cooperation, the Yugoslav prime
minister said that his country has always pursued an active
policy of good neighborly relations and comprehensive equitable
cooperation with all its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic met with his Turkish counterpart Mesut Yilmaz Sunday
afternoon, but did not speak to reporters about the outcome of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic also stressed
Sunday that the Kosovo crisis should be solved through political
means under the principles of the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO has warned that air strikes will be inevitable
unless the Yugoslav administration agrees to pull its forces out
of the Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member, has decided to participate in a possible
NATO peacekeeping mission aimed at ending the armed conflicts in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Prime ministers from Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia,
Yugoslavia as well as Turkey will try to find a solution to help
solve the Kosovo crisis during the two-day summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian delegation is headed by Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo as the Albanian premier is not able to come to the summit
because of the continuing turmoil in the country.

<P>
The foundation's head, Ayatollah Sheikh Hassan Sanai, announced
on Sunday in Mashhad, northeastern province of Khorasan that his
foundation would add a sum of 300,000 U.S. dollars to its
2.5-million-dollar award.
</P>
<P>
Sanai, a representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, said the recent western propaganda was "trying to cast a
shadow" over late Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989
fatwa, or religious decree, calling on the world Muslims to kill
Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
The foundation offered the award soon after Khomeini published
the fatwa against Rushdie for his controversial novel "the Satanic
Verses" considered to have insulted the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Hezbollah Students Association also announced recently
an award of 1 billion Iranian rials (about 333,000 dollars) for
carrying out the death sentence on Rushdie after the Iranian
government promised not to implement Khomeini's fatwa.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said last month in New
York that the Iranian government would not take or support any
actions to threaten the life of Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
He said the award offered by the Khordad 15 Foundation has
nothing to do with the government, which does not back the move.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain have agreed to upgrade their diplomatic
relations to the ambassadorial level after putting aside the
Rushdie issue, a step viewed by the west as Iran's retreat from
its original stance.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Upper House OKs Bank Reform Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Councillors, the
upper house of parliament, enacted Monday a set of banking reform
bills designed to fix the country's ailing banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The enactment ended months of political wrangling between the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and opposition groups led by
the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) over how to handle Japanese
banks' massive bad loan problem.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful to see the bills become law following
negotiations among the parties," Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also hoped that a separate package of bills on bank
recapitalization would be enacted soon.
</P>
<P>
The newly enacted bills, which cleared the House of
Representatives, the lower house of parliament, on October 2,
offer three options to deal with failed banks and call for a new
independent committee to share financial planning power with the
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the bills, the financially troubled Long-Term Credit of
Japan is expected to become the first Japanese bank to go under
state control around October 20.
</P>
<P>
The reform bills do not specify how much public money would be
earmarked to deal with failed banks, but the LDP is considering
setting aside a total of 67 trillion yen (about 577.4 billion
U.S. dollars) to fix the banking sector, including 50 trillion yen
(430.9 billion dollars) for helping capital-short banks.
</P>
<P>
The LDP scheme is roughly based on a proposal put forward by
the opposition DPJ, which called for the use of 50 trillion yen
(430.9 billion dollars) in public funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan Direct, a Japanese auto
dealer, has earmarked a total of one billion Kwacha (about
500,000 U.S. Dollars) for the introduction of a vehicle purchase
credit scheme in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Monday quoted director Saul Radunski of the

and one billion Kwacha will be committed to the pilot project.
</P>
<P>
An estimated five million U.S. Dollars worth of business is
expected to be achieved under the scheme, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, vehicle buyers will first pay 50 percent
down payment while the balance will be settled in six to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Radunski said that the new scheme will cover both new and
second-hand motor vehicles and no interest will be charged on the
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The firm will further offer a one-month warranty on all
second-hand vehicles and 20,000 kilometers of 12 months guarantee
on new motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The company has 70 cars, trucks and buses on the ground in
Lusaka while another 50 units are on-route from Japan.
</P>
<P>

<P>
JINAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province, a
major grain producer, is expected to reap a record autumn grain
harvest this year, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's autumn grain output is likely to reach a record high
22.5 billion kg this year, five billion kg more than last year,
according to Zheng Shoulong, deputy director of the provincial

</P>
<P>
The increase in grain output alone is expected to raise the per

said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the province's autumn grain acreage
this year totaled four million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shandong's autumn grain harvest fell off by 2.5

<HEADLINE> Law-Enforcement Inspection of Water, Soil Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Buhe, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
recently required concerned departments at all levels to increase
their awareness on water and soil conservation and handle soil
erosion in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Buhe, an NPC Standing Committee team on October 1
began to conduct an inspection of water and soil conservation
in Sichuan Province on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
As the key province of China's water and soil conservation
program, Sichuan has spared no effort in implementing the law in
recent years, and put forth a series of preferential policies in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the province had brought under control a
soil erosion area of 24,000 square kilometers, 12 percent of the
province's total area suffering from soil erosion. The provincial
government also stopped the logging on October 1, and
drew up a long-term plan for water and soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
Affirming the achievements and the role of Sichuan in this
year's flood relief on the Yangtze River, Buhe required the
concerned local departments to draw up coordinated rules and
increase public awareness of water and soil conservation laws in
order to enhance the constant improvement of the environment.

<HEADLINE> Chang Wins 12th Title in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Michael Chang of
the United States signalled his return to top form when he
defeated top seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 to
win the rain-delayed Shanghai Open tennis tournament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was a record 12th title for Chang in Asian ATP Tour events,
his second title for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely significant. First of all, to win in Shanghai
is very special since I have not won here before. Playing Goran
in the final, he's been in the top 10 numberous years, to beat
him was definitely a good felling," said Chang, who levelled his
career head-to-head with Ivanisevic at 5 matches all.
</P>
<P>
The heavy conditions favored Chang. A damp mist settled on
Shanghai throughtout the day, creating a cool, humid atmosphere.
The victory marks an 11-1 record for Chang in the last month,
including titles in Boston and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"The first set was close but Goran won the key points, but in
the second there was a momentum shift and the crowd started
getting into it. There was a bit of a chanting match going on,
the Chinese versus the Crotians, and that was fun to be a part
of," said Chang.
</P>
<P>
Despite the seemingly one sided score, the match took 1 hour
and 57 minutes, with Ivanisevic having a number of break point
opportunities in the third set.
</P>
<P>
"The way I played I should go to jail," said Ivanisevic. "It's
a different part of the world to be in, it was a good week but
I'm not happy with the way I played. I can beat some guys, but as
soon as I play someone tougher, I struggle."
</P>
<P>
In the doubles final, second seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander
Paes won the title by stunning top seeded Todd Woodrigde and Mark
Woodforde of Australia in a gripping two hours and 46 minutes
final 6-4, 6-7(7-2), 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
The Indian's victory over the Woodies was their first win in
four attempts.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Export Drops in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee exports in
September this year dropped 40.6 percent to 207,931 bags compared
to 350,197 bags registered in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Monitor daily quoted a monthly report of Uganda
Coffee Development Authority as saying that the plunge is due to
a reduction in the farm level production caused by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The report also said September is usually an off-season month
and volumes are minimal, adding that farmers are busy preparing
fro the beginning of the new season in the month.
</P>
<P>
In relation to the same period last year, September 1998
exports declined by 5.5 and 10 percents respectively in terms of
volume and value.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997/1998 coffee year ending September 30, Uganda
exported 3 million bags of coffee with a value of some 274
million U.S. Dollars, a decline of 29 percent in volume and 22.7
percent in value from the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Uganda's key export product and accounts for 60
percent of its total foreign exchange earnings.

<P>
HEFEI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Taihe County is unknown to the
majority of Chinese, but it is deemed as the Capital of Pharmacy
by local pharmaceutical manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"The Taihe pharmaceutical market is the largest of its kind in
China," says Xie Yufa, a local government official. "Therefore, we
have invested heavily in infrastructure and tried strenuous efforts
to protect it."
</P>
<P>
The recent reports about substandard medicine which were
donated to flood-hit areas have led to the close-down of a number
of stalls in the Taihe market.
</P>
<P>
"We'll put stricter restrictions on the management so as to
turn down those illegally profiteering firms," says Xie.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical market is merely one of the many big markets
in Fuyang City, in east China's Anhui Province, which used to be
one of the poorest areas in the country due to frequent floods and
droughts.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, local people have tried every means
to make their own fortune. But it was only known as one of the
major labor-exporting places until the early 1990s, when a number of
specialized market emerged there.
</P>
<P>
These markets include some nationally largest ones dealing in
decorating wood-plates, peppermint, cattle and animal skins and
hides, respectively.

Local governments at different levels have tried hard to
improve the business environment. A government official from
Fuyang says, "Local rickshaw drivers never bargain much for a
higher price, because they know it would scare away visiting
businessmen."
</P>
<P>
Local authorities often check up in the markets to see if there
are irregular activities such as illegal charges or levies
collected by government officials or other local people.
</P>
<P>
In Taihe, to protect businessmen from robbery, large quantities
of uniformed or plain-clothed policemen are deployed around
market-places, banks and post offices. "No robbery has been
reported here, though lots of business people here are moving
around with cash," says a local police officer.
</P>
<P>
With the effective and powerful support from the government,
local markets and businesses have been flourishing. Li Wenbin, who
owns one of the country's largest nylon rope and net factories, is
now further expanding his business. Recently, he has purchased two
PII 586 computers to modernize the management.
</P>
<P>
The booming markets have also milked local service
sectors. Local Hui residents have opened many Muslim restaurants
to cater to transients from across the country and even other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Farmers at Balihe Town, Yinshang County, have turned a country
place into a scenic holiday resort, a miniature of the Summer

<HEADLINE> Death Toll at Lesotho Ruling Party Rally Rises to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Two more people have died
in a hospital in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, following the
outbreak of violence Sunday at a Lesotho Congress for Democracy
(LCD) rally, and bringing the death toll to three.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the latest death report, one person was beaten to
death and four others injured when they were allegedly found
trying to plant a bomb at the rally site, South African Press
Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Enraged LCD supporters cornered the unidentified people after
one of them fired a shot, wounding an LCD supporters in a knee.
The LCD public meeting with the participation of 5,000 people
ended in chaos.
</P>
<P>
The LCD leaders blamed the opposition parties for sending the
people to assassinate Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his
deputy Kelibone Maope, who were participating in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both Mosisili and Maope were whisked away from the rally
shortly after the violence broke out at the rally site, about six
km east of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The LCD rally, to brief supporters on Southern African
Development Community (SADC)-initiated talks aimed at resolving
the political crisis in the kingdom, was the first to be held by
the LCD since the SADC's military intervention beginning on
September 22.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been in political crisis when opposition parties
claimed that the May 23 general election was rigged in favor of
the LCD.
</P>
<P>
The LCD and the opposition party alliance are due to hold the
third round talks, chaired by the South African Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Seventh East Asia Economic Summit Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh East Asia
Economic Summit opened here Monday with a discussion on economic
outlook for Asia.
</P>
<P>
Most speakers expressed their belief at the gathering of some
800 participants Monday morning that East Asia's sound economic
fundamentals will provide good prospects for the region.
</P>
<P>
Lee Tsao Yuan, director of the Institute of Policy Study of
Singapore, said the economic fundamentals, which are the basis for
the Asian economic miracles in the past decades, remain sound,
referring to the infrastructure, the investments, the technical
transfer, the high saving rates, the education and the strategy
for opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
These factors have not disappeared and they will benefit Asian
economic recovery and economic development in future, she said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the current trend toward stability in Asian currencies
and increasing export volumes in some Asian economies, she said
the downturn of East Asian economy seems to have touched the
bottom and is reversing its course and going toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
Charles Powell, director of the Jardine Matheson of the United
Kingdom, expressed similar idea.
</P>
<P>
He said if Asian economies enhance efficiency in manipulating
capitals, strengthen financial supervision and increase
transparency, these fundamentals will bring recovery to East Asian
economies.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that national cohesion and strong national
leadership are decisive factors for a country to overcome its
economic woes and achieve stable and fast economic development.
</P>
<P>
While East Asia should build up confidence in itself, he said,
it also needs help from the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ways in which Asian economies achieve recoveries are different
from country to country, he noticed, saying it is impossible for a
single pair of shoes to fit all feet.
</P>
<P>
However, Clyde Prestowits, president of the Economic Strategy
Institute of the U.S., presented a different view. He attributed
the Asian economic crisis to too fast economic growth, the high
saving rate and high export rate and neglect of regulations and
laws in their economies.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the world will face economic recession and
plunge into more difficulties in years 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh East Asia Economic Summit is organized by the
Switzerland-based World Economic Forum in partnership with the
Economic Development Board of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The summit will last for three days to end Wednesday. Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Philippine President Joseph
Estrada will make keynote speeches Monday evening and Tuesday
respectively .
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce Supachai
Panitchpakdi of Thailand, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh Cam of Vietnam, Vice Minister of
Finance Lou Jiwei of China, Secretary of Trade and Industry Chau
Tak Hay of Hong Kong and Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority Joseph Yam will deliver their speeches at the plenary
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Attending the three-day summit are about 1,000 participants
from the member companies of the World Economic Forum worldwide
and government officials, business leaders, public figures,
leading commentators, opinion makers and experts from Asia, Europe
and North America.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government

after kidnappers who preyed on wealthy businessmen, particularly
members of the Chinese Filipino community in Metro Manila.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Drafts Long-Awaited Constitution Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A bill on the review of
Kenya's constitution, being drafted by Kenya's Attorney-General,
will be presented to parliament within a month, following a split
among groups charged with preparing it.
</P>
<P>
A dispute over the review process resulted in the National
Convention Executive Council (NCEC), the umbrella body of
opposition lobby groups during l997 pre-election campaigns,
leaving the 10-man constitutional drafting committee, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC wanted a "multi-sectoral caucus" set up to advise on
a bill covering the appointment of commissioners to the Kenyan
Constitution Review Commission before it is debated in
parliament, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Attorney-General's office was
preparing to publish th final bill for debate next month and the
drafting committee is expected to endorse the final amendments
within a fortnight.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fairly urgent bill and there is unanimity within
the drafting committee that the effort that has gone into the
process is more important than the NCEC's self-serving attitude,"
a state counsel on the drafting committee said.
</P>
<P>
The constitution review commission is expected to hear views
around the country on constitutional reform within two and a half
years and prepare a new constitution before the next general
elections, slated for December 2002.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC, however, said it believes that crucial issues
related to the time-frame for the constitutional review process
have not been addressed, arguing that this could impede the
commission's work.
</P>
<P>
Sources within the drafting committee alleged that the
fall-out between the NCEC and other committee members was
precipitated by the unwillingness of the latter to reserve a seat
for the lobby group on the review commission.
</P>
<P>
But the NCEC played down disagreements on automatic
representation within the commission, warning that its unilateral
withdrawal indicated its displeasure with the Attorney-General's
growing encroachment on the drafting committee's business.
</P>
<P>
"The Attorney-General has encroached on the committee's work,
which calls for reconstituting the committee to ensure the final
draft bill is sound and legitimate," argued Kibutha Kibwana, the
convener of the NCEC.
</P>
<P>
The constitution review was very highlighted during the
confrontations between the government and the opposition before
the country's second multi-party general elections held at the
end of December last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The China Export-Import Bank
(Eximbank) issued three billion yuan worth of two-year financial
bonds today, the first set of bonds the bank has ever floated
through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice-President of Eximbank Zhu Degui said that the
bonds first go to underwriters through public bidding, and
commercial banks and insurance companies will then buy the bonds
from the underwriters.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Eximbank's financial bonds were distributed by the
central bank to other banks and postal savings institutions, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
With an annual interest rate of 5.31 percent, the bonds are
expected to be traded on the national interbank money market with
approval from the central bank. Revenues from the bond issue will
be used for export-seller credit.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, Eximbank, which was established in
July 1994, had provided credit to exporters in the amount of 49
billion yuan, and issued 28.9 billion yuan in financial bonds.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that 40 percent of the bank's funds this year will come
from public-bidding financial bond issues. With the constant
improvement of the country's capital market, Eximbank will
gradually increase the proportion of funds raised through public
bidding.

<HEADLINE> Bodies of Remaining Diplomats Returned to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The bodies of three other
Iranian diplomats killed by the Afghan Taliban militia have been
returned to Iran, the official news agency IRNA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A plane of the International Committee of the Red Cross carried
the bodies Sunday night to Mashhad in the northeastern province of
Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
The bodies will be identified in Mashhad before being
transferred to Tehran for a funeral procession on Friday, IRNA
said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban militia killed eight Iranian diplomats and an IRNA
reporter after the group captured Mazari Sharif, northern
Afghanistan, in August. Six bodies of the Iranian diplomats and
the reporter were transferred to Iran last month.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Taliban's atrocity, Iran has threatened retaliation
against the group and massed 200,000 troops on the Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, set conditions Sunday on a possible visit to Tehran by
Taliban officials, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
No Taliban members will be allowed to visit Tehran unless they
bring back the Iranian citizens kidnaped by the group, arrest and
punish those killing the Iranian diplomats and the reporter, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
A London-based Arabic weekly reported recently that a
representative of the Taliban group is to pay a visit to Tehran in
the coming days to start negotiations with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran said Taliban has detained more than 40 Iranian drivers
and aid workers in Afghanistan. Ten Iranians were released in two
groups in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Taliban decided Sunday to set free another 10
Iranians after a mediation of a Palestinian delegation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Seeking WB Fund for More Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is currently seeking more
fund from the World Bank (WB) to boost power generation at the Owen
Falls Dam in Jinja, some 80 kms east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
A WB team was invited to Uganda recently to assess the facilities
of Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) and to explore possible ways to
end chronic power shortages in the fast developing country, the
Nairobi-based weekly East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The team had looked at the possibility of providing further
funding for the dam extension project so that three more turbines
could be installed to boost power generation.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to make recommendations to the bank's headquarters in
Washington but prefered to co-fund with other donor agencies to
bring in the three machines.
</P>
<P>
UEB said Uganda is generating some 180 megawatts of
electricity while the demand tops 230 megawatts. So blackouts are
inevitable during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
A UEB official was quoted as saying that the demand for power
would continue to rise with technological development and population
growth.
</P>
<P>
Uganda had a population of 4.96 million in 1954 when the
Owen Falls Dam was built and it has shot up to more than 20 million
now.
</P>
<P>
Of power consumption, residential consumption accounted for 55
percent of the total power output. The commercial sector and industry
consume 25 and 20 percents respectively.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the Ugandan economy has witnessed a growth rate
of 6 percent, one of the success stories for the East African region
and even the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
With further development of national economy, Uganda will face a
much bigger demand for power. When the dam extension project is
completed by 1999 as expected, some 80 megawatts of power can be
added to the power output.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand University to Dismiss Student Defaulters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Victoria University in
Wellington, capital of New Zealand, will cancel the enrollment of
students who have not paid 1998 tuition fees and student
association levies, if debt collectors cannot recover the money,
the Dominion reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said that about 200 students are
facing the threat of dismissal.
</P>
<P>
It quoted David Brian, finance and property director of the
university, as saying, "I think we will have to disenrol students
this year. I think it is a sad inevitability. It's the
vice-chancellor's position that we do this if we can't collect the
fees, and we're carrying that out."
</P>
<P>
Brian said the university had been sending letters to students
who owed money and followed them up with leaflets in student and
university magazines, notice boards and lecture theaters.
</P>
<P>
A "healthy number" of students had cleared fee debts in recent
weeks, cutting the amount outstanding from 1.4 million NZ dollars
(0.7 million U.S. dollars) to 740,000 NZ dollars (370,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the New Zealand Ministry of
Education, the total outstanding debt students owe the government
through borrowing from the student loan scheme has surpassed 2.4
billion NZ dollars (1.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure will top three billion next year and four billion by
2001.
</P>
<P>
Last week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley revealed
that the government is now considering paying student loans
incrementally instead of in lump sums.
</P>
<P>
She said she had found students doing things other than meeting
their course costs with their loans, such as buying and selling
shares.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Raise Train Speeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China's railway departments
will take measures to further raise train speeds, said Chang
Guozhi, chief dispatcher of the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
More sections of major railway lines will be fenced in, and
basic facilities including bridges, roadbeds, signals and
telecommunications will be consolidated. Fly-overs will be built
at crossings on railway lines with a speed of over 140 km per
hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
Train speeds were raised on April 1 last year and October 1
this year, and trains now run at a speed of 140-160 km per hour on
the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Harbin
lines. "But there is still room for a hike of train speed," Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
China's railways are coming into an era of high speed. Work on
the Beijing-Shanghai express railway, the first of its kind in
China, will begin in the year 2000, with an estimated speed of
300 km per hour. An express train now runs on the
Guangzhou-Shenzhen line at 200 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the increased speeds will satisfy demands
brought on by economic development and improvement in people's
living standards, and sharpen the competitive edge of railways
as compared with highways and civil aviation.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Off-load 87 More State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken steps for off-loading 87 more state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
under its privatization policy, an English newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the enterprises, 79 have been readied for sell-out, and 21
of them are in jute sector, 19 textiles, 21 steel and engineering,
10 sugar and food and eight in chemical sector, The Independent
daily quoted officials in the Privatization Board as saying.
</P>
<P>
Steps have been taken for the disposal of shares from eight
SOEs, they said, adding that tender call for these enterprises
will be issued on completion of 35 enterprises listed earlier for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Five of the public-sector industrial units have already been
sold out to private owners, and letters of intent have been issued
for nine others.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs in the country, with the total value
of output accounting for about six percent of the GDP (gross
domestic product). Owing to mismanagement, corruption and
bureaucracy, the SOEs are making an enormous loss of about 568
million U.S. dollars every year, which accounts for 45 percent of
the country's total investment.
</P>
<P>
To privatize the loss-making SOEs is the Bangladeshi
government's set policy. The government set up the Privatization
Board in 1993 to expedite the process of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen SOEs were privatized during the 1993-96 period, and a
World Bank survey showed that the production and management of
most of them were improved.
</P>
<P>
Since June 1996 when the present government was formed, 32 SOEs
have been privatized.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board has reportedly drafted a plan of SOEs'
privatization and submitted it to the government for approval.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Enterprises No Longer Run Schools in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises (SOE) in
east China's Fujian Province have shaken off the burden of running
schools for their workers' children.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the provincial economic and trade committee said
that 103 SOE-affiliated schools have been separated from SOE
beginning this autumn semester. Four more schools will become
independent from SOE in the near future.
</P>
<P>
China's SOE, known as "mini-societies," used to build
hospitals, schools, bathhouses, canteens, post offices, and houses
for their workers and staff. These responsibilities have become
heavy burdens now that they are facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian provincial government has worked out plans and
allocated 6.25 million yuan (about 753,000 U.S. dollars) to help
state enterprises cast off these burdens.
</P>
<P>
By separating schools from enterprises, it is believed more
funds for production and management will become
available. Besides, the schools will receive funds from local
educational bureaus to improve the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
This pilot reform, first conducted at the Nanping Textile
Mill in June 1997, proved successful and subsequently spread
throughout the province.

<HEADLINE> India to Stage Large-scale Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Defense Ministry
confirmed Sunday that its army and air force were scheduled to
stage a "formation-level" exercise next month along its border
with neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times daily reported Monday that the
brigade-level exercise was a "routine and a planned one" with the
participation of the Indian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Western observers were reportedly alarmed at India's plan for
the military maneuver with 100,000 troops on its border with its
arch-enemy Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
They feared that India "might use the exercise to launch an
airstrike against a militant training camp in Pakistani Kashmir",
according to the mass circulated newspaper Sunday Telegraph
published Sunday in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Western intelligence sources as saying that
"several army divisions will mass on the sensitive border next
month for two weeks of simulated war games.
</P>
<P>
The last such exercise in 1987 had brought India and Pakistan
to the brink of an all-out war.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph said that India's short-range Prithvi
missile would be deployed for the exercises and back-up would be
provided by battleships, aircraft carriers and probably submarines
positioned off the coast of India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said
Sunday that fears of war with Pakistan were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The talk of war was totally unfounded because India and
Pakistan informed each other of troop movement before the start of
any such exercises, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The talk of India using the exercise to launch an airstrike
for a pre-emptive strike on the Kashmir militants is baseless," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The news of military maneuver came at a sensitive time when
India and Pakistan had planned for resumption of foreign
secretary-lever talks in Islamabad next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Telegraph, the Pakistani army might
also come up with a massive military exercise involving nuclear
weapons in the wake of India's war games in Rajasthan desert and
Arabian sea in November.

<HEADLINE> New Vehicle Sales Rise in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand saw an increase
of 10 percent in new vehicle sales in September, the New Zealand
Press Association (NZPA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Total sales of new vehicles last month were 6,068, the second
highest figure recorded in the past 11 months. It represented an
increase of 577 over the August figure.
</P>
<P>
The increase in new vehicle sales was attributed to realigned
prices after the removal of tariffs on motor vehicles in the
country and a recognition that the New Zealand dollar was falling.
</P>
<P>
However, new vehicle sales for the first nine months of 1998
were well down on last year. A total of 48,214 new vehicles had
been sold, 11.6 percent down on the 54,586 sold during the first
nine months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Toyota sold 1,210 new vehicles in September, accounting for
19.9 percent of the New Zealand market.

<HEADLINE> Sea Buckthorn Helps Ease Soil Erosion Along Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Sea buckthorn, a perennial bush
whose fruits are nowadays often used to make delicious juice, is
playing a vital role in the fight against soil erosions in the
middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Lastest figures show that a total of more than 1.15 million
hectares of sea buckthorn are grown in these areas, which suffer
some of the worst soil erosion in China.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia's Ikh Chao League pioneered the use of this shrub
tree in the anti-soil-erosion fight in the early 1980s, and this
successful experience was spread to the entire country in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, the six provinces and autonomous regions of
Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia
planted 55,600 hectares of sea buckthorn, which helped ease soil
erosion in areas covering more than 553 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The fruit of the shrub has been used to make juice, jam, candy,
canned fruit, medicine and beer, with the help of China's only sea
buckthorn research institute, in Youyu County, Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, over 100 sea buckthorn enterprises in the middle and
upper reaches of the Yellow River produced 2,000 tons of preserved
fruit, 10,000 tons of juice and 800 tons of dried fruit,
generating an output value of 300 million yuan (36.14 million
U.S. dollars). Sea buckthorn planting and fruit processing have
also helped many poor areas escape from poverty.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Announces New Immigration Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
launched new immigration policy initiatives as part of its
Policies for Progress to attract more "highly skilled migrants" to
the country, especially from Asia.
</P>
<P>
Under the new immigration policy issued Monday by Immigration
Minister Tuariki Delamere, English language bond will be abolished
and replaced with pre-purchased English language training.
</P>
<P>
"The bond was a barrier to migration. We were missing out on
skilled migrants who could not afford the 20,000 NZ dollar (10,000
U.S. dollar) bond for their family members who did not have at
least modest English language skills," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Another important feature of the new policy is a more
realistic view of what qualifications should be accepted under the
General Skills category. Under old policy we missed out on people
with skills and expertise in a wide range of industries,
particularly high-tech, emerging industries such as information
technology.
</P>
<P>
"We will be accepting all work experience, not just experience
relevant to qualifications, for points in the General Skills
category," he said.
</P>
<P>
Delamere said the new policy has made the investor category
more streamlined, with a simpler points table and better approvals
processes to encourage those who are "willing to put down roots
and invest time and energy in developing a business" in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The new investor category has three points categories only:
age, business experience and investor funds to replace a more
complex points system that includes points for different
categories of investments funds, qualifications and a range of
settlement factors such as spouse's qualifications and family
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
Delamere said foreign nationals who have established successful
businesses in New Zealand can qualify for residence under the new
entrepreneur category while people interested in setting up a
business in New Zealand will be able to apply for a long-term
multiple re-entry visa to get their business underway.
</P>
<P>
The new policy also encourages foreign students who graduate
from a New Zealand tertiary institution to stay in the country, by
awarding them an extra point in the General Skills category and
waiving the requirement for them to have two years' work
experience to qualify for residence.
</P>
<P>
Delamere said the New Zealand government will open new
immigration offices in Shanghai, the largest city in China, and in
Moscow next July.
</P>
<P>
"These offices will serve General Skill category and business
migrants, but they will also play a significant role in developing
trade and tourism links with New Zealand," he said.
</P>
<P>
All regulations will take effect within less than half a year.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley issued a statement,
welcoming the launch of new immigration policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"The National Minority Government recognizes that increasing
the level of business expertise, investment and skilled workers in
New Zealand will assist in creating economic growth and jobs for
New Zealanders," she said.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand must continue to present itself as a good place in
which to do business. It remains one of the best countries in the
world in which to live and bring up a family," she added.

<HEADLINE> Slums Turned into Downtown Area in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- In Lhasa, capital of southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region, a slum area crowded with beggars
four decades ago has been turned into a downtown area.
</P>
<P>
In the former poor district known as Lugu near Jokhang Temple,
there are now 348 shops and restaurants and apartment buildings
for more than 1,600 residents.
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, Lhasa had a population of about 20,000 and the
number of beggars amounted to several thousands, with most of them
living in shabby tents and shanties in Lugu.
</P>
<P>
In 1959, about 160 homeless beggars were allocated homes in the
Lugu neighborhood community after the start of democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, the Tibet regional government has
allocated a large amount of money for adequate-housing project for
the beggars.
</P>
<P>
Today, the residents of Lhasa have an average housing floor
space of 15 square meters, and all Lugu families have moved to new
apartments with sanitary facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Since China started its reform and opening-up policy two
decades ago, Lugu District has changed a lot. The greatest change
is that people here have moved to new apartments and have begun to
lead peaceful lives," said Chugba Yungdan, a neighborhood
community official.
</P>
<P>
The community is also one of the busiest parts of Lhasa because
of its booming trade, which provides chances for local people to
gain wealth as well as buy products from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
"If you use your brain, there are many ways to get rich," says
Puncog Gungphel, offspring of the former beggars in Lugu. During
the last eight years, he has developed his business from a
teahouse to a Tibetan-style restaurant, and he also has a flour
mill and a transportation company. Now he earns about 1,000 yuan
in net profit every month.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the Lugu neighborhood community spent about
5,000 yuan per capita in 1997. At present, almost every household
has a TV set, and some have VCDs and telephones.
</P>
<P>
Lugu's changes over the past four decades are a miniature
reflection of Lhasa's development. Lhasa has expanded its area
from three square kilometers to the current 50 square kilometers,
and its population has grown from 20,000 to 130,000.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Scholars Urged to Face Challenges of New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Sunday called on the Muslim scholars, scientists and
academicians to prepare themselves to face the challenges of the
new millennium and revive the lost glory of the Ummah, English
newspapers here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
She made the call when addressing the 12th congregation
ceremony of the Islamic Institute of Technology (IIT) in northern
district of Gazipur.
</P>
<P>
"Once the Muslim scholars had kindled the torch of knowledge
when the entire world plunged into the darkness of ignorance and
superstition," she said, recalling the past glory of scientific
and technological achievements of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The IIT is a shining example of joint Islamic action and it's a
matter of great pride and honor that Bangladesh has been chosen as
the location for such a prestigious institution, she told the
function.
</P>
<P>
This year, 96 students from 15 countries were conferred
graduate and post graduate degrees from this international
institution run by the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)
members.
</P>
<P>
A 2.5 million U.S. dollar loan agreement has been signed with
Islamic Development Bank for the institute's second dormitory
which will be able to accommodate at least 900 students against
the present capacity of 380.
</P>
<P>
Assuring the government's continued support to the IIT, she
said the institute would grow from strength to strength.
</P>
<P>
She thanked the OIC member states which have been contributing
regularly to the IIT.
</P>
<P>
This institute is facing some financial hardships because of
mandatory contributions of 13 million dollars from some member
states, she said, appealing to all member states for contributing
to the budget as well as making generous donations to IIT.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Launches Border Area Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been launching a
number of border areas development projects in the country since
late 1988, aiming at narrowing the development gap between the
hinterland and border areas.
</P>
<P>
It started implementing a four-year development project in
1989, followed by another 11-year master plan beginning 1993 for
the development, including the first short-term three-year plan
(1993-94 to 1995-96), the first medium-term four-year plan
(1996-97 to 1999-2000) and the second medium-term four-year plan
(2000-01 to 2003-04).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also been cooperating with United Nations agencies
in this regard and seven projects have been or are being
implemented with the involvement of the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the United Nations Drug Control Program
(UNDCP).
</P>
<P>
The government has formed the Ministry of Progress of Border
Areas and National Races and Development Affairs and the Central
Committee for Development of Border Areas and National Races to
help develop the economy, social conditions and transport of
border areas, while conserving the traditions and culture and
literature of the different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government has increased investment in the border
areas' development projects, spending more than 9.51 billion kyats
 (about 31.7 million U.S. dollars) so far for the projects of
building roads, bridges, hospitals, dispensaries, schools,
irrigation facilities, vocational training schools, setting up
firms, plantations, generators, TV retransmission stations and
communication links in the regions.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 fiscal year, which began in April, has also been
designated as the year of roads and bridges to facilitate road
links among villages and the rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the development of the border areas, the
government also gives more priority to controlling narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
As one of its achievements, Myanmar has been able to turn the
Mongla region in eastern Shan state into an opium-free zone and
efforts are being made to bring about more similar zones. The
country is working to totally eliminate poppy cultivation in 15
years.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia said here Monday it
would contribute one million Australian dollars (600,000 U.S.
dollars) to United Nations' emergency relief operation for
flood-hit areas in China.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce that the Australian government is to
provide additional assistance to flood-devastated areas of China,"
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the U.N. World Food Program's relief

the immediate and essential needs of the most vulnerable
communities in the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August, more than 2,000 people had been killed
and 5.6 million houses and 1.3 million hectares of crops had been
destroyed by China's worst floods since 1954.

HARBIN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite the heavy flooding this
summer, China's northernmost province, Heilongjiang, is expected
to reap 30.1 billion kg of grain this year, the third bumper
harvest in its history.
</P>
<P>
Rainstorms and floods inundated 74 state farms in Heilongjiang,
causing damage to more than 1.36 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Provincial agricultural experts attribute the anticipated good
harvest to a number of measures including more acreage for
high-yielding paddy rice and maize, increased government input for
grain production and the application of modern cultivation
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of these measures has helped increase grain-crop
output by 5.51 billion kg this year, a provincial agricultural
official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Major industrial sectors in
India saw a sharp fall in demand in the first six months of the
current fiscal year beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)
showed that a majority of Indian industries had less than 10
percent or negative growth rate in the first half of the fiscal
year 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The biggest slump had been experienced by the automobile sector
which saw a 41 percent dip in commercial vehicles production, 53
percent in middle and heavy commercial vehicles, 20 percent in
light commercial vehicle and three percent in cars, according to
the Financial Express daily here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, motor cycles experienced a 27 percent
growth in production during the period.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the basic goods sector also remained depressed with
only 2.5 percent increase in aluminum, 5.4 percent in cement, 5.2
percent in fertilizer but the production of cold rolled steel and
lead and lead alloy decreased 2.5 and 13 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the intermediate goods segment, production in polyester
staple fiber and polyester filament yarn grew 12.6 and 17.4
percent respectively while production in capital goods was low.

refrigerators (22 percent), air conditioners (30 percent) and
hardware (25 percent).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Berger: U.S.-Russia Ties Not to Be Affected by Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Sunday that possible air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) against Serbian targets will not affect its
relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
In "Late Edition" show of the Cable News Network (CNN), U.S.
President Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said "certainly we have to act in a way which we believe is in our
interest and in NATO's interest."
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that will affect our fundamental relationship
with Russia," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned a week ago that
NATO military strikes to force a settlement in Kosovo would mean a
return to the Cold War while a Russian general Saturday said that
Moscow could consider military cooperation with Yugoslavia if NATO
goes ahead with air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov played down any suggestion
of a renewed Cold War in an interview aired on Russian Television
on Sunday, but said it it could lead to international chaos.
</P>
<P>
Berger told the CNN that it was up to Yugoslavia's President
Slobodan Milosevic to avert NATO air strikes by complying with
U.N. demands to withdraw Serbian forces from Kosovo, to allow
humanitarian aid into the province and to begin talks with ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's court. He can come into
compliance or he can face military action by NATO," said Berger.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Sunday continued talks in
Belgrade into the night with Milosevic to try to resolve the
Kosovo crisis after hours of negotiations producing no
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
NATO is expected to issue an activation order on Monday for the
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that if military action is ordered, it would not be
"confined only Kosovo," suggesting that targets in whole Serbia
could be attacked.
</P>
<P>
He added that a monitoring mission will be needed if Belgrade
agrees to comply fully with the U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Milosevic complies over the next few days, next few
hours, it will obviously require some sort of a verification
mission on the ground to determine whether he is living up to
those promises," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the mission should be civilian, in
which the U.S. will not take part. "There may be some NATO role.
There will be no U.S. combat forces." he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Govt Urged to Probe Previous Regime's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government has
been urged to probe activities of the previous United National
Party (UNP) government concerning the funding to the rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the official Daily News
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has taken cognizance of an
appeal by government back benchers to initiate such a probe, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The back benchers have alleged that the UNP leadership had
provided millions of rupees, truck loads of arms and ammunition
and cement to the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
They said there are still leaders in the UNP who were also in
office during the administration of the late president Ranasinghe
Premadasa when arms and funds were donated to the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
General Sepala Attygala, former army commander and secretary to
the Ministry of Defense, had revealed that the quality of the
ammunition presented to the LTTE had not even been available to
the Sri Lanka army.
</P>
<P>
They had been supplied on the basis of a collective Cabinet
decision that the arms were meant for the armed forces. There had
been ten truck loads of self loading rifles, T-56 assault rifles
and Browning automatic pistols which were channeled to the LTTE
through the army.
</P>
<P>
The back benchers pointed out that what the UNP leaders had
done was unpatriotic and amounted to treason. Hence a commission
of inquiry to fully probe the allegations was urgently required.
</P>
<P>
The UNP leadership had supplied arms to the LTTE during the
latter's peace talks with the then government of president
Ranasinghe Premadasa to whom they gave assurances of cooperation
to get rid of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) who were
present in the north and east of Sri Lanka from August 1987 to
March 1990.
</P>
<P>
The IPKF came to Sri Lanka following a peace agreement signed
in July 1987 by former president J.R. Jayewardene and former
Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi to contain the Tamil rebels and
evolve a political solution to the country's ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, president Premadasa won his election on a pledge to
eject the IPKF from the country. To achieve this, he negotiated
with the LTTE and reached some agreements.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Provide Air Corridor to NATO in "Emergency" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Supreme National
Defense Council announced Sunday that Romania will grant access to
its airspace to NATO "in case of emergency."
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to a NATO request two days
ago asking Romania to provide air corridor for its possible
strikes against Yugoslavia, said Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu.
</P>
<P>
The council, composed of the president, prime minister, defense
minister, foreign minister and other key figures, met to discuss
the Kosovo situation and Romania's stand on possible NATO armed
intervention.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the council said Romania has all along
supported the efforts to settle the crisis through negotiations
while backing all measures to be taken by the international
community on the matter.
</P>
<P>
But as a neighbor of Yugoslavia, Romania will not directly
participate in any military actions there.
</P>
<P>
Romania is ready to send a humanitarian multi-function mobile
team to Yugoslavia to engage in medical relief, refugee
arrangement and housing rebuilding, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Dorin Marian, National Defense and State Security Advisor, told
the press that NATO's planes were to use Romanian airspace only
"in case of emergency" -- dangerous situation due to technical
breakdowns and inability to return to home bases for unexpected
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Romanian political parties were divided in their reaction to
the communique. Many appreciated the non-participation decision in
NATO military operation in Yugoslavia and considered it to be in
line with international practice to offer Romania's airspace to
NATO in emergency.
</P>
<P>
But others emphasized that Romania should not provide any help
to NATO by noting that to open airspace is equal to providing
logistic assistance to it.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- An international conference of
women in the 21st Century opened here Sunday with its focus on the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting "Transcending Boundaries to Sustainable Development
in Southeast Europe" was attended by 335 representatives of
non-governmental organizations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov said at the opening ceremony
that the developments in Kosovo were in the focus of the world
attention.
</P>
<P>
U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton, a special guest to the
conference, said "those of us with a voice and power to use must
speak out for the ethnic Albanians who are suffering in Kosovo. We
must speak out for the 250,000 people left without a home."
</P>
<P>
The lack of an effective civil society is at the root of the
problems in Kosovo, said Sonja Liht of the Open Society Foundation
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing atrocities in Kosovo, as people are being
killed, houses burnt and thousands of people are seeking refuge in
the mountains waiting for the world to intervene," said Mrs Lidra
Mejdani, wife of the Albanian president.
</P>
<P>
Antonina Stoyanova, wife of the Bulgarian president, said she
hopes this conference would help reach an agreement on the
principles of future development and contribute to establishing a

<HEADLINE> Individual Income Tax Increases in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- About 600,000 residents of
Shenzhen, south China, are now paying individual income tax,
contributing greatly to the government coffers.
</P>
<P>
When the special economic zone began to levy individual income
tax ten years ago, the tax was minimal, and only a small number of
people were required to pay it.
</P>
<P>
With the fast growth in people's income, individual income tax
payment nearly doubled between 1995 and 1997, making it the third
largest local tax category, behind only business tax and
enterprise income tax.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Shenzhen, with a permanent and
transient population of 3.5 million, collected 692 million yuan
(83.37 million U.S. dollars) in individual income tax. This amount
is expected to top 1.2 billion yuan for the entire year, a more
than 20 percent rise over last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.05 billion yuan collected in 1997, individual income
tax paid by foreigners accounted for 260 million yuan, or 25
percent. The local tax authorities promulgated rules to further
standardize collection to facilitate foreign tax payers this year.
</P>
<P>
Since more of the taxes are coming from income earned from
stock investments, the city also circulated a document concerning
this type of collection. Last year, the tax from stock-investment
income reached 130 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Cattle-born Diseases Hurt Thailand's Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Diseases brought across the
border by smuggled cattle have caused Thailand a loss of 20,000
million baht (500 million U.S. dollars) annually in revenue from
export of livestock and related products, according to Deputy
Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Somchai Sunthornwat.
</P>
<P>
Before 1995, over one million head of cattle were smuggled
across the border from Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia through 26 Thai
provinces, bringing with them foot and mouth disease and authrax.
</P>
<P>
The Livestock Development Department has failed to make the
country free of animal diseases due to the smuggling although a
program for this purpose has been launched for over 10 years
during which over 1,000 million baht (25 million U.S. dollars) has
been spent.
</P>
<P>
Many countries wanted to import livestock from Thailand, but
the uncontrollable spread of foot and mouth disease compelled them
to change their minds, causing Thailand to lose about 20,000
million baht (500 million U.S. dollars) annually in revenue,
Somchai was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan, in particular, wanted to import Thai pigs on condition
that they are free of disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to stop the spread of diseases across the
border, Thailand has set up eight border animal checkpoints where
imported cattle are put in quarantine and vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
Somchai said that his ministry intends to impose disease
control on all imported animals and make Thailand free of foot and
mouth disease by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Begin to Register Farm-Product Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Rice is rice. Rice with a brand
name may taste the same as other rice, but it sells at a higher
price. This is nothing new. But for Chinese farmers, it is.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Chinese farmers never bothered to register a brand
for their products, however things have changed quite a lot in
recent years, and local farmers are becoming more aware of the
importance of a registered brand.
</P>
<P>
"Under a market economy, even farm products have to register a
brand in order to compete with others," says Chen Chaojun, owner
of Dangyuan brand pears in Anhui Province, east China. Dangyuan
pears sell well, and at a 30 percent higher price than other pears.
</P>
<P>
In China, farmers have now registered as famous brands nearly
1,000 varieties of their farm products ranging from rice, wheat,
mushrooms, chickens, oranges and apples to garlic and crabs.
</P>
<P>
Farm products with registered brands normally sell better than
those without registered brands.
</P>
<P>
Brand registration for farm products has brought ideological
changes to Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
"People are wearing brand name clothes, and using brand
appliances and now we want them to eat brand name food," says Wang
Heji, a farmer who is applying to register the peanuts of his
hometown -- Guzhen County in Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
To assure good quality and freshness, farmers sometimes
transport their products by air. Crabs may be the largest
group of the air passengers in the country; they come mainly
from Jiangsu Province and are a favorite delicacy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local farmers know how to protect their interests
through legal procedures. Zhao Baoquan, owner of Shanhua brand
mushrooms, says that in the future he intends to sue anyone
selling fake Shanhua mushrooms.

BELGRADE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
said Sunday that his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan

Holbrooke met again Sunday with Milosevic, aiming to avert

there was nothing changed and the situation was still very serious.

resolution of the Kosovo crisis.

WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee
decided to shelf a plan to test for recreational drug use among
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Also striped from a revision of the committee's drug-test
rules was a proposal to tighten security around urine samples.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the USOC started unannounced, random drug
tests of residents at training centers in several American
cities.
</P>
<P>
The addition of recreational drugs such as marijuana and
cocaine to thetests would have formalized anti-doping efforts the
USOC takes only when specifically asked by member sports bodies.
</P>
<P>
The USOC is due to hear next April from a task force
investigating how to place all drug testing of American's
Olympic-level athletes to an independent agency.
</P>
<P>
The USOC is one of the few national Olympic groups that
conducts its own drug tests. The USOC wants to set up an

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank, Bank
Indonesia, announced that its gross foreign exchange reserves rose
to 21.5 billion U.S. dollars in the week ending October 7 from
20.5 billion U.S. dollars the previous week.
</P>
<P>
In its latest weekly report, the central bank said that the
increase was due to the disbursement of the International Monetary
Fund's fresh monthly loan of 936.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But its net international reserves (NIR) fell slightly to 13.94
billion U.S. dollars as of October 7 from 14.03 billion U.S.
dollars a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
The decline was mainly due to servicing the interest of the
government's foreign debt and selling U.S. dollars for rupiah to
sterilize liquidity in the wake of greater government spending,
the Jakarta Post Monday quoted the central bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the October 7 NIR level was still above the
International Monetary Fund's adjusted NIR target of 11.67 billion
U.S. dollars.

Meanwhile he emphasized the precondition for Hungary's

Orban noted he had made his stand clear both in his recent
visit to the United States and his telephone talks with Brussels,
where NATO Headquarters is based.
</P>

But he believed that Hungary will get NATO protection once it
suffers military revenge from Yugoslavia due to its cooperation
with the NATO.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria To Grant NATO Free Passage in East-West Direction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will grant the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) free passage through the
country's airspace in its possible air strikes against Yugoslavia,
Deputy Foreign Minister Marin Raikov said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, Bulgaria will grant NATO free air passage in the
East-West direction only, Raikov said, adding that the passage
will only be for aircraft that have already been to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Bulgaria will ask NATO for guarantees of its
national security on the basis of the Partnership for Peace
Framework Agreement and the Agreement between NATO members and the
states participating in Partnership for Peace, Raikov said.
</P>
<P>
According to Government Information Service, Prime Minister
Ivan Kostov Saturday received an official note from NATO
requesting for passage through Bulgarian airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government said that it believed there are still
chances for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Kostov said that Bulgaria will help only humanitarian
and logistic operations within the framework of NATO efforts to
impose and guarantee peace in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his country will not take part, directly or
indirectly, in any military actions in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Keep Tight Monetary Policy: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia will stick to
its tight monetary policy until worries over the rupiah exchange
rate and inflation truly subside, the Jakarta Post Monday quoted
bank director Achjar Iljas as saying.
</P>
<P>
Achjar said pressure on the rupiah would remain high until
local corporations with huge overseas debts managed to reschedule
their obligations, while primary pressure on inflation might come
from the expectation of higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The momentum is good, but we don't want to be too premature in
lowering interest rates. But if the current stable condition
continues, it will be enough for us to gradually lower the rates.
Our tight monetary policy is only temporary," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar
last week, ending at 9,050 rupiah Friday, compared with more than
10,000 rupiah last month and 15,000 rupiah in June.
</P>
<P>
Achjar attributed the rupiah appreciation to improving
sentiment in regional currencies following the strengthening of
the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"But is this sustainable? We're still observing. This is a good
opportunity, but we have to be careful because if we relax the
tight monetary condition it could create potential demand for
dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the more than 20 billion U.S. dollars in
the country's private sector overseas debt due this year presented
a huge potential demand for U.S. dollars, with accompanying
pressure on the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
If the interest rates were cut immediately amid the existing
huge potential demand for the U.S. dollars, the debtors would rush
to borrow the rupiah to purchase the U.S. dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
Achjar added that another important factor to watch was the
inflation rate which had started to decrease but "is it
sustainable?"
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics announced last week that the
inflation rate for September was 3.75 percent compared with 6.30
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
"How can this trend be maintained? It all depends on food
supply, distribution and political stability," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Panel Increases Athlete Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee
has decided to put up 18 million U.S. dollars to boost American
athletes to win more medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
The money was budgeted Saturday as the board met in Phoenix
and approved its budget through 2002.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be directed to the USOC's Podium 2002 program,
designed to foster athlete development, said USOC Executive
Director Dick Schultz.
</P>
<P>
"We're really excited about this," Schultz said. "This is a
new way of doing things for the U.S. Olympic Committee."
</P>
<P>
The United States won 13 medals at the 1994 Winter Games at
Lillehammer, and equaled that total at Nagano, Japan, last winter.
</P>
<P>
Schultz said:"Our program is going in the wrong direction." To
keep and increase public support, the United States must win more
medals, he added.
</P>
<P>
Before the directors approved the budget, the Podium 2002
program had already planned to spend 3.4 million U.S. dollars,
most of it on direct athlete support, Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
Theremaining 14.6 million will go to the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Terror for Indonesian Activist Working With Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The terror for the Indonesian
activist working with rape victims of May riots continued Sunday
with the news that the house of a fellow activist was broken into
by a group of men, the Indonesian Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hajjah Sundus A. Salim, fellow activist of the Team of
Volunteers for Humanity, was quoted as saying that the men stole
her son's motorcycle after she received two threats over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
The new terror follows the death of Martadinata, also known as
Ita, the 18-year-old daughter of an activist with the Team of
Volunteers for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
The victim was found with her neck slashed and stab wounds on
her hands, abdomen and chest Friday by her parents at their home
in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators Sunday insisted the incident had been a
purely criminal act.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Jakarta Police Chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho
Djajoesman said police had arrested Suryadi, a 20-year-old
neighbor of the victim.
</P>
<P>
"He (Suryadi) committed the crime because he wanted to steal
some money to help his parents," said Noegroho, adding that the
motive of the violent crime was criminal, and not politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid and Human Rights
Association Paskah Irianto said Sunday that he believed Ita was
one of the rape victims of the May riots.
</P>
<P>
He said Ita was about to recount her assault in the United
States in the next few days. "I think that for her safety, Ita was
named a volunteer who would accompany the rape victims to testify
in the U.S.," he added.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers team coordinator Sandyawan Sumardi told the Jakarta
Post that he did not know for sure if Ita was a rape victim.
</P>
<P>
"But, to be frank, I also suspected that Ita was a rape victim.
How could a girl her age accompany rape victims? What is her role
in the planned journey to the U.S. if she was not a victim?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Ita's death, several activists complained of
continuous terrorization, including threats of possible physical
and sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
Both Ita and her mother had been involved in providing
counseling and assistance for many ethnic-Chinese Indonesian women
raped during last May's riots in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian workers had speculated that the brutal murder of
the activist was an attempt to cow them into silence.
</P>
<P>
"The killing was done to warn the activists not to go further
with their investigation," said Ester Indahyani Jusuf Lubis,
chairwoman of Solidaritas Nusa Bangsa, which was formed in June to
fight racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Although she admitted the murder was a terrible blow to the
activists, Ester vowed to continue with her work to uncover facts
behind the May riots, which left about 1,200 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a gathering of more than 5,000 people in
Central Jakarta Sunday, Abdurrahman Wahid, general chairman of the
Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country's largest Muslim organization,
deplored the murder of Ita, saying it was "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
"Why does one have to be murdered just because one wanted to
testify? We reject such inhumane means. We are a civilized
nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Team of Volunteers for Humanity was the first organization
to raise the alarm about the systematic gang-rapes during the May
riots. Led by Catholic priest Sandyawan Sumardi, the
non-governmental organization reported to the National Commission
on Human Rights in July that at least 168 women and children were
raped or sexually abused during the riots in Jakarta and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
The government established a team in July which includes
representatives from the Armed Forces (ABRI), government agencies,
the rights body and non-governmental organizations to investigate
allegations that the riots were masterminded. The team is expected
to complete its task later this month.
</P>
<P>
National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said in August that
some non-governmental organizations were exaggerating reports of
rapes and sexual assaults against Chinese-Indonesian women during
the riots.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander Gen. Wiranto has also repeatedly
said that ABRI had found no evidence to substantiate the claims.

<HEADLINE> French Alstom Provides Subway Trains for Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Alstom, a major French
transportation equipment supplier, is helping to build the subway
system in Shanghai, China's largest industrial center.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort came when a letter of intent was signed
recently between Alstom and a local subway construction company,
on the supply of equipment valued at 200 million U.S. dollars for
the third subway line of a viaduct in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the pact, Alstom will provide 24 subway trains,
each with six cars, which are said to cost less in electricity and
maintenance and will be put into operation by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The subway project is expected to ease the increasing traffic
pressure in the largest metropolitan area in China.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Bilger, Alstom's president, said that his company's
development in China has been further promoted by the Shanghai
project. He hoped that Alstom would undertake more subway projects
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alstom has already provided nearly a third of China's imported
locomotives, and now has 3,500 employees working in China.

<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- President Joseph Estrada began his state visit to Singapore.
He told thousands of cheering Filipinos working in Singapore upon

<P>

<P>
-- Resurrected Philippine Airlines is preparing to take off for
foreign skies again this week, but may avoid using leased jumbo

there.

Business Daily:
</P>
<P>
-- The central bank of the Philippines is projected to incur a
net loss of 1.68 billion pesos (38.6 million U.S. dollars at

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne in Clinic over Alcohol Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- English Premier club
Middlesbrough admitted on Sunday that Paul Gascoigne spent the
weekend in a specialist clinic.
</P>
<P>
The England midfielder checked into the clinic last week after
the latest in a series of high profile drink-related incidents.
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows Saturday's confirmation from manager
Bryan Robson that Gascoigne is suffering from stress and alcohol
problems.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough spokesman Dave Allan said: "Bryan Robson regards
him as a friend as well as a player. Everyone at the football
club wants to do their best for Gascoigne.
</P>
<P>
"Gascoigne will remain away from the club while the clinic
staff consider his symptoms. The club will be guided by their
advice over his welfare."
</P>
<P>
Robson's revelation that Gascoigne was in trouble followed
newspaper reports which claimed the player returned from a trip
to the Republic of Ireland with a facial injury after falling
over while drunk.
</P>
<P>
"Gazza has got a problem. It's been building up for quite a
few years. Everybody keeps talking about the drink and it's a
little bit of that because he does get down at times," said
Robson.
</P>
<P>
"People talk about stress in football and Gazza, in all the
years I've been in football, has had more of a high profile than
anybody I've ever known."
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne joined Middlesbrough from Glasgow Rangers late last
season and played a part as they won promotion back to the FA
Premier League.
</P>
<P>
But problems have mounted this year with divorce from his
wife, the death of a friend and his omission from England's 22
for the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Paul Merson, a recovering alcoholic, left Middlesbrough for
Aston Villa earlier this season after claiming that a culture of
drinking at the club was too much of a temptation to him.

<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- English Premier club Newcastle
United is involved in 150 million pound (256.7 million U.S.
dollars) takeover talks with a media-based company, according to
local reports on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Mail On Sunday said negotiations were at an advanced stage
and that "the conviction now on Tyneside is that a deal to buy
control of Newcastle from Douglas Hall, who owns a majority
stake, is imminent".
</P>
<P>
Speculation has been rife that Newcastle and other quoted
clubs are heading for takeover bids ever since satellite
broadcaster BSkyB made its billion dollar bid last month for top
club Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports have suggested a variety of companies are
interested in Newcastle, including Cable &AMP; Wireless
Communications Plc and TeleWest Communications Plc.
</P>
<P>
Four weeks ago Japan's Sony denied a report that it had
offered 220 million pounds for the club.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Sweep Chicago Marathon Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Ondoro Osoro, who had never
run a marathon before, led a Kenya's title sweep in Chicago
Marathon race Sunday and registered the third fastest time in
history in 2 hours,6 minutes and 54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Osoro, a former cross-country runner, finished the race 49
seconds outside the world best time set by Ronaldo Da Costa at
last month's Berlin Marathon.
</P>
<P>
Joyce Chepchumba, London Marathon winner last year, grabbed
the women's title for Kenya with a personal best of 2:23:57.
</P>
<P>
"It was my first marathon and I think I'm very happy," Osoro
said. "I must be a lucky man today, running for the first time
and running very well."
</P>
<P>
Osoco didn't surge to the leading position until the last mile
where he rolled over Moroccan defending champion Khalid
Khannouchi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan missed competitions for almost two years after a
car accident in 1995. He set records for debut, and broke the
course record of 2:07:10, set by Khannouchi last year.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Anticipates Record Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a heavy
industrial base in northeast China, expects to produce 17.5
billion kg of grain this year, according to the provincial
agricultural bureau.
</P>
<P>
The projected output will surpass the 1993 record by some 500
million kg.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated good harvest in spite of difficulties caused by
bad weather has been attributed to increased funding which has
improved production conditions.
</P>
<P>
Other factors for the expected harvest include reform of
traditional farming methods, the promotion of practical agronomic
techniques, the use of new crop varieties and expanded training
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government allocated 2.11 billion yuan to build
a number of irrigation facilities for spring planting this year
when there was a severe drought.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.91 million farmers have participated in various
agronomic training courses since last winter, laying a solid
foundation for the further development of agriculture in the
province.
