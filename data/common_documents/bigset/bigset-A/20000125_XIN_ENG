BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- World soccer's governing body
FIFA has decided to located its multi-million dollar Hall of
Champions in London instead of Paris, FIFA secretary general
Michel Zen-Ruffinen said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We were left with two choices -- either Zurich, which is the
headquarters of FIFA, or London which is, of course, the capital
city of the country that invented soccer," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only logical choice was London as there are many more
people there and who go there to visit," Zen-ruffinen said. "The
British government and English Football Association have given us
their absolute and total support for the scheme."
</P>
<P>
He added that FIFA had looked at six buildings in London and
was on the verge of signing a contract with one of them, which he
described as having "a perfect location in the very heart of
London."

<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Honda will return to the Formula
One racing circuit for the first time in seven years as the
Japanese company and British American Racing (BAR) unveiled their
new car here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new BAR Honda 002 will be driven by former world champion
Jacques Villeneuve of Canada and Ricardo Zonta of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Honda will be competing in Formula One for a third spell after
1964-68 when it was a team in its own right and 1983-92 when it
supplied engines.
</P>
<P>
The team, founded as Tyrrell in 1960, has scored 33 victories
and secured three world drivers championships, through Jackie
Stewart in 1969, 1970 and 1971. It also won the constructors'
title in 1971.
</P>
<P>
When Stewart left, Tyrrell's glory years went with him and the
team were taken over by BAR in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Villenueve had a disappointing year with BAR last year and
still seems a long way off reproducing his form of 1997 when he
won the driver's championship in the last race of the year holding
off Germany's Michael Schumacher.

DALIAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The northeast China port city of
Dalian has begun allocating portions of its 10 million yuan (about
1.2 million U.S. dollars) talent fund.
</P>
<P>
Few cities in China have such a fund, and none of them is as
large as Dalian's.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bo Xilai said that economic development today largely
depends on technology and talented personnel, and the local
government will allocate more to introduce talents into the city.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to attract talented people who have
finished their studies abroad, provide academic exchange and
professional training opportunities, aid scientific research
projects, and improve the living conditions of those recruited,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
China is in great need of a large number of qualified personnel
in all economic sectors, while the limited scientific research
environment and slow economic development in some areas has
resulted in a lack of human resources.
</P>
<P>
Dalian intends to develop a growing pool of talent, the mayor
said.

LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Togo held 1992 champion Cote d'
Ivoire to a 1-1 tie on Monday in their 22nd African Nations Cup
opening match in Accra, co-host Ghana's capital.
</P>
<P>
The Ivorians took the lead through a 37th minute penalty, after
France-based Ibrahima Bakayoko was brought down in the Togolese
box, during a period of sustained pressure from the Elephants of
Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
Even though the Togolese rallied soon to fight back, the first
half belonged to the Ivorians who dominated and remained camped
near the Togolese penalty box for long periods.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Cote d'Ivoire, with nine foreign-based players in its
starting line-up, did most of the attacking in the first half hour
but failed to convert their domination into goals.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Togolese strengthened their indomitable
fighting back and were soon rewarded with an equalizer in the 61st
minute.
</P>
<P>
The goal was scored by Togolese Swiss-based Lantame Ouadja,
when he collected an excellent cross from his colleague, France-
based full-back, Yao Senaya.
</P>
<P>
The second tie in Accra's national stadium after the first on
Saturday between Ghana and Cameroon in the tournament's first
match put all the nations in Group A on an equal ground with a
point for each.
</P>
<P>
The Cote d'Ivoire is to play Cameroon on Friday, while the
Ghana is to fight Togo Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Plays Scoreless Tie with DR Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Neither Algeria nor DR Congo
scored a single goal for a 0-0 draw in the second Group B match of
the African Nations Cup in Kumasi, a Northwest city of co-host
Ghana on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Algerians nearly took the lead as early as the third minute
but the Congolese goalie came off his line to block the goal-bound
shot, according to reports reaching here from Kumasi.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are now second in the group behind South Africa, who
won the group's opening game 3-1 against Gabon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At African Nations Cup '98 in Burkina Faso, the DR Congo had
reached the semi finals against all expectations before losing in
extra-time to South Africa
</P>
<P>
Algeria sadly exited at the first round in the last Cup
competitions, though she was the 1999 cup champion.
</P>
<P>
DR Congo is to play again on Thursday against South Africa
while Algeria will meet Gabon on Saturday. Both matches will be
played in Kumasi.

<HEADLINE> Keegan has Final Say on Stadium Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, Janaury 24 (Xinhua) -- Adam Crozier, new chief
executive of the Football Association of England, has handed coach
Kevin Keegan the final decision on where England play their World
Cup qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive told BBC Radio 5 Live that Keegan was "a
terrific manager" and had his full backing.
</P>
<P>
With Wembley unavailable due to rebuilding, Crozier said the 14
proposed venues for the 2006 World Cup would all be offered a
chance to bid for the four matches.
</P>
<P>
Keegan wants to play at Anfield and St James Park, while Old
Trafford, Villa Park and Elland Road are favourites for the other
two games.
</P>
<P>
"We'll talk to each of the clubs concerned over the next ten
days," said Crozier.
</P>
<P>
"The decision will rest with Kevin at that point because the
most important thing is that we play at the places we think we
have the most chance of winning."
</P>
<P>
Crozier also insisted that Keegan would have the final say on
who he picked for upcoming squads, despite a recent series of
disciplinary incidents on and off the pitch.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to let it rest with him because he's very grown up
about it. He realises that the image we portray is very important,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Billionare Heisley to Buy Grizzlies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The future of the NBA in
Vancouver, Canada, apparently became a whole lot brighter today.
</P>
<P>
ESPN is reporting that the Grizzlies found another buyer today
in Chicago billionaire Michael Heisley, just four days after
discount department store magnate Bill Laurie terminated his
agreement to buy the club.
</P>
<P>
Laurie was expected to move the NBA team to his hometown of St.
Louis, but Heisley, who has done extensive business in Canada and
made his fortune by purchasing and then rebuilding companies,
likely plans to keep the team in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
In October, Laurie was very close to buying the Grizzlies from
Orca Bay chairman John McCaw and moving the team to St. Louis.
However, the deal provided a two-year window for Vancouver's fans
to prevent relocation by showing their support.
</P>
<P>
The NBA's finance committee felt that time frame was not long
enough and tabled a vote on the sale agreement by the Board of
Governors.
</P>
<P>
Discussions between Laurie and McCaw broke down last week, when
Orca Bay reportedly threatened Laurie with a multi-million dollar
fine should he pull out of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The potential sale to Heisley would be news for celebration in
Vancouver, which hopes to keep its team sagging attendance. The
Grizzles are averaging 13,298 fans per game at GM Place, the
second-lowest total in the league, and are last in the Midwest
Division with a 10-29 record.
</P>
<P>
A similar situation arose several years ago in Minnesota, where
ownership considered selling the Timberwolves to a group that
planned to relocate the team to New Orleans. Local businessman
Glen Taylor stepped forward and with the help of a new facility in
the Target Center, bought the team and kept it in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
The NBA has not had a team switch since the Kings moved from
Kansas City to Sacramento in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Warns of Israeli Nuclear Program's Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League's committee on
observing Israeli nuclear activity warned anew of the danger of the
Israeli nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The committee issued a statement on Monday, calling on all
countries of the region, including Israel, to join the
International Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli nuclear program poses a direct threat to regional
security, said the committee, urging NPT signatories to make
efforts to involve Israel in the treaty, aimed ultimately to turn
the Middle East into a nuclear-free region.
</P>
<P>
Israel neither admits nor denies that it has nuclear weapons.
But it is widely to have a significant stockpile of nuclear
weapons, and refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty and
rejects international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said Israel has equipped its newly-acquired
submarine with nuclear warhead, which alarmed its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Knesset (parliament) is expected to hold an
unprecedented open debate in the near future on the country's
nuclear capacity.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Sees Record Power Output in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's power sector recorded a
record annual output figure last year, the Saigon Times Daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's total power generation in 1999 reached 23,739.2
million kilowatt hours, 1.36 percent above the target and a 9.57
percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hydro-generation by the State Power Utility Electricity of
Vietnam (EVN) accounted for 58.3 percent of the total output, coal
12.26 percent, gas 14.49 percent and oil 2.82 percent. Non-
corparation sources supplied 6.36 percent, or 1,484.8 million
kilowatt hours.
</P>
<P>
The better figures were due to regular rain which helped raise
hydro-generation, as well as lower-than-expected power consumption
for production, the Saigon Times Daily quoted EVN's general
director Hoang Trung Hai as saying.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Wait to See U.N. Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban's Foreign
Minister Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil said Monday that the militia were
waiting to see possible new steps taken by the United Nations for
peace in his country.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the new U.N. envoy to come to the region
and we will see whether he has any new proposal or innovative idea,
" he told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has recently appointed Frances Vendrell of
Spain as the U.N. secretary-general's new envoy for Afghanistan,
who is expected to visit the region early next month.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil called for the exclusion of the United States and
Russia from the U.N. group on Afghanistan, known as "Six Plus Two,
" which is composed of Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors as
well as the two powers.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official, who is on a three-day visit to Pakistan,
said the United States is blocking recognition of the Taliban
government by the international community.
</P>
<P>
On issues back in Afghanistan, Mutawakil listed human rights,
narcotics and terrorism as the three problems faced by the Taliban
government.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban had never opposed women education. "It is
paucity of resources which is main hindrance in female education."
</P>
<P>
Referring to his talks with Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul
Sattar on Monday, Mutawakil said the talks covered bilateral and
regional issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
He said the head of Taliban's ruling Council, Mulla Muhammad
Rabbani, would be visiting Pakistan soon, and hoped that the issue
of transit trade would be sorted out during his trip.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the Taliban's relations with Iran,
he said there has been no progress in the political relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban wanted to have friendly relations with all
neighboring countries including Iran, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Leader Says Strikes Will  Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairperson of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party Begum Khaleda Zia Monday told the business
community that the opposition will continue to call hartals (
general strikes) to oust the government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of a two-day conference
sponsored by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (FBCCI), Khaleda Zia, leader of the opposition in
parliament, asked the businessmen to join her "one-point oust-
government movement."
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
offer to resolve any political difference through discussion,
Khaleda Zia said: "It is too late to discuss with the government."
</P>
<P>
The only way out for the government is now to resign, she said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session, President of the Bangladesh Garments
Manufacturers and Exporters Association Rahman Sinha said that "
the people in fact do not support hartal."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Khaleda Zia to announce that no more hartal will
be called.
</P>
<P>
Former FBCCI president Yusuf Abdullah Harun said hartal, a
panic for people and nightmare for businessmen, will breed more
loan defaulters in the country.
</P>
<P>
He proposed setting up a national economic consensus forum
comprising representatives of the government, the opposition and
the business community to settle national economic issues.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Myanmar Gunmen Attack Thai Hospital,  Taking 500 Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of 10 gunmen from a
Myanmar ethnic Karen guerrilla faction stormed a provincial
hospital in Thailand earlier on Monday, taking more than 500
medical staff and patients hostage, the Independent Television (
ITV) reported.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, wearing camouflage and masks and armed with assault
rifles and hand grenades, were seen firing guns in the air and
planted a bomb near the entrance to the 770-bed hospital, which is
in the western province of Rachaburi, some 120 kilometers west of
Bangkok and 48 kilometers east of the Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
The armed guerrillas were believed to have hijacked a bus near
the border and forced the driver to take them to downtown
Rachaburi, where they captured the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 people were released by the gunmen, some in exchange
for food, and more than 100 people escaped from the hospital
compound.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualties in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen had asked the Thai government to provide them with
two helicopters and send one person as hostage with them to
guarantee a safe passage to the Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
ITV reported that the gunmen also asked for communication
facilities to get in touch with their group.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is said to be considering the demands of
the gunmen, but there is no sign of an immediate end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the armed guerrillas had demanded that
Thailand stop shelling their base on the border, send doctors and
nurses to treat their wounded fighters and open the border to
allow "God's Army" to seek refuge in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The armed guerrillas also demanded that the Thai government not
support Yangon on its current crackdown on the ethnic Karen rebels
along the Thai-Myanmar border and asked the international
community to put pressure on the Myanmar government to stop the
fighting and allow the Karen refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government reportedly began a drive against Karen
rebels recently. Heavy fighting had driven some 1,000 Karen
refugees into neighboring Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai troops also tightened their border surveillance to
prevent the fighting from spilling over to Thai soil.
</P>
<P>
Surayut Chulanont, the Thai Army Commander-in-Chief, had agreed
to the initial demands of the gunmen by ordering his troops to
stop shelling and agreeing to the refugees' entry into Thailand
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai government has vowed to take tough actions
against the armed men, believed to be from a Karen splinter group
known as "God's Army," a band of about 100 fighters which broke
away from Myanmar's Karen National Union ethnic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
A national security meeting was held in Bangkok Monday
afternoon. However, officials attending the meeting refused to
give any comment.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Pasong Sonsiri, the prime minister's
national security adviser, strongly condemned the incident as an "
international terrorist act," saying it is against both Thai and
international laws and violates the sovereignty of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The hospital attack awoke Thai people's recent memory of a
similar seizure of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok by five Myanmar
students last October.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, the five heavily-armed students took over and was
holed up in the embassy for 25 hours, holding 38 people hostage
and trapping 96 others in the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
They were later given safe passage to the Thai-Myanmar border
in exchange for the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Thailand has vowed to arrest the five students and
has been screening recent refugees to find them.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that God's Army has been providing shelter for
the five students after they escaped to the Myanmar side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether any of the five students was among the
10 gunmen, who staged the hospital seizure drama Monday.

BANGKOK -- The 10 Karen gunmen who stormed a provincial
hospital in Thailand earlier on Monday had asked the Thai
government to provide them with two helicopters and send one
person as hostage with them to the Thai-Myanmar border, the local
ITV news network reported.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen also asked for communication facilities in order to
get in touch with their group.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen are believed to be from a Karen splinter group known
as "God's Army," a band of about 100 fighters which broke away
from Myanmar's Karen National Union ethnic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Thai government is considering the
gunmen's new demands.
</P>
<P>
A group of about 10 armed men, wearing camouflage and masks and
carrying assault rifles and hand grenades, attacked Rachaburi
Hospital in the western Rachaburi province, some 120 kilometers
west of Bangkok and 48 kilometers east of the border to Myanmar.

NANJING -- People from all walks of life including survivors
and relatives of victims of the Nanjing Massacre gathered in
Nanjing today to denounce the Japanese right-wing anti-China
gathering in Osaka on January 23 and unfair judgment concerning
Azuma Shiro by Japan's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In heavy snow, there were more than 500 people standing in
silent tribute at the square in front of the Memorial Hall to
Victims of the Nanjing Massacre. Hundreds of students held banners
and streamers with their signatures and the words: "The Nanjing
Massacre is an irrefutable fact. The atrocities committed by
Japanese soldiers cannot be denied."
</P>
<P>
Xu Huiling, the city's vice mayor, said that the anti-China
rally organized by Japan's right-wing forces at the International
Peace Center in Osaka on January 23 attempted to whitewash the
Nanjing Massacre and deny any aggression by the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The real purpose of the Osaka gathering, said Xu, was to
enforce right-wing's anti-China activities and to whitewash war
crimes committed by Japanese invaders. (China-Japan-Nanjing

JERUSALEM -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams on
interim issues held another meeting here Monday, but nothing has
been decided.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran told reporters after the
meeting that issues such as Israel's next troop withdrawal from
the West Bank, release of more Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails and economic cooperation between the two sides were
discussed in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two teams addressed all these issues, but no progress was
made, Eran said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's next troop redeployment, he said that
Israel has never agreed to hand over Abu Dis, an Arab village hard
by East Jerusalem, to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He added that the maps on Israel's withdrawal has not been
finalized yet and the next troop redeployment could be further
delayed for some time.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed last September,
Israel had to carry out its third troop withdrawal from another 6.
1 percent of the West Bank territories on January 20. But the
pullback has been postponed due to the differences over which
areas that Israelis have to transfer. (Israel-Palestinians-

<HEADLINE> Thai Hostage Drama Ends With Nine Gunmen Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Nine out of the 10 gunmen, who
seized a provincial Thai hospital on Monday, were killed by Thai
forces Tuesday, thus bringing to an end the 24-hour hostage drama,
Thai officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 hostages trapped in the hospital in the western
province of Rachaburi are all safe and have left the hospital, the
Independent Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The army and police have confirmed that one gunman was missing
in the action while two Thai policemen were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is pursuing the missing gunman and has vowed to bring
him to justice if he is arrested.
</P>
<P>
Thai military and police forces stormed the hospital taken over
Monday by the 10 gunmen, believed to be from a Myanmar ethnic
Karen guerrilla splinter group called "God's Army," early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear how many Thai servicemen had taken part
in the assault, but witnesses saw trucks and jeeps filled with
policemen and soldiers speeding into the hospital before the
action.
</P>
<P>
Thai government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart confirmed the
successful assault, saying the government had worked out the plan
of action Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The government had agreed to consider the demands by the gunmen
to buy time for the preparation of the action, he said.
</P>
<P>
Near midnight Monday, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and
Supreme Commander Mongkon Ampornpisit went to Rachaburi Province,
bordering Myanmar, to direct the negotiation and the assault.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had earlier condemned the seizure of the hospital as
an"international terrorist act," which is against Thai and
international laws and violates the sovereignty of the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader on Power Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar military leader Senior-
General Than Shwe Monday stressed the need to avoid head-on
confrontation with any organization in the transfer of state power
some day.
</P>
<P>
"The government, being the Tatmataw (military) government, has
entertained the conviction which is concerned with and can be
accepted by the entire people so as not to cause head-on
confrontation with any organization or any party with the aim of
transferring the duties of state into the hands of national people
some day," Than Shwe, chairman of the ruling Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council, said when addressing trainees here of the
University for Development of National Races.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, who is also the country's prime minister, admitted
that Myanmar lagged behind in development for various reasons,
saying the government is striving to achieve development of the
state and enable the nation to keep abreast of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has managed to build national
solidarity again, emphasizing that the union spirit is the spirit
of striving for prosperity of the union.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military government took over the power of state on
September 18, 1988, when the country was at the height of a
political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Later on May 27, 1990, the military government sponsored a
multi-party general election with a declaration to transfer back
the state power to an elected government.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Opposition Against Conscription to Fight Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
United National Party (UNP) has voiced strong resistance against
conscription as a way to fight the separatist Tamil rebels, party
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNP would oppose any attempt to enforce legislation to make
military service compulsory, the sources said, citing the party's
leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
</P>
<P>
During a party meeting on Monday, Wickremesinghe also accused
the government of taking cover under the long-running ethnic war
to hide the shortcomings of a controversial devolution package.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels have
rejected the devolution package.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe said that in the event that the government
submits the devolution package and then seeks to conscript youths
to fight the LTTE rebels, his party would oppose the move in the
strongest possible way.
</P>
<P>
He said he opposes moves to wage war to hide the fact that the
government's devolution package had failed.
</P>
<P>
The government unveiled the devolution package in 1995 in a bid
to resolve the ethnic war since 1983 between government troops and
LTTE rebels who are fighting for independence for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The package has been stalled in the parliament for lack of a
two-third majority due to the opposition of the UNP.
</P>
<P>
However, Wickremesinghe said last Wednesday that his party
supports the government's package with reservations.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand is that this (ethnic) problem cannot be solved by
the process you intend taking to resolve this issue. But, since
you don't have any other solution we would not block the process,"
he said in a letter to President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said there were no moves to make military
service compulsory at the moment. However, they said the army
headquarters was making arrangements to recruit at least 15,000
youths next month.

<HEADLINE> Five Thai Officers Injured in Hospital Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- At least five Thai police and
military officers were injured in Tuesday's action against the
Myanmar ethnic guerrillas who took over a hospital in the western
province of Rachaburi Monday, the Independent Television (ITV)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the five officers, two are seriously injured during the
operation Tuesday morning, which killed nine out of the 10 gunmen,
who took over the hospital Monday, and ended the 22-hour hostage
drama, said ITV, which is conducting a non-stop coverage of the
story.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 hostages trapped in the hospital are all safe and some
have left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Fresh doctors and nurses have been sent to the hospital to
replace their exhausted colleagues to treat the patients remaining
inside while the police and the armed forces have begun clearing
the site.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the gunmen had planted landmines and bombs
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The army and police have confirmed that one gunman was missing
in the action.
</P>
<P>
Thai forces are pursuing the missing gunman and have vowed to
bring him to justice once he is caught.
</P>
<P>
Thai military and police forces stormed the hospital at about 5:
30 a.m. Tuesday morning (2230 GMT Monday).
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear how many Thai servicemen have taken part
in the assault, but witnesses saw trucks and jeeps filled with
policemen and soldiers speeding into the hospital before the
action.
</P>
<P>
Thai government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart confirmed the
report about the successful assault, saying the government had
worked out the plan of action Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The government had agreed to consider the demands set forth by
the gunmen, believed to be from a Myanmar ethnic Karen guerrilla
splinter group called "God's Army," to buy time for the
preparation of the action, he said.
</P>
<P>
Near midnight Monday, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and
Supreme Commander Mongkon Ampornpisit went to the site in
Rachaburi Province, bordering Myanmar, to direct the negotiation
and the assault.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said after Thailand's successful assault that a barbaric
attack on a hospital like what the gunmen did had not happened in
Thailand in the past.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist act should be condemned by every country in the
world and would by no means be accepted by most Thai people as
well as the international community, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had earlier denounced the seizure as an "international
terrorist act," which it said is against Thai and international
laws and violates the sovereignty of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also complained about Thailand's awkward situation as a
result of the constant fighting between Myanmar government troops
and ethnic Karen rebels, who are living near the Thai-Myanmar
border.
</P>
<P>
Recent fighting has driven about 1,000 Karen refugees into Thai
territory.
</P>
<P>
The 10 gunmen seized the hospital partly out of their
dissatisfaction with Thailand's tightened border control to
prevent Karen fighters from entering the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Reports on Hijacking of Indian Airliner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The much-awaited probe report
on the hijacking of an Indian Airlines passenger jet was handed
over to the Nepalese Tourism Ministry Monday, The Kathmandu Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report was presented by a Nepalese probe committee to
Minister for Civil Aviation Bijaya Kumar Gachchhadar, who, however,
refused to disclose any details of the report to reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I will present the report to the cabinet during the scheduled
meeting on Thursday and will decide when we will make the
recommendation public and how we are going to implement it," the
English daily quoted Gachchhadar as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Since the report is related to national security and is also a
sensitive issue, its contents will be revealed only after being
studied and discussed by the Ministers' Council," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The probe committee, headed by former police chief Hem Bahadur
Singh, was formed immediately after the hijacking of the Indian
jet on December 24 to investigate and report back within 15 days
the circumstances leading to the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
However the committee had been given a time extension to
complete their work.
</P>
<P>
Singh said the 63-page report recommended a review of the
security system at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) to
make it more efficient in keeping with the demand of the times.
</P>
<P>
"The recommendations also include points for immediate
implementation and for the long term as well to make the TIA's
security arrangement more reliable and trustworthy," said Singh.
</P>
<P>
The investigators had interrogated police, customs and
immigration officials who were on duty when the Indian plane took
off from the TIA. Not a single person in Nepal has been detained
or arrested in connection with the hijacking case so far.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines Flight 814 was hijacked some 40 minutes
after it took off from the TIA in Kathmandu on Christmas Eve.
About 160 passengers were held hostage for eight days in Kandahar
of Afghanistan before they were released on December 31.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Takes Urgent Measures to Combat Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has taken urgent
measures to combat an outbreak of malaria which is fast spreading
in villages of North Central Province, the Ministry of Health said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures taken is the implementation of mobile

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian firm has reached a
production-sharing contract with the Myanmar energy authorities to
explore and produce oil and natural gas in the country's western
Pyay region.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed here Monday between the Prime

Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise of the Ministry of Energy, the
undertakings are to be carried out on an inland block in Shwedaung

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Manufacturing Grows in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's manufacturing
sector registered an average growth of 11.9 percent in the first
11 months of 1999, against a contraction of 13.7 percent in 1998,
it was officially announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The strong rebound in the performance of the manufacturing
sector led the recovery of the Malaysian economy in 1999 when real
gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to be more than 4 percent,
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said at an
annual press conference on the performance of the sector.
</P>
<P>
Most of the industrial sub-sectors recorded strong output
growth,she said, adding that transport equipment, electronics,
chemicals and chemical products, food manufacturing and basic
metals production also achieved double-digit increases.
</P>
<P>
She said exports of manufactured goods amounted to 237 billion
ringgit (62.368 billion U.S. dollars) for the period, against 232.
8 billion ringgit (61.263 billion dollars) for the whole of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said the performance of the manufacturing sector as
reflected in the trend of applications and approvals had remained
encouraging in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, she said, a total of 747 applications for
manufacturing projects were received, up 2.9 percent, with
investments totaling 14.029 billion ringgit (3.692 billion dollars)
, against 726 applications with investments totaling 18.914
billion ringgit (4.977 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total investments registered a 25.8-percent decline due to a
smaller number of applications received in the capital-intensive
category, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said foreign investments continued to account for a major
portion of the investments with a total of 482 applications
received with foreign participation for investments amounting to 9.
039 billion ringgit (2.378 billion dollars), accounting for 64.4
percent of the total investments in applications received in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign investments declined 28.8 percent in
comparison with 1998 mainly due to lower levels of investments
received for expansion and diversification projects, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it has been the policy of the government to
promote investments in the manufacturing sector that can
strengthen international competitiveness and value-added.

<HEADLINE> Cleanup of Ruined Danube Bridges to Cost 24 Million Euros: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Work on clearing three of the
bombed bridges from the Danube River in Yugoslavia will cost 24.1
million euros (24.4 million U.S. dollars), according to a document
presented here Monday to the Danube Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a Budapest-based, 11-member body made up of
countries through which the river flows, will send the document to
the European Commission in Brussels after it is formally approved,
officials told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The document was prepared jointly by Hungarian and Austrian
experts with the assistance of Yugoslav experts, said State
Secretary Nemeth Zsolt of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Nemeth said he hoped the European Union (EU) could provide the
required support for the clean-up operation.
</P>
<P>
The document only covers waterway clearing, he said, adding
that the Danube Commission does not deal with any aspect of the
reconstruction of the ruined bridges.
</P>
<P>
Hellmuth Strasser, president of the Danube Commission, said the
document is an important step in the efforts to resume
international shipping on the river.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Hungary and Austria will spend up to
three months  removing the wreckage of the three bridges
destroyed by NATO from the river at Novi Sad in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During last year's 11-week air strike on Yugoslavia, NATO
destroyed a total of eight bridges over the Yugoslav section of
the Danube River.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Austria alone have lost 5 billion forint (48
million dollars) in revenue so far since the river was blocked in
April last year.

The Chinese vice premier responsible for industrial and

small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of the two countries.
SMEs play an important role in economic development, providing job
opportunities and services, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides can make full use of the sister city and sister
province relationships, help the SMEs of the two countries
establish more communication channels and find cooperation
partners through institutions like the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade and the Belgian-Chinese Economic
and Commercial Council."
</P>
<P>
He said China's new strategy to develop its vast inner part
offers tremendous business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Belgian companies are welcome to invest and set up factories
or undertake other forms of cooperation with us in the central and
western parts of China. Enjoying preferential policies from the
state and boasting obvious advantages in human and natural
resources, these areas promise tremendous investment opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers Leave Miami Without Seeing Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The grandmothers of the
Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, left Miami, Florida, on Monday without
being able to see their 6-year-old grandson, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Elian's maternal grandmother, Raquel
Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, flew to
Miami from New York just for the purpose of seeing their grandson,
whose mother died in the sea when their boat, bound illegally for
the United States, capsized.
</P>
<P>
The grandmothers were invited to dinner Monday at the home of
Elian's relatives in Miami, who insisted on the meeting take place
there, according an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials were quoted as saying that the grandmothers,
who arrived in New York on Saturday, had hoped to meet with Elian
privately at a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
After flying in from New York, the grandmothers spent about
five hours at the airport before getting back on the plane and
taking off. They had meetings planned in Washington with members
of Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Elian was saved on November 25 last year in the sea near
Florida. The boy's relatives in Florida insist that the boy should
stay in the United States while the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) ruled the boy's custody belongs to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno on
Saturday, Elian's grandmothers asked her to help them bring the
boy back to their home in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. Congressmen planned to hold a hearing on Elian's
case later this week and will possibly vote to give Elian a U.S.
citizenship although the boy's father had rejected it.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief in Warsaw to Discuss Poland-Russia Diplomatic Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson paid a one-day visit to Poland Monday shortly after a
diplomatic row between the NATO-member country and Russia.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the mutual expulsion of diplomats between
the two countries featured highly in Robertson's talks with Polish
officials.
</P>
<P>
Poland ordered nine Russian diplomats out of the country on
charge of spying last Thursday and the next day Russia retaliated
with a similar action, further chilling the already uneasy
relations between the two Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
Poland had informed NATO of the expulsion before it took the
move, according to Robertson.
</P>
<P>
Other topics discussed included the situation in Europe, the
NATO strategy and the modernization of the Polish army when
Robertson met separately with Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, Premier Jerzy Buzek, Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek and Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the chief of the world's largest military
alliance indicated that Europe should increase its contact with
the United States and the Polish side called for greater U.S.
presence in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Poland and Russia went sour in the
early 1990s, when the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance
collapsed and the eastern Europe nations began to forge closer
ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
Poland applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
despite Russia's strong objection and won the membership in 1997.

</P>
<P>
Early entrance interviews showed Gore with a comfortable lead

<P>
PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Europe's Ariane rocket began its
first commercial launch in 2000 in Kourou, French Guiana, on
Tuesday, successfully sending a U.S.-built communications
satellite into orbit.
</P>
<P>
According to Arianespace Company, which built Ariane rockets,
the Ariane-42L with two liquid fuel boosters blasted off at 1:04
GMT, sending the "Galaxy-10R" satellite into its planned orbit
after 21 minutes' flight.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, built by Panamsat of the United States, will
keep a geostationary orbit 36,000 kilometers above the equator at
127 degrees West Longitude. It will be used for transmitting
Internet data and TV broadcasting for North America in the
following 15 years.
</P>
<P>
This is the 126th launch of the Ariane rocket since it was
first produced in 1979. The Ariane rockets will launch once a
month until May this year, including one by the advanced Ariane-5
rocket in March, Arianespace Company announced.
</P>
<P>
The next launch is scheduled for February 11, with an Ariane-44
LP rocket carrying a Superbird-D4 satellite.
</P>
<P>
Ariane-5's maiden launch failed in 1996, but it successfully
sent a space scientific research satellite into orbit from Kourou
last December.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Governor George W. Bush on Monday won the Democratic and
Republican Iowa caucuses, the first vote of the 2000 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest, unofficial returns in the Democratic
caucuses with 85 percent of the precincts reporting, Gore beat
rival Bill Bradley with a comfortable lead with 63 percent of vote.
Former New Jersey Senator Bradley got 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We've just begun to fight," Gore said. His victory blunted
Bradley's challenge going into the New Hampshire primary next week.
Bradley polled even with Gore, or even ahead, in that state.
</P>
<P>
Bradley described the result as "a little bump in the road." He
said no matter the results in Iowa, he had the bankroll to fight
on for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
With 92 percent of the precincts reporting, Republican Bush got
41 percent of the votes in the Republican caucuses and certified
his position as republican presidential front-runner.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor read the results as an "outpouring of
support for my message of compassionate conservatism."
</P>
<P>
Observers said Bush's strength came from Republicans who cited
moral values and protecting Social Security and Medicare. Bush
commanded the field among voters who said that the most important
quality in a candidate was the ability to win in November.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who has poured millions of
his own dollars into his second bid for the presidency, finished
second with 30 percent, followed by former U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Alan Keyes with 14 percent. Arizona Senator John
McCain, who did not campaign in the state and concentrated his
money and energy in New Hampshire, got 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Forbes, who emerged as conservative alternative, outpolled Bush
strongly among Republicans who cited abortion as their top issue,
and more narrowly among voters who cited taxes as their biggest
concern.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Set up Taekwondo Foundation to Boost Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Taekwondo
Association (TI) will launch a taekwondo foundation in February to
help develop the sport in Indonesia, the association chairman
Suharto said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which was jointly set up by TI and a group of
South Korean nationals who were doing business in Indonesia, would
help raise funds to stage championships and to finance Indonesian
taekwondoins taking part in overseas training and competitions.
</P>
<P>
"The foundation will manage everything concerning the
development of taekwondo in Indonesia. It will comprise members of
TI and the South Korean community on both its board and executive
council. It will also have an independent supervisory council to
oversee the work of its members," Suharto said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foundation was a non-profit one and would not
deal with commercial affairs.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the foundation was part of a deal with
South Korean business people who wanted to popularize their
country's national sport.
</P>
<P>
"They are proud of their traditional sport. The leaders of the
South Korean community in Indonesia wanted to help popularize the
sport here. But they only wanted to funnel their money through a
social foundation that could provide transparent public
accountability," Suharto was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that TI would stage the second LG Cup National
Taekwondo Championships in November and the Junior Open in July,
both to take place in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"There will be 204 South Korean elementary students who will
come here to demonstrate the sport, together with our taekwondoins
in the Junior Open," he added.
</P>
<P>
Suharto also said that Indonesia would host the Southeast Asian
Taekwondo Union Championships in October. The championships were
originally scheduled for 1997 but later delayed after five
Southeast Asian countries retired due to economy crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian taekwondoins would also attend the Asian
Championships in Hong Kong, he said, adding that national women's
taekwondoin Juana Wangsa Putri could earn a medal in the Olympic
Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Juana, who competes in the flyweight division, will leave for a
five-month overseas stint before performing in Sydney in September.

CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Jennifer Capriati carried her
career resurgence to the semi-finals of the Australian Open tennis
championships with an easy win over Japan's Ai Sugiyama at the

<P>
The 23-year-old American raced through the match 6-0, 6-2 in 55
minutes despite aggravating a stomach muscle strain midway through
the first set when she called for the trainer.
</P>
<P>
Capriati will now face either second seed Lindsay Davenport or

</P>
<P>
She said later the injury would not hamper her in the semi-

</P>
<P>
Tuesday's match evened the score between the two players as
Sugiyama had beaten the American in their past two meetings after
Capriati won the first clash in 1997 6-1, 6-0.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Skilled Workers Urged to Go West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to send some of its
most forward-thinking people westward to help the western part of
the country many believe to be backward.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Personnel seeks to introduce science,
technology and education to develop China's interior, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The ministry aims to speed up the training of qualified workers,
Song Defu, minister of personnel, said in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
Today rural China, particularly in the resource-rich west,
needs more talents to push its development because only fewer than
seven agricultural technicians live among every 10,000 farmers
there.
</P>
<P>
While making full use of the talent in China's west, Song
called on introducing skilled people from East China's prosperous
regions and from overseas to work in the west.
</P>
<P>
Song made it clear that talented people in eastern China will
be encouraged to join the State's "western campaign" by sharing
the proceeds from certain projects and contracting others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry will organize Chinese students studying
abroad and Chinese experts working in the United States and Japan
to evaluate the development potential of western China.
</P>
<P>
This year four groups of personnel officials from the west will
tour foreign countries to see how other nations have trained
skilled workers, Song said.
</P>
<P>
"The principal work for personnel departments at all levels is
to foster or introduce more talented people for rural China," Song
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
China has only 380,000 personnel actively spreading on new
farming techniques for some 900 million rural people.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of Personnel report released yesterday,
170 million young farmers have received junior middle school
education or higher.
</P>
<P>
While 5 million junior and senior middle school graduates
return home each year to rural areas, the nation has millions of "
self-educated farming experts", according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Arab States Seek a Mideast Free of Weapons of Mass Destructions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A technical committee of the Arab
League (AL) is drafting a regional treaty on making the Middle East
free of weapons of mass destructions, Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meetings of the committee opened here Tuesday in the AL General
Secretariat on the establishment of mechanism to verify compliance
by signatories to the coming treaty, said Nabil Moamari, head of
the Lebanese delegation, who was chairing the two-day meetings.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs Mohamad
Zaharia said the treaty envisages banning using nuclear energy for
other than peaceful purposes in the region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Arab states will seek to rally more support to pressure Israel
into complying with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT), Zaharia said.
</P>
<P>
Israel neither admits nor denies it has nuclear weapons. But it
is widely believed to have a significant stockpile of nuclear
weapons. It refuses to sign the non-proliferation treaty and
rejects international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Israel has equipped its newly-acquired submarine
with nuclear warheads, which alarmed its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Zakaria warned that Arab countries may be lured to acquire
nuclear weapons if they live under the nuclear threat of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Loans 300 Million Dollar to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland on Tuesday signed an
agreement with Iran to extended its first ever credit of 300
million U.S. dollars to Iranian industries to import raw material
and machinery.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was inked here by Phillip Beck, the Middle East
operations director general of Swiss Andre Finco Institute and head
of Iran Export Guarantee Fund (IEGF) Hossein Karbelai.
</P>
<P>
The credit is in the form of one-year usance extendable for up
to five years to industrial units and banks, and the IEGF
affiliated to the Iranian Commerce Ministry will guarantee the
credit, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the credit ceiling can be extended up to
500 million dollars annually and its interest rate may be lower
than international rates.
</P>
<P>
Beck said at the signing ceremony that his country has shown
interest in expanding bilateral cooperation with Iran and the
agreement is a step in bolstering bilateral ties in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Karbelai said that liquidity shortages and inadequate
availability of financial sources are the main obstacle facing
Iranian industries, making them unable to use their full production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Swiss credit will boost hard currency
availability of Iranian industrial units by 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts New Talks With Cyprus on Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Leopold Maurer, head of the
European Union (EU) team on negotiations of Cyprus' accession,
arrived here Tuesday heading a 12-member delegation.
</P>
<P>
The European negotiators are to discuss the issues to be tackled
in the first half of the year, the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The issues include competition, employment, social affairs,
economic and financial affairs, fisheries, information society,
home affairs and regional policy.
</P>
<P>
Maurer said that his working visit to the island is taking place
after EU summit in Helsinki last December reconfirmed that the
Cyprus issue will not affect Nicosia's efforts for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation will meet Wednesday with Cyprus' Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasolides and chief of Cyprus' EU accession team
George Vassiliou.
</P>
<P>
But efforts for a meeting with the Turkish Cypriots have failed
as their Rauf Denktash has not softened his stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
One of Denktash's arguments is that the Cyprus Constitution does
not allow Cyprus to join an international organization of which
Greece and Turkey are not members. Although Greece is a member of
the EU, Turkey, which has also been bidding for EU membership, was
granted candidacy status only in the Helsinki meeting.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has also rejected an offer from Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides for Turkish Cypriot representatives to be included
in the Cyprus team negotiating entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Maurer underlined the importance of the Turkish Cypriots being
informed and engaged in Cyprus' accession course, noting "We have
to see how we could involve the Turkish Cypriots in the
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in 1990 and started
substantial membership talks in November 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Begins Talks on Peace-Keeping Operations in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The heads of state agreed to meet again amongst themselves at
4:30 (p.m. EST) this afternoon," a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting called mini-summit, chaired by Annan, the under-
secretary-general for peace-keeping operations, Bernard Miyet,
walked the meeting through the details of phases 1 and 2 and
touched upon phase 3 of the U.N. plan to send peace-keepers into
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"They also discussed the need to support the facilitator of the
Lusaka peace process, former President Ketumile Masire of Botswana
-- both politically and financially," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General raised the issue of regional and
international dimensions of the conflict and the need to address
the longer term security, humanitarian and development needs of
the countries involved," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that "It would be important, at an appropriate time,
to deal with these issues at an international conference," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up Tuesday, Annan convened the mini-summit among
African leaders, including foreign ministers from the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), to see how the faltering six-
month cease-fire could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties signed the Lusaka Agreement in July last year
to cover the withdrawal of foreign troops from DRC and the
disarmament of former combatants. Since then, however, there have
been many violations.
</P>
<P>
The DRC president, Laurent Kabila, told an open Security
Council debate Monday that the Lusaka Agreement "is deadlocked,"
and it "is not working."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told a press conference that
Annan wanted to discuss with the African presidents "the terms of
the deployment of U.N. troops, where they are to be deployed, why
they are deployed, why the numbers are what they are" and allowing
"the U.N. military liaison officers do the job that they have been
asked to do."
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit came as the Security Council is considering a
recommendation by Annan to send 5,000 peace-keepers to protect 500
unarmed U.N. military observers, of which only 79 have been
deployed.
</P>
<P>
Kabila told an early morning press conference here Tuesday that
he is expecting the United Nations to deploy its peace-keepers for
the interposition, namely, the deployment must be introduced into
the areas occupied by guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe supported Kabila in fighting
against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Release Poverty Reduction Plan Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government said on
Tuesday it planned to launch an economic plan next month aimed at
reducing poverty and wooing for assistance from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
An IMF team arrived in Kenya on Monday for a week-long talks
with the east African country. The visit was seen as the first
step towards the resumption of a 205-million-dollar loan
suspended in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo said that the talks focused
on the preparation of a poverty alleviation plan.
</P>
<P>
The government will complete the preparation of a draft Poverty
 Reduction Strategy Paper, which will be made public next month
for discussion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will also create an environment for financial
assistance to Kenya by the World Bank and the IMF, Okemo said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team is expected to review Kenya's economic and
budgetary performance, structural reforms and anti-corruption
measures.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a three-year 205-million-dollar loan to the
east African country in July 1997 in protest at poor governance,
which has triggered off an economic decline since then. However,
the fund has praised Kenya's recent economic reform efforts.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Regional Cooperation to Safeguard Gulf Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis Vice Speaker
Hassan Rowhani on Tuesday reiterated Tehran's call for cooperation
among regional countries to maintain security and stability in
the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"If a security arrangement is made by regional states, it will
guarantee the security of the region as well as the free flow of
oil from the Persian Gulf," Rowhani said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of a seminar entitled "the
Persian Gulf: towards the 21st century," he said the regional
countries are in need of diplomacy and cultural exchanges besides
firmness and defense capability in order to maintain security in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani, also secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security
Council (SNSC), said that Iran and other Gulf littoral states
should define clearly identity of the region and present new
definitions on types of power and threats.
</P>
<P>
The regional countries should make the region free from weapons
of mass destruction and should prevent foreign vessels carrying
weapons of mass destruction from entering the region, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Voicing Iran's readiness to build cooperation with all regional
states, he said that Iran is for full transparency of arm purchases
by regional states so as to build confidence and transfer data on
military activities and exercises of regional states.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined Iran's role in maintaining
security in the region. The security of Iran, which possesses half
of the Gulf coasts, cannot be separated from that of other littoral

states, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran considers security in the southern Persian
Gulf states as its own security and any tension and instability in
the region detrimental to its national security.
</P>
<P>
Repeating Tehran's opposition to the U.S. military presence,
Rowhani said that Muslim people of the region show sensitivity
towards the presence of alien forces which may pose a danger to
their
national security.
</P>
<P>
He also cited Israel's arsenal and its efforts to dominate the
region, border and territorial disputes among regional states, and
the rivalry between the U.S. and Europe in the Gulf as potential
threats to the regional security.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting continued
Tuesday in Chechnya as the Russian military said that 1,173
federal servicemen have died in its campaign against rebels of the
breakaway republic since last August.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted the Defense and Interior
Ministries as saying that 1,173 Russian servicemen have died, 3,
487 wounded and 53 missing in Daghestan and Chechnya since last
August.
</P>
<P>
Chechen militants launched two waves of armed incursions into
neighboring Daghestan but were driven out by federal forces.
</P>
<P>
Their defeat was followed by a series of apartment bombings in
Moscow and two other Russian cities that left over 300 people dead
and hundreds more maimed. Moscow has accused Chechen militants of
masterminding the blasts.

Federal troops marched into Chechnya last September following
the deadly blasts, with strong backing from the Russian population.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1, 702 Defense Ministry servicemen have been
killed and 1,954 wounded, said Colonel General Valery Manilov,
first deputy chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed
Forces.
</P>
<P>
He also said 776 soldiers and officers had returned to their
units after hospital treatment, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 317 interior troops, including 46 officers, have

during the "second phase of the anti-terrorist operation" in
Chechnya and more than 2,500 have been killed during the current "
third phase," Interfax quoted Manilov as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the fighting rages on in Grozny, the Chechen capital, and
the mountainous regions in the southern part of the breakaway
republic, Russian security agencies have renewed warning of fresh
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has put its armed forces on alert on
Tuesday after a reported threat of terrorism. Ministry personnel
will be required to work 12 hours a day with no leave and stronger
measures will be taken, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Ex-Parliament Speaker Flees to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) --Former Rwandan Parliament
Speaker Joseph Sebarenzi Kabuye fled the country over the weekend
to Uganda, Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A security official who preferred anonymity told RNA that
Sebarenzi crossed to Uganda on foot via an illegal short-cut
escorted by an armed body guard.
</P>
<P>
He let his vehicle continue across the border with the
intention to re- board it in Uganda. Unfortunately, he was
intercepted by Ugandan local defense force operatives who informed
their counterparts in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Rwandan authorities requested that he be handed
over to them, but the Ugandans declined to do so before contacting
higher authorities in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ugandan capital confirmed to RNA that
Sebarenzi was seen in Uganda Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sebarenzi Kabuye was forced to resign on January 7 following
accusations of mismanagement and dictatorial tendencies by a large
majority of Parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
He was eventually expelled from Parliament at the request of
his own party (Liberal Party) on allegations of abetting sectarian
tendencies in the army, receiving and distributing seditious
material from an exiled Rwandan musician and condoning
misunderstandings between government and genocide survivors.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in Kigali attribute Sebarenzi's flight to
fears for his personal security or possible legal proceedings,
because of the gravity of the accusations levelled against him.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Prosecutor in the Supreme Court, Gahima Gerald told
RNA that, " neither criminal file has been opened nor
investigations are in process in Sebarenzi's case."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State to Be Declared This Year: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- An independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital will be declared this year,
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat told
reporters here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader was speaking upon his return from a tour
of the U.S., Tunisia, the European Union's headquarters in Brussels
and Egypt over the troubled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat termed his recent talks in Washington with U.S. President
Bill Clinton as "important and positive," adding that he briefed
the U.S. leaders on the difficulties and obstacles facing the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel postponed the third-stage troop withdrawal from another
6.1 percent of the West Bank slated for January 20 and the final
status talks on some thorny issues have achieved no tangible
progress with the February 13 deadline for a framework agreement at
hand.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite delay of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks scheduled
for January 19 in the U.S. put Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
trip to the Washington on hold and a planned meeting between Barak
and Arafat was therefore cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has called on Washington to fully supervise
the Palestinian-Israeli talks with a view to push forward the peace
process and conclude a framework agreement within the set time,
Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Under a September interim deal, the two sides will conclude a
permanent peace deal by September this year based on the framework
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Italy Sign Contract to Develop Steel Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Italy have decided to
join hands in boosting the annual production of the Iranian biggest
steel enterprise Mobarekeh Steel Complex from the current 3.4
million tons to 4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
A buy-back contract to this effect was signed Tuesday between
the Iranian steel complex and a consortium of three Italian firms.
</P>
<P>
The contract worth 299.5 million euro (about 293.2 million U.S.
dollars) was inked by Iranian Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq
Jahangiri and representative of the consortium consisting of S.M.S.
Demag, Techint and Irasco.
</P>
<P>
Under the 12-year contract, the consortium will take three years
to set up installations and equipment to boost the complex's output
and investment will be repaid through the sale of products, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first installment will be paid 48 months after the
finalization of the agreement to purchase machinery and equipment
for the plant, the agency said, and the interest rate on the
floating loan is 6.4 percent that will be paid in euro.
</P>
<P>
Jahangiri said at the signing ceremony that carrying out
development projects on buy-back scheme would be useful for the
industries and his ministry preferred to use buy-back contract to

GAZA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator in
final-status talks Yasser Abed Rabbo said here Tuesday that the
Palestinian side was committed to the mid-February time-limit for
the conclusion of a framework peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, the Middle East will witness intensive

in early February, Rabbo told Voice of Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side, he said, will be responsible for any

As for the role of the United States and the European Union in

<HEADLINE> Pardoned Ex-Tehran Mayor Still Banned from Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, an influential reformist pardoned by the supreme leader
of his prison term, is still banned from taking government posts,
an Iranian judicial official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official was quoted by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) as saying that the amnesty did not include the
punishment of banning Karbaschi from taking public office for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was serving a two-year prison term on charges of
embezzlement. The pardon, which relieved him of the remainder of
the term as well as the cash fine of up to half a million U.S.
dollars, came after he served 260 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Judiciary issued a statement Tuesday, said the
pardon was issued upon a proposal of Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi at Karbaschi's request.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was appointed Tehran mayor by then Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani in 1989 when the government started post-war
reconstruction. Accused of pocketing public fund and offering
financial support to President Mohammad Khatami in the 1997
presidential election, he was publicly tried in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeals court finally sentenced him to two years in
prison and banned him from taking public office for 10 years with a
cash fine of 1.6 billion rials (about 533,000 U.S. dollars at the
official rate).
</P>
<P>
Local daily Fath reported Saturday that Karbaschi had been freed
one day before, but judicial officials soon denied the report,
saying he was just on a prison furlough.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here earlier that Karbaschi refused to seek
pardon on the occasion of the Eid-e Fitr on January 8, which marked
the end of Islamic holy fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was reported to have played a role in securing
Karbaschi's release ahead of the coming sensitive parliamentary
elections on February 18.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi is believed to be a protege of Rafsanjani, who heads
the powerful State Expediency Council. Rafsanjani has announced to
run in the parliamentary election and Karbaschi's pro-reformist
Party of Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI) strongly supports
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a skilled bureaucrat, helped the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami to win the 1997 presidential election. Observers
believed his release would benefit Rafsanjani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
Both the moderates and conservatives pinned their hopes on the
coming election to assert their power in the political sphere of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives tried to consolidate their control over the
Majlis while the moderates anticipated a victory to unseat the
conservative domination to pave the way for political reforms
advocated by Khatami.

<HEADLINE> UAE Continues to Fight Oil Pollution off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is continuing efforts to handle oil pollution off Abu Dhabi coast
caused by a sunken ship, official sources said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to stop oil leakage from the ship have been completed,
the Abu Dhabi Seaports Authority said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that operations have begun to drain the remaining oil
from the sunken ship to another vessel.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to estimate the total volume of leakage unless
operation of transferring the remaining oil from the capsized
vessel is finished, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran-flagged cargo vessel, Al Jazya 1, run by Abu Dhabi-
based Al Jazya Marine and Shipping Services, sank Monday morning
about 11.3 kilometers east of Abu Dhabi coast while sailing from
Abu Dhabi Free Port to Somalia, laden with 980 tons of fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Environmental Agency, meanwhile, said in another
statement that the oil slick resulted from the sunken ship has
split into various patches and spread on a wide area due to strong
winds.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still too early to assess the extent of damage
caused by the slick on marine life and birds, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Salem Masri Al Dhaheri, director general of the agency, said a
number of rubber fenders had been placed around the area to stop
the slick from spreading further.
</P>
<P>
The accident came just three months after Abu Dhabi National Oil
Company staged the largest oil spill exercise in the Gulf to test
the UAE's readiness to handle oil spills.

<HEADLINE> UAE Official Stresses Importance of Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
should make maximum use of the positive aspects of privatization to
improve and strengthen the local economy, a senior UAE official
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince of one of the
emirates Abu Dhabi, said his country should encourage the private
sector and give it a greater role to participate effectively and
and positively in the comprehensive development of national
economy.
</P>
<P>
He told the opening session of the Gulf and North Africa Project
Finance and Privatization Conference that "privatization has now
become the strategic option and a backbone of the global economy."
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, specialized and independent decision
making authorities have been set up in the UAE to determine
priorities of privatization.
</P>
<P>
"The government has actually privatized some sectors, though
gradually," he pointed out, referring to the country's health and
water and electricity sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the prime goals are to provide more job opportunities
for UAE citizens, further improve the economic performance, attract
more local and foreign investment and explore new horizons for
joint economic cooperation between the Gulf region and other
countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which is to continue on Wednesday, was attended
by a group of representatives from across the Middle East and North
Africa. It was also attended by U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce
Robet Mallet.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, Mallet said the meeting was a good
opportunity for the participants to work out a mechanism for
cooperation between private sector companies in the Gulf, North
Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed satisfaction at the bilateral trade between
the U.S. and the UAE, which hit 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Next 4-7 Months Critical for Mideast Peace: Israeli Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Tuesday that the next four to
seven months is a make-or-break period for Israel's peace talks
with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, Israeli Military Intelligence head Amos Malka warned
that if no agreement was reached during the critical period, a new
round of Israeli-Arab confrontation could follow.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the upcoming presidential campaign in the United
States and Israel's decision to withdraw form the self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon by next July as reasons for his
assessment.
</P>
<P>
However, he was cautiously optimistic that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak could still achieve his Middle East peace
objectives during this "window of opportunity" period, as some
analysts called it.
</P>
<P>
Barak took an unusual step in Israeli political history to set
peace talks deadlines for himself since taking office last July.
</P>
<P>
He promised that between mid-February and September this year,
he would obtain a framework agreement and a permanent status accord
with the Palestinians, pull the IDF out of Lebanon, and arrive at a
peace treaty with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But, as the talks with Syria were halted last week, the deadline
for framework pact with the Palestinian was approaching while no
breakthrough had been made, and the negotiations with Lebanon have
not even started, some analysts believe that Barak is using up his
time.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Grant China P-NTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) U.S. President Bill Clinton
stepped up his effort on Monday to enlist Congress' support for
the WTO agreement signed by the United States and China last
November and vowed to fight for the approval of a permanent normal
trade status with China.
</P>
<P>
"I will make it a top priority in the new year to seek
congressional support for permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR)
with China," Clinton wrote in a lengthy letter to the Speaker of
the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate on
the first day the 106th Congress resumed to work after its winter
recess.
</P>
<P>
The "historic trade agreement" between the two countries,
resulting from over a decade of hard negotiations, is "good for
America", he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that bringing China into the WTO "will advance
critical economic and national security goals," and "will open a
growing market to American workers, farmers, and businesses."
</P>
<P>
The agreement, under which China has made comprehensive market-
opening concessions, promises vast opportunities for American
exports, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In the last 20 years, the Chinese have made giant strides in
building a new economy, lifting more than 200 million people out
of absolute poverty and creating the basis for more profound
reform of Chinese society," Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
But China still faces critical social and economic challenges
in the next few years, and "WTO membership will spur the economy
and, over time, will help establish the conditions to sustain and
deepen economic reform in China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wrote that China's entry into the WTO will also help
bring the country into international agreements, making it "a more
constructive player in the world".
</P>
<P>
The president also joined many business tycoons in marshaling
Congress support for giving China a permanent NTR.
</P>
<P>
"The United States must grant China permanent NTR or risk
losing the full benefits of the agreement we negotiated, including
special import protections, and rights to enforce China's
commitments through WTO dispute settlement," Clinton wrote in the
letter to the Congress leaders.
</P>
<P>
"If Congress were to refuse to grant permanent NTR, our Asian
and European competitors will reap these benefits but American
farmers and businesses may well be left behind," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
"In the months ahead, I look forward to working with Congress
to pass this historic legislation," Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an article written exclusively for the latest
issue of The New Democrat, the flagship publication of the
Democratic leadership Council, Clinton expounded the necessity for
China's accession into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We want a prosperous China open to American exports; whose
people have access to ideas and information; and that upholds the
rule of law at home and plays by global rules of the road on
everything from nuclear non-proliferation to human rights to Trade,
" Clinton wrote. "Bringing China into the World Trade Organization
on the terms we have negotiated will advance all these goals," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is facing an uphill battle in Congress to get through a
bill that would grant China a permanent NTR. At present, most
Republicans support the trade deal while quite a few congressional
Democrats, labor and environmental groups oppose it.

<HEADLINE> DRC Conflict Is Not a Civil War, Kabila Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kabila, who paid the first visit to the United Nations to
attend the U.N. special meeting on Congo (K), told an early
morning press conference that the conflict "is not all the civil
war in the country."
</P>
<P>
The special meeting showed that "for the first time, the U.N.
Security Council has differentiated the invaders and victims of
invasion," Kabila said. "The Congo is the victim of the aggression
and occupation."
</P>
<P>
Six African countries were involved in the conflict, which
broke out in August 1998. Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe backed
President Kabila in fighting rebels supported by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of DRC and the number of other countries
involved in the conflict, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright described the fighting in the central African country as
Africa's "first world war."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held the meeting some months after the
resumption of the war and the violations of a cease-fire accord,
known as the Lusaka Agreement which was signed in July last year,
simply because the resistance of the DRC Government and its people
and the efforts to make invaders fail, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since warring parties signed the Lusaka Agreement, there have
been many violations on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"We are supporting the Lusaka Agreement, supporting its
structure, and trying to bring peace to the region," Kabila said.
"The Lusaka (Agreement) failed because it was not implemented."
</P>
<P>
"We shall repair everything which makes Lusaka (Agreement) not
functioning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the United Nations to play its part by
sending peace-keepers into his country. "The function of the U.N.
peace-keepers is for the interposition," he said, calling on the
Security Council to decide "to send peace-keepers to the area
occupied by guerrilla," he said.
</P>
<P>
The special meeting on DRC came at a time when the Security
Council is considering a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to send 5,000 peace-keeping troops to protect 500
unarmed U.N. military observers, with the United States, which
have to bear a third of the cost, hesitating over the decision,
largely sought by African leaders at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. inaction on DRC, Kabila said that the U.S. position
on the issue "is not very clear" at present. Although the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, and Albright
invited him to attend the Security Council meeting, the invitation
does not necessarily represent "the view of the entire U.S.
Government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila told the Security Council meeting Monday that "the
Lusaka Agreement is deadlocked, and the Agreement is not working."

NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence
climbed further in January, reaching the highest level in the 32-
year history of the series since the index began in 1960s, The
Conference Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent research group, said in a
survey that its Consumer Confidence Index rose 3.0 to 144.7 in
January from 141.7 in December, last year.
</P>
<P>
"People looking for confirmation that the consumer confidence
bubble will soon burst have a further wait in store," said Lynn
Franco, Director of The Conference Board's Consumer Research
Center. "An expanding global economy and a robust job market
suggest that consumer optimism and consumer spending could rise
even further in coming months."
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is a barometer of the U.S. economy since
consumer spending makes up about two-third of the nation's
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The survey said consumers' assessment of current conditions
improved. Those rating business conditions as "good" rose to more
than 47 percent, up from 46 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of respondents anticipating better business
conditions over the next six months rose to 19.6 percent from 17.5
percent in December while the percentage of consumers expecting
conditions to worsen declined to 3.3 percent from 4.8 percent, the
survey added.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the percentage of respondents who feel jobs are
"plentiful" rose to more than 54 percent in January, up from 52
percent, and those claiming jobs were "hard to get" fell to 11.3
percent from 11.8 percent in the previous survey.

<HEADLINE> Irish Arrests Two More Suspects After Bomb Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Irish police made two new
arrests in Ireland on Tuesday as they investigated the discovery
of bombs linked to the Continuity IRA, a dissident republican
group opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrested a 43-year-old man near the southern
town of Tipperary and a woman aged 40 shortly afterwards in the
same area, a Reuters report monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after the discovery of a van transporting
two potentially lethal bombs loaded with Semtex explosive in
County Tipperary on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The van driver is being questioned.
</P>
<P>
Irish Media reports said the weapons were being transported to
Northern Ireland for possible attacks on security forces.
</P>
<P>
The arms find came at a delicate stage in efforts to cement a
lasting peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream guerrilla groups, including the Irish Republican
Army(IRA), are observing cease-fires while politicians from
Northern Ireland's Protestant majority and Roman Catholic minority
try to seal a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
The IRA is under pressure to disarm to maintain momentum in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Continuity IRA, a small hard-line group opposed to the
peace process, has never declared a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The discovery heightened fears that IRA weapons could fall into
the hands of dissident guerrilla groups unless verifiable
disarmament takes place.

<HEADLINE> DRC Conflict Is Not a Civil War, Kabila Says  (Updated with more quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kabila, who paid the first visit to the United Nations to
attend the U.N. special meeting on Congo (K), told an early
morning press conference that the conflict "is not all the civil
war in the country."
</P>
<P>
"There is no civil war in the country," Kabila said. "Congo
needs more security than those claiming to be victims of raids and
armed groups from the Congo."
</P>
<P>
The special meeting showed that "for the first time, the U.N.
Security Council has differentiated the invaders and victims of
invasion," Kabila said. "The Congo is the victim of the aggression
and occupation."
</P>
<P>
Six African countries were involved in the conflict, which
broke out in August 1998. Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe backed
President Kabila in fighting rebels supported by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of DRC and the number of other countries
involved in the conflict, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright described the fighting in the central African country as
Africa's "first world war."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held the meeting some months after the
resumption of the war and the violations of a cease-fire accord,
known as the Lusaka Agreement which was signed in July last year,
simply because the resistance of the DRC Government and its people
and the efforts to make invaders fail, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since warring parties signed the Lusaka Agreement, there have
been many violations on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"We are supporting the Lusaka Agreement, supporting its
structure, and trying to bring peace to the region," Kabila said.
"The Lusaka (Agreement) failed because it was not implemented."
</P>
<P>
"We shall repair everything which makes Lusaka (Agreement) not
functioning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the United Nations to play its part by
sending peace-keepers into his country. "The function of the U.N.
peace-keepers is for the interposition," he said, calling on the
Security Council to decide "to send peace-keepers to the area
occupied by guerrilla," he said.
</P>
<P>
The special meeting on DRC came at a time when the Security
Council is considering a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to send 5,000 peace-keeping troops to protect 500
unarmed U.N. military observers, with the United States, which
have to bear a third of the cost, hesitating over the decision,
largely sought by African leaders at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. inaction on DRC, Kabila said that the U.S. position
on the issue "is not very clear" at present. Although the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, and Albright
invited him to attend the Security Council meeting, the invitation
does not necessarily represent "the view of the entire U.S.
Government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila told the Security Council meeting Monday that "the
Lusaka Agreement is deadlocked, and the Agreement is not working."
</P>
<P>
As Kabila was speaking at press conference, the Security
Council began drafting a resolution Tuesday to send U.N. peace-
keepers into Congo after African heads of state pledged to work
hard for peace in the region and called on the United Nations to
play its part to strengthen the cease-fire agreement.

<HEADLINE> Adams Says N.Irish Peace Process on Way to Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said in Belfast on Tuesday the peace process in Northern Ireland
was on the road to disaster due to the way the issue of guerrilla
disarmament has been handled.
</P>
<P>
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, told the BBC that he hoped disarmament could be
resolved but cautioned against ultimatums being delivered.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see these issues resolved. I think they can be
resolved but the way they're being tackled at the moment is the
road to disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that no verbal assurances on disarmament were given
during peace talks chaired by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell
last November.
</P>
<P>
The thorny topic of guerrilla disarmament is the next key phase
in the peace process intended to draw a line under 30 years of
sectarian and political violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the main Protestant political party and Northern
Ireland's First Minister, David Trimble, has threatened to pull
out of the province's new power-sharing government unless IRA
guerrillas begin to disarm.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Independent Disarmament Commission, retired
Canadian General John de Chastelain, is due to deliver a crucial
report on or before January 31st to the British and Irish
governments detailing progress made.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Gold Industry Dim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's gold mining industry
is hanging in balance because of low mineral prices on the world
market, Managing Director of Falcon Gold of Zimbabwe Andrew
Beattie said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Beattie told the Zimbabwe News Agency that hopes for the
recovery of the gold mining industry were dim since the prices of
the mineral had gone to its lowest level in 12 years, yet
production costs continued to escalate.
</P>
<P>
"Costs, particularly electricity, have gone up and the year
ahead is very precarious because costs are likely to catch up with
revenue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices are hovering around 288 U.S. dollars per ounce
compared with last year's peak of 377 U.S. dollars by November, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But even the present price is considered much better than last
year's lowest level of below 230 U.S. dollars an ounce, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the mining industry needed a further devaluation of the
local currency to boost earnings of companies faced with closure.
</P>
<P>
"A devaluation will give us more revenue although this is only
short term because costs are eventually going to catch up if gold
prices do not increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
High production costs had resulted in many mines closing down
in the past few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the third largest gold producer in Africa after
South Africa and Ghana. It produced 27 tons of gold last year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Warns Against Violence During Election Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean official Tuesday
urged all parties concerned to exercise restraint, stressing that
violence and intimidation during election campaigns will not be
condoned.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hatendi, chairman of the Electoral Supervisory
Commission, (ESC) said that the rules for campaign in preparation
for the fifth parliamentary elections scheduled for March this
year were very strict and allowed for the freedom of expression
and assembly without hindrance, according to Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a member of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) was beaten dead
by supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change in Harare
Province on Saturday night when the two parties clashed during the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody condones violence. All the parties should exercise
social restraint so that there will be no violence and
intimidation," Hatendi said.
</P>
<P>
"The general public should not be persuaded by political
parties to be part of this violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Wayne Budzijena warned that those who
campaigned through violent means would be severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
"We have increased our patrols in those areas where political
violence is likely to erupt," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A memorandum of understanding on
the launching of a Commonwealth diploma in youth development
studies at the Zimbabwe Open University was signed here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Regional Director of Commonwealth
youth program African Centre Ignatius Takawira, Zimbabwean Deputy
Minister of National Affairs, Employment Creation and Cooperatives
Shuvai Mahofa and Vice-Chancellor of Zimbabwe Open University
Kuzvinetsa Dzvimbo.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 students have been identified for the pilot
project set to begin in August.
</P>
<P>
The launching of diploma is aimed at giving youth workers
counselling and skills to make marginalized and economically
disadvantaged youths to be creative and innovative.
</P>
<P>
It is to mark the implementation of recommendations by
Commonwealth Youth Ministers in 1995 to introduce such a diploma
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The diploma would also be offered at the universities of Ghana,
South Africa and Zambia as well as Tanzania Open University.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen tertiary institutions across the Commonwealth would
also offer the same course, thus giving opportunities to graduates
of the diploma to embark on relatively higher courses within any
of the institutions.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Association Calls for Reducing Retiring Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian association leader
Tuesday called for reducing the age of retirement so that the
retrenchees and retirees can enjoy their pension.
</P>
<P>
Nathan Mpepo, general secretary of the Retrenchees and Retirees
 Association, said in Kabwe, central Zambia, that the retiring age
for workers should be reduced from the present 55 to 45 which is
the life expectancy in the country.
</P>
<P>
"If life expectancy for Zambia is 45 years, why should retiring
age be fixed at 55? There is no logic," he said, adding in fact
many people are dying younger than that of the age due to poor
health.
</P>
<P>
He said that it has also been proved difficult for the
relatives to claim pension and contributions from Zambia National
Provident Fund (ZNPF) after the worker dies.
</P>
<P>
The association is collecting signatures from workers and
retirees to force the government to repeal the regulation which
fixed retiring age at 55.

TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday condemned the government of
Honduras for shifting its embassy to Israel to the contentious
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep sorrow over the Honduras' move, Asfei said it
was in line with Israel's policies to remove Islamic and
Palestinian identity from Jerusalem and turn the holy city into its
capital, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is controversial, with Israel claiming
it its eternal and undivided capital and the Palestinians wanting
the holy city as its capital of their future state. And its fate
will be decided in the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Asefi also called on Muslim countries to do their best to
prevent the realization of the Israeli expansionist goals,
particularly its objective to remove values of divine religions and
the first Kiblah of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not recognize the Israel and regards Jerusalem as the
holy site of the Islamic world and capital of Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Indian President Appeals For Equality Among Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan Tuesday appealed for equality among all countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the nation on the eve of the 50th anniversary
of Republic Day, Narayanan said equality "does mean that no nation
or continent can seek overlordship over others claiming political,
economic, technological or strategic superiority."
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War had not ended all conflicts in the
world, it had only changed its character, he said.
</P>
<P>
On India's relations with neighboring China, Narayanan said: "
We celebrate this year the 50th anniversary of the establishment
of diplomatic relations with China, we wish that country and its
people every happiness."
</P>
<P>
The two countries established diplomatic relations on April 1,
1950, six months after the founding of the People's Republic of
China on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Pakistan, Narayanan said: "We want to live in
peace with Pakistan. We want the relations to conform to the best
traditions of good neighborliness, eschewing terrorist
interventions and the propaganda of hatred."
</P>
<P>
"The principles like the respect for the territorial integrity
and independence of nations, non-interference in their internal
matters and mutual benefit and equality are precious concepts
which cannot become redundant in a world of globalization," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the on-going economic reforms in his country, Narayanan
warned that the fury of patient and long-suffering poor people
would be unleashed if economic reforms and globalization did not
provide equality of status and opportunity to them.
</P>
<P>
He said the so-called "three-way fast lane of liberalization,
privatization and globalization must provide safe pedestrian
crossing for the unempowered Indian."
</P>
<P>
He regretted that even 50 years after India became a republic,
"justice -- social, economic, and political -- remains an
unrealized dream" for millions of people in the country and
benefits of economic reforms are yet to reach them.
</P>
<P>
He said India has the world's largest reservoirs of technical
personnel but also has the world's largest number of illiterates,
the world's largest middle class but also the largest number of
people below the poverty line and the largest number of children
suffering from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Although India is one of the 10 fastest growing economies in
the world, "there is sullen resentment among the masses against
their conditions erupting often in violent forms in several parts
of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for people's movement for stopping the pollution of
rivers, saying water is a basic need and a fundamental right of
the people.
</P>
<P>
There was also a need to organize a mass movement for literacy,
through which "not only literacy but also national and social
causes like pollution control and environmental consciousness
could be spread among the people," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh Tuesday called for a collective Asian
initiative to tackle growing terrorism and nuclear proliferation
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
It was a global concern to fashion a lasting security order in
Asia to get rid of narco-terrorism, extremism and small arms
proliferation, said Singh while delivering a closing address at an
international conference on Asian security in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"If proliferation has to be tackled, Asian nations need to come
together by undertaking regional initiatives for steps that will
lead the way in de-legitimizing nuclear weapons and reducing the
risks of accidental and unauthorized nuclear exchange," Singh was
quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Asian security environment as a "unique" one, he
pointed to the fact that Asia lacks an overarching security
framework like those existing in Europe, America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sustaining and strengthening pluralism in the region is of
prime importance and needs greater international attention and
cooperation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airlines to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
announced on Tuesday that it has decided to privatize the Indian
Airlines by divesting 51 percent of its equity.
</P>
<P>
According to a government spokesperson, 26 of the 51 percent
will be divested to a joint venture or a strategic partner and the
rest 25 percent to employees, financial institutions and the
public.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said any joint venture or strategic partner
that wants to bid for the Indian Airlines equity must not have
more than 40 percent foreign equity itself.
</P>
<P>
Non-resident Indians and overseas corporate bodies are free to
bid, but no foreign airlines will be allowed to do so, said the
spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government will also set up an inter-ministerial
group to help in the Indian Airlines' privatization process, the
spokesperson added.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1953 with an equity of 1.05 billion rupees (24.4
million U.S. dollars), the Indian Airlines now has a fleet of 56
aircraft and operates in 57 domestic stations and 17 overseas
destinations.

</P>
<P>
Addressing a function here, Hasina said the four thrust sectors
are leather and leather goods, new and higher value-added ready-
made garment products, computer software and agro-processing
industries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to various incentives to set up export-oriented
industries, she said her government had been following the policy
of "prosperity through export."
</P>
<P>
She said almost all sectors had been opened for investment by
the entrepreneurs both from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Describing the new century as one of computer, science and
competition, Hasina urged the exporters to find newer exportable
items so as to face the challenges of the open economy.
</P>
<P>
She said direct foreign investment now stands at 10 billion U.S.
dollars due to the adoption of various liberal steps with regard
to industries, adding that 439 industries and factories were set
up with foreign investment during the period between 1996 and June
1999.

<HEADLINE> North America Sees "New Era for Women's Hockey" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada's National Women's Hockey
League is seeing "a whole new era for women's hockey" with rapid
expansion of North American teams.
</P>
<P>
A 10th team has been added in Vancouver for next season, when
the new Vancouver Griffins will confront with nine others
including Brampton Thurnder, Beatrice Aeros and Clearnet Lightning,
Canadian league president Susan Fennell said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first league championship will be staged on March 18-19 in
Brampton, Ontario, where the games will be broadcast live via
cable on the Women's Television Network.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian league president also sees keen interest among
prospective U.S. teams because there currently are few club teams
to play on after women leave college leagues.
</P>
<P>
Calgary, Edmonton, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston and Detroit are possible additions in
the future, according to Fennell.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the beginning. Women's hockey has just turned the
corner," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian league was formed through a merger of Ontario and
Quebec teams last autumn. Fennell herself help found the Brampton
Thunder after watching members of the Canadian women's team
returning from the 1998 Olympics in Nagan, Japan.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Quits Republican Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch has
decided to quit the Republican presidential race after a poor
showing in the Iowa caucuses, his adviser said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Utah Senator Hatch, who got only one percent of the vote in the
first presidential voting in Iowa on Monday night, would announce
his decision Wednesday, his adviser said.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor George W. Bush gained 41 Percent of the vote in
the field of six Republican contenders in the party's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts blamed Hatch's poor showing more on a poorly
funded and poorly organized campaign.
</P>
<P>
Hatch, 65, joined the presidential campaign only last July.
Dropping out of the presidential race will allow Hatch to focus on
his re-election campaign to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
He is in his fourth term in the Senate and currently holds the
chair of the Senate's Judiciary Committee.

<P>
Earlier Tuesday, officials said nine gunmen had been killed and
one was believed missing after Thai security forces stormed the
hospital early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
They later revealed that nine of the 10 gunmen had died at the
scene and the 10th was killed in a gun battle after fleeing.
</P>
<P>
Eight Thai police officers, who participated in the attack on
the gunmen which began at about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning (2230

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Blue-chip Giants Team Up to Develop E-commerce (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citibank announced recently that it will partner with kerry
Properties to develop e-commerce. American Express co. inc. said
it is considering launching on-line banking services in Hong Kong,
and discussing with big companies the feasibility of developing e-
commerce.
</P>
<P>
In another alliance announced Monday, Kerry Logistics, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Kerry Properties Ltd., said it would join
forces with Hang Seng Bank in the business-to-customer markets,
offering e-shopping among other things.
</P>
<P>
Their on-line customers will be able to use Hang Seng's secure
Netpayment solution and e-shopping Mastercard, which was launched
by the bank last week with a credit limit of 3,000 HK dollars (384.
6 U.S. dollars), for making payment.
</P>
<P>
Another property firm, Sun Hung Kai and Co., said its
subsidiary Sun Hung Kai Securities would team up with technology
firm New Era of Networks Ltd. with the ambitious goal of
revolutionizing stock trading in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It has become a trend for big companies from different sectors
to join forces in launching e-commerce, said Alex Tang, research
director at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International. "Otherwise, you
will be left behind," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang believed that many blue-chip firms could no longer count
on their core business with the restructuring in Hong Kong's
economy and government's emphasis on developing high-tech and e-
commerce businesses.
</P>
<P>
The recent Internet and e-commerce deals represent "the trend
of the new century," as large companies see e-commerce joint
ventures as a fast way to boost competitiveness, said Kitty Chan,
fund manager with APC Investment and Management service.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts consider big companies' marriage with technology
firms beneficial since it can sharpen their competitive edge in
the information age, thus helping strengthen Hong Kong's position
as an international business, cargo and financial hub.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned that small and medium-sized companies
should prepare themselves for the e-commerce wave, saying they may
disappear in face of increased market competition.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Pardons Former Tehran Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Tuesday pardoned former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, a prominent reformist jailed on graft charges since last
May.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Khamenei
pardoned Karbaschi's remaining prison term upon a proposal of
Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi following
Karbaschi's request.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Fath reported Saturday that Karbaschi had been freed
one day before after serving 260 days of his two-year prison term.
But judicial officials denied the report, saying he was just on a
prison leave.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here earlier that Karbaschi refused to ask for
pardon on the occasion of the Eid-e Fitr on January 8, which marked
the end of Islamic holy fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Now former President Hashemi Rafsanjani was reported to have
played a role in securing Karbaschi's release ahead of the coming
sensitive parliamentary elections on February 18.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi is believed to be a protege of Rafsanjani, who heads
the powerful State Expediency Council. Rafsanjani has announced to
run in the parliamentary election and Karbaschi's pro-reformist
Party of Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI) strongly supports
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a skilled bureaucrat, helped the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami to win the 1997 presidential election. Observers
believed he would contribute a lot to Rafsanjani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
Both the moderates and conservatives have pinned their hopes on
the coming election to assert their power in the political sphere
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives tried to fortify their control over the Majlis
while the moderates anticipated a victory to unseat the
conservative domination to pave the way for political reforms
advocated by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was appointed Tehran mayor by Rafsanjani in 1989 when
the government started post-war reconstruction. Accused of
pocketing public fund and offering financial support to Khatami in
the 1997 presidential election, he was publicly tried in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeals court finally sentenced him to two years in
prison and banned him from taking public office for 10 years.

WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Texas Governor George W. Bush gained a clear victory in
the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday, but his two closest
competitors, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes, who had appealed to
religious conservatives, drew strong support. In the Democratic
contest, Vice President Al Gore defeated former Senator Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
-- An Audit of Germany's Christian Democratic Union found more
than 6.3 million U.S. dollars in illicit contributions under
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The study also showed that the one
million dollars that Kohl has admitted receiving from 1993 to 1998
followed earlier and larger payments.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Toyota Motor Corporation has begun discussions with Ford
Motor Company about joining the U.S. automaker's newly formed
Internet marketplace for suppliers. The move comes less than a
month after General Motors Corporation offered Toyota a similar
invitation to participate in its own Webbased marketplace venture.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's advance appears stalled amid intense house-to-house
fighting in Chechnya's capital as Moscow media challenged official
casualty estimates. Interfax news agency, quoting unnamed
security officials, said 529 Russian soldiers died in the past
month.

<HEADLINE> CIS Summit Vows to Promote Cooperation Among Member States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) agreed here Tuesday to boost their
cooperation in trade, telecommunications, immigration and in the
fight against international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said
leaders of the 12-member organization signed several agreements at
the meeting in the Kremlin covering coordinated anti-monopoly
activities, telecommunications and control of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
"The process of the harmonization of the CIS economic space is
going on," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
There was apparently little progress in the establishment of a
free trade zone at the summit. Russia believes that serious
lawmaking should precede the introduction of common trade
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has suggested that CIS partners hold talks at a
bilateral level on free trade, Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The CIS leaders also decided to work out a program to combat
terrorism. As a first step, they suggested the establishment of a
unified anti-terrorist center.
</P>
<P>
Russia's acting President Vladimir Putin was elected chairman
of the CIS Council, Itar-Tass quoted CIS Executive Secretary Yuri
Yarov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The summit was the 25th since 1991 when the CIS was founded,
which now has 12 members -- Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Georgia.

PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Algerian Foreign
Minister Youssef Yousfi said Tuesday his country intends to build
close ties with France in all fields.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin,
Yousfi said Algeria is determined to promote cooperation with

He briefed Jospin on "the profound change in the political,
economic and security situation" of Algeria since President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika came to power last April.

Bouteflika has convinced most of Algeria's Islamic rebels to
seek peace after nearly 10 years of civil war, which has claimed
the lives of some 100,000 people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit to France,
is the first Algerian foreign minister to visit France since
relations between the two countries experienced rapprochement last
year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Further Banking Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today called
for greater efforts to reform and straighten the banking sector in
order to better serve the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told a national banking, securities and insurance
conference that strict measures must be taken to improve
management and supervision to secure a safe, efficient and stable
banking system.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector and the nation's economic performance are
inseparably linked. The banking industry has not only succeeded in
weathering the Asian financial crisis, but also offset risks
suffered by some financial institutions, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Banking, securities and insurance sectors have contributed
greatly to economic reform and development, as well as social
stability, he said, adding that the country has made major
progress in banking reform with a modern banking organization,
market and supervision system taking shape.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu pointed that there are still many unresolved
problems and hidden troubles that may lead to financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that China's monetary policy should be
strengthened in an effort to boost domestic demand, and improve
economic structures and efficiency. The banking sector should
improve services and provide strong support for national economic
development and reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Strict management and supervision are key to the banking,
securities, and insurance sectors, Zhu said, calling on every
banking institution, every employee to strictly abide to
management procedures, financial laws, regulations, and discipline.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged the banking sector to strive to work honestly
and fight corruption. Special measures should be taken to attract
talent, especially from overseas.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Minister on Sino-EU WTO Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade minister Shi
Guangsheng said here today that China hopes to reach a bilateral
agreement with the European Union (EU) as soon as possible on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
However, China doesn't want to see that the EU would be the
last one to sign a bilateral accord with China on China's
accession to the WTO, said Shi, minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, during his meeting with Ernest-Antoine
Seilliere, chairman of the French Enterprises Movement.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that the EU has always supported China's entry into
the WTO and hoped that the EU would demonstrates its support in
concrete actions at a time that is crucial for China's accession.
</P>
<P>
Reaching an agreement at the earliest possible date is in the
interests of both China and the EU, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Shi stressed that China's entry into the WTO is necessary for
its economic reforms and important for world trade as well.
However, as a developing country, China can only make promises
according to the level of its economic development. China will not
under any circumstances compromise its fundamental interests to
gaining entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China will never make commitment to any country what it cannot
promise though it will do its best to satisfy the specific
requirements of some countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning, China has paid great attention to the
talks with all WTO members, including the EU, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Shi expressed his hope that current negotiation between China
and the EU in Brussels could make major progress.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Adds Flights for Chinese New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) is
increasing flights between Manila and Hong Kong to accommodate the
expected surge in tourist arrivals from Hong Kong and China's
mainland for the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays next month,
Philippine News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
From February 5 to 11, PAL will add 10 extra flights to the
popular route's 24 flights per week, raising the total capacity by
31 percent to 10,855 seats -- the most in any PAL international
network.
</P>
<P>
PAL's total frequency of flights between Manila and Hong Kong
for the one-week Chinese holiday period almost translates to an
average of five flights daily, giving tourists a greater choice of
flight times.
</P>
<P>
On February 9, PAL will upgrade its 279 seater Airbus 330-300
aircraft to the much larger Boeing 747-400 to handle the heavier
passenger load.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing jumbo handles 439 passengers or 57.9 percent more
than the smaller Airbus 330.
</P>
<P>
The rest of PAL's Airbus 330-300 and Boeing 747-400 aircraft
will continue their flights between Manila and Hong Kong during
the one-week holiday period.
</P>
<P>
"These aircraft will make full use of the seating capacity of
the PAL fleet," said David Lim, PAL vice president for sales. "The
shifting of PAL aircraft to service the increased Manila-Hong Kong
flights will not affect the rest of PAL's international flight
schedule."
</P>
<P>
PAL passengers arriving in Manila on the Chinese New Year will
be given souvenir tokens to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The additional PAL flights between Manila and Hong Kong are
expected to increase the number of tourist arrivals in the
Philippines and are part of its cooperative effort to revitalize
the local tourism industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The body of the 10th gunman who
seized a provincial hospital for nearly 24 hours had been found on
Tuesday, the state-run television station Channel 9 confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, officials said nine gunmen had been killed and
one was believed missing after Thai security forces stormed the
hospital early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
They later revealed that nine of the 10 gunmen had died at the
scene and the 10th was killed in a gun battle after fleeing.
</P>
<P>
Eight Thai police officers, who participated in the attack on
the gunmen which began at about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning (2230
GMT Monday) and lasted more than one hour, were injured.
</P>
<P>
All the 500-or-so people who were in the hospital compound when
the ordeal began Monday morning were either freed, had escaped or
were rescued. No hostages were injured during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
A group of 10 gunmen from a Myanmar ethnic Karen guerrilla
faction called "God's Army" seized the hospital in the western
province of Rachaburi on Monday morning, taking hostage more than
500 medical staff and patients.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, wearing camouflage and masks and armed with assault
rifles and hand grenades, were seen firing shots into the air and
planted landmines and bombs in the hospital compound after they
broke in.
</P>
<P>
They had demanded that the Thai government stop shelling their
posts and grant refuge to civilians and combatants.
</P>
<P>
It is the second hostage crisis that has hit Thailand in less
than four months.
</P>
<P>
Last October, five Myanmar students stormed their country's
embassy in Bangkok, holding 38 people hostage for 25 hours, before
being given safe passage to the Myanmar border in exchange for the
safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The five students then hid out with God's Army and at least one
of them was among the 10 gunmen killed Tuesday in the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Breaks out in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic cholera cases which
existed in Mogadishu for more than a month is now changing into an
outbreak of the disease throughout the capital and its surrounding
areas.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals here recorded more than 15 deaths for the cholera
disease on Monday alone.
</P>
<P>
There are also quite a large number of people scattered
throughout the capital who died in their houses before being
admitted to the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The areas worst affected by the disease include the Gubta,
Bermudah, Karan and Medina which are densely populated and have
poor sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The local health authorities in Mogadishu are attributing the
increasing fatalities and the spread of the disease to the lack of
treatment centers and quarantines specialized and equipped for the
cholera.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Osman Mohamud Dufleh, coordinator of the Joint Health
Authority (JHA) of Mogadishu, said the emergency first aid centers
opened by the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) are not
enough for combating this disease.
</P>
<P>
This cholera which the doctors said is of Ogawa type is mainly
being propagated by the poor sanitation and the unclean drinking
water, according to the doctors.
</P>
<P>
The doctors said children are the first targets of this disease
 while the elderly people and weak women are also being affected.
</P>
<P>
The JHA has already begun anti-cholera campaign public
awareness program by using both the printed media as well as the
factional radios of Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion of Black Soil Areas in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Experts said today that areas of
black soil in northeast China's Heilongjiang province is
degenerating as a result of long-term soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the black soil area, covering about 110,000
square kilometers in the Nenjiang Plain and Sanjiang Plain, is
unique in Asia. The only two other black soil areas are found in
eastern Europe and in North America.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the black soil in Heilongjiang is now only
about 20 to 40 centimeters thick, compared with 40 to 100
centimeters 50 years ago. What's more, yellow soil that has very
few organic contents has come in sight in many places.
</P>
<P>
Increasing by only one centimeter every 200 to 400 years, the
black soil is made up of deposit of rot plants and full of natural
organic matters. It is the most fertile soil on earth for
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the organic matters in the black soil
decreased from five percent 50 years ago to the present one to
four percent. And the decrease is going on at an annual rate of 0.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
He Wanyun, a professor at Northeast China Agricultural
University, said, "wind and water erosion is the main reason for
the degeneration of the black soil." To date, 15 percent of the
black soil has been washed away, leaving the barren yellow soil in
sight.
</P>
<P>
Excessive agricultural development is also a major contributing
factor, He said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, the Chinese government mobilized a
large number of migrants to Heilongjiang for land reclamation. Now
the province has become the country's largest grain production
base with an annual output exceeding 30 million tons, accounting
for six percent of China's total. More than 67 percent of the
grain in Heilongjiang is harvested on the black soil areas.
</P>
<P>
However, due to excessive development and utilization of
chemical fertilizers in large amounts, the soft black soil has
been hardening, and soil nutrient is no longer balanced. This has
posed a threat to the sustainable agricultural growth in
Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that urgent measures such as planting trees and
grass, building irrigation works, and rotating crops, must be done
to stop environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
To date, action has been made to actively curb soil erosion in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the government prohibited felling trees in the forests
on Dahinggan and Xiaohinggan mountains.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the Heilongjiang provincial government
prohibited reclaiming new land to protect the existing one million
hectares of untouched land suitable for agricultural production,
the last of its kind in China.

<HEADLINE> Fog Affects Flights at Hainan's Major Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 flights in and out
of Hainan's Meilan International Airport have been delayed or
canceled due to heavy fog covering the southern China island
province since last Friday, airport authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, more than 50 of 182 scheduled flights were delayed
and nine of them canceled as a result of the heavy fog, affecting
nearly 1,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Although it turned to the better this morning, five flights
were delayed due to bad weather conditions at some hinterland
airports.
</P>
<P>
The local weather bureau said that the fog was caused by the
combination of local warm air currents and a strong cold airflow
from northern China. The foggy weather is expected to continue for
a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
In early February during the lunar Chinese New Year, the number
of flights is predicted to increase from 100 to more than 300 per
day, carrying 30,000 passengers daily, three times more than the
same period last year.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Tuesday urged Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad to continue
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in order to achieve a lasting peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the officials from Israel's military establishment,
Barak said Assad is the man who can honor his word and inking an
agreement with Syria could be the turning point for realizing a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Urging the Syrians to attend a new round of the peace talks,
Barak said that Israel will do everything it can to move the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of the peace talks last December, Israel
and Syria have concluded two rounds of negotiations in the United
States. But the third round, slated for last Wednesday also in the
United States, has been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons for the postponement, the Syrians accused the
Israeli side for refusing to write down a promise to withdraw from
the Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967 line.
</P>
<P>
The borders, water, security arrangement and normalization of
ties are the key issues for the Israeli-Syrian talks. All these
issues are linked with the Israel's return to Syria of the Golan
Heights, which Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin
Indyk, said here Tuesday that the U.S. will try its best to help
push the Israeli-Syrian track ahead.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his credential to President Ezer Weizman, Indyk said
that the U.S. contacts with the Israeli and Syrian sides are
continuing and the U.S. administration will decide soon what
measures will be taken to move the Israel-Syrian track forward.

ALGIERS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's security forces have
killed 49 Islamic insurgents and arrested 22 others during a
combing operation on the hideouts of the rebel Al-Ahwal group.
</P>
<P>
The raid, which was launched last Friday in a mountainous,

Algeria has been rocked by Islamic insurgency which had left

<HEADLINE> China's SOE Reforms Succeeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) revealed today that the country's state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) achieved an upturn in 1999, in many cases
ending the losses of recent years.
</P>
<P>
SETC Minister Sheng Huaren said at a press conference that the
added value of industry last year gained a year-on-year increase
of 8.9 percents, more than the anticipated 8 percent, and he
believes China will be able to complete the three-year-target for
SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China initiated major annexing and bankruptcy
policies, the debt-to-equity conversion policy, and encouraged
technology renovation in ailing SOEs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 435 large- and medium-sized enterprises went
bankrupt or closed. The country plans to utilize 70 billion yuan
to handle non-performing loans and help more than 860 SOEs come
out of the red.
</P>
<P>
The SETC has recommended that 601 SOEs sign debt-to-equity swap
agreements with financial asset management companies, and 78 of
them have already signed such agreements with financial asset
management companies, involving 112.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The government also provided concession loans to some SOEs to
renovate their technologies, and has invested 171.8 billion yuan
to set up 647 technology-renovation projects. China hopes these
projects will help raise the competitive edge of the goods
produced by its major industrial sectors.

<HEADLINE> China Offers Tax Reduction for Foreign-Funded Ventures in Western Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to offer a
reduced income tax rate of 15 percent for an additional three
years to foreign-invested ventures in its central and western
regions, the State Administration of Taxation said today.
</P>
<P>
The new policy, which has been in effect since January 1, is
aimed at encouraging overseas businessmen to invest in these
regions, where economic development lags behind that of the
eastern coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The regions include 19 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, namely, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jilin,
Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing,
Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia
and Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises in China are entitled to a three-
year tax reduction and exemption under the Chinese law. When the
term expires, according to the new policy, overseas-invested
enterprises in the central and western regions will enjoy another
three years of preferential tax rate. The rate can be further
reduced to 10 percent when an enterprise's annual export is
confirmed to account for more than 70 percent of its annual output
value.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a nationwide campaign for an overall
development of the central and western parts of the country, and
this new policy is seen as one of the newest moves to promote
economic growth in these areas.

BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The China National
Accreditation Committee for Laboratories (CNACL) recently signed
the Asia-Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation Mutual
Recognition Arrangement (APLAC-MRA).
</P>
<P>
This signing indicates that China's laboratory accreditation
system is recognized internationally, and will facilitate the
country's entry to the World Trade Organization, as well as
further develop international trade and economic cooperation in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xinmin, deputy director of the department of international
cooperation under the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision, said today that laboratory accreditation is a
worldwide system for evaluating the management level and technical
ability of laboratories.
</P>
<P>
This accreditation system is conducive to removing trade
barrier and pushing forward international trade and technological
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Multi-lateral recognition in laboratory accreditation also will
avoid repeated measuring and adjustments, and test results in an
accredited lab will be recognized by all signatories to the
agreement, said one bureau technical official.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the socialist market economy in
China, a national lab accreditation system was imperative in trade
and economic operation, the official said.

Thus far, a total of 13 laboratory accreditation organizations
in countries and regions including China, Australia, Singapore,
the United States, and Japan have signed the APLAC-MRA agreement.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Life Science and Chemical Industry Grow Robustly in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's chemical industry
and life science industry grew 8.4 percent and 74.5 percent
respectively in 1999, generating a total output of 30 billion
Singapore dollars (about 18 billion U.S. dollars) or 22.3 percent
of the total manufacturing sector's output in the year.
</P>
<P>
Tan Suan Swee, director of (Chemicals &AMP; Life Science) Industry
Development Division, the Economic Development Board of Singapore,
gave out the data at a press conference Tuesday, saying all sub-
clusters of the chemical industry -- petroleum, petrochemicals,
and specialty chemicals -- recorded positive growth.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the life science industry generated an output of 6.3
billion Singapore dollars (about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars) and a
value-added of 5.2 billion Singapore dollars (3.1 billion U.S.
dollars), surging up by 59.7 and 74.5 percent respectively
compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
On the petroleum industry in Singapore, Tan said the sub-
cluster registered a 6.8 percent output growth which was tempered
by rising crude oil prices following OPEC's decision to cut oil
production in April 1999 and stronger regional competition.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the robust growth in petrochemical largely to the
start-up of 11 projects which came on stream with a collective
investment of 1.9 billion Singapore dollars (1.13 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tan said the output and value-added growth in the specialty
chemicals sector reached 6.8 percent and 11.9 percent respectively
as demand for electronic chemicals increased and some major
electronicals plants went into operation.
</P>
<P>
On the progress in developing Jurong Island into a world-class
hub, Tan said the southwestern off-shore cluster of seven small
islands is hosting 21 billion Singapore dollars (12.5 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of investments from numerous leading petroleum and
chemical companies, adding there are 50 chemical and other related
companies on the island employing a workforce of more than 6,000.
</P>
<P>
Tan also said the chemical industry is expected to grow in 2000
with more new plants going into production.

<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Army Council has
approved the retirement of eight major generals and 341 officers
in its renewed effort to reposition the force for its
constitutional role, media here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Army Staff Major General Victor Malu announced the
council's approval of the retirement at a press briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malu announced the approval of 478 officers for
promotion to various ranks in the armed forces, saying that "this
is one and only way the army can be replenished or re-injected
with new blood if it must remain vibrant and responsive to
national calls."
</P>
<P>
The army chief said that the army was compelled to take the
step in keeping with the new political dispensation.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory retirement of army officers is based on health,
indiscipline and inability to meet up with service requirements as
stated in the terms and conditions of service of the Nigerian
Army, Malu said.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed the retirement of 16 military personnel who
had served as security officers, military assistants, special
assistants and chairmen of task forces in the regime of late
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that "another category of retirement
considered by the council were those who applied to leave the

DAR ES SALAAM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Mwalimu Nyerere
Foundation has criticized Zanzibari President Salmin Amour for his
move to change the isle' s constitution to allow himself to run
for a third term, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional change should originate from the grass root
level instead of people who are incumbent, Executive Director of
the Nyerere foundation, Joseph Butiku, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that President Salmin's followers in the ruling
Chama Cha Mapinduzi or CCM party are seeking to change Zanzibar's
constitution to allow him to run for an unprecedented third term.
</P>
<P>
Butiku, former personal assistant to late Tanzanian founding

president to respect the constitution and not to agitate for
change for personal interests.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964 after a revolt that ousted the Sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the island.

<HEADLINE> China Ordnance Company Reports Surging Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The China South Industrial
Group Corp. (China South), a large state-owned ordnance enterprise,
reported a 34.8 percent rise in its total industrial output value
and a 17.9 percent sales growth for 1999, figures reflecting the
strong growth of the company's civil-products sector, China South'
s general manager Wang Dechen said here today.
</P>
<P>
China South was established last year with approval of the
State Council, and along with the research and production of
military products, it has wide-ranging mix of civil products
including mini-cars, motorcycles, and medicines.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the company manufactured 173,000 mini-cars and sold
170,000 of them, ranking third in the country's automobile
industry. It also produced 1.53 million motorcycles and sold 1.6
million, dipping into its stocks, to rank first in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chang'an Automobile Group under China South has a
production capacity of 200,000 mini-cars annually, while the group
's motorcycle manufacturer can produce 3 million motorcycles a
year.
</P>
<P>
With China's entry into the World Trade Organization in sight,
Chang'an has stepped up development of new products. Last year, "
the Star of Chang'an," its new car model, successfully passed
several crash tests, making the model the only one in China to
meet international standards in this regard. The price of Chang'an
cars is also competitive on the international market.
</P>
<P>
While China South's motorcycle sector continues to expand in
the domestic market, they also have gained a share of the world
market, exporting 79,000 motorcycles last year and earning more
than 42 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the company will give priority to developing civil
products this year and improve its management for even greater
economic returns.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Turkish Hezbollah Militants Detained in Week-long Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish police have arrested
283 Hezbollah militants in a week-long crackdown on the separatist
terror Islamic group, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of the victims killed by the Turkish Hezbollah rose
to 33 on Monday following the discovery of two bodies of the
victims in the Mersin town of Tarsus Province and neighboring Adana
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah, reported to have no connection with the
pro-Iranian Lebanese group of a similar name, wants to set up an
Islamic republic ruled by strict Shariah law in constitutionally
secular but overwhelmingly muslim Turkey. It launched a series of
terrorist attacks recently, which targetted businessmen
particularly.
</P>
<P>
Police began a nation-wide dragnet against Hezbollah with a raid
on a three-storey villa in Istanbul's Uskudar District on January
17, during which the group's leader, Huseyin Velioglu, was shot
dead and two other key members, Edip Gumus and Cemal Tutar, were
captured.
</P>
<P>
The two hardcore members confessed that the group abducted and
killed 40 businessmen in recent months and their testimony led
police to some other Hezbollah hideouts across the country, where
dozens of victim bodies were discovered subsequently.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah was formed and grew up in the 1980s in the
turbulent southeast Turkey, where it vied with Abdullah Ocalan's
Turkish Worker's Party for control of territory, a fact leading
many to accuse Hezbollah of being a state-sponsored contra-
guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
As the inference hit the headlines of local press, General Staff
of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) issued a stern statement Monday
denying the allegation, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret over the reports which said, "The
TSK was in a fundamentalism paranoia" and so on. However, the
statement did not name the press organs carrying the reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Amid reports that President Ezer Weizman has agreed to
curtain some of his duties during the police probe into his
acceptance of cash gifts, parliamentary members have launched
campaigns to impeach him or strip him of his powers.
</P>
<P>
Likud lawmaker Michael Eitan Monday tried to collect signatures
for a bill that will strip Weizman of his powers until the end of
the criminal investigation. A second Likud lawmaker, Yisrael Katz,
is moving to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite U.S. expectations that Syria would send two "
technical experts" to Washington to continue discussing a peace
treaty between Israel and Syria, Damascus did not send the experts.
Two Israeli experts are leaving Tuesday for Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sought Monday to alleviate
concern that Israel is becoming distracted from the peace process
with the Palestinians because of the talks with Syria, saying the
talks with the Palestinians will be promoted on all levels.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and Palestinian sources announced plans Monday for a
series of negotiating sessions to meet a February 13 deadline on
the outline of the final-status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office said that negotiations will be held on several
levels "with the intent of speeding up the talks." Palestinian
officials said the talks will likely start February 1 somewhere
near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The strike of kindergarten and elementary school teachers is
set to enter its ninth day Tuesday, after Education Minister Yossi
Sarid and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat failed in late night
talks to bridge the gap between the treasury and the teacher's
union on a wage dispute.
</P>
<P>
The strike is also having political repercussions. Likud
lawmaker Limor Livnat Monday submitted a motion of no-confidence
against Barak.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Collects 3 Million Pencils for Iraqi Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A pro-Iraqi committee in Jordan
has collected three million pencils as donations to Iraqi children
in defiance of the decade-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq, committee
sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Mobilization Committee for the Defense of Iraq said
the number of pencils they collected has crossed the three-million
mark thanks to the widespread support from the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The independent committee, representing political parties and
trade unions, launched a nationwide "one million pencils" campaign
last December for the Iraqi children, whom the committee said has
been deprived of their basic rights of education by the sweeping
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was aimed at collecting pencils from all walks of
life in the kingdom as a show of solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Pencils are part of the items embargoed for Iraq under the
sanctions as graphite used for pencils can also be used for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Baghdad by the United Nations
after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990 which touched off the
Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The largest contribution by individuals so far came from British
Member of Parliament George Galloway who donated 10,000 pencils
during his visit to Amman earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Galloway has also vowed to launch a similar pencil-collecting
campaign in Britain for Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been mending its ties with Gulf Arab states which
were damaged during the Gulf war, during which the kingdom was
found
to be sympathetic with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the kingdom also tried to save and keep its
traditionally friendly ties with Iraq, currently its only supplier
of crude oil and oil products.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, under the U.N. oil-for-food program for Iraq, gets 75,
000 barrels of crude oil everyday from Iraq, half as free grants
and the rest at a preferential price.

<HEADLINE> Anwar's Sodomy Trial Resumes in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The joint sodomy trial of
Malaysian former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and his
adopted brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja resumed Tuesday
after a two-month break with Anwar finishing his defense of
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's counsel, Karpal Singh, told High Court judge Arifin
Jaka that Anwar had finished his defense of "a high level
conspiracy" to topple him and will start with defense of alibi
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, and Sukma, 38, are separately charged with
sodomizing Azizan Abu Bakar, 39, the former driver of Anwar's wife
Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. Meanwhile Sukma, a businessman, faces
another charge of abetting Anwar in sodomizing Azizan.
</P>
<P>
Anwar took the stand and spent about two hours continuing his
testimony in the trial, telling the court that Azizan made the
allegations after he met certain personalities which he claimed as
the conspirators because Azizan was in financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The trial was postponed on November 10 last year during Anwar's
testimony after the judge complained of a backache and later was
advised by a doctor to rest.
</P>
<P>
Arifin fixed January 25 to continue hearing the case after
meeting on December 18 last year all the parties involved in the
trial.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's tourist
industry has been urged to promote sports and recreational
activities aggressively to attract more young tourists to the
country.
</P>

officials of the Le Tour de Langkawi 2000 cycling race, which
begins Wednesday, in the northern resort island of Langkawi,

sporting and recreational activities such as deep-sea diving, go-
karting and cross-country cycling to attract the younger
generation of travelers.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's commitment in promoting sporting
events and sporting excellence was reflected in the modern state-
of-the-art facilities, delivering efficient organization in terms
of logistical planning, event promotion and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
He said Le Tour de Langkawi was unique because it used the
entire country as its venue, resulting in 600 million viewers

<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish General Staff denied the alleged connection
between the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and Hezbollah, saying that
an initiative to directly or indirectly link the terror group with
the TSK is a big slander incompatible with reason and logic.

Someone claimed that the TSK might use Hezbollah to combat the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).

Hezbollah, an Islamic terrorist organization in Turkey which

Sharia religious law, is being suppressed by the Turkish Security
Forces across the country for murders, kidnapping and blackmail.

<P>
-- The chief prosecutor of the Turkish supreme court, Vural
Savas, said that religious reactionary posed a threat to the state
security.
He made the remark while talking about the case of outlawing the
pro-Islamic Virtue Party.
</P>
<P>
He said that the testimonies of arrested Hezbollah militants
would be evaluated and taken into consideration by political
parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the Virtue Party has denied that it had connection with
the Hezbollah which advocated to turn secular but overwhelming
Moslem Turkey into a strictly Islamic-ruled country by means of
violence.

ministry was working on a plan to offer an increased subsidy on
diesel oil for farmers, one of the most important investments in
farm production.
</P>
<P>
He said that the existing subsidy was insufficient as the
agricultural sector accounted for 20 percent of Turkey's total
diesel oil consumption of around 9 million tons a year.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israelis to Hold More Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiating teams are planning for a series of sessions in the near
future to meet a February 13 deadline for the outline of the final
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians will be held on
several levels with the intent of speeding up the talks, said
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Office on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which is likely to start on February 1 somewhere near
Washington, will address the sensitive issues of borders, refugees,
the status of Jerusalem and the future of Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories, said Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The talks were planned amid accusations that Barak is favoring
the Syrian over the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Barak wanted to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Davos, but
as Clinton will be there for only a few hours on Saturday morning
and Barak will arrive that night, such a meeting is impossible,
said the office.
</P>
<P>
And a U.S. official reportedly said Monday that the Americans
have not pushed for a three-way summit between Clinton, Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Davos, as there is "not at all
that much to talk about."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli-Syrian peace talks have also been held up
due to Syria's accusations that Israel refuses to write down its
promise to withdraw from the Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967
line.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967
Mideast war and annexed it in 1981. The fate of the strategic
plateau has been the core of the Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Two Syrian experts were scheduled to be in Washington on Monday,
to explain their reactions to the "working document" prepared by
the U.S.. The document outlined positions on all the key issues
concerning the peace talks and U.S. suggestions for their
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli experts, led by head of the Israeli-Syrian
negotiating team Uri Saguy, are to leave Tuesday for Washington.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Help Jordan in Huge Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Libya has agreed to help Jordan
build a multi-million-dollar water delivery project to supply more
fresh water to the capital city of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The project involves installment of a 325-kilometer-long
pipeline to draw water from the 300,000-year-old Disi aquifer in
the south to Amman, the semi-official Jordan Times newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Libya sent a team of experts to Jordan to conduct feasibility
studies on the project last summer.
</P>
<P>
The proposed delivery system will provide Amman with 100 million
cubic meters of water annually for about 30 years to address the
chronic water shortage problem in the capital, which is home to
nearly one third of the country's 4.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
Jordan depends on rainfalls for over half of its human,
industrial and agricultural water needs, but water supplies are not
stable and sufficient during dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
The government has invited 51 local and foreign companies to bid
for the Disi-Amman project on a build, operate and transfer basis.
</P>
<P>
The project, which needs a total investment of 730 million U.S.
dollars, may turn out to be another financial burden on the desert
kingdom which is already suffering from a total foreign debt of
some 7.8 billion dollars by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the Disi aquifer might be the best choice available so
far for fresh water as the cost of desalination of sea water from
the Red Sea in the south could triple the cost of fresh water,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, around 50 million cubic meters of water is drawn
annually from the Disi aquifer by privately-owned companies under a
negligible fee under a 25-year concession agreement granted
by the government in 1985, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Water experts said the aquifer has already been over-exploited
as its water level is dropping by 80 to 85 centimeters each year,
and agricultural water usage in the area must be stopped to pave
the way for the project.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Vice President Urges Maluku People to End Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice President
Tuesday urged all parties in Maluku to end their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"At the saturation point of the conflict all must be changed
into a process of peace making," she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before Christians at Maranatha Church in Ambon,
capital of Maluku province, Megawati stressed that conflicts would
never benefit any parties.
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts will always be disadvantageous to all and are not
desired by any religions," she was quoted by the Antara News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating a statement made earlier by President Abdurrahman
Wahid, the vice president said that the Maluku people had to
settle their own problems and that once the community decided to
do so, everything would be easy.
</P>
<P>
Megawati said the government will of course encourage a peace-
making process in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"My large entourage shows the government's attention to and
responsibility for what has happened," she added.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Megawati, who is on a three-day visit to Maluku,
were a number of Cabinet ministers, including Coordinating
Minister for Political Affairs and Security Gen. Wiranto,
Indonesian Military Commander Adm. Widodo A.S., Coordinating
Minister of People's Welfare Basri Hasanudin.
</P>
<P>
The vice president is slated to have a meeting with a number of
community and religious figures at the governor's office and have
a dialog with the Maluku Community National Reconciliatory Center
in Ambon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, conflict-torn Ambon was quite peaceful
when the vice president was there. Raids have continued to be
conducted by security apparatuses but the community's activities
went on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has witnessed a year long ethnic bloodshed between
Christian and Muslim, which has claimed more than 1,300 civilians.

in Asia, given its favorable geographic conditions and rich
natural forests.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the establishment of this zoo will raise
public awareness on wildlife species in Cambodia. The zoo will be
critical in bridging the gaps between human and animal worlds,
arousing the spirit of love, care and protection of wildlife and
the environment for the next generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
This zoo was established with the aim to reverse the trends of
wildlife degradation and uncontrolled exploitation and to preserve
and rescue rare and endangered wildlife species in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>

has been continuously developed for 5 years. Now, 80 hectares of
the total area have been established as national Zoo, and up to 1,

TOKYO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 Japanese residents in

In a press release, the USFK said it Monday proposed a meeting
at the truce village of Panmunjom with the DPRK Panmunjom mission
after the latter's press recently alleged that the former had made
armistice violations.
</P>
<P>
"The North Korean Panmunjom Mission ignored the meeting and
gave no reason," the USFK charged in the release.
</P>
<P>
The USFK said the "false accusations," which have appeared in
the DPRK press recently, highlight the desire of Pyongyang to "
artificially increase tensions on the Korean peninsula."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that propaganda by Pyongyang is "not productive
to maintaining the armistice and reducing the threat of
confrontation on the peninsula."
</P>
<P>
The USFK added that it remains ready to meet with its DPRK
counterpart at any time to discuss the continued stability along
the Demilitarized Zone.

CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Women's number two seed
Lindsay Davenport is through to the semi-finals of the Australian
Open on Tuesday with a 6-1, 6-2 demolition of French number nine
seed Julie Halard-Decugis.
</P>
<P>
Only a rain delay between the two sets and an unlikely service
break when Davenport was serving for the match pushed the duration
beyond an hour, as the big-hitting American was untroubled in
victory.
</P>
<P>
Davenport will now meet compatriot Jennifer Capriati in the
semi-finals after she had a similarly effortless win over Japanese
Ai Sugiyami earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Davenport's form going into the semi is faultless - she is yet
to lose a set in the tournament and has conceded just 24 games in
five matches.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Overseas Funds to Develop Offshore Oil and Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) is exploring new ways and channels to expand Sino-
foreign cooperation in tapping the country's vast offshore oil and
gas resources.
</P>
<P>
According to CNOOC President Wei Liucheng, China has huge
offshore oil and gas resources, estimated at 25 billion tons and
14 trillion cu m, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the proven offshore oil and gas reserves in China
account for only five percent of the country's total estimated
resources, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only by dramatically increasing Sino-foreign
cooperation in this sector, can China speed up offshore oil and
gas development.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the foreign oil giants have shown intense
interest in investing in China's offshore oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has had nearly 140 contracts with over 70
companies in 18 countries and regions to jointly develop these
resources, utilizing a total of nearly 7 billion US dollars in
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Through Sino-foreign joint efforts, China has sunk more than
400 exploratory wells and verified more than 100 oil and gas-
bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that the country is planning to develop more oil and
gas blocks in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea
through Sino-foreign cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC produced 16.17 million tons of offshore oil and 4.39
billion cu m of gas in 1999, earning profits of 2.75 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in China Drops in 1999 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic globalization has resulted in a change in world
capital flow. The amount of cross-nation investment in 1998, for
instance, doubled compared with that of 1997, and 90 percent of
the investment was conducted among the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, one of China's main investors, the Asia-
Pacific region, was hit hard by financial crisis with a subsequent
decline in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, investment in China from the European Union
nations and the United States also declined.
</P>
<P>
But experts say China has new opportunities to attract
investment this year as the country opens wider to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
China's national economy is maintaining steady growth and
further reforms are being carried out, they point out, adding that
the government has adopted new opening measures following the
breakthrough in the process of entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Asia's economy has gradually recovered as well.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of overseas investment in China will continue to be
quite large in 2000, and this investment will flow to where China
need it most," said one analyst, who preferred to remain anonymous.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Displeasure over EP's Biased Human Rights Accusation against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China expressed strong
displeasure and opposition over a recent resolution passed by the
European Parliament (EP) criticizing China's human rights
situation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a
regular press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament assembly passed a resolution on China's
human rights situation on January 20. Zhu said it was a document
that "contains no objective facts, randomly criticizes China's
human rights situation and its policy on ethnic minorities, has
free and irresponsible remarks on China's decision to outlaw the
Falun Gong cult, and deliberately distorts the implementation of '
one country, two systems' in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the resolution even openly appealed to link the
development of China-Europe relations and China's accession into
the World Trade Organization with those so-called human rights
issues. Also, the organization attempted to join the United States
for a common anti-China resolution at the United Nations Human
Rights convention.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that EP's this move "disregarded the marked
achievements scored by China on the construction of democracy and
rule of law and took no account of the growth of Sino-European
relationship."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that it was known by all without prejudice that
the Chinese government has made great efforts to promote and
protect human rights and scored noteworthy accomplishments in the
regard. "To run the country by law has been added into China's
Constitution. The construction of democracy and legal system has
also seen active progress. Thanks to all these efforts, the
Chinese people have enjoyed ever better social, economic and
cultural rights and China now has the best human rights situation
in its history," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and Europe in recent years have had a
series of dialogues on human rights, during which both sides
developed sound ways to handle their differences with conversation
instead of confrontation. "Past practices have proven that the
conversation on the basis of mutual trust is an effective way to
handle the differences between both sides. And there is no way out
if the two sides handle them with confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that the European side to proceed from the overall
growth of bilateral ties and take concrete measures to eliminate
the adverse effect of the anti-China resolution so as to ensure
the further development of China-Europe constructive partnership.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua)-- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said today on a regular press conference that China's
accession into the Indian Ocean Rim Association of Regional
Cooperation (IORARC) will help boost China's friendly ties with
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The special session of the IORARC Council of Ministers held in
Oman from January 22 to 23 accepted China as a dialogue member,
Zhu said, and thanked relevant countries for their support.
</P>
<P>
Zhu praised the Association for having assumed an active role
in promoting regional economic cooperation and common development
among its members.
</P>
<P>
Although China is not a country along the Indian Ocean Rim,
China has had "sound political relations with all countries of the
Association and both sides enjoy tremendous potentials for
economic and trade cooperation", he noted.
</P>
<P>
He promised that China will actively participate in cooperation
projects of the Association, promote common development among its
members and enhance existing cooperation with regional countries.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing, with all the countries of the Association,
to make concerted efforts to the establishment of a new
international political and economic order", he said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in March 1997 with headquarters in Mauritius, the
IORARC is the only organization of countries around the Indian
Ocean rim as a tool to promote their economic cooperation. The
association has 19 members at the moment.

<HEADLINE> Dubai to Help Sudan Set Up Free Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Dubai, the second largest
emirate of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has signed two memoranda
of understanding with Sudan for the establishment of free zones in
the African state.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to exchange technical experience in handling
container operations and port-related activities, the local Gulf
News daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first memo is for the setting up of free zones on Sudan's
borders with Egypt, Libya, Central Africa, Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia,
Uganda, Chad and Eritrea, said Sultan Bin Sulayem, chairman of
Dubai Ports Authority (DPA) and managing director of Dubai's Jebel
Ali Free Zone Authority.
</P>
<P>
The second one calls for exchanging experience in terminal
handling, maintenance of port equipments, information systems,
development of human resources aimed at delivering best port
services, marketing and attracting shipping lines, said the
official, who paid a visit to Sudan recently.
</P>
<P>
"DPA and the Sudanese Free Zones and Free Shops Co. will
cooperate. The former will lend its experience to Sudan, which is
currently setting up a free zone on the Red Sea," the official was
quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation in port management will also be fruitful,
the official said. "We have already managed Jiddah port in Saudi
Arabia and Beirut port in Lebanon," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Dubai's cooperation with Sudan has the potential to open
up an even wider market in Africa, which may also extend to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Commends Thai Actions on Hostage Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
commended the Thai authorities for its actions on settling the
gunmen's 24-hour hostage drama which took place in a provincial
Thai hospital on Monday, according to a press release issued here
by the Office of the Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Ministry of
Defense Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official statement said that "Myanmar would like to commend
the Thai government for its decisive way in handling and
protecting its citizens from the perils of terrorism and making it
a glaring example that under no pretext of guise can terrorism be
accepted."
</P>
<P>
"It is a definitely well-imaged concern for the world community
where terrorism is becoming a choice-weapon in this new millennium
for all extremists and radicals around the world," it added.
</P>
<P>
A group of some 10 gunmen stormed a hospital in Thailand's
western province of Rachaburi early Monday and took more than 500
medical staff and patients as hostages.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen are believed to be from a Karen splinter group known
as "God's Army," a band of about 100 fighters which broke away
from Myanmar's Karen National Union ethnic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has closed its border with Myanmar and tightened
border surveillance after the Myanmar government troops began a
drive against the ethnic Karen anti-government armed groups living
along the border.
</P>
<P>
Thai security forces early Tuesday stormed the hospital taken
over by the 10 gunmen, killing nine of them and rescuing all the
hostages trapped in the hospital. The remaining gunman is missing.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Mwalimu Nyerere
Foundation has received a total of 9.6 million U.S. dollars in
donation for facilitating the Burundi peace talks during the past
four years, media here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Butiku, Executive Director of the foundation, said
Monday that the funds include contributions from 26 donor
countries, the Organization of African Unity, the United Nations
and its agencies.
</P>
<P>
Butiku said that In principle, the new facilitator for Burundi
peace talks, former South African President Nelson Mandela has
accepted the existing facilitation machinery set up by his
predecessor, late Tanzanian founding president Julius Nyerere,
including the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a closed-door meeting in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha, Mandela urged the donors to offer more help for the
Burundi peace process which is expected to resume in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
According to head of the facilitation team, Judge Mark Bomani,
the Burundi peace talks have already swallowed about eight million
dollars.

dollars, which will mostly be used to cover the administrative
costs and transportation fees.
</P>
<P>

committed to the African unity program on the peace process in
Burundi, the millennium agenda for culture of peace, good

<P>
KAMPALA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has called on the international community to support the
implementation of the Lusaka peace accord for the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Radio Uganda said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the call while addressing a special session on
the DRC issue in the United Nations headquarters in New York
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The world body should set up a committee to oversee the
implementation of the peace accord signed in Lusaka in July and
August last year by all the parties directly involved in the DRC
conflict, the Ugandan president noted.
</P>
<P>
He said a national conference should be held in the DRC to
bring together all the different parties and decide on the
political future of the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
African leaders, especially leaders in the Great Lakes region,
should try to facilitate the national dialog in a bid to end the
17-month civil war, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace agreement has not been effectively implemented
due to unbridged differences among the stakeholders of the
conflict and on-and-off exchange of fire between the DRC
government troops and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Urged to Tap New Oil Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's dependency on
foreign petroleum will mount sharply in just a few years unless
there are significantly new discoveries inside the country's
economic zone,New Zealand Oil and Gas (NZOG) Managing Director
Tony Badford Tuesday was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is 42 percent self-sufficient in oil but outputs
from the mature onshore Taranake fields and the giant offshore
Maui field along the west coast of North Island are declining, New
Zealand Press Association (NZPA) quoted Badford as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for sustained oil exploration in New
Zealand's offshore waters.
</P>
<P>
"The best hopes for discoveries of the magnitude needed to
reduce the reliance on foreign oil lie offshore," Badford said.
</P>
<P>
"Over a lengthy period NZOG has carried out some ground-
breaking work with a regional database of 12,000 kilometers of
seismic and as a result we have found prospects in the West Maui
permit area which appears to have world-class reservoirs like
those in the adjacent Maui field," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in the Maui production area, flow rates
from wells have been as high as 37,000 barrels of oil a day,
compared with New Zealand's total oil production of around 50,000
barrels of oil daily.
</P>
<P>
"The costs to drill are high, but so are the stakes. There is a
potential reward of 300 million barrels of recoverable oil from
structural dip closures and much larger quantities potentially
trapped in a stratigraphic closure," Badford said.

An Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey found 4.8
million or 27 percent of Australians were receiving income support
from the government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
That was up from 11 percent of the population receiving social
security benefits in the booming economy of the 1960s and early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
Almost 4 million people were receiving social security
allowances, while 388,000 were on service pensions and 385,000
were on student benefits.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the steady greying of Australia, the number of aged
pension recipients grew from around 780,000 in 1970 to more than 1.
6 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the Income Support Payments in Australia study also
found the proportion of elderly people on benefits had fluctuated
from a high of almost 80 percent in 1978 to around 66 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The study follows the federal government's announcement last
year on welfare reform, with recommendations to be handed to
Family and Community Services Minister Jocelyn Newman in June this
year.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the National Press Club last September, Newman
highlighted the explosive growth in welfare and the need to rein
in some areas against a trend to lower government spending.
</P>
<P>
The speech reflected the Howard government's call for the
development of a social coalition between government, business and
charities as a way of better sharing the cost of welfare support.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Thai Hospital Drama Ends with Limited Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The 24-hour hostage drama in a
provincial hospital in Thailand ended Tuesday with limited
casualties, as nine out of 10 Myanmar gunmen taking over the
hospital were killed when Thai forces launched an assault.
</P>
<P>
One of the gunmen escaped after the attack. The Thai police are
pursuing him and have vowed to bring him to justice once he is
arrested.
</P>
<P>
About eight Thais were injured in the action, including at
least two police officers, who participated in the attack on the
gunmen beginning at about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning (22:30 GMT
Monday) and lasting more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
So far, new doctors and nurses have been sent to the hospital
to replace their exhausted colleagues to treat patients who still
remain in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police have begun clearing the site.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 seriously ill patients have been transferred to
another hospital in the provincial town.
</P>
<P>
A group of 10 gunmen from a Myanmar ethnic Karen guerrilla
faction called "God's Army" stormed the hospital on Monday morning,
taking more than 500 medical staff and patients hostage.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, wearing camouflage and masks and armed with assault
rifles and hand- grenades, were seen firing guns in the air and
planted landmines and bombs in the hospital compound after they
broke in.
</P>
<P>
The 770-bed hospital is in Thailand's western province of
Rachaburi, some 120 kilometers west of Bangkok and 48 kilometers
east of the Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
The armed guerrillas were believed to have hijacked a bus near
the border and forced the driver to take them to downtown
Rachaburi, where they captured the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen released some 50 people, some in exchange for food,
after Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Surayut Chulanont agreed to
their initial demands to stop shelling their military base and let
injured guerrillas receive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people managed to escape from the hospital as the
gunmen and the Thai government stuck in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After seizing the hospital, the armed guerrillas had demanded
that the Thai government stop supporting Rangoon on its current
cracking down on the ethnic Karen rebels along the Thai-Myanmar
border and asked the international community to put pressure on
the Myanmar government to stop the fighting and allow the Karen
refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government began a drive against Karen rebels
recently. Heavy fighting had driven some 1,000 Karen refugees into
neighboring Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai troops tightened their border surveillance to prevent
the fighting from spilling over to the Thai soil.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen later asked for two helicopters to transport them to
the Thai-Myanmar border and demanded that 10 medical staff be
taken as hostage.
</P>
<P>
The Thai negotiators told the gunmen that they would consider
their demands but at the same time worked out a plan to launch the
final assault.
</P>
<P>
The hospital drama awoke Thai people's recent memory of a
similar seizure of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok by five Myanmar
students last October.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1999, five heavily-armed students took over the
embassy for 25 hours, holding 38 people hostage and trapping 96
people in the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
They were later given safe passage to the Thai-Myanmar border
in exchange for the safe release of the hostages, an act that
angered the Myanmar government, which closed its border with
Thailand for two months.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that God's Army has been providing refuge for
the five students, calling themselves "Vigorous Burmese Student
Warriors," after they escaped to the Myanmar side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart, the government's chief
negotiator in both the two occasions, has confirmed that at least
one of the 10 gunmen belongs to the "Student Warriors" group.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the embassy drama, the Thai government from the
beginning pledged to take tough actions against the hospital armed
men.
</P>
<P>
The government strongly denounced the hospital incident as an "
international terrorist act," saying it is against both Thai and
international laws and has violated the sovereignty of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand's tougher stance may trigger new unrest as
ethnic groups in Myanmar have reportedly threatened to launch
similar attacks in Thailand, according to local TV station
Independent Television.
</P>
<P>
As a precautious measure, Thailand has ordered a temporarily
closure of all schools along the border in Rachaburi province.
</P>
<P>
Thai troops have also been requested to tighten the security
along the total 2,400-kilometer border between Myanmar and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai complained after the hospital
crisis about Thailand's awkward situation as a result of the
constant fightings between the Myanmar government troops and
ethnic minority groups, which always lead to massive exodus of
refugees to the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Slowdown in Manufacturing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Production in the Philippine
manufacturing industry slowed down as shown by the negative
growths of -11.7 percent in volume and -6 percent in value, the
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A report released here by the National Statistics Office (NSO)
said the negative growth came after the nation posted year-on-year
consecutive growth from August to October 1999.
</P>
<P>
This is an indication that some sectors were trying to draw
down existing inventory built up in the previous months in a bid
to meet decreasing demand after the holiday season was over.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the dips were seen in consumer-
oriented manufactures, industry inputs, construction-related
commodities and export-oriented manufactures.
</P>
<P>
These manufactures mainly include food, beverages, textile,
plastic products, basic metal products, wood and wood products,
non-metallic mineral products and electrical machinery.
</P>
<P>
In spite the slack in their production, sectors like petroleum,
food electrical machinery, chemicals, and wood and wood products
exhibited growths in their volume of net sales, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
However, positive growths in both volumes of production and net
sales were observed in transport equipment, paper and paper
products, furniture and miscellaneous manufactures, the NSO said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Venture-Backed IPOs Raise $19.4 Billion in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 248 initial
public offerings (IPOs) in the United States backed by venture
capital raised 19.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, according to a
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
This doubled the record set in 1996, when the Internet first
began to have impact on the IPO market, said the report from
VentureOne, a leading U.S. provider of venture capital information
and services.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, according to VentureOne, only 11 percent of the amount
raised in venture-backed IPOs went to Internet companies. By 1999,
however this figure had risen to a staggering 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
After relatively modest year-to-year increases in previous
years, the median valuation of venture-backed companies at IPOs
increased dramatically, from 169.6 million dollars to 316.6
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It's been uplifting to see the renewed faith of the public
market in the technologies and innovations backed by venture
capitalists during 1999," the report said. "The value placed by
the public on venture capitalists' insight is evidenced by the
fantastic valuations these companies achieve at the offering.
Furthermore, the public is seeing new technologies and concepts
sooner with the decreasing time to IPO for venture-backed
companies."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the single most lucrative industry segment was
communications and networking, where 5.9 billion dollars were
raised at IPO.
</P>
<P>
Venture-backed merger and acquisition deal volume for 1999 in
the United States was on par with 1997 and 1998, but the 30.7
billion dollars paid was more than double the total for those
years. Furthermore, the 1999 total exceeded the previous record
from 1996 by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report from U.S. information services
provider Asset Alternatives, the money pouring into U.S. venture
capital funds in 1999 surged 87 percent to 36 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, venture capital is the main source of
equity invested in rapidly growing companies with high growth
potential. The capital invested in start-ups originates from
private and public pension funds, endowment funds, foundations,
corporations, wealthy individuals, foreign investors and the
venture capitalists themselves.

BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,000 wild birds have been

<P>
NANJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully cloned two goats from somatic, or adult cells taken
from a four-year-old genetically modified goat, a procedure which
was listed as one of the nation's top-10 scientific research
discoveries of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Researchers injected the nuclei of granulous cells taken from
on the ovary of the donor black female goat into enucleated
oocytes of a group of white goats.
</P>
<P>
In the lab, the re-constructed eggs developed into embryos,
which were then implanted into surrogate mother goats. At a result,
two lambs were created by this nuclear transfer technology, and
they are also female and black, the same as the donor goat.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will invest more money in education and take measures to
encourage enterprises to increase investment in scientific
research this year.
</P>
<P>
Governor Lu Ruihua made this pledge in a speech delivered at
the ongoing annual session of the provincial people's congress.
The meeting opened on January 22 and will last for seven days.
</P>
<P>
Lu said he hopes for a breakthrough in the implementation of
the strategy for invigorating Guangdong through science and
education.
</P>
<P>
He said the provincial government will add 50 million yuan for
scientific and technological research, and another 194 million
yuan for education this year. With increased investment, the
province last year enlarged the number of college enrollments by
54 percent compared with the 1998 figure, bringing the number of
college students to 230,000.
</P>
<P>
Local enterprises have been told to use an investment
equivalent to five percent of their annual total sales to finance
scientific and technological research and development.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is expected to chalk up 845.95 billion yuan in gross
domestic product (GDP) in 1999, up 9.4 percent from 1998 based on
comparable prices. Foreign trade in the province totaled 140.35
billion U.S. dollars last year, up 8.1 percent over 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 90,000 people made
homeless by the two earthquakes that hit Yunnan on January 15 are
all now settled in temporary tents and are being provided with
sufficient food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the provincial government, tents,
clothing, rice, and other relief materials from the central and
provincial governments, the Red Cross, and Hong Kong charities,
have been sent to quake-stricken Yao'an County in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to immediate and effective relief efforts, not a single
person has been living on the street nor gone hungry since the
disaster befell them 10 days ago, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Although donations and relief materials are still arriving in
Yao'an from all parts of the country, local officials admit that
life there is still difficult.
</P>
<P>
A cold winter and rainy weather have made their life more
miserable, and there is still shortage of long-term food supplies.
</P>
<P>
And the task of rebuilding their homes, schools, and hydraulic
facilities is formidable, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes measuring 5.9 and 6.5 on the Richter scale
occurred less than two hours apart, killing five people and
injuring 1,544. The jolts also damaged 600,000 houses and
destroyed 40,000, leaving more than 90,000 people homeless and 3.6
million kg of grain buried in debris.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates of direct economic losses have been put at 1.
66 billion yuan (about 900 million US dollars).

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Branch of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) recently
established a fund guaranteeing university student loans, thereby
enabling 300 poor students to obtain government loans.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal student loan guarantee fund is the first
of its kind in China. It has received 3.5 million yuan in
donations from 50 enterprises and many ICBC employees in Shanghai
since it was jointly set up by ICBC and the Shanghai branch of the
China Youth Development Foundation (CYDF) earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC is the sole designated agent administering university
student loans which the central government launched in eight
cities around China last September.
</P>
<P>
ICBC sources told Xinhua that many university students in these
cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have eagerly applied for
the loans. However, many of them are unable to get approval
because their families cannot provide adequate guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Designed to solve this problem, the student loan guarantee fund
has now provided guarantees for a total of 3.65 million yuan in
loans to poor students in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Canada, China Cooperate in Developing Solar Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- People in underdeveloped
regions of China will benefit from a project developed by the
Canada-based ATS corporation, which is aimed at promoting solar
energy technology for generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government will sponsor the project, said
visiting Canadian Minister of Natural Resources Ralph Goodale
today at a seminar dedicated to meeting China's future energy
demands.
</P>
<P>
The ATS, headquartered in Ontario, is developing special
technology for producing a solar-energy board capable of turning
solar energy into electricity. This technology is particularly
suitable for the regions that are presently without electricity.
</P>
<P>
Goodale is currently leading a large trade and investment
delegation to China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was killed
Tuesday in an Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the
first in five months, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The soldier, whose name has not been given, was killed when an
anti-tank rocket fired by Hezbollah guerrillas hit his position in
the western part of the so-called security zone, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military intelligence officials have said that Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon, has taken actions to restrict the
Hezbollah, fighting to end Israeli occupation of the border zone it
carved out in 1985, from firing rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Damascus allows Hezbollah guerrillas to continue their
fighting in the security zone, the officials said. Three pro-
Israeli militiamen were wounded Tuesday in another part of the
zone, according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised to bring Israeli
troops out of the mire in south Lebanon by July this year, through
negotiations with Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which resumed last December after a 45-month
break, were deadlocked after two rounds of negotiations. Beirut has
yet to restart the talks with Israel, which also broke down in
early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Barak Puts Off Israeli Expert's Departure for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak decided Tuesday to put off the trip of two Israeli experts to
the U.S. for talks over stalled Israeli-Syrian negotiations,
signalizing another setback in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Uri Saguy and legal advisor on borders
Moshe Kohanovsky should have departed for Washington on Tuesday to
discuss with U.S. officials the "working document" prepared by the
U.S..
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said that two Syrian experts, scheduled
to have shown up in Washington on Monday on the same mission as the
Israeli experts, have postponed their trip indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The "working document" outlined positions of the two sides, all
differences over key issues discussed during the last two rounds of
talks, and the U.S. suggestions for their settlement.
</P>
<P>
"Following consultations which took place between the Prime
Minister's Office and the U.S. Administration, the prime minister
has decided to postpone the trip," Barak's office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"A new date for the trip has yet to be set," the statement said
without any further explanation.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a State Department official said Tuesday that
Syria has not informed the U.S. when the the Syrian experts might
come.
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of the peace talks last December, Israel
and Syria have held two rounds of talks in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
But the third round, scheduled to have started on Wednesday, has
been postponed indefinitely due to the rift between the two sides
over which issues to discuss first, Israeli full withdrawal from
the Golan Heights or normalization of bilateral ties and security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands for Israeli written promise to withdraw from the
Golan Israel seized from Syria in 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Syria's official media attacked Barak, saying peace
talks could not resume until Barak changed his approach and
promised a full return of the Golan.

<HEADLINE> Striking Baggage Handlers at Switzerland's Largest Airport Return to Work </HEADLINE>

<P>
GENEVA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Baggage handlers who went on
strike Monday morning at Switzerland's largest airport, the Zurich
international airport, have returned to work after reaching a deal
with the SAir Group late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day walkout disrupted flight schedules and left
passengers to carry their own luggage, according to a Swiss Radio
International report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The workers of the SAir subsidiary, Swissport, and SAir agreed
to set up a special commission to look into the strikers' demands.
</P>
<P>
The strikers were protesting their transfer to a new company,
complaining that the arrangement will lead to poorer working
conditions and the loss of flight concessions. They are demanding
increased pay and protection from dismissal in case of strike
actions.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said at least 14 flights had been delayed by
up to four and a half hours.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans to Pay Off Government's Debt by 2013 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton said the publicly held debt is 1.7 trillion dollars
lower than it was projected to be when he took office seven years
ago. He said his proposal would devote interest savings to Social
Security, extending its solvency beyond 2050, and his plan also
would seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least 2025.
</P>
<P>
Citing a combination of the prosperous economy and his fiscal
policies, he said that "Our children and their children will not
inherit the crippling burden of interests payments that we faced
seven years ago."
</P>
<P>
The President said his plan would mean the United States would
become debt-free for the first time since 1835, when there were
only 24 states and 15 million citizens. He said it is important
that political leaders in both parties commit to using the budget
surpluses to pay down the debt.
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing by taking this position is maximizing the
choices the next president and the next Congress will have,"
Clinton said. "I ask the Republican majority in Congress to put
politics aside and join me."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration's claim of making the government debt-
free covers only the two-thirds of the 5.7 trillion dollars
national debt that is held by the public in the form of Treasury
bonds and bills.
</P>
<P>
However, the Clinton program does not deal with the other 2
trillion dollars of government debt which is held by the
government's trust funds, primarily Social Security.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he believes there should be a tax cut this
year, Clinton said tax cuts are possible if they are modest,
targeted and within the confines of fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office is expected to release three
surplus projections for the coming decade on Wednesday. The figure
Congress ultimately chooses will determine how much money is
available for tax cuts, spending increases and debt reduction.

<HEADLINE> World Tourism Increases 3.2 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 25 (Xinhua) -- World tourism increased 3.2
percent in 1999, a half point over the previous year, according to
data given Tuesday by the World Tourism Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference , WTO General Secretary Francesco
Frangialli said "it has been a record for several countries in the
world" last year and highlighted the increase in this Pacific-
Asian area.
</P>
<P>
According to Frangialli, the arrivals of tourists increased in
the world to 657 million, meaning an increase of 3.2 percent over
the previous year. The income of last year amounted to 455 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli said that "after two years of negative results the
Pacific and Asian regions became again the star of world tourism
with an increase of 7.5 percent and reached a new record with
almost 94 million international tourists."
</P>
<P>
In the same way there has been an increase in the Central
American zone which registered an increase of 23 percent in 1999,
the Middle East (17.5 percent) and Africa (9 percent); the western
Mediterranean countries also have a good development by going
towards Spain, France and North Africa, above all Morocco and
Tunisia due to the Kosovo and Turkish situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the amounts given by the WTO, Spain has the second
place worldwide as far as tourism is concerned with 51.5 million
visitors, just behind France in the first place with 71.4 million,
and the same place in income with 25.179 billion dollars, behind
the United States with 73 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
China is in the fifth place with 25.07 million visitors and
seventh place in tourism income with 14 billion dollars.

Paul A Laudicina, A T Kearney vice-president said: "
Unexpectedly strong economic growth in the first three quarters of

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Evidence Pakistan Involved in Plane Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton made the statement at the White House at an event when
responding to a published report that implicated the Pakistani
government.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Tuesday that the United States now
believes that a terrorist group supported by the Pakistani
military was responsible for the hijacking of an Indian airlines
jet last month.
</P>
<P>
"I guess the simplest thing I can tell you is that we do not
have evidence that the Pakistani government was in any way
involved in that hijacking," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Stated Department, however, said the hijackers may
have been linked to a terrorist group that operates in Kashmir --
a territory disputed by Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
The group, known as Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, was placed on the
department's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was
called Harkat ul-Ansar.
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin also rejected
the speculation that the Pakistani government involved in the
hijacking of the plane.
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe that the government of Pakistan
had foreknowledge, supported or helped carry out" the hijacking,
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that the U.S. is considering to put Pakistan
into the list of countries that support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton and his senior advisers are weighing a
decision whether he should visit Pakistan in March on a planned
trip to India and Bangladesh.

NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the Kenyan
government and the visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF)
officials for aid resumption will focus on Kenya's financial
performance in the current financial year, media sources here
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission, which arrived in Kenya's capital Nairobi
Monday, will be in the country for two weeks and will hold
discussions with government officials, donors and other
stakeholders, Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo said in a
statement released Tuesday. The minister also announced that a
mission from the World Bank, also in the country, will be holding
twin consultations with both the government and the IMF mission.
</P>
<P>
Okemo disclosed that talks will also centre on Kenya's balance
of payments position, monetary policy and governance, saying the
mission is also keen on preparation of the country's new poverty
reduction strategy paper.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the paper has been completed, Okemo said, adding
that it will be published for public debate and discussions next
month.
</P>
<P>
Kenya hopes that the discussions with the IMF and World Bank
missions will lead to a mutually agreed program, paving way for
resumption for eligibility of the newly-created poverty reduction
growth facility.
</P>

Okemo said that at the end of the mission, the two missions
will present their reports both to the managements of the IMF and

The key index used by the Bank of England to set interest rates,

Economists here believe that inflationary pressures are still
moderate.

Despite the figures, the Bank of England is widely expected to
raise interest rates further to slow the economy, which has been

S. could have an adverse impact on Europe's own credit outlook.

In the oil sector, BP Amoco gave up 2.8 percent as the outcome
of its struggle for control of Atlantic Richfield Co. remained

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Pastrana Meet on Aid to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prior to the 45-minute meeting, Clinton, acknowledging the
threat guerrilla groups and drug traffickers pose to the Colombian
government, predicted bipartisan congressional support for his 1.6
billion U.S. dollar aid package for Bogota.
</P>
<P>
"And we had the opportunity to speak about the Colombian Plan
and how can we get this bipartisan support for our Colombian Plan,
for the aid. And we really had an excellent meeting," Pastrana
told reporters following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I agree completely, as I said to the president, with his notes
this morning when he said that we need to fight what we call the
new enemy of the next 21st century," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Clinton announced a two-year aid package
worth 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. It will provide Colombia training
for special counternarcotics battalions and 30 Black Hawk and 33
Huey helicopters for counterdrug activities, radar, aircraft and
airfield upgrades, and improved intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at Colombia, that's in sort of the intersection of
narco-traffickers and the political rebels," Clinton said before
the meeting at the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
"You see a picture of what you might see much more of in the
21st century world... enemies of nation-states forming networks of
support across national borders and across otherwise discrete
interests, like narco-traffickers, organized criminals and
political terrorists, weapons dealers," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that we have to do is to try to help them
gain some measure of control over their own country again,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cocaine in the United States either came directly
from Colombia or through the country.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Presidential Statement on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Security Council began another round of efforts to push
forward the DRC peace process, based on the Lusaka Agreement,
which warring parties failed to implement over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The president of the 15-nation Council, Richard Holbrooke who
is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the press here
that the Council delayed its adoption of the statement, originally
scheduled to be passed on Tuesday afternoon, because some non-
Council member signatories to the Lusaka Agreement, a peace accord
signed in July last year to end the many-sided conflict in DRC, "
asked for some time."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after seven African heads of state met
again among themselves on Tuesday afternoon. They have spent the
Tuesday morning with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reviewing
the plans for the U.N. peace-keeping operations in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who attended the so-called mini-summit as an
observer, said that the there is a good exchange of views at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a U.N. spokesman said, "The heads of state agreed to
meet again amongst themselves at 4:30 (p.m. EST) this afternoon."
</P>
<P>
At the mini-summit, chaired by Annan, the under-secretary-
general for peace-keeping operations, Bernard Miyet, walked the
meeting through the details of phases 1 and 2 and touched upon
phase 3 of the U.N. plan to send peace-keepers into the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up Tuesday, Annan convened the mini-summit among
African leaders, including foreign ministers from the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), to see how the faltering six-
month cease-fire could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties signed the Lusaka Agreement in July last year
to cover the withdrawal of foreign troops from DRC and the
disarmament of former combatants. Since then, however, there have
been many violations.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit came as the Security Council is considering a
recommendation by Annan to send 5,000 peace-keepers to protect 500
unarmed U.N. military observers, of which only 79 have been
deployed.
</P>
<P>
Kabila told an early morning press conference here Tuesday that
he is expecting the United Nations to deploy its peace-keepers for
the interposition, namely, the deployment must be introduced into
the areas occupied by guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe supported Kabila in fighting
against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Hit Record in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The association said that last year's sales surpassed the
previous record of 4.97 million set in 1998, reflecting the buying
mood because of the robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, demand was brisk for existing homes even as interest
rates were on an upswing. Plentiful jobs, rising incomes, tame
inflation and stock and bond market gains fueled a record home-
buying boom. Some economists said a portion of last year's
existing home sales also reflected buyers scrambling to lock in
deal before interest rates moved higher.
</P>
<P>
The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 7.9
percent in December compared with 6.7 percent in December 1998 .
Last week, rates hit 8.26 percent, the highest since September
1996.
</P>
<P>
Many economists expect home sales to slow this year but still
remain at healthy levels.
</P>
<P>
Last year's strong sales pushed up the value of many homes. The
average price of an existing home was 168,300 dollars, up 5.8
percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
In December, however, sales fell 1.4 percent from the month
before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.06 million units.
</P>
<P>
Economists read the December decline as a sign that rising
mortgage rates have begun to dampen demand.
</P>
<P>
By region, the Northeast posted the biggest decline in December
with sales falling 4.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 590,000 units. Sales in the Midwest fell 4.3 percent to a
rate of 1.12 million units. Sales in the South and West were
unchanged at a rate of 1.98 million units and 1.37 million units
respectively.

<HEADLINE> INS Orders Cuban Boy's Relatives to Allow Boy to See Grandmothers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The order was made in a letter to the lawyers for the boy's
great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. The letter asked him to make Elian
available Wednesday for a meeting with his grandmothers at a
neutral site.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure that Elian has the chance to spend time
alone with his grandmothers, the INS is obliged to direct Lazaro
Gonzalez to make Elian available for a visit with his grandmothers
on Wednesday at 4:00 p.m.," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by Michael A. Pearson, executive
associate immigration commissioner for field operations.
</P>
<P>
The order came after Lazaro refused Monday to agree to a meeting
at any sight other than his own home, Pearson wrote.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the boy's grandmothers also met a group of
congressmen. "He belongs in Cuba. He was born in Cuba and he's a
Cuban citizen," Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 after his mother and
stepfather died when the boat capsized in the sea near Florida
</P>
<P>
The boy's father insists the boy should be returned to him in
Cuba while the boy's relatives demand he stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled that the boy belongs to his father in Cuba and
the boy should be returned. However, a few of U.S. anti-Cuba
congressmen planned to hold a hearing and vote to give the boy a U.
S. citizenship although the boy's father rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Bill Clinton told reporters that he had
not decided whether he would veto a congressional legislation to
offer the boy a U.S. citizenship. "I have not decided what to do,
and I wouldn't rule that out. I just haven't decided what to do."
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to minimize the politics of it, because I think
that when you -- if you take this one decision out of context, it'
s not just Cuba and it's not just this little boy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are likely to be a lot of these things in the future as
immigration flows increase, as upheavals increase elsewhere, and
as we know more and more about what goes on in other countries,"
Clinton added.
