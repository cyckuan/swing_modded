<HEADLINE> Trade, Environment Issues to Top U.N. Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 small island
nations will use their two days in the global spotlight to seek
international support on trade and environment problems when the
United Nations focuses on island issues at a special session of
its General Assembly on 27-28 September in New York.
</P>
<P>
While island nations often conjure up images of "paradise,"
their coasts, coral reef and forests are under increasing stress
from pollution, development, climate change and natural disaster
-- problems often beyond their means or control to solve.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special session, to be attended by a number of island
presidents and prime ministers, will assess progress on the action
plan adopted by over 100 countries five years ago at the 1994
Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States, held in Barbados. There small island and donor
nations agreed to tackle the islands' challenges in partnership.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties small islands face in an increasing
competitive global economy was a top issue at preparatory talks
held this past April at the U.N. Commission for Sustainable
Development. Caribbean nations protested recent rulings by the
World Trade Organization against the long-standing trade
preferences for their bananas and and other products in European
markets. Pacific island economies have suffered from the financial
crisis that has afflicted their Asian trading partners. In light
of their limited resources and options, island nations are seeking
some kind of compensatory mechanism or assistance while they try
to restructure their economies.
</P>
<P>
The small islands action plan aims to strike a balance for
sustainable development, which promotes needed economic growth and
improves social well-being while preserving the environment. This
approach was popularized at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, which
called for the Barbados Conference.

<HEADLINE> UAE Disappointed at Lack of Arab Unity on Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Saturday implicitly expressed its disappointment at the lack
of Arab unity on a controversial exhibition to be staged by the
U.S. Disney Co..
</P>
<P>
Disney Co. did not make enough concessions because it had
received reassurance that the threats of an Arab boycott of its
products need not be taken seriously, said UAE Minister of
Information and Culture Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
The minister was commenting on a meeting of Arab foreign
ministers in New York on Friday, which resulted in shelving, if
not discarding, the issue of Arab boycott against the American
entertainment giant.
</P>
<P>
The ministers accepted Disney's written assurances that the
upcoming millennium exhibition, due to open on October 1 in
Florida, U.S.A., would not identify Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been at the forefront of calling for an Arab
boycott against Disney. The campaign was launched last month after
news emerged that the Israeli pavilion at the exhibition would
portray Jerusalem as the Jewish state's capital.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Islamic countries insist that East Jerusalem should
be the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Disney would have made more concessions if some Arab
personalities had not informed it of no need to bother about calls
by the Arab world for punitive measures against it, said Sheikh
Abdullah without naming the personalities.
</P>
<P>
These reassurances made by some Arab individuals made Disney
feel that there was a lack of unity in the Arab position and it
was necessary only to offer limited concessions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that Disney could have offered to change fully an
Israeli film for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister praised the efforts made by some Arab and
Muslim countries and the Arab League to dissuade Disney from
accepting the Israeli pavilion as originally proposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Disney offered to ensure that any reference in the
Israeli pavilion to Jerusalem being the capital of Israel will be
removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Disney also assured Arabs that the entertainment firm will
not take a position on the question of Jerusalem, and any views
expressed are solely those of exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this positive step to the concerted campaign
undertaken by a number of official and non-official Arab bodies to
emphasize the Arab character of Jerusalem, as recognized and
highlighted in international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed an announcement by Arab League Secretary General
Ahmed Abdel-Meguid after the Arab foreign ministers meeting that
it was considering a proposal to set up a Palestinian pavilion.
</P>
<P>
He urged the league to take all necessary measures to ensure
that such a pavilion is built to highlight the Arab and Islamic
character of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"No one can give up on, or tamper with, the question of the
future of Jerusalem. This campaign has shown clearly that Arabs
and Muslims will never accept any distortion of the character of
Jerusalem, even if such a distortion is simply a matter of an
exhibition," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gets Remarkable Revenues From Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has cashed in 5.5 billion
Egyptian pounds (1.62 billion U.S. dollars) out of the 7.5 billion
pounds (2.21 billion dollars) of the gross value of the public
companies privatized, a minister said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Business Sector Atef Ebeid told the
country's Middle East News Agency that the remaining proceeds of
the privatized enterprises will be collected in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid's ministry is in charge of the privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off in 1995 the privatization process of 314
state-owned firms. So far, more than one third of the firms have
been totally or partially sold to foreign investors or domestic
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the early retirement scheme for workers in the
privatized companies, Ebeid said that about 2.4 billion pounds
(705.88 million dollars) have been paid to 120,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of privatizing the state-owned
pharmaceutical companies in a bid to secure reasonable medicine
prices.
</P>
<P>
But he said the government might tender part of the companies'
shares for public subscription, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, 44 more companies will be put on sale
at 6.6 billion pounds (1.94 billion dollars), including four
cement companies, the Eastern Tobacco Company and a paint company,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid said that the government will sell five chain stores to
financial concerns instead of selling their shares in the stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program has significantly improved Egypt's
economy and helped the country maintain one of the best economic
performances in the Middle East.

CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Lawyers Union will
launch a wide-scale campaign to confront Israeli plots on
Jerusalem and rally support the Palestinian people, the union
chief said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The union is scheduled to organize meeting at its headquarters
in Cairo on Monday to discuss the details of the planned campaign,
Farouk Abu Issa said in remarks carried by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by representatives of Arab,
regional and international organizations, Palestinian and Arab
intellectuals, and international law experts, Abu Issa said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the meeting is to reiterate the legitimacy of
the United Nations resolutions on Middle East issues, especially
those related to Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss ways of protecting the holy city
against judaization by Israel and maintaining its Islamic
characteristics, the Arab union secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
They will seek to uphold Arab right to the traditional Arab
East Jerusalem and promote the Palestinians' legitimate struggle
to establish an independent state with East Jerusalem as the
capital, Abu Issa said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. resolutions stipulate that Jerusalem is under the control
of the world organization. But Israel captured the whole of the
city in wars with Arabs and declared in 1980 that Jerusalem was
its "eternal and undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have begun negotiations for a final peace
agreement on the thorny issues including Jerusalem and the
Palestinian statehood.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti, Jordanian Bourses to be Tied Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Stock
Exchange (KSE) and its Jordanian counterpart are poised to
consolidate future cooperation by linking themselves together
early next year, a KSE official said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The link agreement between the Kuwaiti and Jordanian stock
markets will go into effect in February 2000, said KSE Deputy
Director General Saafaq Al-Rukaibi after a meeting of the two
Arab bourses.
</P>
<P>
For his part, KSE Director General Abdallah Al-Sidrawi
expressed content over the firm steps towards the link between
the two markets, which he said had reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sidrawi said the link was "vital due to the size of the
Kuwaiti investment in Jordan and its growth over the past few
years. But he didn't give specific figures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Amman bourse, Walid Al-Najjar, said the Kuwaiti investment in
Jordan was the largest among Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Jordanian stocks, investment
by non-Jordanians, especially Kuwaitis, account for some 44
percent of the total market value at the Amman bourse, which was
put at 6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Al-Najjar stressed the link between the Jordanian and Kuwaiti
bourses would benefit investors on both ends.
</P>
<P>
The KSE has already established links with the Lebanese and
Egyptian stock markets, although the results of the connection
were not made public because of the relatively short period.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Jospin Favor EU's Rapid Eastern Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and French premier Lionel Jospin underlined here
Saturday the importance of the European Union's rapid enlargement
toward the east.
</P>
<P>
Meeting at the eastern German town of Genshagen near Berlin,
the two leaders stressed the necessity to draw all European people
as the direct consequence of the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
"If Europe stops at Germany's border, the European thought will
go ahead without security and peace," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The latest structural reform of the EU and the "Agenda 200,"
the fiscal reform package of the bloc, will be the prerequisites
of accepting more countries, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Europe has learned from the Kosovo war that those eastern
European countries must be accepted into the EU "as quickly as
possible," echoed Jospin, who was visiting Germany for a
German-Franco cultural conference.
</P>
<P>
"They (the eastern European countries) are knocking at our
borders," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Jospin called the German-Franco axis "the
flywheel for European integration," saying the latest close
relationship between Schroeder and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair would not hurt the "traditional friendship" between Germany
and France.
</P>
<P>
"The German-Franco friendship is not only a requirement of
rationality, but also a long-since matter of the heart," assured
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Both Germany and France need not apologize for pleading for
their own national interests, agreed Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The two stressed that occasional misunderstanding, or deferent
interpretation of each other's political guidance, would be "very
normal" in German-Franco ties.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Blair, both new leaders of left-wing parties in
their countries, were well known for sharing their view over a
pro-business social policy, which the two boasted as "the new
middle line" in their common statement issued earlier this year in
London.
</P>
<P>
The governing Socialists in France have sharply criticized the
Schroeder-Blair common statement, but Schroeder defended his
policy by saying that France, just like Germany, was faced with
deep-rooted social changes and it also needed sweeping reform.
</P>
<P>
After the cultural conference, Schroeder and Jospin held
close-door talks in Schroeder's interim chancellory in Berlin with
no detail disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Join Regional Peace-Keeping Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 25 (Xinhua) --Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has urged the country's defense force to remain alert for
possible participation of peace-keeping and security operations
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the launch
of Mozambique's war for liberation from Portuguese colonial rule
on September 25, 1964, Chissano said that the forces should
continue implementing confidence-building measures to make
regional security a reality in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the armed conflicts which still plague some
member states of SADC (Southern African Development Community),
and the uncertainty as to their outcome, require the armed forces
to strengthen their operational and dissuasive capacity to
guarantee national stability and security.
</P>
<P>
However, Chissano condemned the use of force in pursuit of
political goals, saying that "we think it would be indefensible
for Africa to continue advocating the use of violence as a way to
justify any claims."
</P>
<P>
Rather, Africa should seek and find solutions for its problems
by developing and deepening dialogue and tolerance, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, the challenges the continent currently
faces are not military, but globalization, regional integration
and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"These are gigantic challenges that require the commitment and
the creativity of each and every Mozambican,"" he said. "We need
to strengthen our cohesion and sense of identity in order to
participate, and to confront the challenges of globalization."
</P>
<P>
The old concept of sovereignty, around which world politics had
once been organized, has been profoundly shaken, Chissano said,
adding that " financial markets, whose strength lies far from the
nation-state, weaken national control and make borders still more
porous".
</P>
<P>
"These structural changes, whose extraordinary speed causes so
much uncertainty, help create new insecurities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of deeply impoverished countries such as ours,
all this is also associated with the sweep of fatal epidemics
which make evident the weakness and fragility of our
institutions," he continued.

NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Burundian President Pierre
Buyoya said Saturday that Burundi has all the means to defeat the
Hutu rebels, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"In Burundi, we are perfectly capable to contain the rebellion
with our own forces," President Buyoya was quoted as saying after
a one-day visit to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in response to reports that
Rwanda has dispatched a lot of troops and weapons through the
northern borders of Burundi in preparation of a major joint swoop
against the Hutu armed insurgency.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian army is said to have mounted a major offensive on
the bases of the Hutu rebellion in Bujumbura Rural Province
considered the stronghold of the armed insurgency. The rebels
have stepped up attacks on capital Bujumbura in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya acknowledged that his country is faced with terrorist
attacks by the forces operating from the province, but said that
the situation is not yet out of hand.
</P>
<P>
"There is no danger of seeing the terrorists destabilizing
neither the country, nor the Bujumbura city," he noted, saying
that the rebels have no such power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president denied that his country is risking to
slide into the Rwanda-like situation which led to the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Burundi will not degenerate into
mass-killings, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya arrived in Rwandan capital Kigali on Friday morning and
immediately held talks with Rwandan Pasteur Bizimungu and his
Vice- President Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions focused mainly on the situation in the Great
Lakes region and the stalled Burundi peace process, Buyoya said.
</P>
<P>
A week-long session of Burundi peace talks ended in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha last Sunday without clinching a peace deal
to end the bloody conflicts in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
But delegates at the talks have agreed to meet again in late
October.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Burundian president was in Kampala on a one-day
visit during which he met with his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri
Museveni and discussed the same issues.
</P>
<P>
The six-year ethnic violence in Burundi has allegedly claimed
more than 150,000 people, mostly civilians.

<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Japanese government has agreed to grant Egypt
loans to finance a project on developing wind power stations in
the Eastern-desert Xa'frana area, the Arabic daily al-Alam al-Youm
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government also planned to extend another package
to help Egypt build a solar energy station in the southern Toshka
zone and a nearby 10,000-kilowatt solar energy plant currently under
construction at an investment of 500,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Dubai will host an Arab International Fair of Oil,
Gas, Marine and Land-based Petrochemical Industries serving the
Gulf states with the participation of 200 companies from 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
The fair is the biggest of its kind in the Arab world where
up-to-date oil and gas industry-related equipment is to be
displayed, the Arabic daily al-Alam al-Youm reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
International groups from Belgium, Britain, China, France,
Germany and firms from North America, Western Europe, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Southeastern Asia and the GCC
countries would take part in the event, said the report.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The U.S Overseas Private Investment Corporation
will extend a package of 55 million U.S. dollars to Jordan's
Aqaba Railway Company, the Arabic daily al-Alam al-Youm reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to help the Jordanian government carry
out the company's privatization program and build new lines.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian International Exhibition and Fair
Authority is to organize an international fair of packaging and
wrapping equipment from November 23 to 28.

percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP) in most
countries, the al-Alam al-Youm daily quoted Egyptian Trade and
Supply Minister Ahmed Gowaili as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, the annual spending in this industry is over one
billion dollars, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Work with U.S. Oil Firms: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday declared
its readiness to cooperate with international oil companies
including U.S. companies to supply Iraq's oil sector with
the required oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Oil Undersecretary Taha Hammoud Mousa made the remarks at an
inauguration ceremony for an oil and gas technology exhibition
currently held in Baghdad with the participation of 56 Arab and
foreign oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the message hints Iraq's
flexibility in dealing with U.S. oil companies in the future.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Baghdad refused to do business with hostile
countries, referring to the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi official accused the U.S. and British
representatives at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for hampering the
endorsement of Iraq's contracts on purchasing spare parts for its
oil sector under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq had only received 60 million U.S. dollars
worth of oil equipment and spare parts out of a total of 600
million dollars of contracts it signed with foreign companies in
the fourth and fifth phases of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase, Iraq is
allowed to export limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its people
reeling under the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was allowed by the U.N. Security Council to import 600
million dollars of oil equipment and spare parts in the fourth
and fifth phases of the deal to rehabilitate its dilapidated oil
installations.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys at the
Sanctions Committee of deliberately putting on hold many of its
contracts, saying the humanitarian program has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Mousa said he hoped that the participating companies would
supply Iraq with high quality oil equipment and offer competitive
prices.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the event has drawn so many oil companies
shows their eagerness to work with Iraq in the future, adding that
most of the companies had signed contracts with Iraq before.

<HEADLINE> Thailand on Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- To meet the challenges
of globalization and take the most advantages from its benefits,
the international community must join hands to promote
globalization with a human face, Thailand said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Thailand's Minister for Foreign Affairs
Surin Pitsuwan said "globalization with a human face" is not a new
idea.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has spoken about it, and the
United Nations, particularly the United Nations Development
Program, has long been a proponent of this concept, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization should be ensured to lead to, among other
things:
</P>
<P>
-- Greater equity among peoples and nations,
</P>
<P>
-- The easing of social tensions and strengthening of
communities,
</P>
<P>
-- the inclusion of a greater number of economies as
stakeholders and co-partners in the building of the global
economy,
</P>
<P>
-- Declining poverty and reduction of the income gap between
the very rich and the very poor,
</P>
<P>
-- Enhanced protection and preservation of the environment,
</P>
<P>
-- Greater protection and promotion of human rights and
fundamental freedoms,
</P>
<P>
-- And, perhaps most importantly and very simply, a better life
for all peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Joining hands to promote globalization with a human face is a
distinct contribution to promoting human security. The United
Nations is already playing a leadership role in realizing this
goal at a global level. But the United Nations cannot do this
alone. It needs to forge a partnership with non-governmental
sector, especially the private sector and civil society and other
international organizations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Air Strikes on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian warplanes raided the
breakaway republic of Chechnya for the third day Saturday,
knocking out television and mobile telephone networks, said
Russian media reports.
</P>
<P>
"The television center has ceased to exist," Air Force
commander Anatoly Kornukov said, referring to the television
station in Grozny, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the raids would continue "until the job of killing off
the fighters, their bases and sites supporting them is
completed."
</P>
<P>
The latest raids further targeted Chechnya's already largely
crippled oil installations. The head of Grozny's refinery said his
facility, working sporadically for months, had been shut down
completely.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said the Russian air force had been 80 percent
accurate in more than 1,700 air missions in the past three weeks
using Su-24 and Su-25 jets. More than 2,000 rebels had been
killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the guerrillas remained well equipped. "There is still
work to be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said federal forces would stick to "pinpoint attacks"
on bases and other sites used by the rebels and there were no
plans for "carpet bombing" and no need to enlist long-range
bombers.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that there would be no attacks on civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
There were different reports of casualties in the raids. While
the Interfax news agency said seven people had died in the latest
raids, the RIA agency put the toll at three.
</P>
<P>
A Chechen official speaking in London Friday said nearly 300
had died in two weeks of Russian military action in the region.
</P>
<P>
Moscow insists that its air force was only targeting bases,
arms depots and other facilities used by the Islamic rebels that
twice infiltrated the neighboring Daghestan republic and were
believed to be behind several apartment block explosions that
killed more than 300 people in Moscow and other major Russian
cities.

NEW DELHI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The fourth phase of polling
for the 13th Lok Sabha elections Saturday recorded a turnout of
over 51 percent, the Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
However, five people were killed and more than 20 people

<HEADLINE> DPRK on U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Without enhancing the
authority of the General Assembly and without early restructuring
of the Security Council, the United Nations would be unable to
meet the demands of a rapidly changing situation and cope with new
challenges, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the
General Assembly, DPRK Minister for Foreign Affairs Paek Nam Sun
said the authority of the General Assembly where all member states
are represented and interact democratically on an equal footing
should be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"If the General Assembly is empowered to deliberate on crucial
issues such as ensuring international peace and security and
finally examines important resolutions adopted by the Security
Council concerning sanctions and the use of force, this will be
conducive to ensuring fairness in the U.N. activities and
preventing high-handness and arbitrariness by individual
countries," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council should be reformed in such a way as to
make all regions equally represented in its composition and ensure
full transparency in its activities. In this regard, we oppose,
under any circumstances, the permanent membership of a defeated
nation which has not liquidated its past crimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the proposal put forward by member
countries of the non-aligned movement to first increase
non-permanent seats, which is relatively easy to be agreed upon at
this stage, deserves sincere consideration," he added.

<HEADLINE> World Tourism To Grow 4.2 Percent in Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- World tourism will have an
average growth of 4.2 percent between 2000 and 2010 as forecast by
the World Tourism Organization (WTO) here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The WTO started the same day in the Chilean capital the
preparations for its 13th General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by more than 1,000 delegates from 131
countries that will discuss the conservation of natural and
cultural resources, as well as the impact of the new information
and marketing technologies of the touristic business.
</P>
<P>
WTO General Secretary Francesco Frangialli said at the
preparatory forum that it is possible that "internal tourism will
be 10 times bigger than the international tourism in the year
2020."
</P>
<P>
The biggest growth of touristic activity will occur in the
developing countries of Asia, Latin America and the Middle East,
said Frangialli.
</P>
<P>
He said that 635 million tourists were registered in 1998 all
over the world and that income, excluding international
transportation, was 439 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This means that tourism exported 1.2 billion dollars every
day," said the WTO secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli also explained that tourist income represented last
year 8 percent of the world commerce of services, which puts this
activity among the sectors of the biggest importance, together
with oil and motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Regarding South America, he said that the region had more than
18 million arrivals. Tourism grew 8.2 percent in the last 10 years
in South America, doubling the world growth rate, which was 4.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli said Chile earned about 1 billion dollars in 1998,
receiving 1.8 million foreign visitors.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Popular Defense Science Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua)-- China today published a series
of books on national defense science, in a bid to propagate
defense science and improve people's defense awareness.
</P>
<P>
The series, the most authoritative of its kind in China, was
compiled by the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defense, a body in charge of the nation's defense
industry and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The five volumes of the series cover nuclear energy, aviation,
space, warships, and weaponry. These books systematically
introduce the evolution of the defense industry, and
comprehensively provide scientific and technical knowledge about
such defense topics as electronic information and new weapons.
</P>
<P>
The series is mainly designed for readers above the junior high
school level, while some parts are a bit advanced in order to "
leave some thinking room for those who want to acquire a deeper
understanding of defense science," sources say.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the authority of the series, the commission
invited technical consultants to help compile and edit the work,

<HEADLINE> China to Push Ahead Strategic Restructuring of SOEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China will continue the
strategic restructuring of its State-owned enterprises in a move
to enhance their competitiveness, says "The Decision of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Major Issues
Concerning the Reform and Development of State-owned Enterprises".
</P>
<P>
According to the Decision, which was issued here today, China
will give support to a handful of enterprises that must be
monopolized by the State to help them play their due role.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises that have considerable strength in competitive
fields should accelerate their development by attracting
investment from different sectors. Enterprises that do have a
market for their products but are suffering from an excessive
burden and managerial difficulties should regroup their assets and
readjust their structure in the forms of merger and association.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy and closure have to be conducted for enterprises
that can not find any market for their products, have been
suffering from long-time losses, and are not expected to turn loss
into profit, as well as those that have been wasting resources,
are technologically backward, are manufacturing poor-quality
products, and have caused severe pollution, the Decision says.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to foster powerful and competitive large
enterprises and enterprise groups, some of which could be turned
into trans-regional, trans-industrial, trans-ownership and
transnational large enterprise groups. Their superiority in
capital management and technological renovation should be made
full use of, so as to turn them into pillars of the national
economy and the major players in international competition, it
points out.
</P>
<P>
Active support will be given to small and medium-sized
enterprises, especially hi-tech ones. Small state-owned
enterprises are encouraged to adopt various forms to invigorate
themselves. Those forms include regrouping, association, merger,
leasing, contract-based management, shareholding, and sale.
</P>
<P>
In the process of the strategic regrouping of state-owned
enterprises, the role of market mechanism should be brought into
full play, while economic, legal and necessary administrative
means should be applied, the document says.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Party Leadership in SOEs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Strengthening and improving
the Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for speeding up
the reform and development of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in
China, according to a Party document issued today.
</P>
<P>
The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) on Major Issues Concerning the Reform and Development
of State-Owned Enterprises stresses that it is a major principle
to adhere to the Party leadership and bring into play the role of
Party organizations in SOEs as the political core, and SOEs should
have no wavering over the principle at any time.
</P>
<P>
The Decision points out that to lift SOEs out of difficulties,
efforts must be made to establish a leading system as well as an
organizational and managerial system in SOEs that conform to the
law of the market economy and China's actual situation. Efforts
are also needed to improve the SOE leadership, give play to the
role of Party organizations in SOEs as the political core, and
adhere to the principle of relying on the working class whole-
heartedly.
</P>
<P>
The effort to pay attention to the Party's political advantages
should be combined that to make use of market mechanisms so as to
mobilize every positive factor to pool efforts for the smooth
implementation of reform and development in SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The role of the SOE Party organizations as the political core
is mainly reflected in ensuring and supervising the implementation
of the Party and state policies in related enterprises;
participating in making decisions on major issues, supporting the
board of share-holders, board of directors, board of supervisors
and managers or directors in exercising their functions and powers
according to law; and whole-heartedly relying on staff and workers,
and leading and supporting trade unions and non-government
organizations including the Communist Youth League, as well as the
workers' congress, to function independently according to law and
their respective regulations.
</P>
<P>
Their role is also seen in guiding enterprises' ideological and
political education as well as ethical and cultural progress in an
effort to forge ranks of workers and staff members that have lofty
ideals, moral integrity, a good education and a strong sense of
discipline; and in strengthening the building of the Party
organizations themselves, improving education on the Party spirit
and work style, and giving full play to the roles of the Party
branches as a fighting bastion and the Party members as an
exemplary vanguard, it says.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Demands Stricter Supervision of Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The conservative-dominated
Majlis (parliament) of Iran on Sunday called on the government to
exert stricter supervision over the local media in line with
Islamic rules.
</P>
<P>
Some 170 members of the Majlis signed a letter to President
Mohammad Khatami, calling on him to "pay more attention to the
cultural environment" of the country, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The legislators accused "some segments of the press" for making
"insults to sanctities and violations of Islamic rules."
</P>
<P>
Amid the power struggle between hard-liners who dominate the
judiciary and the parliament, on one side, and the reformists
represented by Khatami on the other, a number of pro-reformists
newspapers were banned by the conservatives recently for
publishing "hostile articles."
</P>
<P>
The letter demanded that the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance, the body in charge of the country's cultural affairs,
provide necessary tools to "prevent insults to Islamic principles
and sanctities through stricter supervision over the ministry's
performance."
</P>
<P>
"Violations of values and insults to religious principles and
sanctities ... are intolerable" in a state "whose duty is to
enforce Islamic rules and regulations," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who neglect warnings and cautions" of religious scholars
and the supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei are "acting against the
interests of the Islamic system" as well as the ideals of late
supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini and Khamenei, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis representatives expected the authorities in charge
of cultural affairs to exercise a stricter supervision over such
activities, the letter concluded.

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Coup Suspects Put on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Supreme Criminal
Court on Sunday began the trial of Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin
Hamad Al-Thani, the suspected mastermind of a 1996 coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects, who were identified as Ghanem Saleh
Al-Kawari and Mete'b Twaim Al-Meri, were also brought to the
court.

The public prosecutor charged the three with attempting to oust
Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani in collaboration with a
foreign country and to leak state military secrets.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem was accused of masterminding the foiled
coup, in which he "hired a number of individuals and mapped out a
plan to carry out the coup operation, brought arms to the country,
and continued his bid against the Qatari regime after the failed
attempt on February 13, 1996."
</P>
<P>
The three denied all the charges, according to the Kuwait News

<HEADLINE> China to Build Up Highly Qualified Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- To meet the needs of
establishing a modern enterprise system and to survive and develop
in fierce competition, China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) must
build up their highly qualified management and nurture a big batch
of excellent entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) on Major Issues Concerning the Reform and Development
of State-Owned Enterprises, which was made public today, points
out that the management of SOEs is generally good and have made
important contributions to the reform and development of the
enterprises. However, the trend of building up a socialist market
economy has imposed new demands to SOE managers.
</P>
<P>
The reform of personnel system of SOEs should be deepened. The
CPC must manage and supervise its SOE cadres. The Central
Committee and local committees of the Party must strengthen
management over the operation of SOEs that hold the lifeline of
the state security and national economy.
</P>
<P>
They should probe for new mechanisms that conform to the modern
corporate system in personnel management, combine organizational
appraisal and recommendation with market mechanisms and public
applications, and combine the principle of the Party administering
officials with the right of board of directors to select managers
as well as managers exercising personnel powers according to law,
the Decision says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a talent market for business managers must be
established and greater efforts made to create conditions for
building a social environment conducive to the healthy growth of
managers and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The Decision points out that a system should be established to
encourage SOE managers' brilliant performance and to curb their
irresponsible conducts. The managers' incomes should be linked
with their performance. Managers should not only get due material
rewards, they should also receive due honors for their devotion. A
few enterprises have tried some distribution modes including the
annual salary system for managers. This can be further
experimented to gather experiences but should not be taken as an
example for enterprises to follow indiscriminately. There should a
system to standardize the allocating of salaries to managers and
that system should be transparent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more work should be done to increase supervision
over managers in areas such as use of funds, production and
management, income distribution, use of personnel and self-
discipline. Managers who fail to follow relevant laws and
regulations and cause heavy losses to their enterprises should be
duly punished and they should be removed from their posts, nor
should they be transferred to work as a leader elsewhere.

and some conglomerates in the United States, Europe and Asia-
Pacific. Other attendants include celebrities in the economic and
political circles.
</P>
<P>
The heads of 200 large-sized Chinese enterprises and many high-
ranking officials from the central and local governments of China
will also participate in the forum. Nearly 600 journalists from
Chinese and international media will be in Shanghai to cover the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Fortune Global Forum is an annual forum for world economic
magnates to discuss the issues that global businesses face. It is
held by the Fortune magazine under the Time-Warner Group of the U.
S..
</P>
<P>
The sub-themes of this year's forum include "draw lessons from
the Asian financial crisis", "explore new China consumer market",
"set your company's market strategy in China", "China's central
bank: intelligence and orientation" and "export to China: today
and tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has devoted a lot of resources and energy to
preparation of the convocation of the meeting, including building
an advanced convention center and an international airport and
training volunteers to serve at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Coming into being in 1930, the Fortune magazine began to
appraise and select the top 500 U.S. enterprises that have the
largest operational revenue in the United States in 1955. In 1990,
it began to publish a ranking of the top 500 industrial
enterprises in the world. And in 1994, it expanded the scope of
the top 500 ranking to include service industry.
</P>
<P>
The ranking is based mainly on operational revenues. But it
also compares assets, net income, sales volume, the number of
employees, investment and dividend. The Fortune top 500 ranking
has been considered as an authoritative measurement of the
economic power of an enterprise and a weatherglass of a country's
economic strength.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Big Party in Macao Celebrates New China's 50th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Attended by more than 1,000
people from all walks of life, a grand gathering was held here
Sunday morning to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, presidium chairman of a local preparatory committee
for celebrating the anniversary, expressed the common wish of the
Macao people that the motherland will grow stronger and more
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and
through the concerted hard work of the people all over the country,
China has shown earth-shaking changes since our New China was
founded 50 years ago," said the 80-year-old Ma, who is also
chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country enjoys unprecedented economic
strength, its productivity is greatly boosted and the people have
much higher living standards. "History is a good testimony that
the Socialist system has incomparable advantage and vitality and
that the Chinese people have a strong cohesive force."
</P>
<P>
While celebrating the 50th birthday of the PRC, Macao residents
are happy to see Macao's return to the motherland, Ma said. After
Hong Kong, Macao's return will be another good example to
demonstrate the correctness of the "one country, two systems"
concept.
</P>
<P>
"The fate of Macao has been closely linked with that of the
motherland. We are fully aware of the fact that only a stronger
motherland can give Macao a promising future," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Macao residents of various social quarters to take
an active part in the preparatory work for the establishment of
the Macao Special Administrative Region on December 20 and build a
better future.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-designate of the Macao SAR,
and Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
joined local residents at the party, where artistic performances
were also staged.
</P>
<P>
Over the past days, social bodies in Macao have been holding
various gatherings to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the PRC.

<HEADLINE> Prisoners Take Prison Guards Hostage in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Political Prisoners took as
hostages dozens of prison guards in various jails in Turkey on
sunday, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported here.
</P>
<P>
The political prisoners were reacting to an incident in which
seven prisoners were killed in the uprising in the Anakra Main
Covered Jail early Sunday morning, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners took hostage seven prison guards at the Bartin
Special Type Covered Prison on Sunday. Eyewitnesses said they
heard gunfire from within the prison in Bartin province.
</P>
<P>
Security measures have tightened in and around the prison.
</P>
<P>
The agency added that at the Bayrampasa and Umraniye prisons in
Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, prisoners who were
sentenced with terrorist crimes took hostage a total of 18 prison
guards.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcement units have been deployed at the both
prisons in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prisoners took hostage nine prison guards at the
Canakkale E-Type Covered Prison and 10 prison guards at the
Cankiri E-Type Covered Prison.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday morning, seven people were killed and seven
others injured in clashes between the Turkish security forces
and prisoners at Ankara Main Covered Jail as the forces tried
to enter into the wards in a bid to transfer the inmates
to prisons in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners set up barricades and used pistols or bottles
to stop the security forces from carrying out their mission.

<HEADLINE> Russian Air Force Continues Pounding Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian fighter jets continued
air raids on the breakaway republic of Chechnya for a fourth day
Sunday, dropping missiles and bombs on terrorist strongholds and
facilities, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Oktyabrsk district of Grozny, the regional capital, again
came under attack, Tass said, quoting the press center of federal
forces in Dagestan, a republic bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In the past 24 hours, federal jets bombed terrorist camps,
communication and provision bases along the administrative border
between Chechnya and Dagestan, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 200 armored military vehicles backed by helicopters
and gunships advanced to the border with Chechnya from Ingush,
another Russian province in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Their main task is to prevent Chechen terrorists from
penetrating into the republic of Dagestan, Tass said, quoting
Ingushi Interior Ministry spokeswoman Madina Khadziyeva.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to 1994, when the Chechen war just started and the
Ingushi population attempted to block federal troops from
advancing to Chechnya, the local people are quiet this time about
the deployment of federal troops around, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"The people are tired of bandit raids and kidnapping from the
territory of Chechnya,," she said.
</P>
<P>
As the air raids over Chechnya continues, the flow of refugees
to Ingush has been increasing steadily. Two tent camps were set up,
but they could only house 500 people, far from enough to
accommodating the 40,000 refugees already there.
</P>
<P>
The latest federal assaults, the fiercest since the end of
1994-1996 Chechen war, came after repeated incursions by Islamic
rebels from Chechnya to Dagestan and several apartment building
blasts that killed more than 300 people in Moscow and other major
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been moving federal troops and special police units
to Chechnya's border with neighboring republics. Russia has also
carried out air strikes on the Grozny airport, arms depots, mobile
telephone networks and radio and television broadcast facilities
that believed to be at the service of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
While authorities insist that there is no plan to launch a
ground campaign in Chechnya, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said
on Sunday that he would not rule out such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
"There are several variants of the plan which will be
implemented depending on the situation," Tass quoted Sergeyev as
saying during a visit to the Burdenko military hospital where
soldiers and officers wounded in Dagestan are recovering.
</P>
<P>
"The main aim of all the plans is to eliminate bandits," the
minister said, stressing the importance "to create a considerably
deep security zone (around Chechnya)."
</P>
<P>
He praised the servicemen for their "courage and heroism" in
fighting Islamic insurrectionists in Dagestan. There have been one
hundred and five servicemen killed and 306 wounded in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Extradition Hearing to Open on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The formal hearing on whether
former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet should be sent to stand
trial in Spain is scheduled to open in a British court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming hearing is to consider whether the retired
general should be extradited to Spain to face trial for alleged
human rights abuses during his 17-year iron-fisted rule, which
ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The session is set for five days and the decision could come
within two weeks of its close. After the decision is made, either
side can appeal and the judicial marathon may run months or years
more.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who is 83 years old and suffers some serious
illnesses, was arrested in a London hospital last October after a
Spanish judge accused him of responsibility to the deaths and
disappearances of 3,000 people. The Spanish judge wanted him to be
extradited to Spain to face the charges.
</P>
<P>
His case has been in and out of British court on various legal
points ever since. A lot of speculations on what will happen to
the retired general come and go every month here in London.
</P>
<P>
A local report said that if the court next week rules against
Pinochet, the general might abandon further appeals and instead
ask Home Secretary Jack Straw to block his extradition on
humanitarian grounds, given his advanced age and frail health.
</P>
<P>
Another floated speculation is that Pinochet would go to Spain
voluntarily in hope of winning his case there or striking a deal
with Spanish prosecutors or the government.
</P>
<P>
But one of his Spanish lawyers said this week he had advised
Pinochet against leaving Britain before appeals were exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is not expected to attend the trial planned to be held
from Monday on in the Victorian-era Bow Street Magistrates' Court
in London's Covent Garden. He has to be present only for the
decision.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Passports Traded in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian passports are being
traded in western Europe by some Nigerians, a leading Nigerian
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian quoted the Foreign Affairs Ministry sources as
saying Nigerian embassies had presented the seized passports to
the minister of state for foreign affairs Dubun Onyia.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that a memo is underway from the Foreign Affairs
Ministry to the Internal Affairs Ministry on the worrying
development and an overhaul of the immigration department is
requested.
</P>
<P>
The passport trade was believed to be connected with the high
price of the document overseas. Renewal of passport in Germany
costs 200 U.S. dollars, in the United States 60 dollars and in
Britain 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Nigerian embassy in Germany told Onyia that
the high cost of passport acquisition and renewal is traceable to
the directive of government that embassies should generate
revenue.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that those who patronize the illegal market
include Nigerians who travelled overseas with the passports of
other west African countries.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Launches GSLV Early Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian planned to launch
its geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) in January,
2000, and develop its own cryogenic engine in the first quarter,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted Dr. G. Madhavan Nair, newly-appointed director of
the Vikram Sarabhal Space Center (VSSC), as saying that the first
phase of cryogenic engine would be used in the second or third
launch of the GSLV in 2000 or 2002.
</P>
<P>
The GSLV, which was now capable of carrying satellites weighing
upto 25 tones, would be improved to carry satellites upto to 36
tones in the orbit.
</P>
<P>
The decision to develop India's own cryogenic engine, which at
present supplied by Russia, was made in 1992 and got government
approval in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nair said in Thiruvananthapuram, 2,800 kms south of here, that
Indian scientists had been working on the project ever since in
order to take the country to a position of self-reliance in the
space sector.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that India's achievements in space sector was unique
among developing countries and pictures from its remote sensing
satellites were the finest.
</P>
<P>
Nair disclosed that GSLV had an estimated project cost of 13
billion rupees (300 million U.S. dollars) and a three-stage launch
system with three core motors.
</P>
<P>
VSSC, based in Thiruvananthapuram, was using 99 percent
technology of its own and the excess workload had forced it to
share some of its works with some private and public sector
institutions, Nair said.

<HEADLINE> China's SOEs Urged to Trim Off Payrolls (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Decision of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee on Major Issues Concerning the
Reform and Development of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), which
was published today, urges SOEs to do a good job in reducing
workforce, improving efficiency, re-employing displaced workers,
and guaranteeing social security.
</P>
<P>
Laying off redundant workers to increase enterprise efficiency
and helping these displaced workers to get re-employed is an
important part of the SOE reform, the Decision says.
</P>
<P>
Streamlining the workforce should be well combined with
increasing efficiency so as to attain the goal of reducing cost,
increase efficiency and profitability in the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Qualified SOEs should create economic entities that are
financially independent and responsible for their own economic
losses and profits by separating their main business from other
business operations and diverting part of the workers to some
auxiliary posts, so that some redundant workers could get re-
employed and the pressure on social employment could be alleviated.
</P>
<P>
Procedures of laying off workers should be standardized, re-
employment centers should be set up inside the enterprises, and
laid-off workers need to be granted basic living to maintain
social stability.
</P>
<P>
The work of laying off workers should be adapted to the State
fiscal strength and capability of the society to absorb the
unemployed, it says.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts should be put into the task of re-employment of
laid-off workers. Effective policies and measures should be
adopted to increase job opportunities. The service sector should
be boosted to absorb more laid-off workers, who also need guidance
to change their stereotyped opinion in job selection. Efforts are
also needed for training the laid-off workers so as to increase
the chances for them to land new jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Preferential policies should be improved to facilitate the re-
employment of displaced workers, encouraging them to get re-
employed as soon as possible by accepting jobs in non-public
economic entities, starting their own business or becoming self-
employed.
</P>
<P>
As for those who start business of their own, the government
should grant them more support in getting official permits,
finding office sites, enjoying tax reduction or exemption, and
receiving bank loans. The labor market should be actively
developed and regulated so a market-oriented employment mechanism
could be formed, the Decision stresses.
</P>
<P>
It points out that speeding up the building of the social
security system is an important prerequisite for a smooth
implementation of the SOE reform. The social security services
such as endowment, unemployment and medical insurance should cover
people of a wider range, and SOEs, collectively-owned enterprises,
overseas-funded ventures and private businesses and their
employees should all take part in the social security program, and
hand in insurance premium.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be increased to collect the insurance premium,
increase its rate, pursue enterprises' arrears of the premium so
as to ensure that the pension can be paid on time and in full
amount.
</P>
<P>
A unified management plan of retirement pension funds at the
provincial-level should be further improved, and multiple measures
such as selling off some State assets and adjusting the fiscal
spending structure should be taken to establish new fund-raising
channels for the social security program and replenish the social
funds.
</P>
<P>
Social insurance funds should be strictly managed, supervision
should be strengthened on such management and no funds should be
used for other purposes than insurance payments to ensure the
safety and increment in value of the funds.
</P>
<P>
Provision of social insurance should be gradually socialized.
Retirees should disengage from the enterprises, receive retirement
pensions at social service agencies and be managed by communities
instead of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to ensure the political and welfare of retired
veteran cadres and provide them with good services.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Lists Progress in His Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said he had done a lot to restore hope in the country and
win the respect of the international community since he took
office in May this year, the Guardian newspaper reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president, speaking at a press conference during his trip
to the United Nations in New York on Saturday, said before his
elected civilian government came to power, Nigeria gave a combined
image of military dictatorship, a corruption-ridden,
crime-infested and ethnic-strife rampant society, and a collapsing
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The image is no longer valid after his four months in the
saddle, and Nigeria is different from what it was in the past,
said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
On corruption, Obasanjo noted that while Nigeria for two
consecutive years led the corruption index of Transparency
International, the situation on the ground now is no longer the
same.
</P>
<P>
"I will be fooling myself to say corruption has been eradicated
in Nigeria," said the president. "There is no where in the world
where there is no corruption. But corruption was a way of life in
Nigeria. We are trying to change that. We cannot give ourselves
full marks yet. But we are on the way."
</P>
<P>
He said the police would be retrained, reorganized and
adequately equipped to confront the rising wave of crime.
</P>
<P>
The president cited improvement in power supply as an
indication of the seriousness of his government to confront the
problems, adding that in one year the problem of frequent power
cut will be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo stated that the orientation of his government is that
of " private sector-led economy."
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility is to provide the conducive environment for
 investment to come in," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The most influential
business giants in the world will gather at the Shanghai
International Convention Center tomorrow morning for the grand
opening of the '99 Fortune Global Forum, universally acknowledged
as an occasion to "stimulate thoughts of creation".
</P>
<P>
During the three-day forum, presidents and CEOs of the top 300
multinational corporations and celebrated politicians and scholars
from around the world, will discuss, along with 200 Chinese
entrepreneurs, the topic: "China, the next 50 years."
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will announce the opening of the
Fortune Global Forum which will run September 27 to 29 and deliver
a keynote address to the opening session.
</P>
<P>
The Fortune Global Forum, established by U.S.-based Time Warner
Inc. in 1995, chooses the city with the most vigorous economy in
which to hold the forum each year.
</P>
<P>
As each forum focuses its agenda on hot topics of world
economic development, it is a meeting of high-level business
executives and a window through which to observe global economic
trend.
</P>
<P>
The current forum will be larger than any of the four previous
forums.
</P>
<P>
Why has the Fortune Global Forum selected Shanghai as the venue
and shows such great interest in China?
</P>
<P>
Xie Kang, director of the Multinational Corporation Research
Office under the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said, "It
was unimaginable 20 years ago that global economic giants would
assemble in Shanghai to discuss the topic of China's future
development. But present-day China is a unique attraction, with
rapid and sustained economic growth. "

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up SOE Technical Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- to achieve sustained, fast
and healthy economic development, attention should be paid to keep
up with the global trend in adjustment of industrial structure and
changing demand of domestic and overseas markets, and speeding up
the technological renovation and industrial upgrading, according
to the a decision of the Communist Part of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China on Major Issues Concerning the Reform and Development of
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) was published today.
</P>
<P>
The Decision says that the direction and emphasis of SOEs in
technological renovation and industrial upgrading should be
employing advanced technology to transform the traditional
industries and strengthening technological renovation of existent
enterprises with the market as the guide and with the goal of
increasing product diversity, improving quality, improving
efficiency and spurring exports.
</P>
<P>
The direction and emphasis also include holding an important
position in new and hi-tech industries in electronic information,
bio-engineering, new energy, new materials, aviation, space
technology and environmental protection, and mastering core
technologies so as to serve as an industrial leader.
</P>
<P>
With technological renovation and industrial upgrading, a few
large enterprises and enterprise groups should reach or near the
advanced world level in terms of product quality, manufacturing
technology and equipment, and labor productivity, and establish
themselves in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Most enterprises should actively participate in market
competition at home and abroad by pushing ahead with technology
renovation and industrial upgrading and making full use of the
advantage of the nation's sufficient labor resources, it says.
</P>
<P>
Active and effective policies, including increased input,
subsidized bank loans, tax incentives, industrial investment funds
and venture capital funds, should be adopted to support the
technological renovation and industrial upgrading of the
enterprises, and funds should also be pooled from domestic and
overseas capital markets. In addition, policy incentives should be
offered to facilitate the commercial use of research achievements.
</P>
<P>
The Decision points out that enterprises should be taken as
principal participants in technological renovation and it is
imperative to establish a technological renovation system with
enterprises as its central consideration. Large enterprises should
set up technological development centers, develop core products
with their own intellectual patents.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, research and development of technologies
should be combined, technological personnel in scientific research
institutions and institutions of higher learning should be
encouraged to join enterprises or enterprise groups, development
and spreading of practical technologies should be intensified, and
input into experimental application of new technologies should be
increased, so as to facilitate the translation of technological
developments into real productive forces.

The Fortune Forum conducts an investigation prior to deciding
the venue for each global forum, and Shanghai came out on top this
year. The previous four meetings were held in Singapore,
Barcelona, Bangkok and Budapest. Before this year's decision was
finalized, Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc. headed a
delegation to China.
</P>
<P>
It was demonstrated to their satisfaction that China is now a
vital place in the wake of two decades of economic reforms. During
this period, the gross domestic product (GDP) of China grew at an
annual rate of 9.7 percent, and the country now ranks seventh in
the world in terms of economic development. It was the world's
eleventh-largest trading power in 1998, compared to the thirty-
second ranking in 1978. The country has approved the establishment
of 324,000 enterprises created with direct foreign investment,
involving a contractual value of 573.2 billion U.S. dollars, the
second-largest in the world, behind only the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, located in the dynamic economic belt of China's
eastern coast, embarked on the road of rapid growth by opening the
Pudong New Area to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shanghai's per capita GDP exceeded 28,000 yuan,
ranking first in the country. More than 20,000 foreign-funded
firms have been set up in Shanghai, with some 130 of the top 500
multinational corporations among them. The city has emerged as the
"dragon head" of economic growth at the Yangtze River delta and
the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Long-term political stability and all-round social development
are other reasons for the great interest shown by major world
businesses. Levin and his party drew their conclusion: China's
economy has great prospects and enormous potential, and is an
ideal partner for multinational corporations seeking new avenues
for development.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the annual forum in China has aroused the
active interest of many multinationals including General Motors,
Ford, Sony, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Dell, Kodak, Toshiba and Nokia.
Douglas Ivester, chairman of the Coca-Cola Company, and his rival,
Pepsi Co. Chairman Roger Enrico, will be sitting in the same hall
during this year's forum.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, executives from 60
multinational corporations among the leading 500 corporations
worldwide, as selected by Fortune magazine, will attend the
meeting. Also present will be former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

<HEADLINE> China to Readjust Layout of State Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China will take strategic
steps to readjust its over-distributed and poor-performing state
economy, according to a decision adopted by the 4th Plenum of the
15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Major Issues
Concerning the Reform and Development of State-owned Enterprises,
which was made public here today, details the guiding principles
for readjusting the layout of the state economy.
</P>
<P>
The Decision points out that under a socialist market economy,
the leading role of the state economy in the national economy
hinges upon its power to control. The role of the state economy
should be materialized through solely state-owned enterprises as
well as through making greater efforts to develop a shareholding
system.
</P>
<P>
State economy should command a dominant stake in key industries
and crucial fields deemed as the lifeline of the national economy,
in order to shore up, guide and push ahead overall social and
economic development and play a key role in achieving State-set
macro-economic control targets.
</P>
<P>
State economy should be maintained at a necessary size, with
its layout further optimized and the quality further improved, the
Decision notes.
</P>
<P>
In different stages of economic development, the document says,
the proportion of the state economy in different industries and
areas may vary, but its layout should be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
It says that the strategic readjustment of the layout of the
national economy should be combined with the optimization and
upgrading of industrial structure and the readjustment and
improvement of the structure of ownership.

<P>
Industries and fields that need to be controlled by the state
economy include: industries that are related to state security,
industries that are monopolized by their nature, industries that
supply public-use products and services, and backbone enterprises
in pillar industries and new and high technology industries, the
document points out.
</P>
<P>
In other industries and fields, it says, the entire quality of
the state economy could be improved through assets regrouping and
structural adjustment to centralize their capacity and strengthen
the key state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Along with the sustained growth of the national economy, the
development of the state economy has a vast space, with its
aggregate power expected to be further increased, overall quality
further improved, and layout more rational, though the proportion
it holds in the entire national economy might decrease. The
decline, however, will not affect the socialist nature of the
country, so long as China upholds public ownership as the main
form, the State controls the lifeline of the national economy, and
the controlling power and competitiveness of the state economy are
strengthened, the Decision says.
</P>
<P>
Effective policies and measures will be adopted to accelerate
the readjustment of the state economy in old industrial bases and
the central and western parts of the country, the Decision says.

The U.S.-based General Motors (GE) Corp, number one on the list
of the 500 multinational corporations, has set up five enterprises,
operating either as joint ventures or as exclusive investments in
China.
</P>
<P>
GE President Richard Wagoner said his corporation expects to be
a strategic partner with China because a country with a population
of more than 1 billion is a market of strong appeal in scale and
potential.
</P>
<P>
Durk Jager, president and CEO of Procter &AMP; Gamble, which has
opened 11 firms in China, has shown great interest in the Chinese
market. The achievements Procter &AMP; Gamble has made over the past
10 years derive from rapid economic growth and an improved
investment environment in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe a more open and prosperous China is sure to provide
even bigger room for us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Forum participants have every reason to be confident about
China's economic development. This month, China promulgated a
series of new policies for expanding the use of foreign funds,
opening its service market to the outside world, encouraging
technical innovation by foreign-funded enterprises, and offering
financial support to foreign-funded firms. The policies aim to
integrate China's economic growth with that of other countries to
make still greater contributions to global economic development in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
A resolution on the reforms of state-owned enterprises adopted
at the just-concluded Fourth Plenum of the 15th Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China is bound to accelerate China's
pace of economic reforms and opening.
</P>
<P>
Most experts believe that all this will make China even more
appealing to overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 27 Injured in Bus Blast in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- At least one passenger were
killed and 27 others were injured Sunday afternoon in eastern Sri
Lanka when the bus they were traveling in was hit by a bomb blast,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the blast happened around 1:00 p.m. local time
at Passara, about 200 kilometers east of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The injured has been rushed to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
No one has yet claimed responsibility for the blast. But the
sources believed that it was the work of separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the LTTE rebels have stepped up attacks in the
east after heavy fighting was reported in the northern Wanni
region as the government troops made another attempt to capture
more territory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, 54 Sinhalese civilians were hacked to death
by LTTE rebels in attacks on three villages in the eastern Amparai
district.
</P>
<P>
On Friday LTTE rebels ambushed a military convoy in the eastern
Batticaloa town, killing 18 soldiers on a bus with remote
controlled claymore mine.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE have been fighting a 16-year-old war against the
government for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri
Lanka's north and east.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Trans-Century Blueprint for SOE Reform and Development ( 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The major objectives for SOEs' reform and development by the
year of 2010 are basically completing strategic readjustment and
restructuring, bringing into form a more rational lay-out and
structure of the national economy, establishing a relatively
perfect modern corporate system, markedly improving economic
performance, markedly strengthening scientific and technological
development, market competition and risk-resisting, and giving the
state sector a better dominant role in the national economy in
accordance with the fundamental transformation of the economic
structure and economic growth mode, and with the needs of opening
up further to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The Decision sets out the following guiding principles in
promoting SOEs' reform and development:
</P>
<P>
-- With public ownership as the dominant form, diverse forms of
ownership develop side by side.
</P>
<P>
-- Strategically readjusting the lay-out of the state sector
and restructuring the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
-- Combining reforms with restructuring, regrouping, and
enhancement of management.
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing the modern corporate system.
</P>
<P>
-- Pushing forward scientific and technological advancement of
enterprises.
</P>

readjusting the structure to centralize their capacity and
strengthening the key state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Various effective forms to realize public ownership should be
actively explored, and greater efforts be made to develop share-
holding economy and economies with mixed ownerships, while the
State controls the main stake in key enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The strategic regrouping of state-owned enterprises should be
continued in a bid to bring market mechanism into full play, and
efforts should be made to foster powerful and competitive larger
enterprises and enterprise groups and relax control over and
enliven small and mid-sized state-owned enterprises, the document
says.
</P>
<P>
To establish a modern enterprise system is the orientation of
the reform in state-owned enterprises and also an effective way to
combine public ownership and market economy.
</P>
<P>
The Decision points out that it is necessary to introduce
standardized corporate system reform into large and mid-sized
state-owned enterprises, and establish and improve the structure
of corporate legal person management, and be market-aware and
concentrate efforts on transforming enterprises' operating
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Improving the balance of assets and debts of the SOEs and
reducing their social burden should associate with preventing and
reducing financial risks, promoting internal restructuring and
fostering scientific management in SOEs.

<HEADLINE> Egyptians Tend to Vote for Mubarak's Fourth Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian voters cast their
ballots on Sunday in a referendum certain to endorse parliament
nomination of President Hosni Mubarak for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
The poll started at 8:00 local time (0500 GMT) and will end at
17:00 (14:00 GMT). Results are expected on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the polling station in the El Oukaf Secondary School in
Cairo's Mohandesin District, hundreds of voters gathered on the
school playground, chanting pro-Mubarak slogans.
</P>
<P>
"Yes to Mubarak!" "Mubarak, we love you!" "We would like to
sacrifice for you!" chanted the voters, holding high a large
portrait of Mubarak and banner supporting the president.
</P>
<P>
"We support Mubarak's leadership as he has done a lot to
improve the life of the Egyptian people during the past 18 years,"
Esam Hosni, a preparatory school English teacher, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Mubarak is leading the country in a process to better its
economic landscape by carrying out reform programs and large-scale
irrigation projects such as the Toshka scheme in the south," Hosni
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he will vote for the president, "one hundred percent."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was first elected president in 1981 after the
assassination of former president Anwar Sadat. He was re-elected
twice in 1987 and 1993. In the past referendums, Mubarak received
more than 95 percent "yes" votes.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's constitution does not allow for a direct presidential
election. Instead, the parliament, the People's Assembly,
nominates one candidate for the presidency. A referendum must then
be held to endorse the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, which is dominated by Mubarak's National
Democratic Party, chose him for a fourth six-year term in
July. The voters are asked to say "yes" or "no" to the nominee.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has set up a total of 40,907 polling stations in the 26
governorates for about 24 million eligible voters of the country's
64 million people.
</P>
<P>
Three hours after the polls opened, Mubarak cast a ballot with
his wife Suzanne and two sons at a school in the posh Cairo suburb
of Heliopolis.
</P>
<P>
The government devoted considerably to secure "yes" votes for
Mubarak. Portraits of the president and banners supporting him fly
from government buildings and along the main streets in the
capital. The government provided free rides for the day on all
state-owned vehicles. The major pro-government newspapers,
Al-Ahram and Al Gomhuria, emblazoned their front pages with color
photos of Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has been keen on helping advance the Arab-Israeli peace
talks and launched an economic privatization program which has
helped Egypt maintain one of the best economic performances in the
Middle East.

<P>
These problems should be solved step by step through various
means in consideration of the country's current macro-economic and
financial situation to help enterprises increase flowing capital
and reduce debts.
</P>
<P>
Attention should be paid to keeping up with the global trend in
industrial restructuring and the changing demand of domestic and
overseas markets, and accelerate technological renovation and
elevation of industries.
</P>
<P>
With the market as a guide, advanced technology should be used
to transform traditional industries and strengthen technological
renovation in these industries with the goal of diversifying

exports.
</P>
<P>
The SOEs should hold an important position in new and hi-tech

industrial leaders, the Decision notes.
</P>
<P>
The country must open wider to the outside world, establish a
sound legal system for the socialist market economy, develop

favorable macro-economic climate for the reform and development of
the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening and improving the leadership of the Party is the

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Offered Free Zone on Red Sea Coast: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia, which is eager
to increase its import and export, has received an offer from
neighboring Sudan to use its port and to open business at Red Sea
Free Zone, an Ethiopian weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, which established a 26-square-kilometer Red Sea Free
Zone along the Sudanese Red Sea Coast, is expected to attract the
increasing business of Ethiopian import and export, Sudanese
officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The free zone situated at south of Port Sudan is qualified to
host infra- structure investment projects, export processing
industries, banking and insurance activities, warehousing and
other related activities, according to the report by "the Capital"
.
</P>
<P>
Since the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea erupted last
May, Ethiopia has been forced to use the Djibouti Port, which has
turned to be the only sea outlet of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Trade and Industry Minister Kassahun Ayele said
recently that the Ethiopian government would consider using
alternative ports in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that given improved political relations with
Sudan, Ethiopia will try to use Sudanese ports as well as Kenya's
Port of Mombasa and the Berbera Port in Somalia. He stressed that
"depending on only one port is dangerous."
</P>
<P>
According to Sudanese officials, the industrial, commercial and
service investment projects approved in the Sudanese Free Zone
will enjoy exemptions from all customs taxes except service
charge.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sea Free Zone is currently managed by the Sudanese Free
Zone and Markets Company, a government agency established in 1993
with a 20 million U.S. dollar working capital.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sea Free Zone is the first phase out of the 600 square
kilometers of free zone area projected to be established in
different parts of the country, Sudanese officials said.

<HEADLINE> Modern Corporate System Key to China's SOE Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- To establish a modern
enterprise system is a necessary requirement to develop socialized
mass production and market economy and also an effective way to
combine public ownership and market economy, so it is the
orientation of the reform of China's state-owned enterprises,
according to a decision of the 15th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Major Issues
Concerning the Reform and Development of State-Owned Enterprises,
which was made public today, notes that in the process of
establishing and improving the modern corporate system, efforts
should be made to fully understand and master requirements for a
clear definition of property rights, rights and duty, separation
of administrative and corporate functions, and scientific
management. And a good job is required in the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to push forward the task of separating
administrative and corporate functions.
</P>
<P>
The government performs the functions of stake holders in the
state-financed enterprises or state share-holding companies via
its designated representatives, enjoys rights to share assets
profits, makes major decisions and selects operation managers in
accordance with the scale of investment, and bears limited
responsibilities into enterprises' debts, but will not interfere
in daily operations of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Party and government departments at different levels should
fully separate themselves from economic entities they run or
enterprises they directly administer in terms of personnel and
financial management.
</P>
<P>
-- Active efforts should be made to explore effective ways for
management of state assets.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to gradually construct a network and mechanism
for management, supervision and operation of state assets in
accordance with the principles of the ownership by the state,
classified management, franchised operation and division of
supervision, and to establish and improve a strict responsibility
system.
</P>
<P>
Localities will be allowed and encouraged to make experiments
toward exploring the detailed measures for the management of state
assets.

<HEADLINE> Modern Corporate System Key to China's SOE Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- Introduce standardized corporate system reform into large
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to clarify the duty of councils of share-
holders, the board of directors, the board of supervisors and
managerial ranks, form a corporate legal person management
structure by which each legal person is responsible for his own
duty and harmonious operation but is under effective restriction.
</P>
<P>
Diversity of equities is conducive to the formation of a
standardized corporate legal person management structure, and it
is necessary to make active efforts in developing companies
featuring multiple investing entities except a small number of
enterprises that should be monopolized by the state.
</P>
<P>
-- Be market-aware and concentrate efforts on transforming
enterprise operation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to gradually establish mechanisms under which
successful enterprises survive and loss-incurring enterprises are
eliminated, operators can be promoted or demoted, personnel can be
employed or fired, income can be raised or be lowered,
technologies are kept upgrading, and the value of state assets are
preserved and incremented.
</P>
<P>
An income distribution system compatible with the modern
enterprise system should be established, and the practice of
members from the board of directors and the managerial ranks
obtaining rewards according to their respective duty and
contributions should be introduced under the guidance of the
policies of the state.
</P>
<P>
Salary standards of workers should be decided by enterprises in
accordance with the average social salary of different localities
and the performance of the enterprises. Inside the enterprises,
the principle of distribution according to work should be followed,
and proper income gaps will be allowed. Factors of production such
as capital and technologies will be permitted and encouraged to be
taken into account in distribution of profits.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures should be practiced to solve the current
problem that personal income of some monopolized industries are
too high.

<HEADLINE> China Defends Asian Women's Volleyball Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China
encountered a stiff challenge from Japan before winning the title
for the seventh time in a row on Sunday at the 10th Asian Women's
Volleyball Championship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players defeated their Japanese counterparts 25-19,
20-25,25-23 and 25-19.
</P>
<P>
"We have completed our first goal of the year, winning the
title and the berth in the World Cup," said Hu Jin, head coach of
the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
He said the next goal for the Chinese is to gain the right to
play in the 2000 Olympic Games next year by finishing among the
top three places at the up-coming World Cup women's tournament in
Japan in November.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team got to a flying start by resorting to varied
tactics with a string of changes and powerful spikes and kept
their dominance on the court in the first set, winning 25-19.
</P>
<P>
But the second set saw the spirited Japanese turning the table
with a good teamwork and fast attacks. After taking the second set
25-20, the Japanese continued their dominance in the beginning of
the third set, leading at 18-14.
</P>
<P>
After a time-out, the world and Olympic silver medalists
Chinese struggled to find their powerful spikes and fast attacks
and run away with the set at 25-23.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set proved to be an easy work for the Chinese, who
kept the rhythm with their superiority over the net before taking
the set and the match 25-19.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth meeting between China and Japan this year
with the Chinese winning all the matches.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Taking Measures to Reduce SOE Burdens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- To gradually solve problems
of China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) such as high asset-to-
liability rate, capital shortage and heavy social burden is of
utmost importance in their reform and development, according to a
decision of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
These problems should be solved step by step through various
means in consideration of the country's current macro-economic and
financial situation, says the Decision of the CPC Central
Committee on Major Issues Concerning the Reform and Development of
State-Owned Enterprises, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
The decision puts forward the following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese banks should have more reserves for writing off the
non-performing loans caused by the merger and bankruptcy of SOEs
and closure of a number of dried-up coal mines, especially in key
industries. Incentives will be given to encourage the merger
between state-owned and collectively-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
-- Major SOEs, currently debt-ridden but having potentials,
should solve the problem of high asset-to-liability rate by debt-
to-equity swap, together with the state banks' current reform on
handling non-performing loans and with the help of financial asset
management firms.
</P>
<P>
-- Accumulation of funds through direct means should be
enhanced. SOEs which already met the qualifications for listing
may raise funds in domestic and overseas capital markets, and the
proportion of public shares under current circulation should be
increased. Other SOEs may prepare for the listing by debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
State-owned and state holding enterprises will be allowed to
participate in the allocation of new shares. A number of high-
yielding and promising state holding listed companies will be
picked out to reduce the state capital proportion, and the capital
thus raised will be used for other SOEs' reform and development.
</P>
<P>
The system of stock issuance and listing should be further
improved to promote the healthy development of China's securities
market.
</P>
<P>
-- With the government approval, unlisted SOEs can acquire cash
by transferring their land-use right or fixed assets for
increasing working capital and reducing debts as well as their own
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
-- The government policies on the interest rate should be
strictly followed to alleviate SOEs' burdens.
</P>
<P>
-- Large SOEs with the capability of paying off debts are
allowed to issue corporate bonds with government approval and
after appraisal by intermediate agencies, and some enterprises are
permitted issue corporate bonds outside China as well.
</P>
<P>
-- SOEs will gradually break away from the social welfare
responsibility (for running their own schools, hospitals and other
services) in an effort to reduce their social burden.

<HEADLINE> Two Australia Law Firms Approved to Open Offices in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Justice today
granted two Australian law firms approval to establish branch
agencies in China, bringing the total number of foreign law firms
in China to 81.
</P>
<P>
Today's move represents a quick response to President Jiang
Zemin's pledge during his visit to Australia earlier this month
that the ratification of two more Australian law offices in China
would mark another step in the progress of Sino-Australian
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Deacons Graham &AMP; James and the Minter Ellison law firms
will locate their offices in China's largest city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Along with the 81 foreign law firms from 10 countries, there
are 26 others from Hong Kong who have opened branch offices in
China, said Gao Changli, minister of justice, at today's ceremony
for issuing certificates of approval to the two Australian firms.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the top 50 law firms in the world, over a
half have opened branches offices in China, and many of the rest
have made application to do so.
</P>
<P>
Gao pledged that the Ministry of Justice will, as always, do
its best to help more overseas law firms set up branches in the
country for better services to foreign investors in China, and
China's foreign trade and economic cooperation with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister is working on relevant regulations governing the
ratification and operations of foreign law firm branch offices in
China, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's 8,400 law firms were employing
over 110,000 lawyers by the end of last year. Seven Chinese law
firms have established agencies in foreign countries.

JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After meeting with French President Jacques Chirac in Paris
Saturday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called on the
international community for support to ensure that the latest
Israeli-Palestinian agreement is followed through. Meanwhile, the
Israeli-Palestinian committee on the safe-passage route between
Gaza and the West Bank will meet Sunday to try to iron out the
remaining differences and finalize the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Syria suffered a diplomatic blow when it failed to keep
other Arab countries from attending a multilateral meeting with
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in New York Friday. The
absence of Syria and Lebanon got more attention than the presence
of 11 Arab countries and 5 countries from the Persian Gulf, some
of which have no diplomatic relations with Israel. Levy said after
the meeting that the major significance of the event "was in that
it expressed the commitment of the Arab world and the countries of
the Persian Gulf and the Maghreb to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A crisis over the government funding of Shas' school system
hung on Saturday night as Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Education
Minister Yossi Sarid failed to reach an agreement with the
Shas. Despite marathon efforts which began late Thursday, Shas
denied compromise proposals from Barak and Sarid, which include
the demand that Shas fire head of its school system, who is under
investigation by police for fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Musa Damri, a 56-year-old resident of Silwan in East
Jerusalem, Saturday shot dead two of his three grown daughters
and seriously wounded the third one before committing
suicide. Police investigators discovered that the father, a
retired bus driver, had a history of physically abusing his
daughters and that he often complained that they did not treat
him with respect.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Senior Arab diplomats in Cairo
lauded on Sunday the efforts exerted by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in helping realize regional peace and stability, and
improving the national economic landscape.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Assistant Secretary General Ahmed Bin Halay said
Mubarak "has a strategic vision" for peace and stability in the
Middle East and Egypt's drive to enhance economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Halay made the remarks in an interview with the Voice of Arab
radio on the occasion of Egypt's referendum which is certain to

fourth six-year term.
</P>
<P>
"Mubarak has a clear strategic vision based on accurate
calculations and giving top priorities to the national dimension,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was first elected president in 1981 after the
assassination of former president Anwar Sadat. He was re-elected
twice in 1987 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
During his 18 years in office, Mubarak has pushed forward the
peace process with Israel and kicked off a privatization program
making Egypt maintain one of the best economic performances in the
Middle East.
</P>

The parliament, the People's Assembly, nominated Mubarak for a
new term in July. Mubarak, who received 95 percent "yes" votes in
the past referendums, is set to win again this time.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with the Cairo-based radio, Algerian
Ambassador to Egypt Mostafa Sherif said Mubarak "has spared no
efforts to close the Arab ranks."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president "is respected and held in high esteem by
Algerians," Sherif said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Folk Show Popular in National Minorities Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A long bamboo rod with
umbrella-shaped decorations and jingle bells at top was vertically
tossed into the air from the performer's tiptoe and a second later
it fell upright on his forehead, arousing loud cheering and
applause from the spectators in the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
"Zhongfan", a traditional Chinese folk show is being displayed
as one of the demonstration events at China's National Games for
Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities in Beijing. And it
is becoming one of the most welcomed events at the week-long Games
opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the ten-minute acrobatic action, the performer props "
Zhongfan" up from or let it fall on the forehead, nose, jaws,
shoulder, elbow, thumb, little finger or even tiptoe and,
occasionally, tosses it from one another without even using their
hands. It could be performed individually or by a team of up to
five members.
</P>
<P>
Dating back as early as in ancient China's Tang Dynasty (618-
907), "Zhongfan" was originally an oriflamme in the army or
present as part of the royal guard of honor. Mongolian tribe
soldiers usually perform it as an exercise or just for fun.
</P>
<P>
It was later developed into a folk show among such minority
nationalities in China as Mongolia, Manchu and Hui. The oriflamme
was transformed into the current shape to make it the performance
more difficult and more entertaining as well.
</P>
<P>
The "Zhongfan" for performance now weighs about 25 kilograms,
with the bamboo rod some 12 centimeters in diameter and 10 meters
long.
</P>
<P>
"As a Chinese quintessence, it should be cherished and further
promoted to make it more prosperous," said famous performer Chang
Quandong. A member of the Mongolia minority nationality himself,
Chang, 54, leads a Beijing-based Zhongfan League, one of the most
famous Zhongfan clubs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chang's team members are all from his family, including his son
and nephews. He said he wishes to set up a school to teach "
Zhongfan" performance.
</P>
<P>
"I've been interviewed by the China Central Television and it
will be broadcast tomorrow," said a proud and delighted Chang.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Trans-Century Blueprint for SOE Reform and Development ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Decision of the Central
Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) on Major Issues
Concerning the Reform and Development of State-owned Enterprises (
SOEs), adopted at the 4th Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee
on September 22, 1999, was officially issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-word Decision, which consists of 12 parts, reaffirms
the leading role of state economy in the national economy and puts
forward trans-century objectives and guiding principles until 2010
for SOE reform and development.
</P>
<P>
The 4th Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee, held
in Beijing during September 19-22, stressed the SOEs' important
role in promoting the country's social and economic development as
well as in consolidating the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
The plenum pointed out that promoting SOE reform and
development is an important and pressing task. Currently, SOE
reform and development is at a critical stage, with some deep-
seated problems yet to be solved. And it is timely and necessary
for the session to concentrate on studying issues related to the
SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Since New China was founded 50 years ago and especially since
China's reform and opening-up, the Chinese people of all
nationalities have, through unremitting efforts, scored great
achievements in the socialist construction under the leadership of
the Party. China has developed from a poor and backward agrarian
country into a socialist country that will soon become well-off
and is striding toward the goal of industrialization and
modernization. This is a great historical leap forward in the
developing process of the Chinese nationality, to which SOEs and
the working class have made great and indelible contribution, the
Decision says.

LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Royalty are also-rans and most politicians are passe in
Britain's circles of power, according to a study of who really
rules the country. Instead, power lies with chiefs of business and
finance, who dominate a new analysis of the 500 people with the
greatest control and influence over British life.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made a
historic pledge on Sunday night to restore Britain to full
employment, as an exclusive poll revealed growing disillusionment
with his government's failure to deliver on its election promises.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair on Sunday pledged to lead Labour into a third
general election, dealing a bitter blow to the ambitions of Gordon
Brown, the Chancellor of Exchequer who has always believed Blair
would step down at some point to let him become Prime Minister if
Labour wins a second term.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Monsanto, the U.S. genetically modified food giant, drew up
plans to make billions of dollars of the world's water crisis,
confidential company documents revealed. The documents identify a
"vast economic opportunity" for the company in impending global
shortages of resources such as water.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Land Use Policy to Prevent Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Sunday called on the congress to legislate a national land use
policy in order to minimize consequences of earthquake disasters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the administration, National Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said in an interview here that a national land use
policy could give all concerned sectors a "map" of areas
pinpointed by authorities as prone to earthquake or landslide.
</P>
<P>
"When we have a map, we will have a sort of a plan that we use
when we build a house. But for the past several decades, we have
been using lands indiscriminately," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who is also chairman of the National Disaster
Coordinating Council (NDCC), said the need for a land use policy
was made clear as early as August, when a landslide destroyed
several houses at the Cherry Hills subdivision in Antipolo City,
Manila.
</P>
<P>
He said developers must know which lands are safe for
development into residential or industrial areas and which lands
be developed for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The national land use policy is a long-term solution that would
complement the government's program to achieve food security and
disaster preparedness, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We really want a long-term solution. The first thing that we
should do is to push a bill in the congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said that as part of its program for disaster
preparedness, the NDCC, in coordination with the Metro Manila
Development Authority (MMDA) and Local Government Units (LGUs), is
now conducting earthquake and fire drills.
</P>
<P>
As an earthquake-prone country, the Philippines experiences at
least five earthquakes a day, but most of them are too weak to be
felt.

<HEADLINE> Israel Issues Settlement Expansion Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Housing and
Construction Ministry has issued 2,600 new tenders for house
constructions in the settlements of the West Bank, Israel Radio
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All those tenders were issued after the new government came to
power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim,
and others for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the
Radio quoted ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ma'aleh Adumim is the largest settlement situated just east of
Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers. It is called city instead of
settlement now.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are one of
the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestinians
during their final-status talks which have been launched September
13.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the
settlement expansions pending a final solution to this
issue. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in his U.N. address on
Wednesday has asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement
expansions in the territories.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in
Ma'aleh Adumim, no matter what happens in the future.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement
on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he would, like
the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, continue to expand it.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem,"
which has triggered sharp criticism from the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem Affairs,
said that the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is
"evacuation."
</P>
<P>
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian
cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to
situations like those in Kosovo," he added.

<HEADLINE> Egyptians Begin to Vote on Mubarak's Fourth Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptians began early Sunday to
cast ballots in a referendum which is believed to be certain to
endorse parliament nomination of President Hosni Mubarak for a
fourth term.
</P>
<P>
The poll started at 8:00 local time (0500 GMT) and will end at
17:00 (14:00 GMT). The result is expected on Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 voters entered a polling station in a school in
the Mohandesin District when the voting process kicked off. Some
of them arrived there by free rides provided by the government on
all state-owned transportation for the day.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has set up a total of 40,907 polling stations in the 26
governorates across Egypt for about 24 million eligible voters of
the country's 64 million people to cast their ballots in the
yes-no referendum.
</P>
<P>
Portraits of Mubarak and banners supporting him fly from
government buildings and along the main streets in the capital,
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
In the past referendums, Mubarak received more than 95 percent
"yes" votes.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's constitution does not allow for a direct presidential
election. Instead, the parliament, the People's Assembly,
nominates one candidate for the presidency. A referendum must then
be held to endorse the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, which is dominated by Mubarak's National
Democratic Party, chose him for a fourth six-year term in
July. The voters are asked to say "yes" or "no" to the nominee.
</P>
<P>
After the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981,
Mubarak, the then vice president, became president. He was
re-elected in 1987 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has been keen on helping advance the Arab-Israeli
peace talks and unleashed an economic privatization program which
has helped Egypt maintain one of the best economic performances in
the Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The tuberculosis (TB) drugs
are often in short supply in most Zambian public hospitals and
clinics, Sunday Mail newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The report also revealed that while the University Teaching
Hospital in Lusaka, the biggest hospital in Zambia and even in
southern Africa, and other public health institutions suffer acute
shortage of TB drugs, private pharmacies have almost all types of
TB drugs.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Central Board of Health maintained that the
shortage at public hospitals was a result of insufficient drugs
being brought into the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the source declined to comment on allegations of
pilfering of the TB drugs from public hospitals to private
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper reported that more than 4,000
TB cases were detected last year in Kitwe district of Copperbelt
Province alone, and over 600 people of them died.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A grand gathering of more than
1,000 people from all walks of life was held here in Macao Sunday
morning to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People
's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, presidium chairman of a local preparatory committee
for celebrating the anniversary, expressed the common aspirations
of the Macao people that the motherland will grow stronger and
more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and
through the concerted hard work of the people all over the country,
China has shown earth-shaking changes since our New China was
founded 50 years ago," said the 80-year-old Ma, who is also
chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country enjoys unprecedented national
strength, its productivity is greatly boosted and the people have
much higher living standards. "History is a good testimony that
the Socialist system has incomparable advantage and vitality and
that the Chinese people have a strong cohesive force."
</P>
<P>
While celebrating China's 50th birthday, Macao residents are
happy to see Macao's return to the motherland later this year, Ma
said. After Hong Kong, Macao's return will be another good example
to demonstrate the correctness of the "one country, two systems"
concept, Ma added.
</P>
<P>
"The fate of Macao has been closely linked with that of the
motherland. We are fully aware of the fact that only a stronger
motherland can give Macao a promising future," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Macao residents of various social quarters to take
an active part in the preparatory work for the establishment of
the Macao Special Administrative Region on December 20 and build a
better future.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-elect of the Macao SAR, and
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
joined local residents at the party, where artistic performances
were also staged.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several days, social bodies in Macao have held
various activities to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> 500 Kenyans Die of AIDS Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- About 500 people die of AIDS
in Kenya every day, a senior Kenyan health official has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation newspaper quoted Health Ministry Permanent
Secretary Julius Meme as saying that AIDS has become a major
public health concern and hindered economic development in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Seventy to 80 percent of those dying of the epidemic are aged
between 15 to 49 years, who are most economically productive, "
Meme said.
</P>
<P>
The productive capacity of these people have caused great
economic loss to the country, which amounts to over 200 million
shillings (about 2.7 million U.S. dollars) per day, said Meme.
</P>
<P>
"Out of the two million Kenyans infected with AIDS, 100,000 are
children below five years old," added Meme.
</P>
<P>
The Joint United Nations Program on AIDS estimates that by the
end of 1999, 33.4 million people will have been infected with HIV
in the world, and out of these 22 million are in sub-Sahara
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Kills 12 Tamil Rebels in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry
said Sunday that its troops killed 12 Tamil rebels in the latest
conflicts in the north of the country as security has been
tightened ahead of the first anniversary of a major battle.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that troops Saturday killed
seven Tamil rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
in two separate incidents in the northern Wanni region.
</P>
<P>
It said troops killed four LTTE guerrillas in the early hours
of Sunday in the Wanni region, the main battlefield between the
troops and LTTE rebels who have been fighting a 16-year-old war
for a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said troops Saturday sniped and killed one more
rebel south of Paranthan in the Jaffna region.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting came as the warring sides are going to
observe the first anniversary of a major battle in the Wanni
region.
</P>
<P>
During the battle starting from September 27 last year, the
government troops recaptured Mankulam town but lost Kilinochchi,
which is just below the neck of the northern Jaffna peninsula, the
former stronghold of LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The loss of Kilinochchi forced the government to suspend one of
its longest military operations which had been launched in May
1997 to open a land route to Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Officials said troops were on alert in all sensitive areas in
the warfront expecting attack by the LTTE rebels to mark their
victory at Kilinochchi where they defeated the government troops
and killed hundreds of them.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Arab Ministers' Decision Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel has welcomed a
decision by Arab foreign ministers to avert the controversy over
the depiction of Jerusalem at the Israeli pavilion in Disney's
Epcot Park, Florida, U.S..
</P>
<P>
After holding a "special meeting" in New York on Friday with
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, Arab foreign ministers
decided to accept reassurances from Disney that the Israeli
exhibit at the park will not refer to Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel, said the Israeli Foreign Ministry in a statement issued
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Levy's meeting with the Arab foreign ministers was held in an
amicable atmosphere following Levy's declaration that under no
circumstances would Israel accept the dual track of a political
campaign being conducted against Israel at the same time the peace
process moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
It was never Disney's intention to offer a political point of
view and Disney is an entertainment company dedicated to simply
bringing delight to its guests, said Disney executives.
</P>
<P>
But the Ministry's statement contradicted this clarification by
saying that anyone who visits the Israeli exhibit at Epcot will
receive a clear message that Jerusalem is Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab states and organizations had threatened to boycott
Disney unless all references to Jerusalem being Israel's capital
at the Israeli pavilion were removed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has also asked the Disney not to
yield to Arab pressure regarding Israel's participation in the
Disney's millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to harm Israel's standing on Jerusalem as its capital
failed in the past and would fail in the future," Barak said in
his statement last week.

<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh may win at least
seven golds and rank fourth in the medals tally at the eighth
South Asian Federation Games (SAF), The Star Sport reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The eighth SAF, the biggest sporting festival of the seven
South Asian countries, opened in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu on
Saturday and will last till October 4.
</P>
<P>
"The disciplines to which we are mostly looking forward is
shooting and with a little bit of luck, we might also win the
football gold," contingent general manger Lutful Huq was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He blamed "bad luck" for Bangladesh never winning the football
gold despite having reached the SAF final for a record five times.

<P>
"We will win more medals in the games where mental toughness in
needed, and with a standard we have high hopes of winning a
considerable number of silver medals," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believes that India would win almost half of the 159 gold
medals, and Pakistan and Sri Lank might remain in the second and
third positions.
</P>

Bangladesh might also win gold medals from swimming and
taekwondo, accordng to a report in The Independent daily newspaper,

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sets to Work Against Honor Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A national anti-honor crimes
committee of Jordan has garnered 8,000 signatures in the first
month of a national campaign to cancel clauses in the penal code
to pardon or reduce the penalties for alleged honor killers.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press on Sunday, the independent National
Jordanian Campaign Committee to Eliminate Crimes of Honor said it
had distributed 713 petition sheets among citizens in various
parts of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In the petition, the group called on the government to abolish
Article 340 of the penal code, which pardons or reduce prison
terms for men who killed their wives or female relatives for
actual or suspected involvement in illicit relationships.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 women are killed each year in the kingdom with a
4.7 million population for honor-related reasons, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statement praised the efforts of hundreds of concerned
citizens who volunteered to help collect signatures and called on
everyone to joint the effort either by signing the petition or by
helping to gather more signatures.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was initiated by a group of Jordanians who claimed
they have no personal, political or racial interests, but to
"secure a good and safe life, free of violence in a society that
protects the rights of all."
</P>
<P>
In July this year, a special committee under the ministry of
justice decided to cancel Article 340 in the penal code, but the
decision still needs endorsement of the lower and upper house,
followed by a Royal Decree.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Rises in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output in August 1999 rose by 18.4 percent over a year earlier,
continuing a trend of two-digit growth for four months in a row,
Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months this year, manufacturing output grew
12.6 percent compared with the same period of last year, the
ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, all clusters in the manufacturing
sector recorded an increase in their August output with the
electronics cluster leading the gainers.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster gained 33.6 percent year-on-year in its
August output as strong demand for cellular phones and ICs boosted
output of telecommunication equipment and semiconductors
substantially.
</P>
<P>
The production of disk drives was slightly higher than a year
ago despite the restructuring by the drive makers but output of
PCBAs decreased due to less export demand.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster grew by 16.7 percent over the same month
last year with the pharmaceuticals segment and the
industrial/specialty chemicals segment soaring by 54.3 percent and
63 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, output of petrochemicals and petroleum products in
August contracted by 3.3 and 19.4 percent year-on-year, offsetting
gains by the pharmaceuticals and the industrial/specialty
chemicals segment.
</P>
<P>
Output of the engineering cluster in August picked up 3.4
percent year-on-year as the 8.9-percent contraction in the
transport engineering segment dragged down a 14.1-percent hike in
the precision engineering segment and a marginal 1.8-percent
growth in the process engineering segment.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months this year, the cumulative outputs of
the electronics and chemical clusters registered a 22.5- and
17.5-percent growth respectively while the engineering cluster
dipped 1.4 percent compared with the same period of last year.

WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The organizers of the 2002
Winter Olympic Games announced the names of the mascots Saturday
in Salt Lake City, the United States.
</P>
<P>

million. The stuffed animals will go on sale early as this holiday
season in Utah for $10 to $40.
</P>
<P>
The snowshoe hare, coyote and bear, all characters in western
Indian myth, first appeared in May. After the unveiling, SLOC
opened up the suggested names to a nationwide vote. The other
options were Sky, Cliff and Shadow or Arrow, Bolt and Rocky.
</P>
<P>
SLOC President Mitt Romney said the names represent Utah, with"
Powder" symbolizing the state's claim to "the greatest snow on
earth" and "Copper" and "Coal" representing the land.

<HEADLINE> ADB Sets Conditions for Funding Bangladesh Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has set some pre-conditions for funding the proposed "Dhaka
Power System Upgrading Project" of the Dhaka Electric Supply
Authority (DESA), The Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official sources, the paper said the conditions include
separation of transmission and distribution systems from the Power
Development Board (PDB) to lessen the state monopoly on the
county's power sector.
</P>
<P>
The ADB agreed earlier to provide 150 million U.S. dollars to
the project to help improve power supply in the capital city,
Dhaka, and reduce system loss and pilferage in power distribution
in the DESA area.
</P>
<P>
ADB's resident representative in Dhaka Phipphit Suphaphiphat
said in a recent letter to the Bangladesh Energy Ministry that the
ADB would provide necessary fund to the "Dhaka Power System
Upgrading Project" only after getting the government's assurance
of fulfilling the conditions, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB asked the Energy Ministry to respond to the
pre-conditions by October 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
The ADB would hold official discussions on the project with the
government by the middle of next month, Suphaphiphat was quoted as
saying. "ADB's intention is to help the government to improve its
power sector. But it depends on the government's policy measures
to create a favorable situation for the fund providers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the power sector should be "un-bundled" by transferring
the transmission and distribution systems to different
organizations other than the PDB and the DESA.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Ministry at a meeting in April this year admitted
that the DESA failed to supply around 300 megawatts of electricity
due to lack of proper transmission lines and observed that some
new transmission lines should be built on an emergency basis to
reduce loadshedding in the capital city, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country's total electricity demand is about 2,300 megawatts
while the production capacity of the PDB is between 2,000 and
2,100 megawatts.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Opposition Rejects Peace Treaty With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 460 representatives from
13 Jordanian parties, 12 professional associations and labor
unions have reiterated rejection to the 1994 peace treaty between
Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a 15-point resolution adopted after a second
anti-normalization conference concluded on Saturday, the
representatives called on Arabs to refrain from recognizing
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The resolution lauded armed resistance against Israeli
occupation in South Lebanon, and called for Arabs to support
the Lebanese in their struggle for freedom.
</P>
<P>
The resolution denounced Arab governments for their drive
against Palestinian resistance movements.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Jordanian government in particular to release
two senior leaders of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and
their associates arrested during a month-long crackdown on the
movement, and to "open a new page to enable the group to pursue
its struggle against the Zionist occupation."
</P>
<P>
Hamas politburo chief Khalid Mishaal and spokesman Ibrahim
Gosheh were still under detention with 19 of their associates on
charges of engaging in illegal political activities and holding
military exercises in Jordan as part of Hamas campaigns against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The anti-normalization conference, the second of its kind since
1995, represented a strong anti-Israel sentiment in the 4.7
million Jordanian population, of whom over 60 percent are of
Palestinian origins.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, and the
government has based its foreign policies on keeping friendly
relations with all neighbor countries, including Israel.
</P>
<P>
The desert kingdom has also been a firm supporter and broker of
the peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including
the Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Parliament Leader Calls China Egypt's Sincere Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Egyptian People'
s Assembly (Parliament) Ahmad Fathi Sorour said China is Egypt's
sincere friend that supports all just causes of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua before the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China, Sorour expressed confidence that the
cordial and historical friendship will last long between Egypt and
China.
</P>
<P>
Egypt took the lead in the Arab and African nations to set up
diplomatic ties with China in 1956, Sorour said, adding that this
step has yielded fruitful achievements through consistent
cooperation in bilateral relations and on regional and
international issues including the Middle East peace process and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
"I have visited China many times, and every time I find China
achieve new success in economic and social development," Sorour
said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the wise leadership of the Chinese government in
enabling the country to fall in line with the new international
economic environment without affecting its socialist system.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also succeeded in forging a concord
between market liberalization and socialist market economy and in
forming strong economic and social structures, which have helped
China achieve rapid economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sorour praised China's foreign policy based on independence,
self reliance, opposition to hegemony and power politics, and
protection of world peace.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China has made great achievements in
the diplomatic field, strengthening the traditional and cordial
relations with the Arab world and other developing countries, and
promoting ties with the developed countries including the United
States, Japan and the European Union members, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is now playing a more effective role in safeguarding
world peace, stability and development, the Egyptian parliament
leader noted.
</P>
<P>
The world community lauds China's prominent role in seeking
solutions to the Gulf crisis and the agreement on Cambodia as well
as in enhancing dialogue aimed at securing peace on the Korean
peninsular, controlling armament and building of a new world order,
Sorour said.
</P>
<P>
Sorour said it is a must that economic relations be developed
and boosted between Egypt and China to reach the same lofty level
as political relations. And to benefit from the great potentials
of the Chinese market, Egypt can increase its exports and expand
the scope of trade exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sorour said he hoped that China would play a more effective
role in regional and international politics in the coming century,
shouldering more responsibilities and tasks in protecting the
rights and interests of the developing countries as well as the
world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Promises to Promote Global Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Major industrial nations
pledged Saturday to make further joint efforts to improve the
international economic outlook and to strengthen financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group
of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries, who held a one-day
meeting here, agreed that the global economic outlook has improved.
</P>
<P>
The improved outlook has been characterized by the beginnings
of a foundation for balanced and widely shared growth in the major
industrial countries, and a solidifying recovery in emerging
markets in Asia, G-7 said in a statement issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the United States and Canada, prospects are favorable for
another year of solid growth and job creation in a low-inflation
environment, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers and governors agreed that the world is
still faced with a number of challenges in fostering a strong and
sustained world recovery with financial stability.
</P>
<P>
"In our discussions of the global economy, we recognized that
it is important not to take recent improvements in the global
outlook for granted and that there remain serious challenges ahead,
" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers at a press
conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
G-7 members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, while reaffirming the importance of progress in
achieving a more balanced pattern of growth among the G-7
economies, urged the emerging market economies to continue to
focus on reform to promote the basis for lasting growth.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for Japan's economy, the second largest economy in
the world, and the impact of the rising yen on its fledgling
recovery figured high on the agenda of the G-7.
</P>
<P>
On exchange rates, the statement said: "We shared Japan's
concern about the potential impact of the yen's appreciation for
the Japanese economy and the world economy."
</P>
<P>
"We welcomed indications by the Japanese authorities that
policies would be conducted appropriately in view of this
potential impact," said the statement. "We will continue to
monitor developments in exchange markets and cooperate as
appropriate."
</P>
<P>
Japanese authorities pledged to "implement stimulus measures
until domestic-demand- led growth is solidly in place and, in the
context of their zero interest rate policy, to provide ample
liquidity until deflationary concerns are dispelled." the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed debt reduction and poverty reduction,
strengthening the international financial and monetary system,
anti-corruption and the Russian economy, the U.S. secretary of
treasury said.
</P>
<P>
The seven countries urged the Russian authorities to step up
economic reforms and combat the critical problems of corruption
and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Recovery Still Fragile in Developing World: G-24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 24 (G-24)
developing countries said here Saturday that global economic
prospects and financial markets have improved in the last few
months, but the recovery in the developing world remains quite
fragile.
</P>
<P>
"A number of risks and uncertainties continue to pose
challenges for policymakers," G-24 said in a communique issued
after a one-day meeting of their ministers.
</P>
<P>
A major concern arises from the unbalanced growth pattern among
major industrial countries, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Despite some stabilization in international financial markets,
net capital flows to developing countries and transition economies
have not yet recovered from the very low level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the distribution of flows remains uneven, and
interest rate spreads are still very large, the communique said.
Oil prices remain volatile, non-fuel commodity prices remain
depressed, and an early improvement appears unlikely in developing
countries' terms of trade.
</P>
<P>
Despite the various initiatives currently in place to address
the problems of the heavily indebted poor countries, comprehensive
relief is yet to be achieved, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 countries called on wealthy nations to provide "
broader, deeper and faster debt relief for heavily indebted
countries to help fight poverty," said Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, current chairman of the G-24.
</P>
<P>
The ministers considered that the uncertainty surrounding the
sustainability of global growth requires a parallel effort on the
part of industrial countries, particularly by strengthening
macroeconomic policy coordination.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 countries called for greater involvement of private
investors and creditors in overcoming their countries' financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The major challenge for the international community is to
develop a market-friendly strategy for involving the private
sector in a manner that does not disrupt or unduly raise the cost
of capital flows to developing countries," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The G-24, which represents the developing world at the annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank, will present their views to the IMF policy-making Interim
Committee meeting here Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Foreign Exchange Reserve Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign currency
reserve has been declining, from a record 3 billion U.S. dollars
in 1994 to the present 1.5 billion dollars which is the lowest in
about half a decade's time, the newspaper The New Nation reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The low foreign currency reserve figured prominently in a
recent meeting here between representatives of donor countries
and Bangladesh government officials. Donors in the meeting
expressed their acute worry over the declining reserve and
stressed all-out efforts to raise it.
</P>
<P>
Many donor countries have considerable investments in
Bangladesh. Therefore, they have a stake in uninterrupted debt
servicing and repatriation of their investments and profits.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the country noted that a good or satisfactory
reserve situation is the best guarantee of the continuous inflow
of foreign direct investments (FDIs). FDIs are much sought after
in Bangladesh against the backdrop of its low internal rate of
investments, they said. They added that FDIs are the main hope of
investments which can cater to the desperate needs of employment
and earnings in the country.
</P>
<P>
The experts expressed their concerns about the situation of the
foreign exchange reserve of the country in a report published here
on Sunday. A significant boost in export and increase in foreign
currency remittances can notably increase the reserve in a short
period of time, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, better governmental policy planning
and execution would be necessary to substantially increase
earnings from these two sectors.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Denies Intervention in Colombia's Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government
Saturday refuted Colombia's charges that Venezuela has intervened
in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente
Rangel said that the Venezuelan government does not understand the
statement made by Colombian President Andres Pastrana in a recent
interview with Washington Post, which asked Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez to keep away from Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
Rangel emphasized that the Chavez government, aware of what is
going on in its neighboring country, has adopted a prudent stand
based on non-intervention and has at the same time shown its
willingness to contribute to the solution of the Colombian crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana was quoted by the press as saying, "What I
am asking of Chavez is to keep himself in his own terrain, and
that we will manage our own problems."
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been in a civil war for decades, during which
leftist guerrillas, rightist paramilitary organizations and
government forces fought for control of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan foreign minister complained that his country
suffered a lot from the fallout of Colombia's internal troubles,
citing repeated intrusion across the border, hijackings,
kidnapping and killing of Venezuelan citizens, as well as the
refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
Rangel denied that the Venezuelan government had any part in
Colombia's internal crisis.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the ongoing peace talks in Venezuela between Colombia
's civil society representatives and the National Liberation Army
(ELN), he stressed that his country had been requested to be the
host and that it has the permission of the Colombian government,
as was the case for similar meetings held in Venezuela before.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Vows to Strengthen Global Financial Architecture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Major industrial nations
vowed here Saturday to build a stronger global financial system,
based on more robust national policies to avoid crisis, as well as
a better international capacity to respond when crisis occurs.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialized countries met and reviewed the progress
towards strengthening the international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 ministers have launched a new G-20 mechanism for dialog
among key industrial and emerging market economies, with the first
meeting expected in December.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, they
"shared a collective sense of impatience" to do all they can in
the coming year to implement further concrete steps in this regard.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to reduce national vulnerability to crisis with
better management of their external balance sheets to avoid a
buildup of unstable debt, and with efforts to promote sustainable
exchange rate regimes in emerging market economies.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided to press further with coordination
between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
in the crucial areas relating to financial stability and
successful development, with shared work and emphasis on
strengthening the critical infrastructure for countries' financial
systems, ranging from banking supervision, corporate governance,
and bankruptcy regimes to the social agenda.
</P>
<P>
On the crucial issue of crisis resolution, the ministers
reaffirmed the framework of principles and tools that they
endorsed in their Report to Heads in June, noting the need to
maintain flexibility to address diverse cases effectively.
</P>
<P>
"We stressed the importance of supporting a stable flow of
capital to emerging markets, that reflected market judgments of
countries' economic and financial prospects," Summers said at a
press conference after the G-7 meeting.

<HEADLINE> Time Limit to be Set for Re-employment Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Re-employment services
centers (RSCs) set up to help China's laid-off workers from State-
owned enterprises (SOEs) are likely to consigned to history by
2003, today's China Daily (Business Weekly) reported.
</P>
<P>
An improved social insurance network, including unemployment
insurance, old-age pensions and medicare insurance, will take over
the RSC's responsibilities and be used to protect the unemployment,
Beijing Mayor Liu Qi said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is one of the first cities to try out the practice.
</P>
<P>
For decades, China pursued full employment at expense of
economic efficiency. With workers unused to the sudden SOE reforms
in mid-1990s, RSCs were established to come to help those layoffs.
</P>
<P>
RSCs take in laid-off workers from SOEs and offer to help them
find new jobs. The centers also give financial subsidies above the
normal level of unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the subsidies is shared equally by the SOEs that
have laid off the workers, the local government and the RSCs.

RIO DE JANEIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A lack of funds has

Championships in Birmingham, England, the Brazilian Judo
Confederation (CBJ) said here on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar FM on Globalization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has warned that the
process of globalization, which can facilitate economic
development and enhance the living standards of people, can also
make smaller and less developed states vulnerable to undesirable
negative effects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 54th session of the U.N.
General Assembly in New York Friday, Myanmar Foreign Minister U
Win Aung pointed out that one such problem, caused by the process
of globalization, is transnational crime which includes illicit
trafficking of narcotic drugs, money laundering, trafficking in
persons, arms smuggling, piracy and terrorism, official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that these crimes pose serious threats to the
peace and stability of mankind at both national and regional
levels.
</P>
<P>
He called for national, regional and global response to deal
with the nature of the problem.
</P>
<P>
He cited Myanmar's hosting of the Second Ministerial Meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on transnational crime
in June this year as a bid to strengthen cooperation in the
regional grouping to cope with the problem.
</P>
<P>
The successful hosting of the meeting constituted a significant
step in advancing the regional cooperation in combating the menace
in Southeast Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Myanmar has adopted a master plan to totally
eradicate poppy cultivation in the country within 15 years, saying
the Mongla region in Shan state has been declared an "opium-free
zone" with law enforcement stepped up in the border areas,
resulting in increased seizure of narcotic drugs.

<HEADLINE> China's First Asset Management Co. Outlines Debt Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China first asset management
corporation, Cinda, has said it will go beyond debt-equity swaps
to help pull State-owned enterprises (SOEs) out of their
difficulties, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The State has pinned high hopes on debt-equity swaps to rescue
troubled SOEs. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which concluded
on Wednesday, reiterated the utmost importance of meeting a three-
year (1998-2000) turn-around target for these firms.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaozhou is executive director of the investment banking
department of Cinda, China's first professional handler of non-
performing loans. He pledged that the company would focus on
follow-up measures to help restructure and streamline SOEs in
which it will hold shares.
</P>
<P>
The crux of the operation is to initiate restructuring and
streamlining drives within the enterprises, Chen said, adding that
this could be facilitated by the alleviation of their financial
burden by debt-equity swaps.
</P>
<P>
The operations of new companies will strictly follow the
guidelines worked out by its board of directors. Creditors' rights,
which used to be vague in SOEs, will be clarified to ensure the
firm's healthy development, Chen added.

<P>
BRASILIA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Airport
Infrastructure Company (Infraero) is planning to invest 26.3
million U.S. dollars in expanding the country's Alcantara
Launching Center (CLA).
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to transform the center into a pole of attraction

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Active Participation in Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China urged developing
countries to take a more active stance toward participating in
globalization to achieve and maintain a steady development as the
Group of 24 developing countries held a ministerial meeting here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Chinese Vice Minister of Finance Jin
Liqun said that globalization, for the benefit of all members of
the international community, must rule out the zero-sum game under
the law of the jungle and embrace a mechanism for a win-win
solution on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said that in reforming the international financial structure,
full participation by developing countries is required, and their
views should be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the international financial architecture to be
worked out must be multi-dimensional. It should not just cover
international standards and codes of conduct in macro policy and
structural reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the reforms is to solve the substantive issues of
the international financial structure, such as on international
monetary system and management of international capital flow, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should have their opportunities to
participate fully in the discussions for this purpose, he noted.
</P>
<P>
G-24 was formed at the 1972 Lima meeting of the Group of 77 to
represent the interests of the developing countries in
negotiations on international monetary matters.
</P>
<P>
On trade liberalization, Jin said, "We have to concern
ourselves with the fair share of benefits to the developing
countries and the balance of their rights against obligations in
the international trade system and the opportunities expected of
trade liberalization."
</P>
<P>
Jin urged the international community to push the
implementation of the agreements concluded in Uruguay Round in a "
concrete effective and balanced way," particularly those areas
related to the interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming new round of multilateral trade negotiations
should take into full account developing countries' concerns and
needs, and work towards a more open and fair multilateral trade
system, thereby contributing to the balanced development of the
world economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jin called on developed countries and multilateral development
institutions to continue to support economic growth in under-
developed countries by providing resource transfers.

<P>
BUDAPEST, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Football
Federation Saturday elected a new president, ending nine months of
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
45-year-old Imre Bozoky, a rural lawyer and linesman, emerged

Bozoky, the preferred candidate of the Ministry of Sports and
Youth Affairs, later pledged to help overcome what he described as
the moral crisis in Hungarian soccer.

and in mid-March forced the Hungarian sports minister, Tamas
Deutsch, to reinstate Kovacs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Interview: Tibetans Marching on Socialist Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- New comers to Tibet often find
that the exotic land far exceeds their expectations, and those who
make return visits continue to marvel at the stunning changes,
Tibet's top government official said in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Legqog, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's
Government, comes from a long line of ethnic Tibetans. He swells
with pride when he talks about the progress Tibet has made since
1951 when it was peacefully liberated, especially since 1959 when
Tibet launched its democratic reform which helped the people out
of serfdom and into socialism.
</P>
<P>
"Since the democratic reform, Tibetans have become masters of
their own destiny," he said, adding that "Currently, they are
marching towards a well-off life, and a united, prosperous and
civilized socialist, new Tibet has emerged."
</P>
<P>
Legqog called the great changes that have occurred in Tibet,
which covers 1.2 million square kilometers, a "miracle in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, Tibet has achieved a sustainable, fast
and healthy development. In 1998, its gross domestic product
reached 9.12 billion yuan, 48.1 times the 1959 figure. Since 1994,
Tibet has been developing at double-digit rate annually, faster
than the national average.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the average annual per-capita income in Tibet
surpassed 5,400 yuan for urbanites and 1,158 yuan for rural
residents, 5.31 times and 7.7 times of the 1959 figures,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
To date, the number of poor Tibetans has been decreased to 110,
000, as 90 percent of the Tibetan people have adequate food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Legqog attributed the enormous changes to the support of the
central government and the aid of Chinese people in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1959, the central government has allocated over 40
billion yuan for building infrastructure in Tibet, while other
parts of the country have also helped this ethnic autonomous
region build 105 key projects, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
During his interview with Xinhua, Legqog reiterated that the
fast economic progress in Tibet has consistently improved the
living standards of the Tibetan people and enabled them to enjoy
their full rights of existence and development.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, since Tibet was made an autonomous
region, it has established the regional law-making body, the
people's congress, and deputies to people's congresses at all

comprehensive rights in political, economic, cultural and

<HEADLINE> Myanmar FM on U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar said it is encouraged
to see that the U.N. General Assembly has adopted a resolution on
the requirement of a two-thirds majority in taking decisions and
resolutions on the question of reform of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in the general debate of the 54th session of the
U.N. General Assembly in New York Friday, Myanmar Foreign Minister
U Win Aung said that as a member of the Non-Alignment Movement,
Myanmar's preference for the enlargement of the Security Council
is up to 26, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar favors the expansion of the council membership in both
categories, permanent and non-permanent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to overcome the current impasse on the question of
permanent seats in the Security Council, a compromise formula,
acceptable to all parties, should be worked out through enhanced
consultations and discussions among the member states," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is of the view that in the event of other options
having failed to command enough support, the idea of rotating
permanent seats should also be considered as one of the options in
the permanent membership category, he added.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, Leftist Guerrilla to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) have agreed to resume peace talks within 10 days, said
reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after two days of talks between the
FARC and senior government delegate Victor G. Ricardo, said
guerrilla spokesman Luis Eduardo Devia in San Vicente del Caguan
in the demilitarized areas.
</P>
<P>
The talks will reopen without the participation of an
international verification commission, as the FARC opposes foreign
presence, Devia told Radio Caracol network.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the government and the FARC, the biggest
guerrilla group in Colombia, started in January and halted in mid-
July because of the latter's objection to the international
verification commission.
</P>
<P>
According to Devia, FARC representatives and Ricardo will meet
again within the next few days to fix the schedule for the
upcoming talks, which, he disclosed, will be held in La Uribe, one
of the five demilitarized zones created by the Colombian
government last November in order to facilitate peace talks with
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's demilitarized areas total 42,000 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Hails China's Achievements in Past 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung conveyed his hearty congratulations on the 50th anniversary
of the People's Republic of China and highly praised China's great
achievements in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Kim said that during these years,
China has made "very impressive" development. Especially in the 20
years or so of reform and opening-up, China's economy has
witnessed "a surprisingly high growth of 9.8 percent per year."
Internationally, it has also "ensured the position as a great
nation in politics and economy."
</P>
<P>
Recalling his four visits to China, Kim said he has noticed the
resolution of the Chinese leaders and people in carrying forward
the reform and opening-up policy and is sure that China will make
greater progress in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He extended his hearty respects to Chinese leaders Deng
Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin who have led the nation to prosperity and
to the Chinese people who have made great efforts under their
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's role in Asia and the world, Kim Dae-jung
noted that China is "one of the most influential countries" not
only in Northeast Asia and Asia, but also in the world by making
significant contributions to peace, security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In Northeast Asia, he said, China has played an active part in
the four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula issue, whose purpose
is to secure peace. In Asia, China has played an active role in
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and the ASEAN Regional
Forum, and has contributed to regional peace and prosperity
through regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung said the reason why China is so important in the
international society lies in "the success of its reform and
opening-up policy and the independent foreign policy of peace it
has been pursuing in the last 20 years." He said he was sure that
China will make greater progress and contribution to regional and
global peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said that "China has a very bright future" and "will make
greater achievements" because the country has "the eminent
leadership of Jiang Zemin and his colleagues, the excellence of
the Chinese people and the infinite potentiality of its national
economy."
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung said that South Korea "cares for and anticipates"
the improvement of its relationship with China, as it is "not only
vital for their common prosperity, but also for peace and security
in East Asia." He said he was "very satisfied" that bilateral
relationship has moved forward significantly since his visit to
China last November to sign the agreement with President Jiang
Zemin on the establishment of a "cooperative partnership" oriented
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is "the most indispensable, the most
important and the most valuable neighbor" of South Korea and that
it is "absolutely essential" that the close cooperation between
South Korea and China continues to contribute to peace in the
Korean Peninsula and East Asia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefiting From Urbanization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- It used to be only a dream
for farmers in some parts of China of living as good a life as
urbanites did, enjoying modern-day life in an apartment with
electric house appliances.
</P>
<P>
But now the dream has come true for Wu Renbao, 72, in the
village of Huaxi in Jiangsu Province, east China, where he is the
Village Communist Party Committee secretary, after nearly 30 years
of struggle, strife, and untold suffering. In his younger years he
was a herdsman, but 1949, the year when New China was born, made
it possible for him to change his life and even help poverty-
stricken farmers in Huaxi.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, as a Party member, he planned to mobilize his fellow
villagers to bring a new look to Huaxi and worked with them to get
out of poverty and build tile-roofed brick houses and irrigation
ditches, develop farmland, and apply scientific farming methods.
</P>
<P>
Wu led the village in diversifying production into sideline and
industrial sectors, setting up more than 40 enterprises in the
village, with 95 percent of the labor force in the industrial and
service sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Huaxi ranked first in the province's villages, with
its 100 million yuan worth of industrial and agricultural output.

<P>
Wu also gave much thought to the needs of the younger
generation and proposed building a park in the village in the
early 1980s, which, he thinks, is a good place for youngsters to
make friends.
</P>
<P>
Even more surprising, he had a roofed corridor built in the
village, running 10 kilometers from north to south to link the
village's houses, market, shop, hotel, park, and factories.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, he rented a plane for the more than 30 of the elderly
villagers up for a look at the development around Huaxi. They were
overwhelmed by the results and excited about their village. Aiming
even higher, Wu made it possible for Huaxi villagers to purchase
50 Volkswagens and Jettas in 1993, giving the farmers their own
cars for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Wu has reached most of his goals, but the old man is still
thinking about other things like the environment and education and
what else he can do for the village next century. Huaxi has become
known as the No. 1 village in China.
</P>
<P>
There are more cars here for every 100 people than that in
Singapore, so, in some people's eyes, Huaxi has created an
economic miracle similar to that of Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Map Of Beijing Now Having To Be Updated Frequently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Map of Beijing now has to be
updated once every month or even every week because of fast
changes now taking place here in the Chinese capital, according to
Li Zongshun, who has been working on cartography for more than
three decades.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Beijing say that they hardly recognize their
city any more even though they've lived here for years. Li said
that they used to only print city maps once a year, 500,000 at a
time, but now they only print 50,000 to 100,000 each time because
of the rapid urban growth.
</P>
<P>
A detailed map of Beijing that was printed in 1950 is the
oldest map at the China Map Publishing House. It has no price or
traffic lanes printed on it. The capital at that time was divided
into two parts -- an interior and an exterior.
</P>
<P>
Now, anyone can get a city map anywhere for just 3 yuan (about
0.36 U.S. cents). It shows four ring roads circling the city and
the urban area has grown from 62 sq. km.to over 400 sq. km.
</P>
<P>
The publishing house spent about 31 million yuan (about 3.72
million U.S. dollars) improving production by buying computers in
1994 to keep up with changes in the city.
</P>
<P>
October 1, this year, is the 50th anniversary of the founding
of New China and 67 key projects are being finished for the
occasion, so the publishing house is preparing the most recent map.
</P>
<P>
It's less than one week since the last map was printed,
according to Wang Jixian, head of the publishing house.

Sports Centre on Saturday losing 6-3, 2-6, 6-4, 2-6 and 4-6 in
doubles match against Chile.

Wayne upset former world number one and Chilean number one Marcel
Rios in the single matches after his brother Byron had dismissed
Mass in the first game of the singles matches.

QUITO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Jamil
Mahuad Saturday asked the international financing organizations to
reduce the burden of the Ecuadoran foreign debt because of the
economic incapacity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador cannot pay the present debt of 16 billion U.S. dollars,
said Mahuad in his Saturday speech broadcast to all the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran debt is in proportion the highest of Latin
America, and the government searches for a reduction of the debt
burden in the budget, the economy and the exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have (in Ecuador) a very special situation, that must be
considered here and abroad," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that an Ecuadoran mission headed by Central Bank
President Pablo Better traveled some days ago to Washington to
meet with International Monetary Fund, World Bank and U.S.
Treasury officials.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran government wants to renegotiate in the next days
96 million dollars in interests due next Tuesday for its Brady
bonds debt of almost 6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The president said that if the Ecuadoran foreign debt keeps at
the present levels, "it does not have an exit in the future."
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is facing its worst economic slum. The South American
country is technically in default of it 5.9 billion dollars in
Brandy bonds. Its total debt burden of 16 billion dollars is
representing 110 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
