PARIS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- France's rightwing opposition
Liberal Democratic Party (DL), which is a splinter party of the
Union for French Democracy (UDF), Friday allied with the far-right
National Front (FN) in electing presidents of three regional
councils.
</P>
<P>
UDF-DL deputies were elected presidents of regional councils of
Languedoc-Roussillon bordering the Mediterranean, the important
industrial region of Rhone-Alpes and the big central region of
Centre with the support of FN.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UDF deputies, including former President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, were elected president of regional councils in
five other regions, while the Gaullist Rally for the Republic
(RPR) won two regions.
</P>
<P>
UDF and RPR deputies also failed to show up in the voting in
the Paris region, or Ile-de-France, and two other regions,
delaying the election of presidents of regional parliaments in
these regions.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist-led leftwing coalition has won only three
regional presidencies so far, and is expected to win in the
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur and at least another region.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe: Traitors Must Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday said there is an open rebellion against his ruling
ZANU (PF) by some top party leaders including mps and Speaker
Cyril Ndebele, the Zimbabwe National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address at the start of the 33rd session of the
party's central committee, Mugabe said these ''evil schemers,
conspirators, political saboteurs'' and their ''misguided''
ambitions were responsible for the present situation of confusion
and anxiety in ZANU (PF) and have to be ''dealt with once and for
all.''
</P>
<P>
''Let us begin to fish them out and expose them for what they
are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said there were some mps in the 150-strong ZANU
(PF)-dominated legislative assembly who had virtually become
independent members, believing they had unrestricted freedom to
adopt and propound any ideas of their choice, even if these went
against their party.
</P>
<P>
''It is indeed a case of arrogant defiance of the party and
its leadership. It is a rebellion itself which such members are
engaged in,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
''Alas, we notice also an even more strange phenomenon. The
speaker, the honorable speaker, has decided to join in the
rebellion against the party as he and those in collusion with him
seek to stultify it in its political and administrative role to
discipline its own members. What rank madness has gripped some of
us, i ask?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Departing briefly from his prepared speech, he said an
hour-long impromptu meeting of highest decision-maing body of the
party, the politburo, had already taken a decision on the fate of
the speaker and others deemed to have become rebels.
</P>
<P>
A disciplinary committee of ZANU (PF) this week summoned
Masvingo central mp Dzikamayi Mavhaire to explain statements he
made in parliament when he recently introduced a motion on
constitutional reform in which he was quoted as saying that
Mugabe ''must go''.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe stressed that mps at all times had the duty and
obligation to admit and recognize that their membership of
parliament arose from their sponsorship by ZANU (PF) and,
therefore, they must remain accountable to it for their
performance in parliament, as they must also remain accountable,
but in a secondary manner, to the constituency they represented.
</P>
<P>
''Several of our members are no longer paying any heed to the
views or position of the party and government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said ordinary members of the party who were solidly
behind the party and its leadership were pleading for remedial
action that would ensure its unity and viability and the success
of the party and government programs.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Selects New Executive for China Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Boeing has selected a
41-year-old executive to lead its all-important China operations.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Bracy will assume the presidency of Boeing China
Inc. next month. A former U.S. Navy pilot and Harvard MBA, Bracy
has been with Boeing's Commercial Airplane Group since 1989 and is
one of the youngest executives ever chosen by Boeing for such a
high-level post.
</P>
<P>
He is replacing Michael Zimmerman, who held the post for four
years and is retiring.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is forecasting a market for approximately 1,900
commercial jet aircraft sales in China worth 124 billion
U.S. dollars over the next 20 years, making China the largest
forecasted aviation market outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bracy met many of China's airline officials in his former job
as director of business management and deputy vice president for
Boeing's Asia-Pacific region. He told the Seattle Times that his
role will involve more diplomatic aspects than day-to-day
operations.
</P>
<P>
He said his goal will be to build and maintain Boeing's
reputation as a quality supplier with outstanding service.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make sure we preserve our market share," he
said, acknowledging that Airbus Industrie will continue to compete
with Boeing for China orders.
</P>
<P>
Boeing now works with 20 of the 34 jet-operating airlines in
China. Through December 31, 1997, 288 of 400 jetliners operating
in China were made by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing market share in China is 72 percent, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Bracy will direct an office staff of 47 and about
150 Boeing employees overall who work in 21 cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Bracy is different from a lot of Boeing executives who are
specialists in a single field. He is not just a salesman or an
engineer. He is knowledgeable about the inner workings of the
aviation business, manufacturing airplanes and flying them.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said these qualities helped him won the appointment
amid fierce inside competition.
</P>
<P>
Bracy believes that his calm approach is one of the main
reasons why he was chosen for the job.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses Foreign Missions of Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has again accused
diplomatic missions of financing pro-democracy and dissident
activities in the country, following alleged foreign support for
last year's foiled coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi Thursday alleged that the recent
upsurge in "dissident activities" particularly in Lagos by some
pro-democracy activists have the financial and other support of
some diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that the minister was referring to the
five-million-man rally in Lagos early this week to oppose the
presidential candidacy of the head of state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The rally was dispersed by armed police before it really
started, while another two-million-man pro-Abacha rally held in
the capital of Abuja boasted a success under heavy security
protection.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, the matter "is being investigated just as
the case of those missions which gave support to the coup
plotters in December 1997."
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said that the 3.4 million U.S. Dollars European
Parliament approved two weeks ago to support non-government
organizations for poverty alleviation in Nigeria was meant to
finance anti-government activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to assure the European Union that the latest attempt
like others they embarked upon in the past to fund clandestine
political organizations and dissidents will also fail," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
In a veiled attempt to link pro-democracy activities and the
presence of the foreign missions in Lagos, Ikimi gave the
missions an ultimatum to relocate to the capital Abuja before the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so, the government "will stop further
transactions with missions in Lagos by that date," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the Nigerian government moved to Abuja eight years ago,
it has kept asking foreign missions to move. However, only nine
foreign missions have done so, with most of them still in Lagos,
the former capital.
</P>
<P>
According to observers, Ikimi's accusation followed statements
by the United States which said the U.S. government will not
accept Abacha as the country's next civilian president, scheduled
to inaugurate on October 1 this year at the end of the three-year
transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright also said Thursday that her government was expecting "a
real transition, not phony or cosmetic one" in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> 42 Bodies Recovered from Crash Site of Afghan Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers have recovered
42 bodies from the crash site of an Afghan airliner which crashed
Thursday near the Afghan capital of Kabul, said reports reaching
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
All 45, including 13 crew and 32 passengers, on board the
Boeing 727 operated by Afghanistan's Ariana airline were killed
when the jet crashed into a mountain in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers found the wreckage of the plane about 100 meters
below the summit of Sharki Baratayi, about 15 kilometers south of
Kabul, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, the rescuers have not found the black box of the
aircraft because their efforts were hampered by mines left over
from the war that followed the soviet invasion of Afghanistan in
1979.
</P>
<P>
An Ariana official at the site said the plane, which was on its
way from the Afghan southwestern city of Kandahar to Kabul,
crashed at 2:00 p.m. (1030 GMT) Thursday as it hit a bank of
cloud, rain and sleet near the capital, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Ariana, operating regular services only to some Gulf cities,
was hit recently by a series of serious accidents. In January, an
Antonov 32 plane on a domestic route crashed in bad weather on
Pakistani soil, killing all 80 on board.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Tupolev jet crashed on a training flight in the
Afghanistan's eastern city of Jalalabad, killing five crew
members.

<HEADLINE> German Activists Protest Nuclear Waste Shipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- About 2,500 Germany anti-nuclear
activists gathered in Ahaus Friday to protest against a nuclear
waste shipment.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 protesters defying a police ban on demonstrations had
been detained, according to German media report.
</P>
<P>
The controversial shipment of six containers of nuclear waste
was due to a storage depot in Ahaus near the Dutch border.
</P>
<P>
Police said so far demonstrations had been peaceful and there
had been no violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
But shortly after leaving a depot in Baden-wuerttemberg, the
train hauling the nuclear waste was delayed when three
anti-nuclear activists chained themselves to the tracks.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand policemen were involved in the security
operation to protect the latest nuclear waste transport which
started on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A German policeman was struck by a train and died of head
injuries Friday morning hours before the special train carrying
nuclear waste from two southern German nuclear power plants was
due to pass a site near Wuersburg.
</P>
<P>
Another policeman was also injured Friday morning after being
struck by a car that refused to stop for a security control post
near Ahaus.
</P>
<P>
A similar transport carrying six nuclear waste containers last
year required 30,000 police to provide protection and cost the
government nearly 61 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear activists have called on the government to close
all nuclear power plants in the country.

LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- British bomb disposal experts
Friday carried out a controlled explosion in a holdall left at a
Londonderry bank and confirmed it contained a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Two masked men had left the bag in the bank at Shipquay Place
and had told employees it held a bomb, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police also received a 20-minute warning about the device from
a caller who said he was from the Continuity IRA, a dissident
republican group opposed to peace talks on Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Workers were evacuated from offices and shops in the city
center while the security operation was carried out.
</P>

The move was apparently trying to undermine peace efforts
involving most of the province's parties in round table talks

<HEADLINE> Britain to Draw Private Cash to Modernize Tube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced a
plan Friday to draw private investment into the infrastructure of
London's Underground network.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told the House of Commons
that private firms were to be given a role in running London's
Tube, although this was not privatization of the system and its
assets would remain in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
"It is not privatization, nor nationalization, but a radical
new `third way' to generate investment while retaining a
publicly-owned, publicly accountable network," Prescott said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The freehold ownership of assets will remain in the
public sector. The private sector contractor or contractors will
be free to borrow sums outside the constraints of the public
sector pay round."
</P>
<P>
He also announced 365 million pounds (584 million U.S. dollars)
of investment over the next two years so that the tube would be
"returned to the people."
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, contractors will be responsible for
refurbishing stations, replacing tracks, upgrading signaling and
refurbishing or replacing trains, as well as regular maintenance.
</P>
<P>
But the London Underground company will still be responsible
for operating services, including ticketing, fares, service levels
and the operation of the signalling system and safety.

<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus' trade gap widened further in 1997, as
imports increased by more than 2 percent while exports continued
to decline.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Statistics Department released Friday said
total imports last year rose to 1,898 million Cyprus pounds
(about 3,796 million U.S. dollars), up 2.2 percent over 1996 of
1,858 million pounds (about 3,716 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total exports amounted to 639 million pounds (about 1,278
million dollars), showing a decline of 1.5 percent over the 1996
figure of 649 million pounds (about 1,298 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decline was mainly due to a 4.1 percent fall in domestic
exports, which amounted to 213 million pounds (about 426 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade deficit for the year widened to
1,259 million pounds (about 2,518 million dollars) compared to
1,208 million pounds (about 2,416 million dollars) in 1996.

OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian retail sales declined 1.9
percent to 19.8 billion dollars (13.9 billion U.S. dollars) in
January, Statistics Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The January ice storm in parts of Quebec, Ontario and New
Brunswick provinces and the resulting power outages resulted in a
disruption of sales in some sectors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, motor and recreational vehicle sales posted a
large decrease after a significant increase in December, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, the level of retail sales in January was
5.1 percent higher than the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Canada's retail sales have generally been rising since the
start of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the rate of increase has been slowing in recent months,
after a period of strong advances from the fall of 1996 to the
fall of 1997.

National News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Messages on the placards denounced Secretary-General of the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions Morgan Tsvangirayi, praised
Mugabe's hard-line stance on the land reform issue and proclaimed
support for his continued leadership.
</P>
<P>
The labor movement has become the biggest challenge to the
government, having successfully organized two nationwide strikes
to protest a sharply-rising cost of living and unpopular
government taxes.
</P>
<P>
Some placards also denounced the party's Masvingo provincial
Chairman Dzikamayi Mavhaire, currently facing disciplinary
inquiry into utterances he made in parliament in which he was
quoted as calling on Mugabe to step down.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the demonstrators, Mugabe shied from naming
Mavhaire as a divisive element within the party, but only
mentioned the deep divisions in the party's Masvingo, Manicaland
and Mashonaland West provinces.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 provinces in Zimbabwe now.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "they are saying that the next congress is too
far away and they want to grab power without going through
congress."
</P>
<P>
He said the party should learn to resolve its contradictions
through debate, but acknowledged that there would always be
people within the party who are opposed to his leadership.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Leaders Keep Up Pressure on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Political directors from the
United States, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and Russia Friday
met here to keep up the pressure on both Serbia and ethnic
Albanian leaders in Kosovo to open talks aimed at ending recent
violence in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group met in Brussels to discuss whether
Yugoslavia had done enough to avoid the threat of international
sanctions in retaliation for its repression in the province.
</P>
<P>
British political director Jeremy Greenstock, who chaired the
meeting Friday, told reporters that there was slight progress from
both sides on the Kosovo dispute but it was still far from meeting
"all the (group's) requirements."
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the Contact Group are scheduled to meet in Bonn
next Wednesday. Greenstock said it would continue to put pressure
on both sides to move towards a dialogue without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see no violence in Kosovo; we want to see correct
standards of policing; we want to see both sides moving towards
dialogue; and we want to see access for all international
organizations, non-governmental organizations, the Red Cross,
diplomats, as well as journalists," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 10-day deadline, which expired Thursday, had been set earlier
this month for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw
his special police and start talking to the ethnic Albanians who
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
</P>
<P>
Serb special police units have been involved in a bloody
crackdown in Kosovo this month in which at least 80 people have
been killed.
</P>
<P>
There have been recently signs of disagreement on the need for
sanctions between members of the Contact Group, but no one leaving
the meeting would comment on this.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats have said Milosevic is trying to drive a
wedge between Russia and its five Western Contact Group partners
in a bid to avert tougher international action.
</P>
<P>
The Albanians, demanding international mediation and
independence, or at least autonomy within Yugoslavia, have
boycotted Serbian government negotiators in Kosovo for almost a
week, though Kosovo's Albanian leaders admitted Friday that this
tactic was losing international credibility.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people Friday staged a protest outside the British
mission building in Brussels where the political leaders met.
</P>
<P>
They held banners which read "stop the ethnic cleansing," "stop
the genocide" and Kosovo's "divorce from the devil."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Welcomes EU Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has welcomed
the latest tariff concessions by the European Union (EU) in their
trade negotiations for a free trade agreement, local media
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU recently offered to include 510 more South African
exports in its tariff-free list, including about 30 industrial
products and 480 farm goods from ferro-alloys, wines to dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
But South Africa was disappointed that the new concessions did
not affect any of the "sensitive" products, mainly agricultural
goods, said South Africa's chief trade negotiator with the EU,
Elias Links Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would make no more concessions until Europe
changed its original mandate which excluded about 45 percent of
South Africa's farm products, the mainstay of its exports to
Europe, from a proposed free trade area, Links said.
</P>
<P>
At a conference at the South African Institute of
International Affairs Thursday, Links said the new offer would
help to push the EU's list of tariff-free products to just over
94 percent of South African imports from its January offer of 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the signs of flexibility had lent hope that a
free-trade area agreement could be nailed down by the target date
of the middle of this year. The two sides had been engaged in
talks for more than 31 months.
</P>
<P>
Links, the ambassador to the EU, criticized the EU for
reducing tariffs at a slower pace than South Africa. He said it
contradicted a previous agreement in principle that the EU would
lower barriers faster than South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa increased its list of tariff-free products from
about 55 percent to about 81 percent in its last offer late last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The goal is for South Africa to allow tariff-free entry of 85
percent of EU goods and for the EU to allow 95 percent of South
African goods. This would produce an average of 90 percent, which
would meet the free trade criteria of the World Trade
Organization, Links said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Passes FY '98 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives (lower
house) approved the 77.67 trillion yen (about 606.8 billion dollars)
national budget for fiscal 1998 Friday.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the year starting April 1 was passed at a lower
house plenary session with the backing of members of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its two noncabinet allies -- the
Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The budget was immediately sent to the House of Councillors (upper
house) which is expected to start deliberations on it next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Even if the upper house fails to agree on the budget, it will be
automatically enacted April 19.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Constitution stipulates that if the upper house fails to
take final action within 30 days after the budget's passage through
the lower house, the lower house's decision will be the parliamentary
decision.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1998 budget is the first compiled under restraints of
the fiscal rehabilitation law and is only 0.4 percent larger than the
initial fiscal 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders welcomed the lower house's nod to the budget and
urged that it pass through the Diet (parliament) as early as
possible.

<HEADLINE> French Top Ballet Troupe to Be on First Tour in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- France's top ballet troupe, Ballet
de l'Opera de Paris, will be on its first tour to China from April
11 to 13, said Brigitte Lefevre, director of dance of the Opera de
Paris, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five dancers of the ballet troupe, including seven
stars, will perform in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing for
some 33,000 spectators, said Lefevre at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The ballet troupe was invited by the Chinese government when
President Jacques Chirac visited China in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The troupe will present a unique program "witnessing the
diversity of the great Western classic repertoire" with romantic
dances such as "Giselle" of Coralli and Perrot which was created
by the troupe in 1841, said Lefevre.
</P>
<P>
They will perform extracts from "Raymonda," in the version
adopted by the late Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev after Petipa,
"the Great Classic Step" of Victor Gsovsky and "Brilliant Allegro"
of George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
The stars who will go to China are Laurent Hilaire, Nicolas Le
Riche and Manuel Legris -- all of whom will dance as the prince in
"Giselle," and Kader Belarbi, who will dance "Brilliant Allegro,"
Isabelle Guerin, Elisabeth Platel, and Elisabeth Maurin.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges between Ballet de l'Operat de Paris and China
dated back to 1980, when its former star Lycette Darsonval visited
the Beijing Central Ballet, and some of its dancers visited
Shanghai in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The Ballets de l'Operat de Lyon and the Ballet de l'Opera du
Rhin of France have already visited China at the invitation of the
Chinese government.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada will host a two-day
workshop here next week to coordinate support for the mine action
agenda resulting from last December's conference.
</P>
<P>
During that conference, 122 countries signed a treaty, pledging
to eliminate anti-personal landmines.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have a treaty, the anti-personal mine campaign
focus shifts to the immediate priorities of maintaining the
political will to implement the convention and coordinate mine
action activities," said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
In the workshop, senior experts from donor and mine-affected
countries, multilateral agencies and non-government organizations
are expected to discuss ways to promote partnerships that will
eliminate duplication of activities.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to ensure the most effective use of the financial
resources pledged by donor countries during last December's Ottawa
conference, the government said in a news release Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the conference, two more countries have signed the
treaty. So far, six countries, including Canada, have ratified the
document, the release said.

<HEADLINE> UK Rural Dwellers Enjoy Better Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- People living in the countryside
in Britain enjoy better life than those city dwellers, having
better jobs and health, bigger houses and more cars, according to
an official study Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said in its quarterly
journal Population Trends that rural lifestyles retain advantages
over urban living in many ways.
</P>
<P>
It said that Britain's rural population remained stable at 10
percent of the whole population between the censuses of 1981 and
1991.
</P>
<P>
Country people are strikingly healthier, with only 10.1 percent
of people in English rural areas reporting a long-term illness,
compared with 12.2 percent of those in towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 40 percent of those rural households have
two or more cars, nearly twice the proportion in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Those rural homes which are detached houses amount to 50
percent, compared with just 16.7 percent in urban areas, and rural
homes have an average of 5.9 rooms against 5.0 in urban homes.
</P>
<P>
The study added that one in three households in English rural
areas is headed by someone with a professional or managerial job,
compared with fewer than one in four of their urban counterparts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Hopes Resolution 425 to Be Implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday expressed the hope that the
U.N. resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the expression at a joint news conference with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz after they held talks on
regional issues, especially the issue of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that attention should be also given to the interests
of the two parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that many things in the world have happened
since the U.N. adopted the resolution, stressing that these
changes should be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Annan also called on the parties concerned to take necessary
steps to implement the resolution 425 which was adopted in 1978
after Israeli first invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was not a mediator in the Middle East peace
process, adding that only the United States carried out the
mediation mission among the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Boueiz said that his talks with Annan also touched
on the Lebanese detainees held in Israeli prisons and Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his refusal to let the 360,000 Palestinian
refugees living in Lebanon to settle in his country. The refugees
are also not allowed to work in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here from Egypt Friday on the third leg of his
first Middle East tour since he took office in January 1997. The
trip has taken him to Jordan and will also take him to Syria,
Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Lebanon, Annan will also meet with
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and House Speaker Nabih Berri
on Friday and President Elias Hrawi on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Beirut International Airport, he was
greeted by Lebanese officials as well as a crowd of Lebanese
whose sons or husbands are being detained in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
They handed Annan a letter welcoming him to visit Lebanon
and calling on him to impose pressure on Israel to release their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Annan promised to press Israel to permit the International Red
Cross staff to enter Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Some 210 Lebanese are being held in Israeli prisons inside
Israeli territory and in south Lebanon reportedly because of their
 refusal to collaborate with Israeli occupying forces or having
connections with Hezbollah (Party of God), the country's leading
military group against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel is still occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer area in
south Lebanon since it declared the area as a buffer zone in
1985 to protect its northern villages and towns from Hezbollah
cross-border attack.

HANOI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Two-way trade between Vietnam and
the U.S. will surely be increased following the waver of the
Jackson-Vanik amendment for Vietnam, Vietnam News Agency quoted
Vietnamese Trade Minister Truong Dinh Tuyen as reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam-U.S. two-way trade saw constant increases since the
two countries normalized their relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is one of seven countries having annual two-way trade
turnover with Vietnam from 1 billion U.S. dollars. Vietnam's
annual exports to the U.S. were valued at 400 million U.S. dollars
worth of coffee, rubber, marine products, garments and textile,
fruit and vegetables, and coal.
</P>
<P>
In return, it imported auto accessories, completely-assembled
vehicles, fertilizers, and steel from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister Tuyen, the fifth round of talk on a trade
agreement between Vietnam and the United States will be held in
April so that the agreement may be signed late this year.

<P>
ATHENS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Cyprus Friday agreed to
further strengthen their cooperation on matters of armaments,
military exercises and training in order to safeguard the island
republic's security after the talks between the defense ministers
of the two countries took place here.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to meet regularly in order to take any
additional measures required to attain the common objectives.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their lengthy talks, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said that they would do everything possible to
ensure "the greatest possible sense of security" on Cyprus within
the framework of the joint strategy of Greece and Hellenism.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Cyprus Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou, who
arrived here Thursday for a two-day official visit, said that the
two countries would help each other to make sure the vital
interests of Hellenism for peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers shared the view that Cyprus' entry into the
European Union (EU) would enhance the island's position in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Omirou also met with Greek Foreign
Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis, who warned that there would be
difficulties along the process of Cyprus' accession to the EU,
which would require alertness and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus's accession negotiations with the EU will start as
scheduled on March 31, but northern Cyprus and Turkey have
expressed their opposition to such a move by Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Warns against Political Schism in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's State
Expediency Council and former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
Friday warned against political schism in the country, urging
people to respect political etiquette.
</P>
<P>
"Freedoms, debates, arguments, and positive criticisms are good
things, without which a society will not go forward, but those
things must not be allowed to cause schism between our people and
divide them," Rafsanjani said at the Friday prayers congregation
in the shrine of the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the remarks in response to a growing tension
between the left-wing and right-wing political groups. They
accused each other of breaking the country's laws.
</P>
<P>
A physical fighting even happened in the Majlis or parliament
between rival representatives on Wednesday when a right-wing
legislator tried to slap Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri,
who was summoned to the Majlis to explain why the Interior
Ministry issued permit for a mourning ceremony for Mehdi
Bazargan, the late leader of Iran's opposition group the Freedom
Movement of Iran (FMI).
</P>
<P>
The hard-line factions also demanded to impeach Nouri after
the Interior Ministry allowed a student group to hold a rally
against a rule of the country's Constitutional Guardians Council
to reject several candidates for the Majlis by-elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the left-wing groups, which supported President
Mohammad Khatami, defended the Interior Ministry's decisions,
calling for more freedom of expression and gatherings.
</P>
<P>
"I hope in the future every person in this country will
demonstrate some form of political etiquette in dealing with the
various issues of the country," because "we have many enemies
here and there around us and they will try to provoke one group
against another," Rafsanjani said.

<HEADLINE> One-Parent Families Rise in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The total number of one-parent
families in Britain rose by 27 percent from 1.23 million in 1990
to reach 1.56 million in 1995, according to official figures
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A study carried in the quarterly journal, Population Trends, of
the Office for National Statistics said that the 1995 figure is
broadly double the total in the late 1970s and represents more
than one in five families with dependent children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the study said that in the five years between 1990
and 1995, the number of children living in one-parent families
rose by one-third to reach 2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
It said that the average family size of single, lone mothers,
those who had never married or cohabited, had grown most by 30
percent in the 14 years between 1981 and 1995, followed by that of
separated lone mothers, by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the rise in lone parents is partly the
result of career women deciding in their 30s that they want to be
mothers.
</P>
<P>
Another reason lies in changing expectations and values. Women
are now less likely to stay in relationships that are not working.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda's Hutu Armed Insurrection Doomed: Kagame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The armed insurgency that has
been causing insecurity in northwestern Rwanda is in its last
days, the Rwandan News Agency (RNA) quoted Rwandan Vice-President
Major General Paul Kagame as claiming.
</P>
<P>
Kagame was addressing over 3,000 residents of Nyabikenke, who
had gathered to celebrate the reopening of the local health
center Thursday that had just been rehabilitated, a special RNA
report sent to Xinhua here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of insecurity have continually given us a
headache since 1994," Kagame, who les as Defense Minister,
admitted.
</P>
<P>
"But the government, in collaboration with security forces,
and the population have stood up and restored security in most
prefectures of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The health center was destroyed during the 1994 genocide by
the same forces that are creating havoc in northwestern Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the reconstruction work on the center is
estimated at around 750,000 U.S. Dollars, donated by the UNICEF
and the Dutch government.
</P>
<P>
General Kagame encouraged the residents of Ndiza to safeguard
infrastructure like this health center, and to shun for ever
divisive politics.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, RNA said the Rwandan army has killed more
than 280 Hutu insurgents in battles in Gitarama province over the
past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Quoting military sources, it said security had been restored
in almost all the communes attacked by infiltrators and that
operations were continuing to "track down the remnants of these
criminals."

<HEADLINE> China Opposed to Sanctions Against Libya: Qin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China is not in favor of
sanctions against Libya, which have brought untold sufferings to
the Libyan people, Qin Huasun, Chinese ambassador to the United
Nations, stressed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin made the remarks at the meeting of the Security
Council, which held an open debate on the question of Libya.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the sanctions against Libya have brought sufferings
especially to women and children, undermined the development of
Libya, and at the same time affected economic development of third
countries.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China is gravely concerned about the adverse effects
of the sanctions, and facts have shown sanctions, instead of
solving the problem, only aggravate matters.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said China is in favor of lifting the sanctions
as soon as possible, and China supports the request raised by the
Arab League and the Organization of African Unity on numerous
occasions to lift the sanctions against Libya at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the U.N. secretary-general recently sent a
fact-finding mission to Libya to look into the negative impacts of
the sanctions, and the report of the mission is basically an
accurate account of the situation there. China is of the view that
the Security Council and its Sanctions Committee should give it a
serious review and take measures to ease the situation, he said.

ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi Friday expressed international community's eagerness to
help Afghans come out of the crisis as Afghanistan "has endured
unrest for far too long."
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan has endured civil unrest and war for far too long
and the international community is eager to help Afghans come out
of the crisis," Brahimi said in his arrival statement at the
Islamabad Airport Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, an Algerian diplomat, appointed by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to lead efforts for the restoration
of peace in the strife-torn country, is here on a two-week visit.
</P>
<P>
He is accompanied by Mukhtar Lalani, Representative of the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said he looks forward to consultations he will
have with the Afghan parties and leaders of "some neighboring
countries."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will work closely with Pakistan to materialize peace

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China favors a peaceful
solution to the Lockerbie case, including legal procedures, Qin
Huasun, Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, stressed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qin also stressed that China is opposed to terrorism in any
form and is of the view that terrorists should be brought to
justice.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin made the remarks at the the meeting of the
Security Council, which held an open debate on the question of
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China welcomed the Security Council open meeting to
consider the question of Libya, and the Security Council should
listen to the broad range of views of member states while
deliberating the issue.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the tragic accident over Lockerbie resulted
in the death of innocent passengers and inflicted agonizing pains
to their families, and the priority now is to settle the case in a
prompt and proper manner because this will be beneficial to all
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the key to the resolution of the Lockerbie case is for
the parties concerned to agree, at an early date, on the venue and
method of the trial of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
China supports the three options by the Arab League and the
Organization of African Unity concerning questions about the
trial, which China thinks are constructive and have reflected the
flexibility of the parties concerned, Qin noted.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said China hopes that other parties will also
show flexibility by responding to these proposals and move to
solve the Lockerbie issue through negotiations as soon as
possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- More Canadian families went onto
the information highway last year, especially for those with
higher incomes, said reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
The proportion using the Internet from home "almost doubled" to
13 percent of Canadian households between 1996 and 1997, according
to the latest figures from Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
Use of the Internet among families whose incomes were in the
top fifth of all households soared to 26 percent, up from 16.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Though families with incomes in the bottom fifth were slow to
be plugged into the Internet, their use of the technology from
their homes actually increased faster, more than doubling to 5.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The statistics agency also noted that families with children
are more likely to possess a computer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, one half of Canadian families with children under 18
had a computer.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 survey found that 81 percent of young people aged 15 to
24 were able to use a computer, the highest rate for any age
group.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, only one in 10 "elderly" Canadians knew how to
operate a computer.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Threatens to Close Refugees Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) - Tanzania warned Rwanda and
Burundi Friday it would close the camps for their refugees in
Tanzania if they continue to accuse it of supporting the
so-called refugees' crossing-border attacks on them.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Home Affairs Segela Nswima told a press
conference that the accusation by the Rwandan government, which
was aired by the Western media this week, was groundless.
</P>
<P>
"No refugees have crossed the border to Rwanda for attacks,"
he said. "Actually the attacks are in the western part of that
country where we do not share a common border."
</P>
<P>
Nswima said that fed up with endless accusations by the
Rwandan and Burundi governments, Tanzania feels too taxing and
tough to continue the task of caring for their refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that during her visit to the camps last month, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako
Ogata refuted the reported claims that there are soldiers in the
refugees camps.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government told the UNHCR head that if the
accusations went from bad to worse, it would definitely close the
camps and repatriate the refugees back to their homelands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation of the envoys based in Dar es Salaam
left Friday for Tanzania's western region of Kigoma to witness
the repatriation of some Congolese refugees, the United Nations
officials said.
</P>
<P>
During their two-day visit, jointly organized by the offices
of the UNHCR and the World Food Program (WFP), the dignitaries
will have a first-hand impression of the difficulties in refugee
assistance program including delivering food, medicine and other
supplies to the refugee camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR statistics show that by the end of last year,
Tanzania harbors 346,703 refugees form Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Somalia, with the Burundians
accounting for 266,498.
</P>
<P>
Despite the endless civil war in Burundi, there are clear
indications that some 68,000 Burundi refugees had returned home
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kohl, Blair Hail Good Anglo-German Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
visiting British Prime Minister Tony Blair Friday expressed
satisfaction about the good relations between the two countries
and stressed that they will continue to cooperate closely in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"The relations between Germany and Britain are strong and are
getting stronger all the time. That is a good thing for both our
countries, as well as Europe and the world," said Blair after a
three-hour meeting with Kohl in Bonn which was held under the
framework of regular Anglo-German consultations.
</P>
<P>
On European issues, both leaders agreed that it was important
to ensure a successful launch of the single European currency euro
and to make progress on the European Union (EU) enlargement and EU
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"There are many difficult obstacles to be overcome, but we are
committed to the same objectives and the same goals," Blair said
at a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that although Britain had decided not to join
euro in the first wave in January next year, it would still play a
fully constructive role in launching euro and was fully prepared
for the event.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed a number of international
issues. Both of them agreed that Europe should continue to play a
constructive role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo crisis, Blair stressed that what had been done by
Europe in stemming an escalation of recent conflicts there was one
of the examples showing that Europe was able to cooperate very
quickly in taking definite action in response to international
problems within its border.
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, Blair held one-hour talks with Gerhard
Schroeder, who will represent Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) to challenge Kohl in the national elections
due in September this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Schroeder, he and Blair shared the common view
that Europe should spend more on job creation to combat serious
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who likes to be compared with Blair who led the
leftist British Labor Party to a big election victory last year,
also expressed confidence that the SPD, the German equivalent of
the Labor Party, would also come to power after the September
elections.
</P>
<P>
Blair himself, however, has been cautious enough in Bonn not to
intervene in the German elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters whether Germany needed a new leader like
Tony Blair, Blair responded, "What Germany needs is a matter of
Germany."
</P>
<P>
In a clear snub at Schroeder, Kohl answered the same question
by saying, "Germany does not have a Tony Blair."

ATHENS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Greek equities set a record
high on the Athens Stock Exchange Friday with the general index
closing 3.13 percent higher at 1,919.91 points for the first time
in history.
</P>
<P>
The bourse index has risen 24.88 percent since the Greek
national currency drachma joined the European exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) as of Saturday, denoting a 14 percent devaluation
against the European currency unit (ECU).
</P>
<P>
The bourse's 20-blue chip index, the FTSE/ASE-20, also scored a
new high at 1,125.9 points.
</P>
<P>
Trading remained extremely heavy with turnover at 108.7 billion
drachmas (about 332 million U.S. dollars) to total 472 billion
drachmas (about 1.43 billion dollars) for the week, or a daily
average of 94.6 billion drachmas (about 289 million dollars) from
21.2 billion drachmas (about 64.8 million dollars) the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
Advancing shares outpaced declines 184 to 47 with another 21
stocks unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that drachma's devaluation had lessened the
danger of further currency turmoil and led to a gradual decline in
domestic interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Parties in Angola to Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday called on the parties concerned in Angola to complete
immediately and without conditions the implementation of all
remaining obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and relevant
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council
stressed the urgent need for the Government of Unity and National
Reconciliation of Angola (GURN) and in particular the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to take
measures to move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the GURN and in particular the UNITA to
complete immediately their obligations in the areas of
demobilization of all remaining military elements of the UNITA,
normalization of state of administration throughout the national
territory, transformation of Radio Vorgan into a non-partisan
broadcasting facility as well as disarmament of the civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
The council endorsed the recommendation by the U.N.
secretary-general to resume the gradual downsizing of the military
component of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA)
before 30 April 1998, with the understanding that the withdrawal
of all formed military units, with the exception of one infantry
company, the helicopter unit and the signals and medical support
units, will be completed as soon as conditions permit, but no
later than July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to increase gradually and as needed the
number of civilian police observers by up to 83 to assist the GURN
and UNITA to resolve disputes during the normalization of state
administration, identify and investigate allegations of abuse, and
facilitate the training of the Angolan National Police according
to internationally accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested the U.N. secretary-general to
report by 17 April 1998 on the status of the implementation of the
peace process, with final recommendations regarding the modalities
of the United Nations presence in Angola after 30 April 1998,
including the exit strategy and expected termination date of the
MONUA and the follow-on activities by the United Nations, after
the termination of process, to consolidate the peace process and
assist in the social and economic recovery of Angola.
</P>
<P>
It urged the GURN to continue to give priority to peaceful
actions that contribute to the successful conclusion of the peace
process and to refrain from any action, including the excessive
use of force, which might undermine the process of normalization
of state administration or lead to renewed hostilities.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the
local authorities in Tanzania have been accused of mismanaging
funds, media reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of 103 councils of the country, 64 mismanaged about 3.5
billion shillings (about 5.8 million US dollars) between 1993 and
1996, the Controller and Auditor General has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the funds had been used for unauthorized
expenditure, questionable payment, improperly vouched and
unvouched expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 20 local authorities failed to meet the target
of revenue collection between 1994 and 1996. During this period
the authorities collected 3.335 billion shillings, a shortfall of
1.4 billion shillings, it says.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Leader of Zimbabwe's Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe African National Union
(Patriotic Front)(ZANU-PF) decided to dismiss its Masvingo
provincial party Chairman Dzikamai Mavhaire with immediate effect
on Friday, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of ZANU-PF, the highest decision making
body of the ruling party, resolved at a crucial meeting on Friday
to dismiss Mavhaire as its member and the provincial leader.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Publicity of the party Nathan Shamuyarira told
reporters that the Central Committee also agreed that Mavhaire
should apologise to President Robert Mugabe for his statements in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mavhaire's statements have been misconstrued as suggesting
that he wanted President Mugabe to step down.
</P>
<P>
As to Speaker of the parliament Cyril Ndebele who was also
critisized by Mugabe for trying to protect Mavhaire from facing
disciplinary action, Shamuyarira said that the Central Committee
felt he had a case to answer.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is still under discussion by the Disciplinary
Committee which will report to the politburo and then to the
Central Committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele and Mavhaire were rebuked by Mugabe who said there was
an open rebellion against the ruling party by some top party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the party's Central
Committee on Friday, Mugabe said that these "evil schemers,
conspirators, political saboteurs" and their "misguided"
ambitions were responsible for the present situation of confusion
and anxiety in ZANU-PF, and had to be "dealt with once and for
all".

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Conveys Annan's Letter to Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's Special Advisor Diego Cordovez Friday conveyed a letter
from Annan to Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, hoping the
bicommunal peace talks on the island are to be resumed as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Cordovez after his meeting with Clerides,
during which they discussed the issue of resumption of Cyprus
peace talks which went into deadlock following two rounds of
bicommunal talks last summer.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy told reporters that the U.N. chief and his
Cyprus envoys are bound by the existing Security Council
resolutions in their efforts to settle the protracted Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to find a way to proceed with negotiations,
bridge the differences between the two positions and continue the
search for a peace settlement," the U.N. envoy noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he explained that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash rejected the idea of going to the Security Council to
change the current mandate and President Clerides does not accept
the idea of "state-to-state" talks.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez had a meeting Thursday with Denktash, during which
the Turkish Cypriot leader reiterated his position of no
participation in the peace talks unless his breakaway state
unilaterally declared in 1983 in northern Cyprus is recognized by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy stressed that "We have to follow the
resolutions of the Security Council, the Secretary-General has
been given a mandate, we have to follow the mandate and try to
achieve a settlement which is in line with those resolutions of
the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"Now if one or the other wants to change that, they can try to
change it in the Security Council," he added, noting that "unless
the Security Council changes this, we are bound by the existing
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
So far, negotiations to settle the long-standing Cyprus problem
have been carried out between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities in accordance with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bi-zonal and
bi-communal federal state through peace talks, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez had a meeting Friday afternoon with Denktash in the
Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia. It was the second
meeting between the two in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy is expected to have a second meeting with
President Clerides Saturday morning. He will leave for Athens and
Ankara on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Six Arrested for Hacking Pentagon Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials said a
confederacy of teenage computer hacker groups targeted the
Pentagon and other U.S. sensitive government agencies in a series
of highly sophisticated attacks during the past seven to 10
months.
</P>
<P>
The hackers were based in Israel and the United States. They
apparently did not obtain any classified information, U.S. Justice
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two California teen-agers, one Washington State young person
and three Israeli teens have been arrested in a joint U.S.-Israeli
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The names of the two California suspects were not released, but
the suspect from Carson, Washington, was 20-year-old Calidan Levi
Coffman.
</P>
<P>
NASA Inspector General Roberta Gross called Coffman "one of the
U.S. ringleaders of the Internet hacking group known as `ViRii.'"
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old Israeli hacker, who calls himself "The
analyzer," was placed under house arrest in Israel Wednesday and
questioned Thursday. The Justice Department in Washington
identified him as Ehud Tenebaum. Two more 18-year-olds in Israel
were also placed under house arest after being identified by the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
All three Israeli teenagers have admitted their involvement in
the computer intrusions, the U.S. Federal Investigation Bureau
(FBI) said.
</P>
<P>
The three Israeli suspects were working with two juveniles in
Cloverdale, California. They hacked their way into U.S. Department
of Defense and other federal agency computers, FBI said. They also
entered Israeli government computers and commercial and
educational systems in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ViRii investigation was triggered in June when security
officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California, discovered one of their Internet computer servers was
actually being controlled by an outside source.
</P>
<P>
NASA's Computer Crimes Division and other government agencies
including the Naval Intelligence Service, the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations and the FBI eventually uncovered a link
between what they say was Coffman's group and a mysterious Israeli
hacker known as "The Analyzer" who headed a shadowy group called
the "Israeli Internet Underground."
</P>
<P>
The investigation picked up steam in February when the
Pentagon's computers came under a massive attack characterized by
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre as the "most sophisticated" in
its history.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still looking for another hacker, thought to
be a Massachusetts teen who goes under the code name "FAC."
</P>
<P>
Investigators said it was not clear at this point what their
motives were.

<HEADLINE> French Rightwing Hijacks Regional Election by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- France's central-right Union for
French Democracy (UDF) Friday hijacked the regional elections
outcome by allying with the far-right National Front (FN), seizing
several left-dominated regional councils and winning 11 councils
out of 22.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist-led leftwing coalition, which came out the winner
in the elections Sunday, only won three councils in France proper
and the one in the overseas territory of Frency Guyana so far,
while the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) won two councils.
</P>
<P>
The UDF and RPR deputies also delayed the voting in four other
regions, including the Paris region and the Provence-Alpes-Cote
d'Azur, where the left won a narrow victory but the number of
elected deputies is considerable.
</P>
<P>
If the UDF and RPR deputies continue to ally with the FN in
these regions, the political map of France will remain
right-dominated as six years ago, when the previous regional
elections were held.
</P>
<P>
Only in the western region of Franche-Comte, Jean-Francois
Humbert, a UDF candidate, resigned after being elected president
of the regional council with the support from FN.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist and Communist leaders immediately condemned the
allying between UDF deputies with the FN, while RPR President
Philippe Seguin denounced those who allied with the far-right.
</P>
<P>
Socialist Party First Secretary Francois Hollande said the day
would "remain a sinister day in the history of the republic,"
while Communist Party National Secretary Robert Hue described what
happened as "a denial of democracy."
</P>
<P>
The FN hailed the alliance with the UDF as a victory. The FN
European Parliament deputy and head of the party's campaign in
Paris, Jean-Yves Le Gallou, said that "the containment against the
FN has now cracked."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia-Angola Relations Strained over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A six-member Angolan delegation
is in Zambia to verify the alleged arms supply from Zambia to
Angola's rebellious National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said here on Thursday that
the delegation is free to go ahead and find out the truth to have
a better impression on Zambian side of the common border.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that Angola remains a friendly and sister country
to Zambia despite misconception and mistakes that could have been
made by nationalists of either country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said it is important for the two countries to meet and
resolve the allegations because the issues at hand are important
and threaten the security of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan military and government officials, who arrived in
Zambia on Tuesday, have held meetings with their Zambian
counterparts in Mongu in western province bordering Angola.
</P>
<P>
The officials from both sides started to carry out spot
inspections on the Zambian side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Angolan ambassador Manuel Augusto charged on March 5 that
Zambians were supplying arms to UNITA through Zambia border.
</P>
<P>
He said "we do not believe that the Zambian government can
support UNITA in any way. But we are saying some individuals
including Zambian citizens are using the Zambian territory to
support UNITA."
</P>
<P>
He warned that while his country does not wish to have a
repeat of the Congo-Brazzaville and Congo Kinshasa incidents
where the Angolan government participated in dislodging the
governments there. "Angola does not rule out any option if UNITA
does not stop getting arms from some territories."
</P>
<P>
He said that Angola had tried to negotiate with former Zaire
and the Congo-Brazzaville governments, but things never worked,
only resulting in Angola's invading the two nations and
dislodging the sitting governments, which supported UNITA.
</P>
<P>
One of the companies that supply arms to UNITA is a
Zambian-based South African firm, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Zambian government must enforce control on
its side of the border so that UNITA does not take advantage of
the border to acquire firearms.
</P>
<P>
He described the situation in Zambian-Angolan border as
serious, saying that the border is almost under the control of
UNITA.
</P>
<P>
But Zambian President Frederick Chiluba denied on March 12
that his government has any involvement in supplying arms to any
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we are a very peaceful and friendly nation and
we have no capacity to give arms to UNITA."
</P>
<P>
However, the president said that his government will
investigate allegations that Zambia is being used as a transit
point for arms to UNITA, which fought a civil war of about 20
years against the Angolan government after the country's
independence in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also dismissed as false claims that UNITA soldiers
have replaced refugees at Maheba refugee camp in Solwezi in
Zambia's northern province.
</P>
<P>
He said that his foreign minister Keli Walubita will go to
Angola soon to brief Angolan side on the measures his government
has taken.
</P>
<P>
On March 15 Walubita said the alleged arms supply to UNITA
through Zambia has already been referred to the Organization of
African Unity (OAU)

<HEADLINE> Greece: Athens Favors Non-Aggression Pact With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday expressed its
willingness to sign a non-aggression pact with neighboring Turkey
as part of its efforts to improve the strained relations between
the two countries for decades.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the Greek government was very favorable
towards the signing of a non-aggression pact with Turkey as long
as this accord would not be contrary to international law and
international treaties governing the status quo in the region.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a statement recently made by Turkish
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin in which Sezgin did not rule out the
possibility of signing such a pact with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reppas said that Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos Thursday handed over a letter to the Turkish ambassador
in Athens in which Athens reiterated its standing position on the
proposals, in essence a rejection of Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem's five-point plan for dialogue on all differences
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Greece criticized Cem's plan as "a simple restatement of issues
already being dealt with and of the standing Turkish stance for
dialogue on all issues."

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The session scheduled to begin at
21:30 local time (20:30 GMT) of the ongoing four-party talks on
the Korean peninsula has been put off again after an earlier
session in the afternoon was postponed, sources close to the talks
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduled session is expected to resume at about 08:00
local time (07:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the delay is supposed to be that one of the four
delegations attending the talks among China, the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, South Korea and the United States has
to wait for instructions from its capital.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chen Jian, China's assistant foreign minister, told
reporters that the atmosphere since the talks started on March 16
had been "serious, calm and friendly" although there existed
disagreement on what kind of subcommittee should be set up.
</P>
<P>
"We need flexibility from all sides" to reach an agreement,

<HEADLINE> Uganda Ready for Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of State for
political affairs Amama Mbabazi announced on Friday afternoon
that US President Bill Clinton will pay an official visit to
Uganda on March 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
This is the first sitting American President to visit Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi briefed the press that for the first day Clinton is to
hold talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on bilateral
relations and then to visit a school and a US-funded program
outside Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The US President will also co-host a regional summit with
Museveni on March 25 in Entebbe, some 40 kilometers south from
here. The summit will focus on regional issues including conflict
prevention, democratic participation, human rights promotion and
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi confirmed that leaders from Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda,
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe, and the
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity are to
attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
More and more American businessmen are interested in Uganda.
Applied Energy Services decided last year to invest more than 400
million US dollars to build a 300-megawatt hydro dynamic power
station at upper Nile. Some American enterprises are also
involved in the telecommunication and other sectors in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the US relationship with Uganda, Susan Rice,
Assistant Secretary of State said on Wednesday in Washington that
Uganda has been a good partner of the United States and is trying
to play a largely constructive role in regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Museveni recently expressed his welcome to Clinton's visit and
said that he hopes the visit would bring more US investment and
soft loans to improve infrastructures in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the six-African-nation trip from March 23 to April 2,
Clinton will also visit Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana and
Senegal.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the US-Uganda relations are booming with more
frequent American officials' visits to the East African country.
One year ago, US first lady Hillary Clinton tripped Kampala, and
then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did last December
during her tour to eight African countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- German riot police on Friday turned
water cannons on hundreds of anti-nuclear activists who staged a
sit-in protest on railway lines near the northern German town of
Ahaus to try to block a controversial shipment of nuclear waste to
a nearby nuclear depot.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the arrival of a special train carrying six
containers of spent fuel rods from two nuclear power plants in
southern Germany, several sections of the rail lines had to be
repaired because of damages made by demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Police also had to cut free several demonstrators who chained
themselves onto the track.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 anti-nuclear protesters gathered in Ahaus earlier
Friday and tried to force their way into the railway station which
was sealed by the police. Several people were wounded during the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
At about 20:40 local time, the nuclear waste train finally
arrived at its destination through a 3.7-kilometer-long private
track leading from Ahaus to the nuclear storage.
</P>
<P>
The transport, which started Thursday from the southern German
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has required a total of 30,000
policemen to provide protection. About 400 anti-nuclear activists
have been taken into custody temporarily in the two days.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Trans-Kalahari Highway
was officially opened on Friday, following completion of the
Botswana section.
</P>
<P>
The 600-kilometer stretch of the road, built over five years,
cost the government of Botswana about 75 million US dollars,
reports reaching here from Gaborone said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma and President Ketumile Masire of
Botswana inaugurated the road, which links Africa's east coast in
Mozambique to Namibia in the west.
</P>
<P>
Masire said that communication and transport are some of the
strongest binding sectors for unity among the 14-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony held in Kalahari Desert in Botswana's
Gantsi District, Masire said that the road will promote
integration as well as economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Radio Namibia reported that goods worth three billion US
dollars may be transported through the highway every year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Industry and Trade of South Africa said in a
statement that the road network will also cut transport costs on
international trade in the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the highway will bring significant
potential savings on the flow of Namibian exports to Mozambique
and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Namibian government said it expects to save more than 120
million US dollars on vehicle operations each year thanks to the
road.
</P>
<P>
Communication and transport are among the top priorities of
SADC, which formed six years ago in order to set up a free-trade
area for Southern Africa by the year 2000.

meeting here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who arrived in Seoul on Saturday for a three-day visit
and met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung earlier, proposed
resuming the talks.
</P>
<P>
"I feel regret over the situation," Obuchi said. "The Japanese
government could not help but inform the Korean government of its
termination of the accord because of protests from private fishery
agencies and politicians in Japan."
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Park urged Japan to take a sincere and positive
attitude toward the restoration of the fishery talks.
</P>
<P>
"If Japan's capture of Korean fishing boats re-occurs, future
negotiations will not go smoothly. Accordingly, Japan's sincere
efforts are required," Park noted.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to open a Seoul-Tokyo security policy
meeting as soon as possible. The meeting, originally scheduled to open
in January this year, was delayed due to Japan's unilateral
termination of the fishery agreement.
</P>
<P>
Revising the 1965 fishery agreement has ailed the two nations
for a long time since they must redraw their sea boundaries under
a new United Nations maritime convention.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, Japan announced its unilateral repeal of the
fishery accord after South Korea refused to accepted its demands
in the past two years' 10 rounds of negotiations for revising the
accord.
</P>
<P>
A day later, South Korea passed a resolution urging the
government to take all possible measures to guarantee Korean
fishermen's interests, including scrapping self-regulation on the
operation of South Korean fishing boats near Japan's waters.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Observes World Water Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Saturday joined the rest
of world in commemorating World Water Day set for Sunday whose
theme this year focuses on the sustainable use of ground water.
</P>
<P>
Cain Mathema, deputy minister of rural resources and water
development, said in a statement that the use of ground water is
on the increase in Zimbabwe and should be monitored to minimize
its depletion and pollution because it plays an important role in
times of drought.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his ministry has just completed consultations on
important pieces of legislation which will guide the development
and management of national water resources into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The draft Zimbabwe National Water Bill will soon be tabled
before parliament and if approved will sensitize the management
of ground water in the same manner as surface water, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The new bill proposes to invoke stiffer penalties against
pollution of water through the application of the polluter pays
principle," Mathema said.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy minister, the government continues to
place emphasis and accords a high priority to water development
countrywide as witnessed by the increased construction of dams to
give the nation adequate water.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the World Water Day is to promote public
awareness on water-related issues which include conservation and
sustainable utilization of water resources.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Environmental Protection Industry Gaining Momentum (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The output of China's
environmental protection industry has registered an annual average
increase of 20 percent in the 1990s, with yearly output hitting 40
billion yuan (five billion U.S. dollars), according to the
Association of China Environmental Protection Industry (ACEPI).
</P>
<P>
"The new industry boasts a certain amount of economic strength
and scale," said Yu Yuefeng, vice director of ACEPI, adding that
the Chinese government has attached great importance to
environmental protection and has taken a series of measures to
step up pollution treatment, which has provided opportunities for
the industry's further development.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Chinese companies have taken environmental
protection or comprehensive utilization of resources into
consideration for production.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China's accumulated investment in environmental
protection will reach 400 billion yuan, of which the investment in
the first-phase landscaping project from 1996-2000 will hit 188.8
billion yuan, an official with the State Environmental Protection
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The big environmental protection projects China is carrying out
include water pollution treatment of Huaihe, Liaohe, Haihe, Caohu,
Taihu and Dianchi, as well as treatment of acid rain and sulfur
dioxide air pollution across many provinces, cities, and regions.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry can provide technology
and equipment for large-scale pollution treatment, comprehensive
utilization of resources, and spreading clean production, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign enterprises such as those in the United States,
Germany, and Japan are also trying to gain an edge in the
potentially big Chinese market.

"Some of these products have reached world advanced level," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese production of equipment dealing with air pollution
treatment will develop rapidly in the next five years, he said,
adding that the newly developed Chinese product of water pollution
prevention and treatment equipment should gain an important market
share.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese competitive products mentioned by Li include
comprehensive utilization facilities treating solid waste whose
output is predicted to surpass that of water and air pollution
treatment equipment, and garbage-burning facilities with a daily
capacity of 150 to 1,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"It is not impossible for China's environmental protection
industry to boast the exporting capabilities amounting to hundreds
of millions U.S. dollars after 3-to-5 years of development," said
Li Siyu.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Liaoning, Tianjin
and Guangdong, and the city of Shanghai have taken the lead in
developing the environmental protection industry, and they are
expected to implement a series of new programs to uphold their
advantages.
</P>
<P>
With an annual increase rate of 25 percent, the environmental
protection industry of Jiangsu Province should reach an output of
20 billion yuan (2.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has assigned Liaoning Province in
northeast China as the production base for the nation's
environmental protection industry, and the municipal city of
Tianjin also set forth a goal of establishing itself as a
production center for north China.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, will
make intensive efforts to develop new technologies, techniques and
products through establishing an environmental protection
industrial park zone.
</P>
<P>
"The newly booming Chinese industry of environmental protection
will also actively seek Sino-foreign economic and technological
cooperation to promote the development of the industry," said Li
Yuefeng.

HARARE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian High Commissioner to
Zimbabwe Anne Charles Saturday predicted that there is potential
for trade increase between Zimbabwe and Canada through joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Charles told the Zimbabwe News Agency that owing to Canada's
open market policy, there are no restrictions for goods imported
or exported to Canada.
</P>
<P>
She said more still needed to be done in the field of
technology transfer and Zimbabwe could benefit from Canadian
technology.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage more business to be done by the two countries
and the interest of business opportunities we have received from
both countries is fantastic," said the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zimbabwe was among the top group of countries which
conducted business with Canada with exports of different goods in
excess of 16.6 million Canadian Dollars (11.6 million U.S.
Dollars), she said.
</P>
<P>
Canada imported tobacco, cotton and precious metals from
Zimbabwe while Zimbabwe imported machinery.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian High Commission in Zimbabwe was currently in the
process of establishing a web site on the internet, she said,
adding that the focus of the site will be to promote and increase
the accessibility of information to Canadian companies by
Zimbabwe's business sectors and other southern African countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs to Protest Land Confiscation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Arabs decided Saturday
to stage widespread demonstrations on March 30 to mark the Land
Day and protest Israel's continued confiscation of their land and
property.
</P>
<P>
The annual event was to remember six Israeli Arabs, three from
the northern Arab town of Sakhnin, who were killed by Israeli
soldiers in a demonstration in 1976 to protest Israel's usurp of
Arab land in Galilee in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
This year's decision to hold the Land Day protests was made by
the Supreme Council of Israeli Arabs that include Arab lawmakers
and heads of local Arab councils who met in the northern city
Shefaram.
</P>
<P>
The council said that three major demonstrations would be held
across the country, including Sakhnin, western Galilee and Negev
in the south.
</P>
<P>
It said the demonstrations are to protest against continued
confiscation of land and properties of Arabs, whose population is
estimated at about 1 million.
</P>
<P>
The past annual Land Day protests usually passed relatively
quietly, but Israeli security forces are expected to keep high
alert this year against possible outbreak of violence at a time
when the peace process is deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arabs, who complain about racial discrimination in the
dominantly Jewish state, closely identify themselves with the
Palestinians in the territories and support their struggle for
independence.

<HEADLINE> 20th Anniversary of Deng's Speech on Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Reviewing Deng Xiaoping's speech
on science and technology two decades ago is of great significance
for Chinese people to carry out the strategies of revitalizing the
country through science and education and realizing sustainable
development, Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wen's remarks came while attending a meeting commemorating the
20th anniversary of the delivering of Deng's speech at the
National Science Congress in 1978, in which Deng re-established
such ideas as "science and technology is productivity" and
"intellectuals are part of the working class." Deng's speech
helped China embrace the spring of science.
</P>
<P>
With the guidance of Deng's speech, China has been earnestly
implementing the Communist Party's policy on science and
technology and intellectuals, pushing the scientific restructuring
drive, establishing systems favorable to the development of
science and technology and professional training, and promoting
the scientific and technological revolution in the agricultural
sector, Wen said, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China must achieve its social and economic
development on the basis of scientific and technological progress,
and the upgrading of labor's quality, placing science and
technology development and education in key positions of economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
He required that intellectuals and knowledge must be respected
by society as a whole, and encouraged intellectuals to play their
own initiatives, adding that leading cadres must help them solve
practical problems.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were Ding Guangen, a member of the
political bureau of CPC Central Committee; Cheng Siwei, vice
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC); and Wang Zhaoguo, Lu Jiaxi, and Song Jian, all
vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

<HEADLINE> Second Four-Party Talks on Korean Peninsula Wind Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The six-day second plenary session
of the four-party talks to seek a lasting and stable peace on the
Korean Peninsula ended here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jian, China's assistant foreign minister and chairman of
the current round of the talks, said in a chairman's statement
that China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea
and the United States of America had an "in-depth exchange of
views on substantive issues relating to permanent peace on the
Korean peninsula."
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere during the talks from March 16-21 was "candid,
serious and calm." Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"We were not, however, able to narrow the differences
sufficiently to move forward in our work at this time," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Major achievements of the second plenary included:
</P>
<P>
-- This was the first meeting in which the four-party talks
moved into a substantive stage.
</P>
<P>
-- The four parties clarified some of the important differences.
</P>
<P>
-- The four parties agreed that it is necessary to set up
sub-committees.
</P>
<P>
"The four-party talks are inherently a long and difficult
process," said the chairman's statement. "The fact that we are
here together today demonstrates the commitment of all the parties
to our common search for a permanent peace."
</P>
<P>
The specific date of the third plenary session to be chaired by
South Korea has not yet been decided, but it is expected to occur
in about three months in Geneva according to the arrangement of
the first plenary session last December.
</P>
<P>
The four delegations expressed their thanks to the Swiss
government for its assistance in serving as host to the current
session.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Nine months after Hong Kong
became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, work and
life have been as usual for Richard A. Siegel, who led 800 staff
members in the Civil Aviation Department through the transition.
</P>
<P>
When asked if anything has changed after the handover, the
Director of Civil Aviation told Xinhua: "There has been no
change. The short answer is no."
</P>
<P>
"(In the civil service), the structures and the people remain
in place, and all assurances that were stated before the handover
have been honored," said the high-ranking expatriate civil servant
of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
His department continues to look after Hong Kong International
Airport, Kai Tak, which is among the busiest, safest and most
efficient airports in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We're a technical department, and we deal with technical
issues and maintain the high standard," said the 54-year-old
Briton, who has been with the Department since he came to Hong
Kong in 1973. No wonder he has a high personal regard for the
department, saying: " We're a good team and we work well
together."
</P>
<P>
Siegel also took a lot of pride of his former staff members,
who now become the backbone at the Airport Authority, a body
taking care of the building and management of the New Airport at
Chek Lap Kok, scheduled for operation in July this year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to see them taking the Kai Tak tradition to the New
Airport, and taking the Hong Kong experience to the New Airport,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
His diary remains pretty full -- chairing the director meetings
every two weeks, joining in discussion on the management of Chek
Lap Kok new airport, planning the transfer of operations from Kai
Tak to Chek Lap Kok, and many more. Usually he works 12 hours a
day from eight to eight, but still manages to find time listening
to classical music and reading biography.
</P>
<P>
However, in Siegel's eyes, something has become different after
the handover. In October 1997, he attended a regional conference
of Director General of Civil Aviation, where for the first time he
sat under the Bauhinia flag, the regional flag of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, He took part in the Conference on
Airworthiness of the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) in Montreal, for the first time as a member of the Chinese
delegation. Hong Kong used to join the British delegation on the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
"I was given a very warm welcome by the Chinese delegation to
the ICAO," he said, "They were very helpful and friendly, and give
me great assistance."
</P>
<P>
"Under the British delegation, I sat right at the back of the
hall; under the Chinese delegation, I sat right in the front of
the hall," said the Hong Kong official, "you see, they (Chinese)
change my position in the hall."
</P>
<P>
Besides the arrangement of sitting, he was impressed by another
aspect. "We're given more latitude under China this time than we
worked under the British," he explained, "we have established a
clear mechanism for communications with the Chinese in the
mainland, and the mechanism works well."
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his 46th-floor office where commands a good view of
the-glass-glazed skyscrapers in Central, Siegel said: "When I
look outside this window, I see what is stated in the Basic Law
and in the Joint Declaration is what has happened."
</P>
<P>
"'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' and 'a high degree of
autonomy' work very well. The concept of 'one country, two
systems' has gone onto a good start. If it continues, the
prosperity of Hong Kong will be ensured," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
His confidence in the future of Hong Kong was built upon his
25-year connection with this Chinese city. When he arrived in
early 1970's, he did not intend to stay this long in Hong Kong,
but after he had been for a while, he fell in love with the Kai
Tak Airport, the people and the city.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak is where he began his career and life in Hong
Kong. Starting from the passenger terminal, he later took the
position of the Airport General Manager for ten years through the
80s, in his words, a very challenging time of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Kai Tak will be closed with the opening of
the New Airport at Chek Lap Kok. Siegel said: "I have mixed
feelings. Kai Tak is like your grandma. It is a wonderful good
lady. It serves so long, so well."
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that Hong Kong needs a new airport with more
capacity, and Chek Lap Kok is the future of aviation in Hong
Kong. "I'll be sad to see it (Kai Tak) go, and I'll be glad to
turn the light down," said the man, who called himself an
aviation man.
</P>
<P>
"I have always been proud to have been part of the city, even
in the future wherever I go and wherever I am," said Siegel, who
is expected to retire in six years.
</P>
<P>
He decided to stay in 1970's because he was motivated by a
"can do" spirit in Hong Kong. The city is so unique that "if it
can be done anywhere in the world, it can be done here", and the
people are vibrant, positive and hard working.
</P>
<P>
During the Sino-British negotiations in the 1980's, again, he
decided to stay on to transition. "Because I believe in the future
of Hong Kong and I have faith in the people."

<HEADLINE> International Jute Meeting Begins in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from exporting and
importing members of the International Jute Organization (IJO)
began a three-day conference in Dhaka on Saturday on the situation
in the world market where competition is becoming increasingly
fierce.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the IJO's exporting countries --
Bangladesh, India, China, Nepal and Thailand and 21 importing
members including those from the European Union are attending the
26th session of the International Jute Council (IJC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the session presided over by IJC
Chairman Li Enheng of China, Bangladeshi State Minister for Jute
A.K. Faizul Huq said that jute as a natural fiber is one of the
most eco-friendly products which can be extensively used by
mankind without the environmental anxiety.
</P>
<P>
But the jute sector now faces a difficult situation in the
world market because of competition from substitute products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The sociological and long-term ecological benefit of jute
usage should be weighed carefully with the mere expediency of
short-term economic gains," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Jute has been a major source of income generation and a major
foreign exchange earner for a number of countries, whose total
population exceeds a billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fate of millions of jute growers in the developing belt is
inextricably connected with the production of jute as it plays a
significant role in poverty alleviation, he said.
</P>
<P>
IJO Executive Director K.M. Rabbani said that to make the jute
industry more profitable to the farmers and more competitive, it
is essential to evolve improved varieties which would not only
give higher yield per acre but also produce better quality fiber.
</P>
<P>
The IJO had embarked upon a project for collection,
conservation and characterization of germ plasma of jute and
allied fibers, the executive director said.
</P>
<P>
IJC Chairman Li Enheng said the objectives of the IJO had been
realized to a great extent. "This should not be taken as a
rationale for us to be self-satisfied...much more work is left to
be done," he added.
</P>
<P>
The closing meeting of the session will consider a possible
renegotiation of a successor agreement to the current
international agreement on jute and jute products in 1998,
conference sources said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses Importance of Legislative Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, newly elected chairman
of the Standing Committee of China's Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), today emphasized the necessity of intensifying
legislative work, improving the quality of legislation and
striving harder to build a socialist legal setup with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Li made his remarks while addressing the first meeting of the
Ninth NPC Standing Committee convened here today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China has made great achievements toward legislative work
through two decades' of effort, he said. A legal framework has
been established with the Constitution as the core and basis, Li
said, supplemented by socialist legal systems with Chinese
features, which has played an important role in China's reform,
opening-up drive and modernization.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years China's reform will expand further and
its modernization drive will continue, he said, which will surely
set new and greater demands for the country's legislative work.
</P>
<P>
The 15th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has put
forward that it is necessary to tighten legislative work and
improve the quality of legislation to form a socialist legal
system with Chinese characteristics by 2010.
</P>
<P>
To realize this goal, the Ninth NPC and its Standing Committee
is entrusted with a very heavy and arduous task toward
legislation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that it is imperative to seize the time, and to
draft and improve important laws concerning the socialist market
economy to standardize, guide, advance and guarantee a healthy
development of a socialist market economy in China.
</P>
<P>
Under the prerequisite of persisting in the four cardinal
principles, it is also necessary to push political restructuring
reform, improve the socialist democratic system, draft and improve
laws that help protect and guarantee people's legitimate rights as
masters of the country, and standardize administrative activities.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the formulation of a general plan for legislation
during the five-year tenure of the NPC Standing Committee, with
detailed sub-plans for each year's legislative work.
</P>
<P>
Legislative tasks should be completed in a planned,
step-by-step manner according to demand and possibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
The study and drafting of legislative outlines till the year of
2010 is also a priority, he said. The legislative outlines will
serve as guidance for long-term legislative work.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized the necessity of drafting laws in accordance with
China's situation and practical conditions, treating the
Constitution as the basis and adhering to the unification of a
socialist legal system, associating legislation with major
decisions of China's reform and economic development, and valuing
the broad masses' opinions.
</P>
<P>
In the process of legislation, it is imperative to go deep to
investigate and research, adopt various forms and widely listen to
the opinions of the masses, said Li, adding that it is also
necessary to fully bring experts' roles in legislative work into
full play.

<HEADLINE> Professional Job Fair Opens in Fuzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A job fair for professional
workers, co-sponsored by the Ministry of Personnel and Fujian
Province, opened today in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important step to speed up the establishment of the
country's jobs fairs for professional personnel," said a ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
The state-level fair, titled "China Straits Job Fair," was set
up to meet the demands of Taiwan-funded or foreign-funded
enterprises and push the economic and trade cooperation as well as
personnel exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Province, which faces Taiwan across the straits, has a
lot in common with Taiwan in land, blood relationships, and
cultural and language traditions. The province also has become an
important window for economic and trade exchanges between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province had approved the
establishment of 5,000-plus Taiwan-funded enterprises with
investment hitting 5.3 billion U.S. dollars. These enterprises
need 100,000 to 120,000 employees each year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Personnel has been promoting the establishment
of job fair systems across the country, setting up a group of
state-level or regional-level job fairs in such cities as
Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu and Xi'an.

derivatives should be raised gradually. This rise, which is due
to start on July 1, 1998, will bring the tax to 80 percent. This
tax will further to 90 percent on July 1, 1999, and to 100 percent
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The new Moroccan government announced Friday that the
customs duties on grain imports would be raised. It is the first
measures of its kind taken by the government since it was
appointed by King Hassan II a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Khaled Elaiwa said that Prime Minister

<HEADLINE> Israel to Seek U.S. Backing to Pullout From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai is to visit the United States next week to seek
Washington's backing to Israel's initiative on a conditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon, Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai will hold talks with senior U.S. officials to
discuss the Israeli readiness to withdraw from south Lebanon so as
to seek U.S. support, which is crucial to the success of the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's U.S. trip was decided after Israeli security
Cabinet voiced support to his proposal for a unilateral pullout
from south Lebanon in keeping with the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425, which called for unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But his proposal conditioned Israeli withdrawal on the
Lebanese government's agreement to deploy troops in the region to
ensure safety of Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
To pull out from south Lebanon, where Israel is bogged down in
a tough guerrilla war with anti-Israeli Hezbollah (Party of God)
fighters.
</P>
<P>
An average 35 Israeli soldiers are killed annually in south
Lebanon since Israel's establishment of a 1,200 square-kilometer
security zone in south Lebanon with the aim to protect Israel's
northern area from cross-border guerilla attacks in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In the latest casualties, six Israeli soldiers were slightly
injured late Friday when Hezbollah gunmen shelled Israeli outposts.
</P>
<P>
Analyzers believed that the chances of Israeli initiative on
Lebanese withdrawal depend on whether Lebanese government agrees
to deploy troops in south Lebanon in the event of an Israeli
pullout and whether Syria permits Lebanon to do so.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Syria will not agree to let Israel off the
hook by withdrawing from south Lebanon while continuing
occupation of the strategic Golan Heights which Israel seized
from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Although Lebanon and Syria have welcomed Israel's initiative
to withdraw unilaterally from south Lebanon, they demanded such
pullout be unconditional only.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Lebanese and Syrian attitudes, Israeli officials
intimated that any breakthrough on the initiative would come
about primarily through direct U.S. involvement.

JAKARTA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,000 people gathered in
Samarinda, capital of Indonesia's East Kalimantan province,
Saturday to join a two-week program to put out forest fires raging
in the 40,000 hectares of the Kutai National Park, Antara News
Agency reported.
</P>

<P>
The fires had been deliberately lit by farmers and plantation
and timber firms to clear ground, he said. "The government is
doing its best but these farmers and the companies still start
fires."
</P>
<P>
Some officials estimated the fires, which have ravaged more
than 80,000 hectares of brush and forest in East Kalimantan over
the last two months, have incurred losses amounting to 76.2
billion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Fires in the islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra last year sent a
haze across a large part of Southeast Asia, causing widespread
health problems and massive transport disruptions.

PHNOM PENH, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime

<HEADLINE> Hyacinth Furniture Planned in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is planning to produce
furniture from hyacinth, the water weed which turns disastrous in
Lake Victoria, The New Vision reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
David Nsalasata, superintendent of Lusira Prison in eastern
Kampala, is seeking assistance for commercial development of the
weed.
</P>
<P>
There are various designs for commercial development of
hyacinth. But the prison officer told a parliament team visiting
the prison earlier this week that his prison has the potential of
producing high-quality furniture on a large scale from the weed.
</P>
<P>
The problem is lack of equipment to harvest and transport the
weed from nearby Murchison Bay of Lake Victoria, the world's
second largest fresh water lake.
</P>
<P>
There are ready market, Nsalasata claimed, adding what they
need is adequate supply of the weed.
</P>
<P>
There is a Japanese weed harvester at nearby Port Bell, but
the chopped weeds are not suitable for making furniture, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The prison has two digesters and a storage trunk that produced
enough biogas for the prison. The biogas is produced from a
mixture of water hyacinth with cow dung. But the facilities are
not enough for commercial production, the prison officer said.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth invaded Nile waters including Lake Victoria in
1950s and developed into an environmental disaster in recent
years.

<P>
TIRANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep Meidani
called on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) on Friday to set up an office in Kosovo to facilitate
mediation during the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meidani made the appeal during a meeting with visiting OSCE
Chairman-in-Office Bronislaw Geremek.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments in Kosovo demonstrate that it is
imperative to establish trust between conflicting sides through
international mediation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meidani told Geremek that Albania supports the role of former
Spanish premier Felipe Gonzalez as mediator for both the European
Union and the OSCE in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic rejected the
idea. He said that Kosovo, as Serbia's "internal issue, can not be
in the competence of a foreign special envoy."
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo heightened on March 1 after the conflict
between Serbian Police and local ethnic Albanians escalated and
led to the deaths of four policemen and 16 Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav province has a 90 percent ethnic majority which
has been seeking independence since 1981.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges Improved Supervision of Government Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, newly elected chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature, today called for more efforts to improve
supervision over governmental institutions and their workers.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that every piece of work of the state is carried out
in accordance with the law, the governmental institutions and
their workers at various levels should, at any time, be brought
under the supervision of its people," Li Peng said at the first
meeting of the NPC Standing Committee held today in the Great Hall
of the People.
</P>
<P>
One of the prominent problems in China's legal structure is a
lack of authority under the law, Li said, adding that the
implementation of some laws is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, laws are not strictly carried out and violations
are not looked into, he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to establishing the authority of the law is that
government bodies at various levels, especially leading officials,
should improve their consciousness of abiding by and upholding
laws, and deal with matters strictly according to law, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To promote the country's progress in accordance with law, he
said, it is necessary to ensure the implementation of the
Constitution and laws are given priority.
</P>
<P>
Li also stressed the importance of launching campaigns to
inspect the enforcement of laws and publicizing basic information
about laws.
</P>
<P>
He called on the NPC Standing Committee to make efforts to
bring under supervision every piece of work concerning state plans
and budgets, major issues of reform and construction, and issues
of great interests to the people.

<HEADLINE> Traces of Siberian Tigers Confirmed in Changbai Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 21 (Xinhua) --A United Nations investigation
team has confirmed traces of four-to-six wild Siberian tigers and
four-to-seven leopards in the forests of Changbai Mountains on the
Sino-DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) border.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is a large meat-eater mainly inhabiting
Siberia in Russia and the northeastern part of China. Only 300
Siberian tigers are believed to exist in the wild because of
difficulties in natural propagation, reduced forests providing a
natural habitat and poaching.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member team -- including specialists from China, Russia
and the United States -- conducted a concentrated investigation
with support from the U.N. Development Program Feb. 28-March
18. The area searched in Jilin Province included the cities of
Hunchun and Dunhua, and the counties of Wangqing and Antu.
</P>
<P>
Researchers on the team used such advanced research methods as
satellite positioning, said Yang Shihe, secretary-general of Jilin
Provincial Wildlife Protection Association. Yang also participated
in the U.N. investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Though we have not seen Siberian tigers and leopards with our
own eyes, we have found traces of their activities almost every
day throughout the entire investigation, including fresh tiger
footprints on the snow-covered ground, excrement, urine stains, and
bones of other animals they have eaten," said Yang, who is also
head of Forest Protection Section of Jilin Provincial Forestry
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, Chinese and foreign experts have also
found many roaming wild boar as well as roe, sika and red deer --
all major food sources for tigers and leopards. In Hunchun they
spotted larger numbers of wild sika deer, which have not been seen
for many years, he said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier investigation carried out in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province found traces of at least one wild Siberian
tiger, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports also said traces of Siberian tigers were found
in Jiaohe city around the Lunar New Year. Those sightings were
confirmed by provincial experts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. began investigating Siberian tigers and leopards two
years ago. So far, they have completed their investigations in
Russia and their studies in northeast China, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The experts plan to move to the DPRK for further investigations
to estimate the number of Siberian tigers and to take effective
measures to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Leopards and Siberian tigers, listed as one of the world's 10
animal species on the verge of extinction, are on the state's
highest level of protection in China.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Eradicate Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is making a
new law outlawing child labor, a senior official of the
Department of Labor said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation will be so stringent that even parents who
urge their children under the age of 15 to take weekend or
holiday jobs could fall foul of the law.
</P>
<P>
Anyone found guilty of employing child labor will be
prosecuted, said Fatima Bhyat, acting director of Minimum
Standards Section of the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that there were about 200,000 children aged
between 10 and 14 who are working for a wage. Most are working on
farms but cases have been reported of children working in
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
Child labor is reportedly exploited in many ways from children
begging for money in the street for their parents, to children
working on farms, children involved in pornography and
prostitution, children used by organized gangs and children
selling fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
To curb child labor, the Department of Labor is promulgating
the Basic Conditions of Employment of Act in two phases, with the
section on child labor being implemented on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This sets 15 as the minimum age for employment and protects
children of 15 up to 18 from hazardous employment.

seriously injured at least 43 of its citizens in a fresh attack
in the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula, as the dispute between the two
countries over it is being handled by the World Court.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters said here Friday that Cameroun, using
a helicopter mounted with a machine-gun, strafed troops and
civilians in several areas of Bakassi, where both countries have
claimed ownership.
</P>
<P>
In the aerial attack, five Nigerian soldiers, 20 market women
and more than 18 school children were wounded, according to
Defense Spokesmen Col. Godwin Ugbo.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which took place Thursday morning, was aimed at
drawing Nigeria into a retaliatory attack, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugbo, the Cameroun armed forces gendarmes have
within the past one year attacked innocent fishermen in the area,
killing some and abducting many.
</P>
<P>
"They have equally provoked our troops, but we have restrained
ourselves not be to drawn into any form of hostilities" in
respect of the ruling by the International Court of Justice on
the cease-fire agreement between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some two weeks ago, Nigeria alarmed that Cameroun had moved
about 5,000 of its troops to the borderline in Bakassi, alleging
that Cameroun had been acquiring more military hardware since it
declared dispute with Nigeria over the ownership of oil-rich area
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to defense sources, Cameroun has a total military
strength of 26,000 made up of 11,500 soldiers, 1,500 naval
officers and ratings, 1,000 air force officers and men and 12,000
gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
It has, apart from three reconnaissance early warning radar,
acquired at least 24 planes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Several European nationals were also accused of being involved
in the preparation for an attack in Nigeria's position in
Bakassi.
</P>
<P>
"The federal military government of Nigeria views the heavy
concentration of troops by the Camerounian government at the
border as an affront, and appeals for restraint," Ugbo said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have been clashing since early 1994 on
Bakassi, a territory of about 1,000 square kilometers and
believed to be rich in oil resources.
</P>
<P>
The case was filed to the International Court of Justice by
Cameroun in 1994 and is currently being heard at the Hague, the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Corser Claims Superbike Pole Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Troy Corser marked a
dream return to the Superbike World Championship Saturday when he
claimed pole position for the opening round at Phillip Island in
Australia's Victoria state on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Despite an injured left ankle, Corser recorded a time of
1 minute 34.971 seconds in Saturday's controversial Superpole
shoot-out to move from fifth on the grid to first, although the
26-year-old had reservations about the new qualifying format.
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with Superpole," said Corser, the 1996 world
superbike champion.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to race, not do one lap. I've got a good race
set-up, and that's what's important for tomorrow, not being
fastest after just one lap."
</P>
<P>
Corser is receiving treatment for injuries he suffered in a 240
kmh accident during testing at the circuit last Wednesday, and
admitted he was not 100 percent fit.
</P>
<P>
Corser edged out the Castrol Honda of New Zealander Aaron
Slight for pole by only 0.026 seconds, with Ducati factory riders
Pier Francesco Chili and Carl Fogarty only 0.078 seconds and 0.011
seconds slower respectively.
</P>
<P>
The casualty of Superpole was Australian Suzuki rider Peter
Goddard, who had earlier qualified fastest in the 36-bike field,
but dropped to seventh-fastest after the one lap Superpole
final qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to spend tonight in my own bed rather than one in a
hospital, so I opted for safety," said 33-year-old Goddard, the
reigning World Endurance champion.
</P>
<P>
The first of Sunday's two 22-lap Superbike races will start at
midway with heat two scheduled for 15:30.

<HEADLINE> Briefing Session for Subsector Elections Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A briefing session for
candidates of the Election Committee (EC) subsector elections was
held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center here
Saturday Morning.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Justice K.H. Woo, chairman of the Electoral
Affairs Commission, briefed the candidates on some important
regulations and guidelines related to the EC subsector elections
to be held in Hong Kong on April 2 as well as specific matters
concerning the polling day arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The session was aimed at ensuring the subsector elections to be
conducted in a fair, open and honest manner, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session, candidates drew lots to determine
the order of names on ballot paper and to allocate designated
spots for display of election advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Optical Mark Reader for counting was also demonstrated during
the session.
</P>
<P>
The nomination for the EC subsector elections finished Friday
with a total of 1,107 nominations received.

<P>
Of the 800 seats which make up the Election committee, 77 will
be filled by ex-officio members comprising Hong Kong deputies to
the National People's Congress and members of the Provisional
Legislative council, 40 seats will be filled by nominees from the
religious subsector and 683 seats will be returned by election in
the remaining subsectors.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Economic Thrift in New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei has called on the Iranian people and the government
to practice "reasonable thrift" and fight against "extravagant
consumption" in the new Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to advise the dear Iranian nation against extravagant
consumption and everybody must think seriously of thrift and
economical consumption," Khamenei said in his new year address to
the Iranian nation on Friday night. The new Iranian year started
on Saturday on Iranian calendar.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying that "there
is no justification for us to indulge in extravagance at the
cost of sacrificing the greater future of our nation or our
long-term goals or even our important present-day preferences and
we have no right to overlook our future needs."
</P>
<P>
"My primary recommendation to the people this year is to be
wise and consume economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ailing economy was worsened by an decrease of oil
incomes as a result of oil price drop in world market during the
past Iranian year, since oil incomes make up 80-90 percent of the
country's foreign exchanges revenues.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil revenue during the 11 months of the past
Iranian year stood at 14.3 billion U.S. dollars with an average
price at 15.7 dollars per barrel. It is difficult to achieve 17.7
billion dollars oil revenue in the government's budget for the
year.
</P>
<P>
Mainly because of the reduction of oil revenue, the budget
deficit in the last Iranian year reached 4.57 billion dollars and
it will rise to 11.4 billion dollars in the current Iranian year,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Iranian rial for U.S. dollar also soared
up to 5,250 in the black market on the eve of the Iranian new year
from 4,800 at the beginning of 1998, although the government still
keeps the official rate at 1,750 rials and the export rate at
3,000 rials.
</P>
<P>
Economists and oil experts have warned of a serious economic
crisis in Iran during the new year, because they believed that
Iran's oil earning would be reduced by some 3-4 billion dollars
since the price of Iranian crude has declined to around 11
dollars per barrel.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's investments
overseas have been hard hit by the current economic turmoil,
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Saturday.

The economic woes forced Malaysian businessmen to defer or pull
out of their overseas investment projects, he said in Sungai

memorandums of understanding which they have signed," he was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.

effects of the economic crisis on Malaysian entrepreneurs
investing overseas, which he said would be submitted to Prime

PARIS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- March 20 was a black day for the French rightwing when the
taboo from the Resistance in World War II and Gaullism was
broken. In five regions where the leftwing has won a relative
majority in regional council elections, the personalities of the
right ignored the instruction from the leaders of Rally for the
Republic and Union for French Democracy and reached a deal with
the far-right National Front for keeping their presidency in the
councils.
</P>
<P>
-- An Argentine commission has revealed some documents which
showed that Cardinal Eugene Tisserant, a French Roman Catholic
prelate who served as leader of the mission of Vatican in eastern
Europe and later nominated as candidate for the pope, wrote to the
Argentine embassy in Rome in 1946 asking Argentina to provide
asylum for some French Nazi collaborators fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The far-right National Front allowed the election of
rightwing personalities to the presidency of five regional
councils on Friday, including former Defense Minister Charles
Millon who was elected as president of the council of the major
industrial region of Rhone-Alpes. This led to a split within the
rightwing, and the RPR president Philippe Seguin described it as
"a terrible convulsion" for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
-- Pope John Paul is to begin Saturday a three-day visit to
Nigeria, during which he will plead for human rights for the
people living under military dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Rejection to Berlin Court Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 21 (Xinhua) - Iran Saturday once again
rejected the Berlin court rule that accused Iranian leaders of
sponsoring state terrorism against Iranian Kurdish rebel leaders
in Germany, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
Saturday morning that "these claims are unacceptable and lack
legal value and validity."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the biased statements of the Berlin local
court judge was made in line with a political and propaganda
show which continued for several years," Mohammadi.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the Berlin local court ruled that Iranian
leaders were behind the terrorist killing of four Iranian
Kurdish opposition leaders in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In a protest to Iran, the European Union (EU) countries
immediately withdrew their ambassadors to Tehran, who returned
last November after the two sides reached a compromise.
</P>
<P>
After 11-month investigation, the Berlin local court judge
repeated the accusation against Iran in his recent statements.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the Berlin court judge's statements have
been made "on the basis of unfounded allegations of witnesses,
some of whom are implicated in terrorist acts and others are
prosecuted by the Iranian judicial authorities and the
international police for committing unlawful actions."
</P>
<P>
In addition to this, he said, after the judge made his
comments orally "we made it clear that the Berlin local
court, investigating the Mykonos file, was not impartial and
that the respective judge ignored the independence of the
judicial system and did not let the opposite side to enjoy
the right to defend."
</P>
<P>
The accusations leveled by the court against the Islamic
Republic of Iran lacked legal value and were rejected at the
same time, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Mykonos case was raised again weeks before senior
German Foreign Ministry officials were reportedly to visit Iran
next month to mend Bonn-Tehran relations strained by the case.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the German officials would also
discuss with Iranian officials the death sentence on the
German businessman Helmut Hofer on charges of having illegal
sexual relations with an Iranian Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has warned that the
Bonn-Tehran relations would depend on Hofer's fate, though the
German government was ready to improve them.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran claimed that Hofer's case was tried
independently and according to the country's laws which ban
sexual relations between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Apologizes for Statement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon had apologized to Jordan over his statement on
an assassination attempt against an Hamas leader in Jordan by
Israeli Agents last September.
</P>
<P>
The Semi-official Jordan Times Saturday quoted informed sources
as saying that Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, had
received an "apology letter" from Sharon who said his statement on
the assasination of anti-Israeli Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) political bureau leader Khalid Mashaal were
"misunderstood."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Jordanian Arabic dailies reported Friday that
Sharon wrote to Hassan that "what he wrote was misunderstood and
he did not mean to threaten the sovereignty of Jordan, its
integrity and its people."
</P>
<P>
Sharon told Israel's Channel Two television on March 14 that
Israel had informed Jordan before it decided to assassinate
Mashaal. Mashaal survived the assassination attempt by two agents
from Israeli overseas intelligence service Mossad in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The statements arose wide protests in Amman. On March 15,
acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Talal Sata'an Al-Hassan on
behalf of the government summoned Israeli Ambassador to Jordan
Odid Airan to inform him of Jordan's protest and rejection
of the statements.
</P>
<P>
Later the next day, Deputy Prime Minister for Services and
Minister of Information Abdullah Ensour denied Sharon's statement
saying that the Jordanian government knew nothing about Israel's
decision to kill Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
Two Mossad agents were arrested last year in Amman for
trying to kill Mashaal by injecting poisonous chemical into
his left ear before his office on September 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Israeli relations sharply deteriorated over the
botched assassination attempt on Mashaal. Hussein immediately
suspended cooperation in security matters with Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Mossad chief Danny Yatom resigned last month over a series
of failed operations in Jordan and Europe against Hamas, Iran
and Hizbollah of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Then the Jordanian-Israeli relations began to warm up as
official high-level contacts were resumed at the beginning of
March.
</P>
<P>
The development was suddenly interrupted by Sharon's remarks
which were made only four days after Hassan visit to Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second Arab country after Egypt that signed
peace treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Vows to Fight Against Fundamentalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz has said that his government will wage every kind of
struggle against Islamic fundamentalism within the rules of law
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remarks late Friday night at his exclusive
interview with Turkey's private ATV in response to a statement
issued by Turkish Armed Forces earlier in the day, which attacked
Yilmaz's earlier remarks on the military.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz has reportedly said that "I did not order the army to
fight against fundamentalism. The military should tend to its own
business." The military can not impose its will on the government,
he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the military pressured Yilmaz's government to
take harder measures against the Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "no matter what position or task is
represented, no one...can display an attitude or make any
suggestion or comment that will discourage, confuse, weaken or
overshadow the determination of the Turkish Armed Forces to
struggle against separatist or fundamentalist activities that
target the country's security."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to ATV, Yilmaz said that there are a lot of people who
have the views of fundamentalism, adding that the views must be
cleared away within the framework of law and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports have said that the army was unhappy with
the government's handling of the Islamic fundamentalism, which
was considered by the army as one of the worst enemies of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister pointed out that "no one can bring
Turkey again into a trap of separation, darkness of fundamentalism
and backwardness of coup."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Gdp Growth Rate in 1996/97 Is 5.6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's gross domestic
product (gdp) grew by 5.6 percent in 1996/97, Minister of
Economic Development and Cooperation Girma Biru has said.
</P>
<P>
According to ''The Ethiopian Herald'' Saturday, Minister
Girma, in an interview with the official newspaper, said during
the period 1992/93 to 1996/97, the real gdp on the average grew
by about 7.0 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Girma said the real gdp growth rate in 1996/97 is below the
average of the period.
</P>
<P>
The basic feature of the Ethiopian economy is the dominance of
the agricultural sector in terms of employment, output and export
earnings, he said, adding that hence the performance of the
economy as a whole is greatly influenced by what happens in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The minister referred to the impacts of El Nino on Ethiopia's
agricultural production and said the El Nino in 1997 has
contributed to excess precipitation throughout equatorial eastern
Africa including Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Climate induced droughts were major social, environmental and
economic disruptive forces in Ethiopia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization and the World Food Program, Ehtiopia's total grain
production in 1997 was about 8.8 million tons compared 11.8
million tons of 1996 and 9.7 million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 grain production is 25 percent and 9 percent lower
than the 1996 and 1995 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of Crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week lower
mostly in line with the strength of the local unit -- the ringgit
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local unit regained its strength against the greenback as
it hovered around 3.64 at the close this week against a recovery
to 3.82 towards the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, there were some buying activities
on Thursday, but prices fell back on the following day as the
ringgit got stronger.
</P>
<P>
The "unsupportive" palm oil forecast by private crop forecaster
Ivan Wong also dampened sentiment, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Wong forecast that March 1998's palm oil production to increase
by five percent to 630,000 tons from 601,219 tons produced in
February.
</P>
<P>
However, he estimated palm oil stocks for March at 715,000 tons
against the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority's
(PORLA's) figure at 736,670 tons in February.
</P>
<P>
March south ended the week 30 ringgit (about 8.24 U.S. dollars)
lower to 2,265 ringgit (about 622.25 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was volatile with thin
volume this week due to the lack of buying interests, especially
from the European buyers.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week decreased to 294 tons from
324 tons last week with the bulk of the transactions coming from
the local and Japanese buyers.
</P>
<P>
On the week's closing day Friday, players short-covered their
positions ahead of the weekend despite the continuous uptrend of
the ringgit against the greenback, saving price from falling
further.
</P>
<P>
Tin price ended 27 sen lower this week to 19.80 ringgit (about
5.43 U.S. dollars) per kg from 20.07 ringgit (about 5.51 U.S.
dollars) per kg at last week's close.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and that of the London Metal
Exchange (LME) narrowed to 155 U.S. dollars per ton from 127 U.S.
dollars per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Malaysian rubber market was choppy as most
buyers adopted a "wait-and-see-attitude" and the strengthening of
the ringgit against the US dollar since early this week also kept
players on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian rubber also faced stiff competition from the Thai and
Indonesian rubber which was offered at lower prices, forcing local
sellers to adjust downward their prices relative to their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
April RSS One closed the week 1.5 sen higher to 279.00 sen
(about 76.64 U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20 slipped by 12.5 sen
to 271.50 sen (about 74.58 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for March 19 was at 191.00
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg as against 200.59 cents on March
12.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 193.85 cents per kg
against 202.38 cents last week.

Venus who is ranked a career-best 11th.
</P>
<P>
Serena's victory was an upset over the 10th-seeded Spirlea,
which helped the Williams sisters for three consecutive wins over
the Romanian, including a victory by Venus in the semifinals at
last year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
"In the second set I got a lot more balls over the net," Serena
said, adding "I knew if I could do that, she would miss."
</P>
<P>
Should the Williams sisters meet in the semifinals, Serena has
to topple defending champion Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals.
The top-ranked Hingis advanced by beating Chanda Rubin 6-1, 6-0 in
47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the men's play, U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter was upset
by Vince Spadea 6-3, 7-5. Rafter, seeded fourth, lost in the
first round at Lipton last year.
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov overcame four match points in
the second set to outlast Slava Dosedel 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6
(7-5).

<HEADLINE> Top Bank Bosses Sacked in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
exercised the mandate as the major shareholder of the Kenya
Commercial Bank (KCB) in sacking KCB Executive Chairman Alexander
Kaminchia and General Manager Elijah arap Bii.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper East African Standard Saturday quoted Kenyan
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae as saying in a statement Friday
that the government had appointed Peter Nyakiamo as the new KCB
executive chairman and Ernest Saino as the new general manager.
</P>
<P>
The sacking of the top bank bosses followed the firing of
three KCB directors Thursday who were involved in large amount of
unsecured and unserviced insiders' loans.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some KCB officials owed the bank large
unserviced loans amounting to more than 2.6 million U.S. Dollars
with Bii reportedly owing over 1.25 million Dollars and other two
directors owing 700,000 and 620,000 Dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The KCB shares fell to a record low of 57 Kenyan Shillings
Friday at the Nairobi Stock Exchange and brokers said that this
was the lowest price in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has a 60 percent share-holding in KCB
which is the largest commercial bank in East Africa, and is
scheduled to sell a 25 percent stake in KCB next month.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the unsecured and unserviced loans of
KCB would have a negative impact on the government's plans to
offload share-holdings in the bank which has assets estimated at
73.5 billion Shillings (about 1.22 billion Dollars).

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  Clinton's Visit to Unfold New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
imminent visit to six African countries, claimed to be one to
promote the continent's prosperity and stability, is actually an
opportunity to unfold Washington's new "partnership with Africa
into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
The "partnership" relation with the whole sub-Saharan region
is clearly revealed in Clinton's itinerary of the visit, which
starts from March 22 and covers Ghana, Uganda, Senegal, Botswana,
South Africa and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
By including two countries in west Africa, two in the southern
region, and one each in east and central Africa, Clinton is
trying to give a touch of a geographical balance to his visit,
the first by a sitting U.S. president in two decades.
</P>
<P>
While Senegal is a clear signal showing United States'
intention to form partnership with African states which were once
considered part of France's sphere of influence, a two-hour stop
in Rwanda, which is later added to Clinton's African tour, is to
demonstrate U.S. concern over regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of U.S. "partnership" policy toward Africa is to be
undergirded by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act of 1997 and
the Africa Crisis Response Force Initiative.
</P>
<P>
While the Act stresses Washington's interest in helping
sub-Saharan nations get onto the track of prosperity as claimed
by the U.S. government, the Initiative emphasizes the provision
of training and equipment, primarily communications gear, to
African countries to create interoperability among units from
different nations.
</P>
<P>
The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which is labeled by the
media as a U.S. "gift" to Africa, would, as Clinton said,
significantly broaden African countries' access to American
market, spur growth in the continent, and help the poorest
countries eliminate or reduce their bilateral debt, thus
assisting them in building a better life for their people.
</P>
<P>
The Act, announced on June 17 last year and passed at the
House of Representatives on March 11 just before Clinton's
historic African tour, would allow sub-Saharan countries to
export textiles and apparel to the U.S. in unlimited, duty-free
quantities.
</P>
<P>
Under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, Africa can ship
up to 1.3 billion Dollars' worth of textiles annually up to 2005,
thus offering an "entry point" to the U.S. market, and paving the
way for the continent to "move onto a higher level of
manufacturing and trade."
</P>
<P>
U.S. textile and apparel imports from sub-Saharan nations
currently total 350 million U.S. Dollars a year, even if imports
from the continent treble as a result of the legislation, they
would account for merely two percent of the 46-billion-Dollar
textile market in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Croatian President Meets Russian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
put forward again his proposal on demilitarization of Bosnia when
meeting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Tudjman noted that Bosnia's demilitarization
should be enforced under the guarantees of the international
community and through the signing of agreements with neighboring
Croatia and Yugoslavia safeguarding Bosnia's territorial integrity
and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman told Primakov it is very important to protect Bosnian
Croats who account for only 17.3 percent of the total population,
far less than Bosnian Serbs or Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who came here for visit Friday, expressed "great
interest" in the proposal. He passed Tudjman an invitation from
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Russia, which Tudjman
accepted with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also met with his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic to
discuss bilateral relations, the situation in Bosnia and Kosovo
and issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Granic said Russia's role of keeping balance between Croatia
and Yugoslavia is welcome.

JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

The Citizen:
</P>
<P>
-- A South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Friday denied
newspaper reports that Robert Mcbride, who was arrested in
Mozambique for illegal possession of weapons, had officially
requested 11,000 U.S. Dollars from the ministry for his
Mozambican trip.
</P>

Saturday Star:

Ecstasy to cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Red Bricks Forbidden For Building In Shandong Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
expected to use fly-ash bricks instead of red bricks in a bid to
reduce air pollution and to protect farmland.
</P>
<P>
Lots of farmland has been destroyed and air is seriously
polluted every year because of the manufacture of red bricks in
this province, according to an official of Shandong's construction
department.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount of fly ash produced by thermal power plants
has increased to be several million tons a year, with an average
annual growth rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Using bricks made from fly ash instead of red bricks,
therefore, is a good method for improving farmland and improving
air quality, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Jinan, capital of the province, is expected to use fly-ash
bricks in all of its large buildings, the official added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kenya and Mauritius, however, were listed as countries
"unqualified' for the benefit, since both were found by the White
House as having failed to establish satisfactory safeguards
against trans-shipment to the U.S. of textiles and clothing made
in countries that remain subject to quotas and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
What's more important is that the two countries do not
willingly undergo structural adjustment programs in line with the
demand of Washington and some international organizations under
the U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have noted that the borrowing from the West and
international financial institutions, as well as bilateral aid
are, more often than not, in close connection with
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Some African economists also argue that the answer to Africa's
economic woes lie in the governments' giving up control of vital
corporations involved in agriculture, mining, insurance, banking,
fishing and everything.
</P>
<P>
It actually means that westerners could own controlling shares
of private industries and utilities in any African countries
receiving U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
This is like a fly-weight boxer contending with the champion
Holyfid. African countries, which have just started their
economic take-off, could be knocked out in the obviously unfair
fight.
</P>
<P>
The Africa Crisis Response Force Initiative, meanwhile, could
be interpreted as a military back-up for the economic benefits
U.S. is trying to seek from the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Initiative, launched in June 1996, is not aimed at the
establishment of a standing African army but to create a
"stand-by" peace-keeping capacity so that participant nations can
act in concert under United Nations auspices to prevent or
resolve conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
But African observers find that the shift in U.S. military
policy in the continent is a new version of engagement with
Africa after its disaster in the peace-keeping effort in early
1990s in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Crisis Response Force Initiative is actually a guarantee
for U.S. market scramble in Africa where regional conflicts and
civil wars are making peace and stability fragile, thus posing a
threat to development and more importantly, to U.S. investment on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that U.S. direct investment in the region at
the end of 1996 totaled 4.9 billion Dollars in book value terms,
up 30 percent from 1994. During 1992-96, the average annual
return on book value of U.S. direct investment in Africa was 28.7
percent, 2.5 times the rate of its return globally.
</P>
<P>
U.S. bilateral trade has also picked up rapidly, with its
exports to Africa in 1997 reaching 6.2 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Just as Clinton said before his African tour, a stronger,
stable and prosperous Africa will be a better economic partner, a
better partner for security and peace.
</P>
<P>
Washington's partnership with Africa, embodied in both the
Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and the Crisis Response Force
Initiative, is part of U.S. global strategy for a sustainable
development well into the next century.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Women food vendors in the
Tanzanian capital have won financial support from the government
to do business.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam City Commission has loaned women food
vendors some 150 million Shillings (about 230,000 U.S. Dollars),
said Matha Wejja, a female member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The MP said she has been impressed by women who have struggled
to make a living by doing petty business, the Daily Mail reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Many women, particularly those with little or no income at
all, lack the necessary capital to start business, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The MP also called on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to
issue soft loans to low-income women so as to help them start
small scale business and be able to repay the loans.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the MP advised the women to make good use
of the loans so that they can improve their living standards and
promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, Wejja insisted that the vendors should strive to
repay the loans in time so that other women can also get loans
from the government.

HAVANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuban State Council President
Fidel Castro said here Friday that the U.S. lifting of ban on
direct flights between the two countries is "positive and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, Castro said that the measure will be
"helpful to a better climate for Cuban-U.S. relations." But he
added he needs to see the full details of the measure.
</P>
<P>
News from Washington reported that President Bill Clinton was
to announce Friday the lifting of ban on direct flights, the
permission of money remittances to relatives in Cuba by Cubans
living in U.S. and the easing of restrictions on U.S. medicine
sales to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez
said the U.S. should completely give up its sanctions against Cuba
and abolish all its "evil and immoral policies."
</P>
<P>
Meeting U.N. human rights officials in Geneva on Friday, Cuban
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina reiterated his opposition to
U.S. economic, financial and trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
Media here said that the U.S. lifting of ban constitutes only
"a drop of water in the desert," and the right thing the
U.S. should do is to fundamentally change its position on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuba estimates that the 40-year U.S. embargo has brought on it
an economic loss of 60 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China to Construct More Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China will build 50,000 new
libraries in the next 11 years, with the hope of achieving the
goal of "one township, one library", today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the country now has 2,676
libraries, with every county having just one.
</P>
<P>
The construction of grassroots libraries is part of the
Knowledge Project, a nationwide program that was launched last
year with financing from nine ministries and commissions.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the project will encourage the public to read
more," the newspaper quoted Du Ke, director of the Library Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Culture, as saying.
</P>
<P>
China published 19.3 billion copies of national and provincial
newspapers, 2.5 billion copies of magazines and 7.1 billion copies
of books last year.
</P>
<P>
It invested 800 million yuan in libraries in 1997, compared
with just 60 million yuan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
A US-based association of Chinese-American professors has also
carried out a scheme to build libraries in southwest China's
Yunnan, Guizhou provinces, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
A dozen of Aihua (Love China) libraries have already been set up,
with 6,000 U.S. dollars of investment in each from the association
for purchase of books.
</P>
<P>
A China Readers' Association is expected to be founded later
this year, which will be put in charge of the implementation of
the projection.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces and cities have already set up their own
readers' associations, providing opportunities to buy books by
discount and information on new books.
</P>
<P>
Preparation is also under way for next year's national reading
activity to mark the return of Macao and the 50th anniversary of
the founding of New China.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Sugar Production Crosses Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has produced 162,000
tons of sugar during the current fiscal year (starting from July
1, 1997) 17,000 tons more than the target, media reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two sugar mills out of the total of 15 are still producing
sugar in full swing, and the output of sugar is expected to reach
170,000 tons by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year, this South Asian country's 15 sugar
mills produced 135,000 tons against their optimum production
capacity of 210,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Though the sugar production surpassed the target, 125,000 tons
of sugar would be imported this year to meet the total demand of
the country, the reports predicted.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Commerce and Industry Minister Tofael Ahmed has
asked the concerned authorities to monitor the sugar distribution
system in order not to let vested quarters create any crisis in
any part of the country, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Center Changes Battle Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Northern Drug
Suppression and Prevention Center is once again adjusting its
strategy to combat narcotics smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Banpot Piamdee, the center's director, said intelligence
operations will be boosted to catch up with drug dealers who have
altered their tactics.
</P>
<P>
The new plan, to be put into practice, will involve local
police and soldiers in anti-drug operations, while anti-drug
officials will cooperate in terms of policy and intelligence, said
Banpot, quoted by today's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
He said anti-drug officials who took part in past operations
will withdraw from such raids because they have their own work to
do.
</P>
<P>
These officials will train soldiers and police, and double
check information at the center, Banpot said.
</P>
<P>
He said the center will investigate cases of drug dealers --
be they government officials, politicians or law enforcement
officers.
</P>
<P>
In the latest five-month operation with the participation of
anti-drug officials, more than 100,000 amphetamine pills were
confiscated, said Banpot.
</P>
<P>
"We set up a lot of checkpoints and searched every vehicle. The
intensive search did have psychological effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced concern about the increasing number of people in the
illicit business, saying the sluggish economy would bring in new
faces.

<HEADLINE> Zubak Backs Bosnia Non-Militarization Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Presidency of the
Republic of Bosnia Kresimir Zubak said Friday he supported
establishing Bosnia as a non-militarization zone, as proposed by
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
Zubak made the remarks in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia during
talks with Mr A. Vershbowon, the United States ambassador to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In a communique released by his office in Sarajevo, Zubak said
that judged from an economic point of view, the proposal deserved
much attention.
</P>
<P>
He said Bosnia needed money to rebuild its war-torn homeland,
and military appropriations were not allowed. Non-militarization
in Bosnia should not block Bosnia from further developing ties
with the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Vershbowon said Tudjman's proposal, made Thursday, was very
interesting. He said the suggestion could become one of the
prerequisites leading to a long stability in a wide area,
particularly in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But a senior Bosnian official opposed the proposal. The
official said it would be very difficult to achieve the suggestion
because Bosnia was surrounded by military forces. Any
non-militarization in Bosnia would be like dropping a stone into
the sea, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was not possible for Bosnia to lose its military force and
join the NATO peace partnership program, the official said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Investors to be Treated as Nationals in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Investors from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to be given treatment
similar to those of the nationals if they invest in the region,
the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Secretary-General of the Board of
Investment Chakramon Phasukvanich, who attended the recent meeting
of the Working Committee on ASEAN Investment.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, coming from the meeting held in Brunei, was aimed
to promote intra-ASEAN investment.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, ASEAN investors would be treated as locals
under each member nation's investment laws, Chakramon said.
</P>
<P>
According to Thai laws, for instance, joint ventures with
foreign investors require Thais to hold a minimum 51 percent
stake. As a result, ASEAN investors interested in launching
investment projects in Thailand would be given the same holding.
</P>
<P>
Chakramon said the proposal will be submitted to the committee
on international economic policy for approval soon and the
resolution will be forwarded to ASEAN economic ministers' meeting
to be held in may.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is part of the ASEAN investment area initiative.
At the unofficial ASEAN summit last December in Malaysia, the
ASEAN investment area was set to come into force in 2010. the
inflow of liberal investment in the area will be allowed in 2020.
</P>
<P>
Chakramon said under the initiative, ASEAN members would
cooperate in exchanging investment information, preparing data
based on investment, ensuring transparency in investment policies
and organizing intra-ASEAN investment promotion activities.

<HEADLINE> Special: Sea Turtle Population Threatened in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's sea turtle population
is facing a serious threat off the famous resort of Phuket Island
in southern Thailand from local fishermen, beach encroachment and
souvenir businesses, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a turtle conservationist as saying that
sea turtles have indirectly been hit by cyanide poisoning that the
local fishermen used in catching lobsters.
</P>
<P>
The conservationist, Manop Kidsarng, said that many fishermen
sell turtle eggs to restaurants and dead turtles to craftsmen who
use their shells to make ornaments.
</P>
<P>
Property development, which also brought waste water and
pollution to the beaches, was also discouraging sea turtles from
coming ashore to lay eggs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Local conservation groups have been collecting sea turtle eggs,
hatching them and releasing baby turtles back into the sea.

<HEADLINE> Moldova, Russia, Ukraine Discuss Trans-Dniester Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from Ukraine, Russia and
Moldova held talks Friday in Ukraine's port city of Odessa to
discuss a speedier settlement to Moldova's conflict with the
self-declared Trans-Dniester Republic.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Interfax said that after the talks, Moldovan
President Petru Lucinschi, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma,
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the leader of
Trans-Dniester, signed an accord that promises to increase
mutual-trust and contact between Moldova and Trans-Dniester.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Moldova and Trans-Dniester would both cut
their peacekeeping forces stationed in the region to
500. Meanwhile, Ukraine would send its observers to the region for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also signed a protocol defining some priorities in
speeding up the settlement of the Trans-Dniester conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma and Chernomyrdin also signed a joint statement on the
Trans-Dniester conflict after a bilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on leaders of Moldova and Trans-Dniester
to give priority in their negotiations to resuming an integrated
economic, social and legal system.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have been helping broker an end to the
conflict over the mostly Russian-spoken region.
</P>
<P>
Trans-Dniester, which is an important industrial region of
Moldova, began to seek independence in 1990 and later declared
itself an independent state.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum granting Trans-Dniester broad autonomy within
the Moldova border was signed last year in Moscow, but leaders of
Trans-Dniester insist they need full independence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Continue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- United States steel imports went
up 19.8 percent in January over December 1997, to reach 2.52
million tons, the American Institute for International Steel
(AIIS) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The AIIS president, Horst E. Buetle, said: "The same strong
steel demand that pushed U.S. imports to their highest level in
1997 continued through the first month of 1998."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imported a record volume of 31.20 million tons in
1997, breaking the previous record of 30.10 million tons in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the import volume in January was 19.8 percent less
than that of the same month in 1997, when import shipments were
driven especially high by repeated price-hike warnings by
U.S. producers, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the Asian financial crisis does not appear to have
resulted in a surge of imports from that region," Buelte said.
</P>
<P>
"Of the major steel producers, only Japan showed an increase in
shipments to the U.S. in January," he added.

<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
rule out any cabinet reshuffle following the censure debate which
ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was too premature to speculate about a cabinet reshuffle,
Chuan was quoted as saying by today's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Chuan denied rumors that the Social Action Party (SAP) had
made indication it wished to have some of the cabinet ministers in
its quota changed.
</P>
<P>
Montri Pongpanich, the SAP leader, also insisted that there
would be no cabinet reshuffle or change to the line-up of
ministers in the party's quota.
</P>
<P>
The censure debate, kicked off by the opposition on Wednesday,
focused on a no-confidence motion submitted to parliament by the
opposition on march 2 in a bid to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Chuan lashed out at opposition members, saying they were just
repeating themselves and talking too much about the past
throughout the debate.
</P>
<P>
He refuted charges by the opposition that his administration
was corrupt and incompetent. But he admitted that there have been
things his coalition government has not succeeded in doing.
</P>
<P>
"Nor has this government set aside any of its policies
declared in parliament," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members will cast a vote on the no-confidence
motion later today.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Impose 5 Percent tax on Foreign Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAkARTA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
impose a new 5 percent tax on the gross value of foreign exchange
purchases by individuals or legal entities in a bid to reduce
speculation in the country, a spokesman of the Finance Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Agus Haryanto said here Friday night that the speculation on
foreign exchange had resulted in the weakening of the rupiah
(national currency), so the government will impose the new tax
from next Monday (March 23).
</P>
<P>
The tax is classified as an income tax, he said, and as such
the amount paid by a taxpayer when purchasing a foreign exchange
could be credited to his annual tax return.
</P>
<P>
He said there would also be no tax on foreign currency
purchases made by banks and authorized money changers.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the new ruling is expected to hurt
travelers planning to go abroad, as well as those intending to
study overseas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government also raised the departure tax
from 250,000 rupiah to 1,000,000 rupiah per person.

<HEADLINE> Way Paved for U.S.-China Nuclear Cooperation: U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior United States
official said here Friday that the U.S.-China agreement on nuclear
cooperation has paved the way for American companies to compete
against their counterparts in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Kristoff, special assistant to the president and senior
director for Asian programs at the National Security Council, told
reporters that the accord, signed in 1985, came into effect after
Congress failed to respond to President Bill Clinton's
certification before the deadline of March 18.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton certified on January 12 that China had stuck
to its commitment to non-proliferation. He was obliged to do so
before the pact went into effect, but Congress had only 30 days to
deliberate. Only two-thirds of the votes in both Houses could turn
down the president's certification.
</P>
<P>
"I think that you will see American companies like Westinghouse
and GE begin in earnest to bid on nuclear projects in China,"
Kristoff said, defending the president from critics' protests.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a group of congressmen signed a letter
Friday to Clinton, urging the president to maintain the sanctions
against China -- because of their suspicion about China's
sincerity in carrying out its commitment.
</P>
<P>
Kristoff said: "From the administration's point of view, we
would hope that American companies would be as competitive, and in
fact I believe they are as competitive, as some of the other
nuclear suppliers in the world, like France."
</P>
<P>
Because of the delay in implementing the U.S.-China nuclear
cooperation agreement, the American companies lost their edge over
counterparts in past years. They hoped for billions of U.S.
dollars in business if the accord with China passed Congress.
</P>
<P>
The official said the accord was part of the sanctions waived
so far by the Administration. The U.S. imposed the sanctions on
China following the turbulence in Beijing in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"We have waived a number of them. We would be in a position to
look at peeling away these sanctions one by one as there is
progress in the U.S.-China relationship," Kristoff said.
</P>
<P>
She confirmed the recent press report that Washington would
loosen export controls on satellite launches for China.
</P>
<P>
"Satellite launches is one of these where we have, the
president has on a number of occasions issued national interest
waivers," she noted.
</P>
<P>
On Clinton's trip to China scheduled for late June, Kristoff
said: "You are going to see us working hard over the next 90 days
with Beijing to try to produce some results on areas like
non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
Military-to-military discussions, maritime cooperation, rule of
law, law enforcement and human rights were issues to be discussed
between the two countries in order to make President Clinton's
trip to China a success, she said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM to Visit Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong will pay an official visit to Myanmar at the invitation of
Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)
and Prime Minister Senior-General Than Shwe, according to an
official announcement here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour visit on March 24 will be Goh's second visit to
Myanmar since March 1994 and also an important visit to the
country by a leader from the third ASEAN fellow member country
after Myanmar's entry into the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) last July.
</P>
<P>
Goh's last Yangon visit had prompted a large volume of
Singaporean investment in Myanmar, bringing Singapore to the
second largest foreign investor status in the country after
Britain in the years followed.
</P>
<P>
In June 1995, Chairman Than Shwe visited Singapore, during
which an agreement on bilateral economic cooperation was
initiated.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up, the two countries formed a Joint Ministerial
Working Committee (JMWC) on Promotion of Economic Cooperation,
Trade and Investment, laying down projects in the sectors of
tourism, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and human resources
development.
</P>
<P>
Two meetings of the two countries' JMWC were respectively held
in Yangon and Singapore in January 1996 and October 1997. During
the last meeting, two agreements were signed -- the Maritime
Transport Agreement between the two governments and the agreement
between the two chambers of commerce and industry of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation between Myanmar and Singapore has
developed rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Singapore's investment in
Myanmar amounted to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 65 permitted
projects at the end of 1997, covering sectors of hotels and
tourism, manufacturing, real estate, industrial estate,
construction and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Myanmar and Singapore, one of
Myanmar's five major trading partners, have a bilateral trade
volume of 800 million dollars in 1997, in which Singapore's
exports to Myanmar shared 85 percent favoring Singapore in the
balance of trade, according to Singapore sources.

<HEADLINE> UN to Finance Plan for Aiding China's Rural Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China and the United Nations Fund
for Population Activities (UNFPA) will jointly launch a program
next month focusing on improving reproductive health and family
control in rural China, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 counties in 22 provinces, many of which are
populous areas in central and western China, will be included in
the project, scheduled to be completed by 2000, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, UNFPA will grant 14 million
U.S. dollars to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
The joint project is one of the China's responses to the
Program of Action of the International Conference on Population
and Development (ICPD) that was held in Cairo of Egypt in 1994,
the newspaper quoted an official with the State Family Planning
Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ICPD program calls upon all nations to provide high quality
reproductive health services for couples of reproductive age and
to integrate family planning activities with information on
preventing sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
A reproductive health service system in China's selected
counties is expected to satisfy the public's need for both
knowledge and health care.
</P>
<P>
Training will also be organized to improve local family
planning and health workers' professional skills, and sex
education will be available for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Five kinds of contraceptives will be provided for couples of
reproductive age to choose from. And practical methods for
reproductive health and family planning promotion will be spread
to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Family Planning Commission has also set up a
three-year project (1998-2000) with the Human Reproductive Program
under the World Health Organization (WHO) to support China's
development of new types of contraceptives and carry out training
for professionals.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese commission is selecting some possible subjects from
across the country to invite international cooperation in the
field of reproductive health care and family planning, said the
official.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Indonesia's Subsidies to Basic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved of Indonesia's plans to continue subsidizing
imports of essential commodities and to maintain the State
Logistics Agency (Bulog), a government official said.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF understands that the subsidies of certain strategic
commodities, such as food, feed meal and medicines, are still
needed," Bulog Chairman Beddu Among said Friday after a meeting
with IMF officials, an English newspaper "the Jakarta Post"
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But he promised that the government would gradually lift the
subsidies after the rupiah, which has dropped more than 70 percent
in value against the U.S. dollar, strengthened again.
</P>
<P>
Bulog imports certain food products at the market rate, but
then sells them to the public at an exchange rate of 5,000 rupiah
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah is currently trading at a level of 10,000 to the
dollar, forcing the government to bear the difference through
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had targeted Bulog's monopolistic business practices in
its economic reform package accepted by the government in January
this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Bulog was to relinquish its trading
monopoly on agricultural products, excluding rice, from February
1.
</P>
<P>
But the Indonesian government later said it could not fully
implement the reforms because some of the points, including issues
relating to Bulog's monopolies, could induce undue public
suffering since the private sector had yet to replace Bulog's
role.
</P>
<P>
Beddu and other Indonesian officials were in discussions with
the IMF team to review the 43 billion U.S. dollars bailout package
to save the country's faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team led by its Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss
arrived here on Tuesday to discuss with the Indonesian government
on economic and monetary crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Saudi To Adopt Contract System When Employing Sri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has agreed to follow
the streamlined contract system when employing Sri Lankans with
effect from May this year, the official Daily News reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Labor Minister John Seneviratne who returned to the
country Friday from a successful one-week tour of Saudi Arabia and
 Kuwait told the paper that Saudi Arabia had taken this decision
after being briefed about the benefits of the new contract system.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that to ensure the welfare of Sri Lankans,
particularly housemaids, the new contract system has been
introduced since last November on the initiative of the Sri Lankan
government.
</P>
<P>
The new contract system is a binding document, providing that
the Sri Lankan Mission in the respective country could intervene
for the benefit of the employee in the case of non-payment of
salaries and violations of the contract on the part of employer.
</P>
<P>
Almost all Middle East countries where Sri Lankans are employed
have accepted the contract system with the exception of Saudi
Arabia, the Minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the United Arab Emirates where around 125,000 Sri Lankans
are employed, including 60,000 housemaids and 40,000 garment
workers, it was agreed that to resolve the issue of non-payment of
salaries by the employer, bank guarantees would be provided to Sri
Lankan expatriate workers ensuring payment of two months'
salaries.
</P>
<P>
His successful visit to Saudi Arabia would be helpful to ensure
the greater welfare of Sri Lankans working in the Middle East and
therefore to boost the country's foreign exchange earnings, the
Minister added.

<HEADLINE> At Least 13 Killed by Georgia Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A sudden tornado struck the
northern part of the United States' state of Georgia Friday
morning killing at least 13 people, injuring more than 90 others
and destroying mobile homes and schools.
</P>
<P>
The tornado carved a 16-kilometer trail of destruction through
Georgia after it touched down at about 6:30 a.m. EST (1130 GMT) in
northern Gainesville, about 80 kilometers north of Atlanta. It
left more than 12,000 people without power, reports from Atlanta
said.
</P>
<P>
The storm touched down just outside Lanier Elementary School in
Hall County, destroying the building. It picked up a produce truck
full of tomatoes and onions and hurled it through the air into a
house, killing the driver.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead were four children killed when a mobile house
was leveled and another child and an adult, who were found in a
pond where they had been dumped by the funnel of wind.
</P>
<P>
The dead also included a sheriff's deputy who was hit by a car
when she stepped out of her vehicle to help another driver whose
car had been hit by a falling tree.
</P>
<P>
Georgia Governor Zell Miller, who flew over the scene in a
helicopter to get a first-hand look at the wreckage, said it was
"horrible". In some areas, there was nothing left except the
cement of driveways.
</P>
<P>
Miller declared a state of emergency in Hall, White, Dawson,
Habersham and Rabun counties.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton granted federal disaster relief within
hours.
</P>
<P>
About 200 people were killed when a tornado struck Hall County
in April 1936.

<HEADLINE> Coal Province Strives to Convert to Electricity Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi, China's richest province
in coal, is striving to generate more electricity to sell to
neighboring provinces rather than selling coal.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the province had a total installed
capacity of nearly 10 million kilowatts (kw), turning out 54.5
billion kwh and diverting 10 billion kwh to the rest of the
country in the year.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhensheng, director of the provincial power industry bureau,
said the province is building a 2.1 million-kw power plant for
east China's Jiangsu Province, scheduled for completion in
2000. Meanwhile, it is preparing to build three more power plants
for Shandong and Hebei provinces, as well as the city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The director estimated that the province, which borders Inner
Mongolia in north China, will see its newly added installation
increase by 1 million kw a year in three years, getting more
profits through selling electricity to other regions, whose
development is restricted by power shortages.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China and north China's Inner Mongolia are also major
contributors of electricity for the country.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Treat More Waste Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will double its sewage
treatment capacity by the end of 1999, when the second phase of
construction of the city's biggest sewage plant is completed,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
From that date, Beijing will treat 42 percent of its waste
water, up from the current 21 percent, said Wang Changjing, an
official in charge of water resources management with the
municipal environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
The first phase construction of the Gaobeidian water treatment
plant started in 1990, and upon completion in 1993, it took on 95
percent of the city's treatment work -- 2.5 million tons of sewage
per day.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has plans for 16 sewage plants by the end of 2010,
treating over 80 percent of waste water, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Water coming out of the Gaobeidian plant will be clean enough
to be discharged into the river. Experts are discussing the
further processing of water for use in factories, thus helping
alleviate the water shortage in Beijing, said Guan Long, vice
manager of Beijing No. 4 Municipal Engineering Co., which is
taking charge of the project.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Makes Big Efforts to Reduce Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's National Bank of
Economic and Social Development (BNDESB) decided Friday to invest
12 million U.S. dollars in the Solidary Literacy Promotion Program
to reduce illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The money will enable 100,000 illiterate people from 100
illiteracy-ridden cities learn to read and write.
</P>
<P>
The education program, launched in 1996, aims to foster a
national campaign to combat illiteracy, while creating more jobs
and improving work force quality.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 75,000 people from north and northeast Brazil, where
the illiteracy rate exceeded 47 percent, got an opportunity to
learn under the program.
</P>
<P>
Brazil currently ranks second on the illiteracy list for Latin
America, with 20 million illiterates.

<HEADLINE> Throwing Seedlings in Sowing Rice Works Well in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The method of throwing instead
of the traditional practice of transplanting seedlings in sowing
rice has been gaining momentum in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Southern Guangdong Province is an example. Last year, it used
the throwing technique on nearly one million hectares of paddy
fields, accounting for one-third of the national total.
</P>
<P>
The high-yield planting technique, imported in the early 1990s,
requires growers to throw seedlings down into paddy fields,
standing on field banks.
</P>
<P>
The technique has been expanded to more than 3 million hectares
nationwide, making up 10 percent of the total paddy fields and
increasing more than one million tons of rice annually.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, for instance, harvested 450 kilograms more rice per
hectare in 1992 by using the new method, and saved approximately
half the production cost.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the province spread the use of the
technique on a total of 1.66 million hectares to increase 670,000
tons of rice output and 3.1 billion yuan in profit, and to save
2.11 billion yuan in production costs.
</P>
<P>
It plans to use the technique on 1.2 million hectares of paddy
fields this year, according to the provincial Agriculture
Department.

<P>
However, in Siegel's eyes, something has become different after
the handover. In October 1997, he attended a regional conference
of Director General of Civil Aviation, where for the first time he
sat under the Bauhinia flag, the regional flag of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, He took part in the Conference on
Airworthiness of the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) in Montreal, for the first time as a member of the Chinese
delegation. Hong Kong used to join the British delegation on the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
"I was given a very warm welcome by the Chinese delegation to
the ICAO," he said, "They were very helpful and friendly, and give
me great assistance."
</P>
<P>
"Under the British delegation, I sat right at the back of the
hall; under the Chinese delegation, I sat right in the front of
the hall," said the Hong Kong official, "you see, they (Chinese)
change my position in the hall."
</P>
<P>
Besides the arrangement of sitting, he was impressed by another
aspect. "We're given more latitude under China this time than we
worked under the British," he explained, "we have established a
clear mechanism for communications with the Chinese in the
mainland, and the mechanism works well."
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his 46th-floor office where commands a good view of
the -glass-glazed skyscrapers in Central, Siegel said: "When I
look outside this window, I see what is stated in the Basic Law
and in the Joint Declaration is what has happened. "
</P>
<P>
"'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' and 'a high degree of
autonomy' work very well. The concept of "one country, two
systems" has gone onto a good start. If it continues, the
prosperity of Hong Kong will be ensured," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
His confidence in the future of Hong Kong was built upon his
25-year connection with this Chinese city. When he arrived in
early 1970's, he did not intend to stay this long in Hong Kong,
but after he had been for a while, he fell in love with the Kai
Tak Airport, the people and the city.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak is where he began his career and life in Hong Kong.
Starting from the passenger terminal, he later took the position
of the Airport General Manager for ten years through the 80s, in
his words, a very challenging time of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Kai Tak will be closed with the opening of
the New Airport at Chek Lap Kok. Siegel said: "I have mixed
feelings. Kai Tak is like your grandma. It is a wonderful good
lady. It serves so long so well."
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that Hong Kong needs a new airport with more
capacity, and Chek Lap Kok is the future of aviation in Hong Kong.
"I'll be sad to see it (Kai Tak) go, and I'll be glad to turn the
light down," said the man, who called himself an aviation man.
</P>
<P>
"I have always been proud to have been part of the city, even
in the future wherever I go and wherever I am," said Siegel, who
is expected to retire in six years.
</P>
<P>
He decided to stay in 1970's because he was motivated by a
"can do" spirit in Hong Kong. The city is so unique that "if it
can be done anywhere in the world, it can be done here", and the
people are vibrant, positive and hard working.
</P>
<P>
During the Sino-British negotiations in the 1980's, again, he
decided to stay on to transition. "Because I believe in the future
of Hong Kong and I have faith in the people."

<HEADLINE> German Leaders Call for New Forms of German-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Several German leaders joined a
chorus on Friday to stress the need to develop new forms of
German-U.S. relations in the post-Cold-War era.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a German-U.S. symposium titled "New Traditions" in
Berlin, German President Roman Herzog said that the German-U.S.
cooperation and friendship had helped to achieve wonders in the
past 40 years, including the end of the Cold War. Now there was a
need to bring about new wonders.
</P>
<P>
"We need more cooperation than in the past, but above all, we
need new forms of cooperation," Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the symposium, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
announced that U.S. President Bill Clinton was due to pay a visit
to Berlin this May on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the
U.S.-led 462-day airlift to the then West Berlin which was cut
from energy and food supplies from East Berlin and other
Soviet-occupied zone in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also noted that after its reunification in 1990, people
were expecting Germany to take more responsibility worldwide than
before and it was also ready to meet such expectations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel complained at
the meeting that Americans sometimes tended to underestimate the
contributions made by its European partners in the post-Cold-War
era and did not appreciate Europe's present developments in their
full dimensions.
</P>
<P>
"We Europeans want U.S. leadership, yes, but in partnership
with us," Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
A similar view was also voiced by the parliamentary group
leader of Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic Union party, Wolfgang
Schaeuble, who said that the European Union could only take bigger
political responsibility when it could participate in
decision-making along with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps to above 8,900 level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
experienced a full week of advance and culminated in a gain of
staggering 103.38 points on Friday when it closed at 8,906.43, the
first time it reached the above 8,900 level.
</P>
<P>
With today's rise, the 30 blue-chip shares soared a total of
998.18 points or 12.62 percent this year. It gained 303.91 points
or 3.5 percent this week. It took the index only one day to leap
to the current level from the above 8,800 level.
</P>
<P>
psychologically confident in sound economic fundamentals,
investors ignored either worries about inflation pressure or about
the impact of Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Among top gainers today were tobacco and energy shares, as a
local jury ruled that the tobacco industry was not liable in the
death of lung cancer of a nurse exposed to passive smoking, and
oil prices were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Most of other market indicators finished also higher with the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock list gaining 9.42 points to 1,099.16
and the New York Stock Exchange composite index up 5.23 to 572.61.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.82 to 1,789.16 amid
profit-taking in technology shares following their previous gains.
</P>
<P>
A hefty 709.75 million shares were changed hands against
Thursday's 572.61 million on the NYSE where advancing issues led
decliners 4-3 with 1,687 up, 1,261 down and 556 unchanged.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Sanctions Against Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Bill Richardson, the U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations, on Friday Defended sanctions
against libya, saying that Libya has one of the highest per capita
income in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Richardson was responding to the argument by Libya that the
five-year long sanctions on it have resulted in serious
humanitarian hardships.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the sanctions targeted to minimize their impact
on ordinary Libyans and did not affect Libya's oil exports.
</P>
<P>
"If Libya truly wants these sanctions lifted, its course of
action is clear: Surrender the two suspects so they can receive a
fair trial in the appropriate criminal court," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Friday opened a debate on the question
of Libya which was prompted by a recent ruling by the World Court
at The Hague that it had jurisdiction to hear Libyan arguments
that the 1971 Montreal civil aviation convention allows the
suspects of the Lockerbie bombing to be put on trial in Libya.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Panel Suggests US Air Force Limit B-2 Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An independent panel has
suggested that the U.S. Air Force limit its fleet of the costly
B-2 stealth bombers to the planned 21 planes, the Pentagon said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The panel, formed on orders from Congress and headed by former
Air Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch, said after a study that the
military should spend money on upgrading and extending the life of
the whole U.S. force of B-1, B-2 and B-52 bombers, rather than buy
more B-2s.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member group completed its study this week and sent
its report to the White House and Congress. The Pentagon plans to
buy 21 of the batwing, four-engine B-2s, but some lawmakers have
pressed to increase the number of the 2-billion-dollar B-2s.
</P>
<P>
As the Cold War is over, the U.S. Air Force is facing the
problem of new missions for its heavy bombers and the B-2 fleet
has been modified to carry large numbers of conventional cruise
missiles and bombs on international attack missions.
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended that 331 million U.S. dollars in extra
funds appropriated by Congress for the B-2 fleet in fiscal 1998 be
used for the planned baseline program.
</P>
<P>
The panel also recommended that the Pentagon better exploit the
potential of the current B-1, B-2 and B-52 force through more
operational attention and additional investment in support and
upgrades, the Pentagon said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Puts off Vote on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott on Friday indefinitely postponed a Senate vote on the
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which
had been scheduled sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
Lott said the NATO enlargement would move behind other more
urgent items on the agenda, adding that it might not come to a
Senate vote until after the two-week recess in April.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received cooperation on any bill that's come up
this year, and I can only do so much to try to get the Senate to
focus and complete action and if they don't I have to turn to
other emergency matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do have members on both sides of the aisle urging me to
delay it," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
"Until the Senate indicates a willingness to stay focused and
we get a little cooperation and don't have to have a filibuster
fight and cloture vote on every bill, then it will just have to
come up later," Lott said of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Lott said the Senate would move on Monday to consider an
emergency supplemental appropriation to pay for troop deployments
in Bosnia and the Gulf and for disaster relief, and would attempt
again on Tuesday to cut off debate on the education bill.
</P>
<P>
Lott's decision came as U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday made
a renewed pitch for the Senate to approve the alliance's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arranged a ceremony attended by top national security
aides, military leaders and key senators at the White House to
appeal for the approval.
</P>
<P>
"The admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will
be a very important milestone in building the kind of world we
want for the 21st century," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"A final decision is at hand," He said, stressing the vote
would be an historic affirmation of the United States' commitment
to Europe.

Lavrov made the remarks at the meeting of the Security

"The recent UN report is evidence of serious humanitarian
consequences of sanctions," he was responding to a report by an
UN mission sent to Libya to assess the humanitarian situation

</P>
<P>
He urged Council adoption of "humanitarian exemption to the

"The Security Council must give an adequate reaction to the

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers See No Evidence of Jones Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
lawyers Friday told a court that there is "not an iota of
evidence... to support" Paula Jones' sexual harassment claims,
repeating their request that the court dismiss the case set to go
on trial in late May.
</P>
<P>
"Our filing focuses on the weakness of the plaintiff's case and
her witnesses," attorney Robert Bennett told a Washington news
conference, while filing some 200 pages of legal documents
supporting his arguments in Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Bennett's new filings are a rebuttal to the 700 pages of
documents and legal arguments submitted by Jones' lawyers last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Mrs. Jones claim she was sexually harassed by
Clinton in an Arkansas hotel room in 1991 and then suffered
adversely in her state job, Bennett said, "There is not an iota of
evidence to support those claims," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Jones' claims last week that she has suffered mental
and physical anguish and sexual aversion, Bennett said that until
now she had raised "no medical bills, not even an aspirin....I
would say it was a big joke."
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he was confident that the case would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Bennett described Jones attorneys' filing last week as
"garbage" and "little more than a web of deceit and distortions."
</P>
<P>
Bennett and Jones' attorneys have been filing legal arguments
and rebuttals, as part of Clinton's motion to have the case
dismissed without trial and Jones' attempt to start the trial as
scheduled on May 27 in Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has firmly denied Jones' charge that he made a sexual
advance in 1991 when he was Arkansas governor.

WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced on Friday that the U.S. will permit a resumption of
direct humanitarian charter flights to Cuba as part of measures
easing sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The actions that the U.S. administration will take also include
bipartisan legislation to meet humanitarian food needs in Cuba,
streamline the issuance of licenses for the sale of medical
supplies and permit Cuban Americans to send remittances to their
relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"They do not reflect a change in policy towards the Cuban
government," said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
She added that economic pressure through the embargo and the
Helms-Burton Act will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.'s embargo against Cuba has lasted nearly four
decades. In 1996, the Helms-Burton Act was enacted to punish any
foreign firms doing business with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> S. African Transport Workers End Week-Long Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South African transport
workers ended their week-long strike on Friday after a compromise
over wages was reached.
</P>
<P>
The compromise over wage raise between employers and unions
was successfully brokered by the Commission for Conciliation,
Mediation and Arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Emily Fourie, spokeswoman for the Professional Transport
Workers' Union, said that the workers on strike were satisfied
with the wage increases agreed upon and would all be back at work
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreed increase were not as high as the workers would
have wanted, but in the end they were all very happy that there
had been an amicable resolution of the dispute." said Fourie.
</P>
<P>
She said that "Having lost their wages for the week they were
on strike, most of the strikers were relieved that they could now
go back to work and get on with their livings. "
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the wages for category five
workers or ultra-heavy duty drivers would get an 11.8 percent
increase, while lower level workers would receive increments of
up to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other workers such as clerks and secretaries, who previously
were not included in negotiations, would get an eight percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The five-day strike by the 40,000 workers began on Monday
after their demand for a 14-percent wage increase across the
board was rejected by the Road Freight Employers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The workers demanded a 40-Rand (one US dollar equals five
Rand) wage increase for grade one workers instead of the 35
offered by employers, and a 60-Rand increase for grades four and
five instead of 54 Rand.

<HEADLINE> High Altitude May be Harmful to Some Infants: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Some infants may be put at high
risk if they fly on aircraft or stay at high altitude because of
the reduction in oxygen supply, British researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
David Southall and colleagues at North Staffordshire Hospital
Centre, Stoke on Trent, exposed 34 infants to air containing 15
percent oxygen, six percent less than the normal supply.
</P>
<P>
They found that four of the babies suffered a severe fall in
blood oxygen level although in the other cases, blood oxygen
levels were maintained at slightly reduced rates than normal.
</P>
<P>
"Exposure to airway hypoxia (poor oxygen supply) similar to
that experienced during air travel or on holidays at high altitude
may be harmful to some infants." researchers wrote in the British
Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
The authors concluded that their findings may explain why some
infants, with reduced oxygen in their airways as a result of
respiratory infection, develop sudden or persistent falls in blood
oxygen saturation.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that their study may contribute to
understanding the relation between respiratory infection, airway
hypoxia and sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
The researchers carried out their study after two sets of
parents said they had lost their babies through cot deaths after
intercontinental flights.
</P>
<P>
One infant had died between 14 and 19 hours after a flight, and
the other between 40 and 41 hours later.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate to Ratify NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday made a renewed pitch for the Senate to approve the
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) next
year into Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
As the Senate moves to vote on the alliance's expansion next
week, Clinton arranged a ceremony attended by top national
security aides, military leaders and key senators at the White
House to appeal for the approval.
</P>
<P>
"The admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will
be a very important milestone in building the kind of world we
want for the 21st century," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"A final decision is at hand," He said, stressing the vote
would be an historic affirmation of the United States' commitment
to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We can bring Europe together not by force of arms but by
possibilities of peace," Clinton declared. "That is the promise of
this moment, and we must seize it."
</P>
<P>
Some senators are urging that the legislation include a
provision that would stop, at least temporarily, additional new
members after Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic get in.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said this would be a mistake and contrary to the
alliance's values.
</P>
<P>
"It would fracture NATO's open door consensus," Clinton said,
adding it would create a dividing line in Europe at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that the expansion of NATO will make
the alliances stronger, the America safer and Europe more stable
and united.
</P>
<P>
However, critics of the move contend an expanded NATO could
entangle the United States in a series of Bosnia-style
peacekeeping missions, poison relations with Russia and promote
instability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16-member NATO decided last July to accept
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members by 1999 and
signed accession protocols in December.
</P>
<P>
The documents have to be ratified by all the 16 parliaments and
so far only Canada, Denmark and Norway have ratified them.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Military Lashes out at Yilmaz' Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Armed Forces issued a
statement Friday, attacking Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's remarks
against the military.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after a meeting between Chief of
General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi and other armed forces leaders
to discuss the latest controversy between Yilmaz and the military
over the crack down on Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the army was unhappy with the
government's handling of the Islamic fundamentalism, which was
considered by the army as one of the worst enemies of the country.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz reportedly said that "I didn't order the army to fight
against fundamentalism. The military should tend to its own
business." The military cannot impose its will on the government,
he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The military is pressuring Yilmaz' eight-month-old government
to take harder line against Islamic radicalism.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "no matter what position or task is
represented, no one ... can display an attitude or make any
suggestion or comment that will discourage, confuse, weaken or
overshadow the determination of the Turkish Armed Forces to
struggle against separatist or fundamentalist activities that
target the country's security."
</P>
<P>
It added that the military did not constitute a threat to the
country and has not acted in any manner that would shake the
nation's confidence.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism is the
duty of everyone in this country who wants to live freely and
independently," the statement added.
