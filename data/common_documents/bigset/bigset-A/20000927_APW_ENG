<HEADLINE> FTC To Allow Boeing To Buy Hughes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission will allow Boeing
Co.'s $3.75 billion purchase of Hughes Electronics Corp.'s space
and communications division, but is requiring measures be taken to
prohibit a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Wednesday that the agreement is necessary to
prevent Boeing from potentially raising costs to other competitors
or having access to information that would reduce competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''This consent agreement will ensure that competition in the
highly specialized markets for satellites and launch vehicles will
be maintained,'' said Richard Parker, the FTC's competition bureau
director.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Boeing could no longer provide systems
engineering and technical assistance services to the Defense
Department for a classified program. The FTC said Boeing is the
sole supplier of a particular unidentified classified program and
Hughes is one of two competing contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's launch vehicle division also could not have access to
nonpublic information its satellite division receives from
competing suppliers and must ''erect firewalls'' between its
satellite and launch vehicle divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also would be required to provide satellite interface
information to all other launch vehicle suppliers. The agreement
also appoints a trustee to ensure Boeing complies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is subject to public comment until Oct. 27. The
commission then will decide whether to give final approval.

<HEADLINE> Study Probes Mental Illness  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Americans increasingly associate mental
illness with the potential for violence despite evidence the
mentally ill are not violence-prone, according to a study that
traced public perceptions over four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said their findings pose a contradiction because
they also discovered that the public has gained a deeper
understanding of the causes of mental illnesses and recognizes that
such disorders can be successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
   The perceived link between mental illness and violence could lie
in television and films that sensationalize murders committed by
mentally ill persons, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really do need to understand how the media shapes these
attitudes because there are concerns that they are having an
impact,'' said Bernice A. Pescosolido, an Indiana University
professor who co-authored the study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said previous research has shown that people with mental
illnesses are no more likely to commit violent acts than the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   The joint study by Indiana University and Columbia University
found that 12.1 percent of Americans surveyed in 1996 perceived
people with mental illnesses as ''violent, dangerous,
frightening''. That's nearly twice the 7.2 percent who expressed
such concerns in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The findings stand in contrast to the study's other conclusions
that the public has a growing understanding that genetic and
stress-related factors can cause mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   While the percentage of people who linked mental illnesses to
violence is small, the study found a growing acceptance for using
legal means to commit people with mental illnesses if they are
perceived as a threat to others. About 95 percent of respondents
supported such actions in four of five categories of possible
mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly half (48.4 percent) said they would be
unwilling to interact with a person with schizophrenia and 37.4
percent said they would avoid interacting with someone with major
depression.
</P>
<P>
   The research compared surveys taken in 1950, 1957, 1976 and
1996. The 1996 survey quizzed about 1,444 people, finding that more
than half know someone who has been hospitalized for a mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   About a third also said they once were on the verge of a nervous
breakdown or had another mental health problem.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are evidence that negative portrayals of the
mentally ill on television and in movies have played a large role
in influencing the public's view of mental illness, said Cecelia
Vergaretti, senior director of community services for the National
Mental Health Association, which represents about 350 organizations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   She said other studies have shown that the mass media tends to
characterize people with mental illnesses as ''violent or evil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the media has perpetuated this myth and this really
shows that we have our work cut out for us in combatting that
perception,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Goes to the Movies  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton had a night out at the
movies on Tuesday. But instead of fighting traffic and standing in
line, he arrived by motorcade and got a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then sat with the crowd, sipped Diet Coke and watched a
preview of ''Remember The Titans,'' the story of a racially
integrated high school football team that won the Virginia state
championship in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only wish we could learn again the things that these men
learned everyday from each other,'' Clinton told the crowd outside
the Uptown Theater afterward seeing the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens nationally on Friday, tells the story of
the 1971 championship season of the football team at T.C. Williams
High School in Alexandria, Va., a suburb of Washington. The team,
which was known as the Titans, was one of the few racially mixed
teams in the state. Its head coach was black and his assistant was
white.
</P>
<P>
   ''They won a victory of the human heart,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had visited the high school twice during his
presidency and noted it is the nation's most religiously and
ethnically diverse school. He said there are students from more
than 80 countries who speak 50 languages.
</P>
<P>
   He added that stories like those in the film inspire him to try
to end fighting throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which stars Denzel Washington, depicted a season in
which the team won the state championship after an undefeated
season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington attended the premiere and said the film is ''about
these young men who came together at this very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen members of the team attended the showing and
presented Clinton with a team jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Boone, who coached the team and was portrayed by
Washington, was at the preview as was Bill Yoast, his assistant.
Will Patton, who portrayed Yoast, was also there but did not speak.

<HEADLINE> Man Extradited And Held Without Bail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The first person to be brought to the United
States from Colombia to face murder charges since the Colombian
government permitted U.S. extraditions was ordered held without
bail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Baez is charged in a federal indictment with
racketeering, murder and robbery, among other charges.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of murdering retired New York City police
Detective Donald Pagani during an August 1999 robbery of a meat
company. Baez was charged along with seven others with
participating in a racketeering organization that conspired to
commit armed robbery, murder and issue threats of violence as it
stole jewelry, money and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Rice Jr., the agent in charge of the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration's New York office, said Baez's
extradition sends a ''clear and strong message that individuals
involved in violence and narcotics trafficking cannot hide behind
political boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in New York on Monday, after being held in Colombia
since December, when he was arrested at the request of the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government amended its constitution in December
1997 to allow extradition to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Russia 3, Cuba 2  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A sensational comeback by the Cubans
was undone by one of the mental mistakes for which they have become
known.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Dennis, the most talented hitter on a team loaded with
fine athletes, sent his jump serve straight into the net, giving
Russia a dramatic 21-25, 25-23, 25-19, 19-25, 15-13 victory
Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT) and a spot in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will play the Brazil-Argentina winner in Friday's first
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   In the other quarterfinals, underdog Australia played tournament
favorite Italy, and defending Olympic champion the Netherlands took
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had an 8-3 lead in the fifth game, with the winner
needing to reach 15 points and win by two. Cuba came back to take
an 11-10 lead with strong blocking, and after Russia surged ahead
14-11, the Cubans rallied once more to get within 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   The drama ended quickly, however, as Dennis hit the ball off the
lower part of his palm and into the midsection of the net. He sank
to his knees, his head in his hands. Teammate Alan Roca helped him
up and took him toward the net for the congratulatory handshaking
with the Russians, but Dennis was inconsolable, keeping his hands
to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Burly, bearded Russian coach Genadi Chipolin, meanwhile, leaped
out of his chair and rolled around on the floor as his players
raised their arms in victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, led by Dennis and brothers Osvaldo and Ihosvany
Hernandez, played the most breathtaking volleyball of the
tournament, but their errors -- whether it was hitting, serving or
blocking -- cost them. They were swept by the Netherlands and
Brazil, and only made the quarterfinals because Spain and Egypt
were so weak in their group.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's last Olympic medal was a bronze in 1976, and now the best
it can do is fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which won six straight medals, including three golds,
between 1964 and 1988, is trying to return to prominence after a
seventh-place finish in Barcelona and a fourth-place showing in
Atlanta.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Martin Rucinsky had two goals to help
the Montreal Canadiens to their first preseason win, 4-2 over the
Calgary Flames on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Rucinsky's goals, his first two of the preseason, came
in Montreal's three-goal second period on perfectly placed shots
against Calgary goalie Fred Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   Rucinsky put the Canadiens ahead 2-0 at 9:51 by firing a shot
from the high slot off the inside of the left post.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute of the period, Rucinsky snapped a shot that
glanced in off the other post for a shorthanded goal.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ward and rookie defenseman Stephane Robidas also scored
for Montreal (1-3-1), which was playing the first of five games in
six nights.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Oleg Saprykin and Jarome Iginla had a goal and an assist
each for the Flames (3-2-0). Saprykin and Iginla share the team
lead with four preseason goals each.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal squandered three two-man advantages en route to a
1-for-9 night on the power play. Calgary was 0-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling in his first few appearances, Canadiens goalie
Jeff Hackett was much sharper in finishing with 26 saves. Hackett
was especially sharp in the first period, making 11 saves,
including successive stops late in the period against Rico Fata,
Marty Murray and Iginla.

<HEADLINE> 28 Killed In Greece Ferry Sinking  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek ferry carrying 511 passengers and
crew sank after hitting a reef near the Aegean Sea island of Paros,
coast guard officials said. At least 28 people on board were killed
and about 50 were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after
hearing news of the sinking, the coast guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry boat Express Samina sank after hitting a reef late
Tuesday in rough seas about two miles off the popular resort
island, officials said. Survivors said panicked passengers started
jumping overboard when the ship listed and began sinking after
striking the rocky outcrop.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ship fell apart as it sank. There were people hanging from
the railings. Children were crying and old people were screaming,''
said survivor Zoe Kolida. ''I jumped in and looked back after about
50 meters (yards) and the ship was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of fishing boats and other vessels rushed to the scene
and helped in the evacuation. Greek air force planes dropped flares
to aid the rescue operations, hampered by a fresh gale with winds
blowing up to 46 miles per hour. British naval vessels on an
exercise near the scene rescued at least 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sea state is quite rough. They are continuing to search
the cliffs and the sea,'' said a British Ministry of Defense
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Coast guard chief Andreas Sirigos said 28 people were confirmed
dead. He said 430 people from the ship had been accounted for at
the island's health center. He appealed for any survivors staying
at hotels or private home to register at the health center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem we have is with residents of Paros who may have
gone home and have not reported in. We are also going from hotel to
hotel and room to room,'' Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry makes regularly scheduled runs from the Athens port of
Piraeus to the island of Samos. It was about to make a stop on
Paros, 103 miles southeast of Athens, when it hit the reef.
</P>
<P>
   According to Minoan Flying Dolphins, the Express Samina's owner,
there were 447 passengers and 64 crew members aboard the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers and crew aboard said the Express Samina sank within
45 minutes after hitting Portes reef. Coast guard officials said
they could not explain why the ship hit the reef, which is marked
on maritime charts and has a navigation light.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be blind not to see it,'' Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   He added the coast guard was also investigating why it took the
crew nearly 20 minutes to inform the coast guard that the ship was
sinking. A crew member interviewed by telephone said there was an
orderly evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was time enough for all of us to get out, including the
people in the cabins. We got them all out,'' Stephanos
Papadopoulos, a ship's officer, told Athens' Antenna television.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, Andreas Spanos, said people panicked and ran
to the back of the ship ''where they were jumping in. I also jumped
and was picked up by a fishing boat.''

<HEADLINE> South Korea 3, Japan 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- South Korea's version of Mark McGwire
led his country to the baseball bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Seung-yuop doubled home a pair of runs with two outs in the
eighth inning Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT), sending the Koreans to
a 3-1 victory over Japan and their first medal in Olympic baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a 6-foot, 187-pound first baseman, set South Korea's
single-season home run record last year by hitting 54. His double
off tough-luck pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka became the biggest hit in
his country's meager Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea failed to qualify for the tournament in Barcelona
and finished last in the eight-team field in Atlanta. The Koreans
shut down their major leagues so they could field a better team in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. They not only won their first medal, they also beat
rival Japan twice -- once in the preliminaries, then again with the
bronze on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Japan went home without a medal for the first time. It won the
bronze in Barcelona -- the first official medal baseball tournament
-- and lost to Cuba in the gold-medal game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese sent four pitchers and four position players from
their major leagues to the Olympics, but lost two extra-inning
games in the preliminaries and were shut out by Cuba in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans had to play the consolation game a few hours after
losing to the United States 3-2 in the semifinals. That game ended
after midnight local time on Doug Mientkiewicz's ninth-inning
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours later, the Koreans were back on the field, locked
in a game dominated by the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuzaka, the Rookie of the Year in Japan last season, struck
out 10 through seven scoreless innings before an error led to his
undoing in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   A single, a throwing error by second baseman Jun Heima and a
steal left runners at second and third with two outs. Lee took
Matsuzaka to a full count before lining a double to the gap in
left-center. Kim Dong-joo followed with another double for a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was sadly familiar for Matsuzaka, who pitched well against
both the United States and South Korea in the preliminaries without
getting a decision. He was on the bench in both games when his
bullpen gave up the winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   Koo Dae-sung, a hard-throwing left-hander for the Kanwha Eagles
who has attracted the interest of several major league teams, gave
up one run on five hits and struck out 11 in a complete game. He
gave up Yukio Tanaka's one-out RBI single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans mobbed Koo on the mound in celebration after he
induced a forceout to end the game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks won't be going back to
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The defending NL West champions were eliminated from playoff
contention Tuesday night as Todd Helton and Todd Hollandsworth hit
two-run homers to lead the Colorado Rockies to a 7-6 win Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing season might cost manager Buck Showalter his
job. Showalter took the expansion team to the playoffs in its
second year before faltering in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo went 4-for-5 for the Rockies who won for the third
time in 11 games. Former Diamondback Bobby Chouinard (2-2) worked
one inning for the win and Jose Jimenez got five outs 22nd save in
28.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies broke a 6-all tie in the seventh inning. Terry
Shumpert hit a leadoff double against Mike Morgan (5-5). After a
sacrifice by Brent Mayne, Juan Pierre hit an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista homered and drove in three runs and Matt Williams
homered and drove in two runs for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Williams gave Arizona a 2-0 led in the first inning against
Kevin Jarvis with his 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado chased Byung-Hyun Kim with a four-run third inning as
Helton and Hollandsworth hit two-run home runs. Kim made his first
career start after 84 relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Helton hit the facing of the upper deck for his 39th homer, and
two batters later, Hollandsworth connected with a high, looping
drive into the first deck in right.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks tied it at 4 in the fifth inning. Pinch-hitter
Rob Ryan walked with one out and moved to third on Craig Counsell
single to right. Helton dropped the relay throw to first on
Bautista's double play grounder allowing Ryan to score. Luis
Gonzalez added an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies took a 6-4 lead in the sixth inning off Greg
Swindell. Jeff Frye doubled, moved to third on a sacrifice and
scored when Counsell booted Neifi Perez's grounder to shortstop for
an error. Cirillo followed with an RBI single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista tied it at 6 in the seventh with a two-run homer off
Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Diamondbacks INF Tony Womack underwent successful surgery
Tuesday to remove a cyst discovered behind his left knee. ...
Gonzalez is one of three NL players to have play in every game this
year. Gonzalez had his career-high and franchise-high 45th double.
... RHP Pedro Astacio will have minor surgery on his left knee on
Oct. 9 in Vail, Colo. ... Colorado has an NL-record 75 sacrifice
flies, one better than the 1977 Philadelphia Phillies. ... Jarvis
had his consecutive batters retired streak ended at 19 by
Bautista's first-inning single, two short of the Colorado club
record of 21 set by Darren Holmes in 1996. ... Helton drew his 98th
and 99th walk of the year to tie Walt Weiss' club record of 99 set
in 1995. ... Helton has 100 extra base hits, one more than Larry
Walker had in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Pierce Improves, Celtics Moves On  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Paul Pierce, the Boston Celtics' most complete
player, is getting better after undergoing surgery for stab wounds.
But what about his team?
</P>
<P>
   The once dominant club, already deficient in many areas, begins
training camp next Monday with even more questions than coach Rick
Pitino faced before Pierce was wounded in a downtown nightclub
early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His condition was upgraded Tuesday from fair to good following
surgery Monday to repair his damaged lung, according to officials
at the New England Medical Center. They said stab wounds to
Pierce's face, neck and back were superficial.
</P>
<P>
   WHDH-TV in Boston reported early Wednesday that arrest warrants
had been issued, but had not yet been served. The station did not
identify who was targeted in the arrest warrants. Boston police
would not confirm or deny the report.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was drafted out of Kansas in 1998 with the 10th pick,
much later than expected. In his second NBA season, he was second
on the Celtics in scoring with 19.5 points per game. He played
forward and guard, and was a favorite of fans who made the other
half of Boston's Big Two -- Antoine Walker -- a target for their
boos.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge blow for the Celtics,'' Cedric Maxwell, a
former Celtics player and now a team broadcaster, said Tuesday.
''There's a lot of apathy about the Celtics. Paul Pierce was one
bright spot that you looked at, that people really loved about the
Celtics. That energy, right now, is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans remember the Celtics' 16 NBA titles, but others recall
the 14 seasons that have passed without one and expected Walker and
Pierce to help break that streak. For now, the burden falls on
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Len Bias and Reggie Lewis were to be the cornerstones of the
team after the Larry Bird era ended. But Bias died of a cocaine
overdose after being drafted in the first round in 1986, and Lewis
collapsed and died of a heart ailment in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Seven more years have passed -- the Celtics have had losing
records in all of them -- and Pierce apparently will play again.
Even with him, the Celtics seemed headed for their sixth straight
non-playoff season.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has said he may step down if the Celtics aren't
successful next season, his fourth with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''How does this affect his decision-making because now, to me,
he's with half his team,'' Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 6-foot-7, 220-pound Pierce is lucky he wasn't hurt
more seriously, the timing of his return is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Celtics have center Vitaly Potapenko, forwards
Walker, Tony Battie, Adrian Griffin, Eric Williams and rookie draft
choice Jerome Moiso, and guards Kenny Anderson, Robert Pack, Randy
Brown, Chris Carr and Calbert Cheaney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, Antoine's going to be looked upon to take more of a
scoring burden,'' Maxwell said. ''How will the fans react to
Antoine?''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell expects Pierce to heal physically. But Pierce's
emotional recovery could take longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing that people aren't looking at is how he will
react when he comes back. Will he be looking over his shoulder?''
Maxwell said. ''You have to remember (tennis player) Monica Seles.
She was attacked when she was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her assailant was captured and it took her a while to overcome
psychological scars and return to tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suppose you don't catch this guy'' who stabbed Pierce, Maxwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokeswoman said people connected to the rap group Made
Men were being investigated, but no motive was given. The group
denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's family issued a statement, saying, ''Paul is in good
spirits and is looking forward to putting this ordeal behind him
and returning to what he does best -- playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Maxwell said, is important to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all still caught up in, 'he was, he was.' He will be
again,'' Maxwell said. ''It's up to this team to hold on. I think
it's going to be very difficult.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Croatia overcame the flu bug and Dutch
swim star Inge de Bruijn to defeat the Netherlands 11-7 in Olympic
men's water polo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatians were without finger-wagging starting goalie Sinisa
Skolnekov and defender Samir Barac because of high temperatures
that have hit the team. And triple gold medalist de Bruijn stopped
in at Ryde Aquatic Leisure Center to inspire her countrymen, who
needed a victory to have any hope of reaching the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't matter for Croatia, which got three goals from
Dubravko Simenc and two apiece from Mile Smodlaka and Igor Hinic.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, 4-0-1, finishes tied with Yugoslavia in Group B. But
the Yugoslavs will head to the quarterfinals as the top seed from
the group based on goal differential.
</P>
<P>
   Harry van der Meer had five goals for the Netherlands, 1-4-0,
which will compete for 9th through 12th places this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Hinic and Vjekoslav Kobescak scored three minutes apart in the
second quarter as Croatia broke away from a 2-all tie. Not even de
Bruijn's cheering could help the Dutch, who are looking to improve
on their 10th place finish in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, which won a silver medal four years ago, enters the
final eight as one of the favorites.

<HEADLINE> 2 arrested at Shea after beer bottle thrown at Rocker  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A 22-year-old man was charged Tuesday night with
throwing a beer bottle that landed near Atlanta Braves relief
pitcher John Rocker on the mound at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested in the fracas was the fan's friend Brian Peterson,
22, who pleaded guilty in 1998 to manslaughter, along with his
girlfriend, in the death of their newborn son at a motel room in
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, vilified by New Yorkers after disparaging them in a
magazine article last year, was loudly booed when he sprinted out
of the Braves bullpen in the eighth inning to face the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to warm up, a beer bottle came flying out of the
first-base box seats and hit about 10 feet from Rocker. Within a
minute, police were leading a man out of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox picked up the bottle and carried it
toward the dugout, discarding it before he reached the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything to say,'' Rocker said after the Braves
beat the Mets 7-1 to clinch the National League East championship.
</P>
<P>
   The man accused of throwing the beer bottle, Raymond Maniaci, of
Wyckoff, N.J., was charged with reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, also of Wyckoff, was charged with obstructing
governmental administration and disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets confirmed that Peterson is the same man involved in the
infant death in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Peterson and his child's mother, Amy Grossberg, pleaded
guilty after the November 1996 death of their newborn son in
Newark, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was given a two-year sentence, six months shorter than
Grossberg's, after he agreed to testify against her. Peterson was
released from prison after serving 1&AMP;frac12; years, and Grossberg was
released eight months early.

<HEADLINE> Condemned Killer Heads To Execution  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Spared earlier this year in an
unprecedented action by Gov. George. W. Bush, condemned killer
Ricky McGinn was not expecting another reprieve to keep him from
the Texas death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready to go,'' McGinn said in death row interview. ''I
guess I'm just tired.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinn, 43, was set for lethal injection Wednesday for raping
and bludgeoning with an ax his 12-year-old stepdaughter more than
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An execution date set for earlier this year was postponed after
some of his paperwork was lost when a tornado struck his attorney's
Fort Worth office.
</P>
<P>
   Then on June 1, only moments before he could have been put to
death, Bush for the first time used his gubernatorial authority to
issue a one-time, 30-day reprieve for McGinn so additional DNA
tests could be run on evidence in his case.
</P>
<P>
   When the test results completed in August again linked McGinn to
the crime, the execution was reset for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of living the way I'm living,'' McGinn said. ''Any
way I leave here, I'm going to be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reprieve, in the midst of his bid for the Republican
presidential nomination, was viewed as an example of his
compassionate conservatism, a favorite campaign theme. McGinne said
he appreciated the reprieve but accused the governor of using his
case for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   The new DNA tests on crime scene evidence supported Brown County
authorities who said McGinn killed Stephanie Flanary on May 22,
1993, and dumped her body in a culvert where it was found three
days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly it helps to have that reconfirmed in even stronger
terms,'' said Brown County District Attorney Lee Haney, who
prosecuted McGinn. ''I think everyone involved in the case right
now is just looking for a sense of closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the test results, McGinn continued to deny any
involvement in the girl's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still want the world to know I'm not guilty,'' he said.
''Somebody else put that there. I know they did it and they know
they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haney said McGinn's contentions that evidence was planted or
tampered with were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''He already had that claim lined up before this all started,''
Haney said.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's wife had left her daughter in his care while she left
for the day. McGinn said the girl got sick after they drank beer
together and dozed off, then went for a walk after waking up. She
never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Blood evidence tied him to her rape and slaying. A jury also
heard from three other sexual assault victims, including one who
said she was attacked by him when she was a pre-schooler.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn would be the 33rd convicted killer to receive lethal
injection in Texas this year.

<HEADLINE> Parents To Fight Standardized Tests  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Hundreds of Ohio parents hold rallies to
denounce standardized tests. In Virginia, a mother of five drives
six hours several days a week to lobby for revised academic
standards. A Nevada mother with similar concerns runs for the state
school board.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, parents who oppose the way standardized
tests are used have mobilized in at least 36 states. Twenty states
now have exams that high school students must pass to graduate, and
all states except Iowa and Nebraska test children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue is striking very close to home because parents are
seeing the impact of these tests in their living and breathing
kids,'' said Karen Hartke, a project director with the National
Center for Fair &AMP; Open Testing in Cambridge, Mass. ''They're so
passionate about this issue that they have created a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the exams place too much stress on
children, miscalculate their abilities, limit what they are taught,
and weigh too much in determining whether they are held back.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the tests ensure solid education by holding
schools and students accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ''For decades, we've graduated students without the skills they
need, and swept the problem under the rug,'' said William Guenther,
president of Mass Insight Education, a Boston-based organization
that works to improve student achievement in Massachusetts' public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that standardized tests in core subjects can focus
attention on areas where students aren't proficient to ensure they
get the help needed to learn basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Parents across Ohio argued Tuesday at more than 30 public forums
that proficiency tests are hurting and not helping schoolchildren.
The Ohio Education Association, the state's largest teacher union,
sponsored the events.
</P>
<P>
   Several Ohio lawmakers in the past six months have proposed
changing one or more of the four tests students must take in the
fourth, sixth, ninth and 12th grades. Gov. Bob Taft this summer
formed a commission to examine the testing system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're (lawmakers) feeling the pressure mainly
because of the parents,'' said Charles Johnson, a Columbus father
of three who founded Parents Against Unfair Testing. ''They
probably thought that we were just going to roll over and not get
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by the commission found that 62 percent of
Ohioans supported a law taking effect in 2001 that will require
students to repeat a year if they fail the reading portion of the
fourth-grade proficiency test. The poll questioned 1,002 people;
its margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   To become more knowledgeable about standardized tests, parents
have been reading education journals, talking to teaching experts,
joining Internet networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're much more dangerous than we used to be,'' said Julie
Woestehoff, a member of Parents United for Responsible Education,
which has worked to reform education in Chicago since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to address what I call bread-and-butter issues ...
things that are really easily grasped by parents,'' she said. But
the group switched its focus as controversy swelled over the local
use of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, vocal parents got lawmakers to scale back plans
for a high school exit exam that would have been the sole criterion
for graduation. Beginning in 2002, the exam will be one of several
factors in determining whether a student graduates.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, Mickey VanDerwerker and other parents in a
learning-standards reform group spend several days each week
lobbying politicians in Richmond, a three-hour drive from
VanDerwerker's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's imperative we speak with one voice to make changes
happen,'' VanDerwerker said. ''This is a political problem that
requires political solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Trusty-Murphy, of Carson Valley, Nev., tried a
different tactic to catch policy-makers' attention: She sought to
become one.
</P>
<P>
   The member of Nevada's Citizens Against Standardized Testing
Abuse ran for a state school board position. Although she lost,
Trusty-Murphy said the 4,600 votes she received encourages her to
run for the Legislature next year and shows ''there's a lot of
people thinking my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartke, of The National Center for Fair &AMP; Open Testing, says the
nation is seeing only the beginning of the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day we get calls from concerned parents,'' Hartke said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Falls Short Of Yugoslavia Goal  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration line for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic is that he should be ''out of power, out of
Serbia and in The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good sound bite but administration officials privately
acknowledge that the goal of dispatching Milosevic to The Hague for
trial on war crimes charges has always been a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic hope for the administration over the short term
is that Milosevic will emerge from the current electoral process
either severely weakened or driven from office altogether by
disaffected voters.
</P>
<P>
   It would be icing on the cake if he were to suffer the added
humiliation of being hauled before the court, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, officials say, is that any attempt to arrest the
Yugoslav leader would be tantamount to a suicide mission, given the
size of his security detail.
</P>
<P>
   He is among dozens of Serbs, Croats and Muslims who have been
indicted but who have yet to be taken into custody by the court,
officially known as the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much hope that Milosevic will be bundled off to The
Hague even if his main opponent in last Sunday's presidential
elections, Vojislav Kostunica, eventually assumes office. He first
must win an Oct. 8 runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has derided the Hague tribunal, calling it ''a
political institution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not even international ... it's an American tool for
exerting pressure, and it even makes and changes its own rules
during trials, which is legally unthinkable,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal handed down indictments against Milosevic and four
top aides two months after the U.S.-led NATO air war over
Yugoslavia began in March 1999. It was the first time an
international court has charged a sitting head of state with war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said there was a credible basis to believe that
the five were ''criminally responsible'' for the deportation of
740,000 Kosovo Albanians and for the murder of 340.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's sharp criticism of the tribunal made him a difficult
target for Milosevic during the campaign. The opposition leader
also defended the performance of the Yugoslav Army during the
Kosovo strife last year and was strident in his denunciations of
the 11-week NATO air war. In his race against Milosevic, he steered
clear of American officials, mindful that anti-Milosevic
nationalists might be offended.
</P>
<P>
   His tactics proved to be good politics. Milosevic appears to be
weaker now than at any time since assuming power more than a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration believes vote count manipulations by
Yugoslav officials deprived Kostunica of a first round, absolute
majority, victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While showing hostility toward the West, Kostunica would be a
far different president than Milosevic, U.S. officials believe.
They say he could be counted on to rule democratically and to
refrain from stirring up ethnic hatreds -- all in sharp contrast to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration still insists that Milosevic be delivered to
The Hague, but it has been less vocal about the issue lately.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been focusing on the
Yugoslav election campaign -- and the prospect that Milosevic will
emerge from the process totally discredited by his own
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told a Senate committee Tuesday that the authorities in
Belgrade ''have used every trick in the book to prevent a fair
campaign, rig the election and distort the results. In so doing,
they have fooled no one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly now, Milosevic is a figure of the past. For too long,
his lawlessness has weakened Yugoslavia; his cronies have robbed
Yugoslavia; and his mismanagement has all but bankrupted
Yugoslavia.''

28 Killed In Greece Ferry Sinking
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek ferry carrying 511 passengers and crew sank
after hitting a reef near the Aegean Sea island of Paros, coast guard officials
said. At least 28 people on board were killed and about 50 were unaccounted for.
A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after hearing news of the
sinking, the coast guard said. The ferry boat Express Samina sank after hitting
a reef late Tuesday in rough seas about two miles off the popular resort island,
officials said. Survivors said panicked passengers started jumping overboard
when the ship listed and began sinking after striking the rocky outcrop.

International Monetary Fund. More delegates peered out of windows to catch a
glimpse of the chaos out in the streets than sat in the cavernous convention
hall by the end of Tuesday. Manuel was just one of the agency's top officials

Milosevic Calls For Runoff Vote

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic conceded Tuesday that his

runoff -- defying demands at home and abroad that he step down. Opposition
candidate Vojislav Kostunica rejected an Oct. 8 runoff, calling it a ''fraud''
and insisting that he won Sunday's election outright. The opposition called for
a rally Wednesday night in downtown Belgrade to ''celebrate its victory'' --
apparently hoping for a show of strength to demonstrate to Milosevic the
public's refusal of a runoff.

Olympic gold medal. The victory extended Williams' winning streak to 32 matches,
and she became only the second player to win Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the
Olympics in the same year. Steffi Graf accomplished the feat in 1988. After
completing her latest victory in 58 minutes, Williams waved to the crowd, bowed

ninth straight division title, beating the New York Mets 7-1 tonight behind John
Burkett's pitching and Chipper Jones' home run. With John Rocker back at Shea
Stadium -- and dodging a beer bottle on the mound -- Atlanta prevented the Mets
from wrapping up the wild card spot. New York would be assured of that berth,
however, if both Arizona and Los Angeles lost later in the evening.

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tim Hudson retired 15 straight hitters
and won his 19th game as the Oakland Athletics stayed 1&AMP;frac12; games
ahead of Cleveland for the AL wild card spot with a 10-3 victory
over the Anaheim Angels on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland also stayed a half-game behind Seattle, which beat Texas
5-0, in the AL West. Despite winning 18 of 23, the Athletics
(87-69) can't shake the Indians (86-71), who beat Minnesota 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (19-6) shook off a rough first inning to improve his
majors-best winning percentage with his sixth straight victory.
After the Angels scored twice in the first, Hudson didn't allow
another baserunner until walking Mo Vaughn in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But after pitching out of a sixth-inning jam, Hudson cruised to
victory, allowing two runs, five hits and one walk in eight
innings. Oakland's small but vocal crowd gave him a standing
ovation after each of his last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson will get a shot at his first 20-win season Sunday against
Texas -- but only if the A's haven't clinched a playoff spot. If
Oakland is already headed to the postseason, manager Art Howe will
save his ace for the playoff opener Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer and Jason Giambi added a
three-run shot, his 41st, in the eighth for Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The A's scored five runs on two hits and five walks in a
disastrous first inning for Angels starter Scott Schoeneweis
(7-10), who lost for the third time in four starts as Anaheim was
officially eliminated from the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis actually got two outs before walking two batters,
allowing Tejada's RBI single and then walking three more as
Oakland's fans laughed and cheered. Ramon Martinez singled home two
more runs to give the A's a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada added a two-run homer in the second to chase Schoeneweis,
who made his shortest start of the season. He lasted just 2 2-3
innings in his previous start at Kansas City on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro and Garret Anderson drove in runs for the
Angels in the first. Lou Pote struck out a career-high six batters
in three innings of sharp long relief for Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Oakland OF Terrence Long made a nifty diving catch of Adam
Kennedy's drive to center field in the fifth inning. ... RHP Mark
Mulder, who won't pitch again in the regular season because of a
slipped disc in his back, has been cleared to begin throwing again.
Mulder, who is 9-10 with a 5.44 ERA in 27 starts, was injured Sept.
12. ... The Athletics broke their year-old franchise record for
runs. Oakland has 902 runs this season, breaking the mark of 893
set in 1999. ... DH Olmedo Saenz returned to the Athletics'
starting lineup for the first time since July 31, when he pulled a
hamstring. Saenz walked twice and scored two runs before Matt
Stairs pinch-hit for him in the fourth.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Aaron Sele is leading the Seattle Mariners when
they need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Sele pitched a six-hitter to win his fourth straight September
start, and the Mariners held on to first place in the AL West by
beating the Texas Rangers 5-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (88-69), which remained a half-game ahead of Oakland in
the AL West, won its second straight following losses in the first
three games of a four-game series against the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (17-10) struck four and walked three in his second shutout
of the season, the sixth of his career. He has a 2.55 ERA in
September after going 1-4 with a 7.03 ERA in August.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has turned around, too, going 16-8 in September
following an 11-17 record in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a 3-0 lead in the third off Ryan Glynn (5-6)
on Rickey Henderson's RBI single, which stopped an 0-for-18 slide,
and Mike Cameron's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle made it 5-0 in the fifth on Joe Oliver's homer and Edgar
Martinez's run-scoring double, which gave him 140 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez ended an 0-for-18 slump with a seventh-inning
triple off Francisco Cordero in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn gave up five runs, eight hits and three walks in 4 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RHP Freddy Garcia is to start for the Mariners against the
Rangers Wednesday night in place of LHP Jamie Moyer, who will start
Thursday. RHP Paul Abbott is to start Friday night at Anaheim in
the opener of the Mariners' final series of the regular season. ...
Sele shut out Detroit in April with a three-hitter. ... The
Mariners got their 10th shutout of the season and third of the
month. ... Texas was shut out for the fifth time. ... Oliver was
4-for-5 with two homers and five RBIs against Glynn this season. He
had a grand slam against Glynn at Safeco Field in July 22. ...
Martinez tied Ken Griffey Jr.'s team record for games at 1,535.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Andy Benes won for the first time in more than
two months and Edgar Renteria drove in three runs, leading the St.
Louis Cardinals to a 7-1 victory over the San Diego Padres on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals remained two games behind Atlanta in the race for
the National League's best record and home field advantage
throughout the playoffs. Each team has five games left.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis won for just the second time in five games since
clinching the NL Central Division title on Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Benes (11-9), who won for the first time since July 13, allowed
one run and five hits in six innings. He had lost his last six
decisions, but was only making his second start since coming off
the disabled list on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria doubled in a run as the Cardinals took a 2-0 lead in
the second, and added a two-run double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds hit a two-run homer in the third inning off Adam
Eaton (6-4) to increase St. Louis' lead to 4-0. Edmonds'
career-high 42nd home run followed a leadoff walk to J.D. Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton lasted only five innings as he gave up four runs and eight
hits. The Cardinals' leadoff hitter reached safely in each inning
off Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire pinch hit in the eighth inning and was hit by a
Heathcliff Slocumb pitch. The Padres hit three St. Louis batters.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Tatis singled to open the second, and after a walk to
Ray Lankford, scored on Renteria's double. Former Padre Carlos
Hernandez ground out to drive in another run for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Desi Relaford cut the lead to 4-1 in the sixth when he singled
in Ruben Rivera, who doubled leading off the inning. But the
Cardinals scored three runs in the eighth on back-to-back doubles
by Renteria and Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Benes is 7-2 in 13 games against San Diego, including a
five-game winning streak. ... Padres LF Eric Owens left the game in
the sixth inning after apparently spraining his left ankle during
an at-bat in the third. Owens fell down while swinging and hobbled
around on his ankle, but stayed in the game. ... Edmonds has driven
in 15 runs in his last 16 games. ... Hernandez, a fan favorite in
his three years with the Padres, got a huge ovation in his first
at-bat in San Diego since being traded to the Cardinals on July 31.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Study Athletic Limits  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprinters faster than a thoroughbred horse. Female swimmers with
the shoulders and swagger of linebackers. Weightlifters generating
enough energy in a single clean and jerk to illuminate your house --
and your neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   World records are falling in bunches at the Sydney 2000 Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes' performances are the product of superb genes, hard
work and, increasingly, science.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, scientists -- physiologists, kinesiologists,
nutritionists, biomechanists, even physicists -- began applying
their knowledge to athletes. As a result, practicing a sport for
hours is no longer enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   In the lungs of cyclists, they measure the maximum oxygen intake
in milliliters per kilogram of weight per minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the fast-twitch muscle cells of a rower, they determine the
use of energy-producing adenosine triphosphate and the buildup of
fatigue-inducing lactic acid.
</P>
<P>
   Using computers, videotape and sensors, they streamline the
trajectory of a weightlifter's hoist, or a gymnast's vault.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with more than 1,000 hours of intensive training a
year, how much might science improve an Olympian's peak
performance?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's often the difference between a gold medal and a silver.
For now.
</P>
<P>
   But are we reaching the upper limits of athletic performance?
Are the world's top athletes, in the words of British biochemist
Guy C. Brown, ''doomed to battle ... over ever-diminishing
fractions of seconds and centimeters?''
</P>
<P>
   Or can more science help Olympic athletes improve significantly?
</P>
<P>
   Both, Brown says. In a study published in the journal The
Sciences, Brown reports athletes' performances have improved
steadily since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the record time in the men's 1500-meter run has
improved by about 10 seconds every quarter-century. Men
historically have outperformed women in most events, but the gap is
narrowing. In a 1992 UCLA study, scientists predicted the women
would outrun men, especially in endurance races such as the
marathon, by 2035.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, the editors of The Sciences predict, women will run the
10,000-meter run a full minute faster than men.
</P>
<P>
   But humans may soon reach the limits of physical fitness, Brown
argues.
</P>
<P>
   The overall limiting factor for athletes is the heart's ability
to pump more freshly oxygenated blood through miles of blood
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it could push more blood through the body, an athlete could
run, swim, row or ride a bicycle faster than usual,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says athletic improvements in the 21st century probably
will depend on scientific and technological gains.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, better equipment, surgical enhancements such as more
flexible tendons, even genetic engineering for faster-acting
muscles, higher oxygen absorption and faster blood circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Future limits to athletic performance will be determined less
by the innate physiology of the athlete,'' Brown said, ''than by
technological advances and the evolving judgment on where to draw
the line between what is 'natural' and what is artificially
enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, there are no clear answers to the performance questions
Brown raises. Too many athletes. Too much history. Too many
complicating factors.
</P>
<P>
   At Sydney, scientists are keenly watching the women's pole
vaulting, which debuted this year. Stacy Dragila won the gold
medal, but she failed to equal her world record of 15 feet 2.25
inches. Few researchers and coaches believe it will remain there as
faster, stronger women compete.
</P>
<P>
   ''The women's record is likely to improve quite a bit,'' said
University of Texas physicist Cliff Froelich.
</P>
<P>
   Pole vaulting, he explains, is an example of energy
conservation. The athlete's kinetic energy, or motion, is
translated through the flexible fiberglass pole into the potential
energy of the jump height.
</P>
<P>
   His prediction: 17.5 feet. That would more than two feet above
the current record, or an astonishing 15 percent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Nielson, Dragila's coach at Idaho State, also expects
above-17-foot vaults, though he is among experts who doubt women's
vaults will exceed the men's record of 20 feet 1.75 inches. Physics
favor the men, who are stronger and generally taller.
</P>
<P>
   Records are falling at Sydney's Aquatic Center, too. The men's
surge has been led by Australian sensation Ian Thorpe, the
''Thorpedo'' whose feet (size 18) exceed his age (17). He won three
gold medals and a silver before the first week was over, and set
two world records.
</P>
<P>
   Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands became the first
man to crack the 48-second barrier in the 100-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists aren't particularly impressed by the men.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mens' records are falling by a whisker,'' said
physiologist Joel Stager of Indiana University. ''They are swimming
exactly as predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   And the women?
</P>
<P>
   ''The women are completely different,'' Stager said. ''It is
almost alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's performances in the pool defy biochemist Brown's
assertion that athletes' margins of victory are narrowing as their
conditioning peaks.
</P>
<P>
   No woman swam faster than Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands. She
set world records in the 100-meter freestyle and butterfly and the
50-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone asked me what my limits are,'' De Bruijn said. ''I
don't know. But the year 2000 is definitely my year.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, consider Misty Dawn Hyman in the women's 200-meter
butterfly. The Arizona native swam a full three seconds faster than
her previous best time to win gold.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists say the proof of phenomenal performance lies with
the losers. The key measurement is ''field time'' -- the average
time of all the competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In six of of the first eight women's swimming events, Stager
says, the average time of the finalists was significantly faster
than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 200-meter butterfly, Stager had predicted an
average field time of 2:10.01. They averaged 2:08.19.
</P>
<P>
   Women swam the 200-meter freestyle 0.49 seconds faster than
predicted. They swam the 100-meter breaststroke 0.92 seconds
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rarely do you see such huge changes, especially if a sport has
been around for a while,'' Stager said. ''If we were seeing it with
both the men and the women, I'd think we did something wrong. But
we're seeing it with women only.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Stager will spend the next four years pondering
the question. But already he has some promising theories.
</P>
<P>
   He believes training alone cannot account for the improvement.
Sure, De Bruijn lifts weights. But so do the others.
</P>
<P>
   One factor could be age. The female swimmers are more mature,
physically and emotionally. In 1988, the average age of U.S. women
swimmers was 15. Now it is nearly 20.
</P>
<P>
   And economics. Top-name Olympians like Dara Torres are
attracting lucrative endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Torres can afford to be a swimmer,'' Stager said. ''That's a
huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs be ruled
out, Stager says. Drug-testing in Sydney is the Olympics' most
rigorous yet, including more than 2,000 random tests. But they
don't directly identify some of the most effective biochemical
advancements, including the use of human growth hormone and
erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drugs remain a distinct possibility,'' Stager said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that Stager dismisses in the swimming events is the
new style of swimsuit made to simulate fish skin to reduce drag in
the water. Medal winners wore a variety of suits, new and old.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to measure, but equally important, is the mental side of
sports. It is here -- especially among the women gymnasts -- that
scientists have noticed a significant decline in performance.
Experienced gymnasts repeatedly fell, stumbled and slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Tension and doubt trigger biochemical changes that interrupt the
muscles' automatic motor response, the ''muscle memory'' honed by
years of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be enjoying it,'' said Boston University sports
psychologist Leonard Zaichowsky. ''Just a small amount of excess
tension results in failure when scores are based on fractions of a
point.''
</P>
<P>
   To gain an edge, most elite athletes visualize a perfect race or
routine before competing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Visualization actually gets the muscles firing,'' Zaichowsky
said. ''It gives the body a rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes dream of victory more vividly than U.S. swimmer
Megan Quann. In her bedroom in Puyallup, Wash., Quann would lie
with a stopwatch in her hand and imagine herself touching the wall
ahead of defending champion Penny Heyns of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see the tiles on the bottom of the pool,'' the high
school junior recalled. ''I can taste the water. I can hear the
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 100-meter breaststroke finals, Quann used a strong kick
to defeat Heyns by a half-second, a huge margin.
</P>
<P>
   She won the gold medal. For real.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.

<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- The crew of a Chinese domestic airliner safely
landed their plane Wednesday morning after subduing a man who
attempted to hijack it, according to an official and state-run
media.
</P>
<P>
   The Xinhua Airlines flight took off at 7:20 a.m. from Baotou in
China's Inner Mongolian region on a flight to Beijing, 370 miles to
the east, said the government-run news agency, Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker attempted to take over the plane during the flight,
but was immediately subdued by the crew, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737 landed in Jinan, about 185 miles south of Beijing
about two hours after takeoff with all 143 passengers reported
safe, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected hijacker was taken off the plane and sent to a
hospital with unspecified injuries, said a security officer at
Jinan's airport. The officer, who only gave his surname, Xue, said
investigators were trying to determine if others on the flight were
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The official and Xinhua did not provide further details on the
hijacker's identity and his planned destination. Officials with
Xinhua Airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration of China did
not answer telephone calls for comment.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Rookie Daniel Sedin
celebrated his 20th birthday by scoring with 6:22 to play as the
Vancouver Canucks tied the Minnesota Wild 4-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver narrowly avoided becoming the first team to lose to

preseason just 1:50 after teammate Matt Cooke closed the gap to
4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Gaborik and Cam Stewart with a shorthanded goal, scored
1:03 apart in the third period to give the Wild a 4-2 lead and a

</P>
<P>
   Todd Bertuzzi and Mattias Ohlund scored the other goals for the
Canucks (3-1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Maxim Sushinsky and Lubomir Sekeras also scored for the Wild,
who remain winless (0-2-3) after five exhibition games.

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now, the real work begins for the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves clinched the NL East to win their record ninth
straight division title, beating the New York Mets 7-1 Tuesday
night behind John Burkett's pitching and Chipper Jones' home run.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to start preparing for the playoffs,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ''We've got to start reading the scouting
reports and start getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   After the final out, the Braves shook hands on the field,
keeping the high-fives to a minimum. The only sign this victory
meant more came when Atlanta relievers ran out of the bullpen to
join their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the clubhouse, however, the Braves sprayed champagne and
put on T-shirts proclaiming themselves champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to show anybody up out there,'' Cox said.
''It's not the World Series, it's the playoffs, the division. But
you absolutely should celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Added 20-game winner Tom Glavine: ''Division titles don't come
easy, but it's still all about winning the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   With John Rocker back at Shea Stadium -- and dodging a beer
bottle on the mound -- Atlanta prevented the Mets from wrapping up
the wild card spot.
</P>
<P>
   New York would have been assured of that berth if both Arizona
and Los Angeles had lost later in the evening. The Diamondbacks
eventually fell 7-6 to Colorado, but the Dodgers beat San Francisco
9-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll probably be awake, I don't know,'' New York manager Bobby
Valentine said. ''We might have to come out and win one tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 48,270 had little to cheer on a damp, chilly night
other than Edgardo Alfonzo's home run. The fans started booing the
home team during a sloppy seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is disappointment, but you still realize there's a very
good chance of your going to the playoffs, and it's the same
playoffs,'' Mets third baseman Robin Ventura said. ''It's not like
they go to a different tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker drew loud jeers when he sprinted out of the Braves
bullpen to relieve in the eighth. A beer bottle landed about 10
feet from him as he prepared to warm up, and police quickly
appeared to have the man who threw it in custody in the first-base
box seats.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker retired Ventura on a routine fly to end the inning,
looked at the crowd without emotion as he walked off and smiled for
his teammates in the dugout. Rocker finished up in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything to say,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves begin the playoffs on either Oct. 3 or Oct. 4 against
either St. Louis or San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel good at this point in the season. All facets are
falling into place,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta won the NL West from 1991-93 and, after a strike wiped
out the end of the 1994 season, has won six consecutive NL East
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta began the night with a magic number of three over New
York. Several Braves players wondered about their standing, asking
aloud in the clubhouse whether they could clinch and dubious that
it could be done.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the first pitch, though, they seemed clued in -- but
that came only after the Braves called the commissioner's office to
clear up the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're absolutely aware of it,'' Braves general manager John
Schuerholz said at gametime. ''If we win tonight, we win it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to baseball's new math in the wild-card era, here's
why the Braves clinched: At 94-63 with five games left, the Braves
are assured of at least a tie with the Mets (89-68).
</P>
<P>
   If they finish even and both are in the playoffs, the division
winner is determined by head-to-head record. Atlanta is 7-4 against
New York with only two games left.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won their fourth in a row and stopped the Mets'
three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (10-6) improved to 3-0 against the Mets this season,
allowing three hits in six innings. He also hit an RBI single off
Al Leiter (16-8) in the fifth for the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the Braves, you figure you're going to be in the playoffs
unless something goofy happens,'' said Burkett, who joined the team
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who won at Atlanta last Wednesday, lasted 5 1-3 innings
and gave up four runs and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Sanders doubled in the fifth and scored with two outs
when Burkett, batting .132, singled for his third RBI of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a perennial Mets' nemesis, hit his 35th homer leading off
the sixth. That made him 15-for-32 (.469) against New York this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura made an ill-advised throw home with the bases loaded
later in the sixth, allowing two more runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta added three runs in the seventh. Andres Galarraga hit a
two-run double -- right after catcher Mike Piazza threw to second
base when no one was stealing -- and an error by shortstop Mike
Bordick set up Brian Jordan's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rocker took a private car to the ballpark, and has no plans
to ride the No. 7 subway in this three-game series. While security
officers guarded the bullpen, there was nothing close to the
700-person police presence that greeted him in late June for his
first visit since making disparaging remarks about New Yorkers.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Deals With Homeless Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Blue Baymen has taken to lying
underneath a sleeping bag, not inside, in case he must defend
himself through the night.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Teague moved in with a friend. And a third drifter, Mike
Culle, curbs his drinking so he is alert enough to fend off
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless in here are taking extra precautions after one man
living on the street was killed this month and two others were
badly beaten in separate attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll find someone else if they know you mean business,''
said Culle, 40, a recent transplant from Titusville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe a band of teens armed with rocks, knives and
other weapons are behind the three attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The victims could not identify their assailants because they
struck at night while the men slept, said Sgt. Rod Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The recent attacks occurred about a year after seven homeless
men were beaten to death in downtown Denver. Two teens have been
convicted in the death of one Denver man; no arrests have been made
in the other assaults.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 800 people homeless in Colorado Springs, a city
of 350,000 residents at the foot of Pikes Peak with four military
bases and a growing hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Like Baymen, some think it is safer to camp 5 miles west in a
national forest than to sleep outdoors in the city. They compare
themselves to the pioneers and prospectors of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   Baymen, 37, rests under a tarp tied to a tree and hides his
sleeping bag under a boulder to protect it from being stolen or
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''What am I going to do? Go to the post office and sleep next to
my P.O. box?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Michael Jones spent nights at the city's only homeless
shelter until August, but left to live with a friend, said Jeannine
Holt, the shelter's director.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found in a sleeping bag on Sept. 9 beneath a
downtown bridge, a quarter-mile from a soup kitchen and a park that
is a popular gathering place for homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Jones died of a blow to the head. Some men who
were staying in an abandoned boxcar nearby said they came into
conflict with a group of men, one carrying a 2-by-4, shortly before
Jones' body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   A week before Jones' death, two other homeless men were beaten
by several attackers in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeless people place part of the blame on police,
contending officers push them into areas where they are more
vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Other homeless people, especially younger ones, seem more upset
about being subjected to random searches for weapons and drugs than
about the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to scare us out,'' said James W. Middlestadt
Jr., 24, as he stood in Monument Valley Park, across from the
Marian House soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Skip Arms said the homeless can always stay in shelters. But
Colorado Springs' only homeless shelter has been filled for the
last two months and Denver's shelters are 70 miles away.

<HEADLINE> Industry To Lessen 'R' Movie Ads  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hollywood executives are seeking to mollify
angry lawmakers with new pledges to curb the marketing of R-rated
movies to underage audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But as top studio executives prepared to present their
initiatives Wednesday on Capitol Hill, some lawmakers and
children's advocates already were questioning whether the industry
was going far enough.
</P>
<P>
   After being sharply rebuked for declining to testify at an
earlier hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, representatives
from eight studios answered their summons to appear before the
senators armed with a 12-point plan for limiting the marketing of
inappropriate films to children.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was unveiled Tuesday by the Motion Picture
Association of America, calls for the movie studios to ask theater
owners not to show ads for R-rated films during G-rated movies and
to not include people under age 17 in focus groups for R-rated
movies without a parent.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the companies have pledged to review their
marketing and advertising practices so as not to target
inappropriately R-rated movies at children, and they will appoint
senior executive compliance officers to review these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are starting a new era that didn't exist before,''
said MPAA President Jack Valenti. ''We're going to take a fresh
look at the way we market our films.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co., Dreamworks SKG, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Twentieth
Century Fox, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. all signed on to
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies already have unveiled plans to go beyond the
industrywide effort. News Corp. said Tuesday that its Fox network
would not accept ads for R-rated films in any family programming or
shows in which 35 percent or more of the audience is under age 17.
Also, the company's Twentieth Century Fox Film label will ask
theater owners not to show trailers for R-rated films during G or
PG-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us in the media industry have a fundamental
responsibility to help parents cope with the many entertainment
choices facing their children,'' said Peter Chernin, News Corp.
president.
</P>
<P>
   Disney already has said it would prohibit theater owners from
showing trailers for R-rated films before movies released under the
Walt Disney label and that its ABC network would not accept
advertisements for R-rated films during prime time before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But these moves may not be enough to satisfy lawmakers, who say
they want executives to make a broader declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm appalled that the movie executives still have not stated
they will stop marketing violent movies to children. This is the
least they should do,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a longtime
advocate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he
hopes the studios offer ''a firm commitment to stop marketing
material to children that they themselves have deemed unsuitable
for that age.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it should be that complicated,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, which reported earlier this month
that the entertainment industry was peddling inappropriate
materials to children, said it was encouraged to see the industry
heeding the call for improved self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education,
said the industry's initiative was an important first step, but
added that the movie companies needed to extend their efforts to
TV, by not advertising R-rated movies on shows popular with young
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   A study being released Wednesday by the conservative Parents
Television Council found that of 54 movie ads aired on broadcast TV
during 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. -- the so-called family hour -- 83 percent
were for R-rated films. The sample was taken from Sept. 1 to Sept.
20 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Others groups argue that the movie executives are trying to
sugarcoat a more fundamental problem -- the rating system itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of putting a Band-Aid on a system that is truly
outdated,'' said Daphne White, founder and executive director of
The Lion &AMP; Lamb Project. She is pushing for a complete overhaul of
the movie rating system to make it more accessible to parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Valenti maintains there is no problem with the ratings
themselves and he offered several initiatives focused on explaining
the reasons for a given rating in print advertisement and on Web
sites.

<HEADLINE> Report Grades Evolution Teaching  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nineteen states got D's or F's in a report
that evaluated how public schools teach evolution, raising a new
issue in a continuing dispute between science and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The report graded 49 states and the District of Columbia and
gave the highest rankings to California, Connecticut, Indiana, New
Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island. Kansas, whose standards
were described as ''disgraceful,'' got the lowest grade.
</P>
<P>
   The report was commissioned by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation
and released Tuesday at the American Association for the
Advancement of Science national headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Following the six top-ranked states, four states got numerical
grades in the 90s and were also given A's in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen states were graded at B, seven got C, six were given
D's and 13 flunked. Iowa was not included because it has no
statewide education standards, leaving that up to each local
district.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, former chairman of the Kansas State Board of
Education, said the report was deceptive and ''very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly they have an ax to grind about evolution,'' she said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas last year rekindled the issue of teaching evolution in
public schools when the state board of education, led by Holloway,
approved science teaching standards that minimized the importance
of evolution and omitted the big-bang theory of the origin of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have considered similar curriculum changes and some
state legislatures have proposed laws that would forbid completely
the teaching of evolution in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, a theory developed by Charles Darwin and others,
holds that the Earth is billions of years old and that all
creatures, including humans, evolved from simpler forms through a
process of natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   Related to biological evolution is the concept that the universe
began with a ''big bang'' and that only later were the sun and the
planets formed.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching of evolution has been opposed by those who believe that
the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created abruptly by
God.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents of divine creation have organized a concept,
called creationism, that they proposed be taught along with
evolution. In 1987, the Supreme Court barred states from requiring
the teaching of creationism. Now some of the same proponents
support other concepts, such as ''abrupt appearance'' or
''intelligent design,'' that are linked to divine creation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence S. Lerner, who compiled the report, said the conflict
''is not really about science, but about religion and politics.''
He calls creationism ''a pseudoscientific rival to evolution that
the courts have repeatedly held to be thinly veiled religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, a former professor at California State University, Long
Beach, said Kansas got such a poor grade because its guidelines
forbid teaching anything about the age of the Earth or the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not a reference to the age of the universe because it
changes all the time,'' explained Holloway. ''Within a month after
we adopted the standards, I heard three different ages of the
Earth. That is kind of ludicrous to get them (teachers) to stick to
one age when it changes all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner called the Kansas science education standards ''a
disgraceful paean to antiscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, however, said the report was part of ''a campaign of
deception'' and that all districts in Kansas are still teaching
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we did was allow local groups to decide how they wanted to
teach evolution,'' she said. ''That is a reasonable thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Nord, a member of a panel assembled by AAAS to comment on
the report, spoke in favor of education standards that would
include religious concepts of creation along with concepts of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Nord, director of the Program on Humanities and Human Values
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the report
failed to evaluate the completeness of science education.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good science education should not limit itself to what
scientists think, but should also explore the cultural context in
which scientific claims are made,'' said Nord, noting that the
report ''doesn't address that.''

<HEADLINE> Suu Kyi's Democrats Fight To Survive  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Twelve years of defiance have won
worldwide respect for Myanmar's democracy heroine, Aung San Suu
Kyi. But back home under military rule, she is struggling to keep
her decimated party alive.
</P>
<P>
   Her National League for Democracy, which marks its 12th
anniversary Wednesday, has been weakened by resignations forced by
the regime. Party offices have been closed and members arrested.
Dozens of its elected lawmakers who refuse to stand down are
detained in state ''guest houses'' until they change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, 55, recently raised the stakes in her war of wills with
the dictatorial regime by defying, twice in one month, the
restrictions on her movements, the latest last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in doing so, the 1991 Nobel Peace laureate has pushed her
party to the brink in its confrontation with the junta, which has
weathered decades of international isolation and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past 2&AMP;frac12; years the NLD has managed a series of planned
confrontations with the government to test how far it could go and
to generate international support,'' said David Steinberg, director
of Asian Studies at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been an effective strategy ... But at some point the
military may say 'enough is enough' and declare the party
illegal,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday a government statement denounced ''The so-called 'war
of endurance' and 'stop me if you dare' campaigns orchestrated by
NLD.'' It said every government step ''has been challenged,
ridiculed and impeded,'' delaying Myanmar's ''orderly transition to
a multiparty democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The regime came to power 12 years ago and maintains it is a
transitional administration, but shows no tolerance of dissent.
Experience shows it turns the screw tighter against the NLD every
time Suu Kyi tries to assert her political rights.
</P>
<P>
   After a nine-day standoff last month when Suu Kyi's motorcade
was blocked on its way south of the capital, she was forced back to
Yangon and confined to her home for two weeks. The party said at
least 11 NLD members were arrested and for the first time the party
headquarters was raided and searched.
</P>
<P>
   When she was tried to travel by train on Thursday to Myanmar's
second city, Mandalay, authorities said all tickets were sold out
and placed restrictions again on party leaders. Suu Kyi is under
virtual house arrest once more and party vice chairman Tin Oo
detained in a government guest house.
</P>
<P>
   The party also is treading on dangerous ground by insisting it
will draft a constitution for Myanmar. The government regards that
as a crime punishable by up to 21 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD was formed in 1988, two weeks after the junta took power
in what was then known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The military gunned down thousands of protesters nationwide, but
two years later organized general elections. The NLD, bolstered by
Suu Kyi's popularity as the daughter of Myanmar's late independence
hero, Aung San, won 82 percent of the seats. Still, the military
refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the NLD set up a proxy parliament. Many of the
392 members elected in 1990 were forced to resign or were
disqualified on technicalities. Today, the military says, only 109
remain valid members of a would-be parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the military claimed some 50,000 party members had
resigned, and an official press commentary said that less than 10
percent of the original membership remains. The NLD dismissed the
figures as fictitious but has none of its own.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department report published in February accused the
regime of waging ''a systematic nationwide campaign to destroy the
NLD without formally banning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, who was released from six years of house arrest in
1995, tenaciously clings to the popular mandate, but with hundreds
of supporters behind bars, she has little room for maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the recent worsening of the deadlock may be the
beginning of the endgame that might lead to the banning of the NLD,
but only if the regime is ready to weather a storm of international
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   The regime will face international scrutiny in the coming
months, which will likely deter it from taking drastic action, said
Josef Silverstein, a Myanmar expert at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Myanmar is to attend a meeting in Laos between
foreign ministers of Southeast Asia and Europe, whose relations
have been snarled for three years by a dispute over Yangon's
participation.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe now ready to engage them, Myanmar's partners in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations would not be pleased to see
the junta crossing any red lines.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Reports Smits Will Retire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana Pacers center Rik Smits is expected
to announce his retirement at a press conference Wednesday at
Conseco Fieldhouse, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Smits, 34, had been pondering retirement since the end of last
season, but team sources told The Indianapolis Star on Tuesday
night that the 7-foot-4 center decided to end his NBA career after
12 seasons. FoxSports also reported the news.
</P>
<P>
   Team sources told The Indianapolis Star that the delay in the
announcement was at the request of the club, and not because of any
indecision on Smits' part. The team opens training camp next week
in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers officials could not be reached by The Associated Press
late Tuesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Smits informed team president Donnie Walsh of his intentions
when he returned to Indianapolis from his summer home in upstate
New York last month, but Walsh asked the center to keep his mind
open to the possibility of returning.
</P>
<P>
   Several key team representatives then tried to persuade Smits to
continue playing, including first-year coach Isiah Thomas and
players Jalen Rose, Austin Croshere and Derrick McKey. After those
pitches were made, Walsh asked Smits for his final decision on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smits would become the fourth member -- and third starter -- from
last year's NBA Finals team to leave the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Mark Jackson left through free agency, signing a
four-year contract with the Toronto Raptors. Power forward Dale
Davis, who expressed discontent with his contract status, was
traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for forward Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   And veteran backup forward Chris Mullin, who had one year
remaining on his contract, requested his release in hopes of
signing with another team.
</P>
<P>
   Though Smits was a free agent, no formal contract offer was
made.
</P>
<P>
   Only shooting guard Reggie Miller will start in the same
position as last season. Rose is now the point guard, Croshere the
small forward and O'Neal the power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Just who will play center remains to be seen. The only veterans
on the roster are 39-year-old Sam Perkins and Zan Tabak. The team
recently contacted journeyman Rony Seikaly about returning to the
league, but he opted to play in Europe instead.

<HEADLINE> Ullrich Wins Olympic Road Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Lance Armstrong admitted this wasn't
his race and the results proved it.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France champion finished 13th in the Olympics road
race, beaten by his longtime cycling rival and fellow Tour winner
Jan Ullrich of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, who won the Tour in 1997 and finished second three
times, was timed in 5 hours, 29 minutes, 8 seconds. Alexander
Vinokourov of Kazakstan won the silver and Andreas Kloeden of
Germany the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Long a dominant rider who has struggled with weight problems,
Ullrich pulled away from the pack midway through the 12th of 14
laps and never got caught in the 148-mile event.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the winner of the last two Tours, crossed the line in
a pack 1:29 behind Ullrich. George Hincapie of Greenville, S.C.,
was eighth, 1:26 behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has yet to compete in the race that he is favored to
win -- the individual time trial on Saturday (Friday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie, who was critical to Armstrong's two Tour titles as a
fellow member of the U.S. Postal Service team, was in third place
with one lap to go appeared to be looking for Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was out of sight at the back of the peloton, some 30
seconds behind the leaders. He attacked, drawing cheers at the
start-finish area when his move was announced to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Hincapie finally connected with about three miles
to go, but by then it was too late. By then, Ullrich was powering
his way to victory aided by help from Kloeden.
</P>
<P>
   After a rainy morning, the clouds broke and the cyclists rode
under sunny skies. Although several riders took turns leading the
field, nobody made a serious move until four laps remained.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Marc Wauters of Belgium, Jens Voigt of Germany and
Max van Heeswijk of the Netherlands broke away.
</P>
<P>
   But Voigt was setting the table for his teammates. Kloeden and
Ullrich stormed up to the front midway through the 13th lap.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in the Olympics for the third time, Armstrong finished
close to where he placed in the previous two.
</P>
<P>
   He was 12th in the road race in Atlanta and 14th in Barcelona.
In Atlanta, he also placed sixth in the time trial at a time he was
unwittingly suffering from testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong rose to the top of his sport by winning the Tour de
France in 1999, capping a remarkable comeback. The disease had
spread to his lungs and brain by the time it was detected in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Sydney focused on winning a gold medal and now it
will have to come in the time trial. That's the event he was
focusing on.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A sensational comeback by the Cubans
was undone when their best player committed the simplest of
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Dennis, the most talented hitter on a volleyball team
loaded with fine athletes, sent his jump serve straight into the
net, giving Russia a dramatic 21-25, 25-23, 25-19, 19-25, 15-13
victory Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT) and a spot in the Olympic
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis was so distraught after the match that he couldn't speak,
but coach Marino Diaz said if it weren't for Dennis, the Cubans
wouldn't have gotten close.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't fail. He tried his very best,'' Diaz said. ''I'm not
going to be too harsh on him, but he's got to work harder and
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia will play the Brazil-Argentina winner in Friday's first
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   In another quarterfinal, tournament favorite Italy dropped a set
to heavy underdog Australia before recovering to win 25-14, 22-25,
25-19, 25-15. Italy will play the winner between the defending
Olympic champion Netherlands and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had an 8-3 lead in the fifth game, with the winner
needing to reach 15 points and win by two. Cuba came back to take
an 11-10 lead with strong blocking, and after Russia surged ahead
14-11, the Cubans rallied once more to get to 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   The drama ended quickly, however, as Dennis hit the ball off the
lower part of his palm and into the midsection of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every person has a moment in his life when he has extreme
luck,'' said Russian captain Vadim Khamutskikh. ''Today was that
day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel sank to his knees, his head in his hands. Teammate Alan
Roca helped him up and took him toward the net for the
congratulatory handshaking with the Russians, but Dennis was
inconsolable, keeping his hands to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Burly, bearded Russian coach Genadi Chipolin, meanwhile, leaped
out of his chair and rolled around on the floor, losing one of his
shoes as his players raised their arms in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medals are worth losing shoes over,'' Chipolin said. ''It is
important not to lose your head and be a coach right to the very
end. This is the Olympics. It will leave a mark on my heart
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, led by Dennis and brothers Osvaldo and Ihosvany
Hernandez, played the most breathtaking volleyball of the
tournament. But their errors -- whether it was hitting, serving or
blocking -- cost them. They were swept by the Netherlands and
Brazil, and only made the quarterfinals because Spain and Egypt
were so weak in their group.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's last Olympic medal was a bronze in 1976, and now the best
it can do is fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which won six straight medals, including three golds,
from 1964 to 1988, is trying to return to prominence after a
seventh-place finish in Barcelona and a fourth-place showing in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which has won the last three world championships and is
looking for its first gold medal, started off well, having rested
four of its starters against the United States in the final
group-play match.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Italians got lazy in the second game against an
Australian team making its Olympic debut, with only a few
world-class players.
</P>
<P>
   Italy turned it around in the third game when it pulled away
from a one-point lead behind the hitting of Samuele Papi and
Alessandro Fei. A putback slam by Fei ended an 8-2 run that
essentially put away the game at 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   Italy rolled to an 18-5 lead to start the fourth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- American Kay Poe, who made the Olympic
team thanks to the kindness of her best friend, lost her
first-round flyweight match in taekwondo.
</P>
<P>
   In an upset, Poe, of Houston, lost 4-3 Wednesday (Tuesday night
EDT) to Hanne Hoegh Poulsen of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Poe led 3-1 after two rounds before getting outscored 4-0 in the
final period. Poulsen had one point deducted to finish with the
one-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was much more cautious today than usual,'' Poe said. ''I'm
usually very aggressive, but today I just didn't play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Poe's chances to win even a bronze medal ended later in the day
when Poulsen lost to Australia's Lauren Burns, eliminating Poulsen
from the final.
</P>
<P>
   Poe would have had a chance for bronze if Poulsen had reached
the final.
</P>
<P>
   Poe entered the Olympic trials in May ranked No. 1 in the world
in the flyweight class and destined for Sydney. But she dislocated
a kneecap in the semifinals, leaving her unable to compete in the
finals against her best friend, Esther Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who would have been an underdog if Poe had been healthy,
decided to give up her chance to make the team by forfeiting the
match to Poe.
</P>
<P>
   ''She did her best, the best that she could do today,'' said
Kim, who watched the bout from the stands, often yelling
encouragement to her friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all proud of her,'' Kim said. ''She hasn't let anyone
down.''

<HEADLINE> Man found guilty of beating death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALONE, N.Y. (AP) - A jury has found David P. Delosh guilty of
beating a 66-year-old man to death with a tire iron.
</P>
<P>
   Delosh was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder as
well as first-degree attempted murder. It took the nine-woman,
three-man Franklin County jury a little more than 3 hours on
Tuesday to reach its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Delosh will be sentenced Nov. 13. Judge Robert G. Main Jr. said
he will sentence Delosh's accomplice, Steven Trimm - who testified
against him - the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal made with the Franklin County District Attorney's
Office, Trimm will receive 20 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Zerella was beaten to death with a tire iron in the driveway of
his Fort Covington home near the Canadian border, on Aug. 10, 1999.
He died of massive head injuries. Delosh and Trimm had gone to the
Zerella house that evening so Delosh could confront Diana Zerella's
boyfriend, Tony Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Delosh believed Russell - who is his brother-in-law - had turned
his family in for welfare fraud and had made an anonymous call to
his parole officer about his continued drinking and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports would've caused Delosh to be in violation of his
parole, and he would be sent back to prison.

<HEADLINE> Foerster a Force in Sailing's 470  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- After waiting four years, what's one
sunny, windless day to sailors trying to win a gold medal?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. 470 class skippers Paul Foerster of Rockwall, Texas, and
J.J. Isler of San Diego were ready to sail for Olympic medals
Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT) when thunderstorms messed up the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The men's and women's races eventually were postponed a day, but
not before some of the sailors went through the equivalent of both
a rain delay and a false start.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the looks of things out there, it was pretty good that we
didn't have a race,'' said Bob Merrick of Portsmouth, R.I.,
Foerster's crewman. ''The wind just totally shut off.''
</P>
<P>
   Storms passing over Sydney Harbor in the morning created
unstable winds and rough water at the harbor entrance, so officials
kept the boats in all classes in the marina for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The skies gradually cleared, and race officials finally sent out
the 470 women, figuring there wasn't time to squeeze in the men's
race as well. But while it was a gorgeous, sunny day on the water,
there was one problem -- only 4 knots of wind, if that. So after
bobbing around for a half hour or so, the boats came back in. Both
fleets will try again on Thursday (Wednesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Isler, 36, and her crewmember, Pease Glaser, 38, of Long Beach,
Calif., are the oldest of the 470 sailors. Glaser is making her
Olympic debut, but had been through the trials three times before.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pease and I probably spent more races postponed than most of
these girls have sailed races,'' said Isler, the 1992 bronze
medalist. ''It's hard to know what other people are thinking, but
you know everyone's nervous. The good thing about our trial system
is we know we can sail well even when we're nervous and under that
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The two U.S. crews tried to stay out of the sun to conserve
their energy. Foerster and Merrick watched some other Olympic
sports on TV in the sailors' lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gosh, it seems like we sat around and did nothing,'' Merrick
said. ''There's not much you can do about it. It's our job to stay
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting races in light, shifting wind can be disastrous,
especially in races with such huge consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's winds are so shifty that during the first 49er fleet
race in this regatta, the wind turned around 180 degrees, leaving
the leaders practically dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't mind the really shifty conditions, but you want it to
be a fair race,'' Merrick said. ''It looked like it was so light
out there that it wouldn't be a fair race.''
</P>
<P>
   Foerster was in second place, behind the Australian crew. Isler
was third, behind Australia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Races in the Star, Finn and Laser classes also were postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster won the silver medal in the Flying Dutchman in 1992,
but then the class was dropped from the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a job and got married. Got a cat and a dog,'' Foerster
said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   It's that low-key approach that had him in medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster was disappointed but not devastated when the Flying
Dutchman was replaced by the Laser class. He had sailed it in two
Olympics and also won world championships in 1991 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked really hard in that boat and then when they changed
it, it was like, 'I don't want to try another boat for '96,' ''
Foerster said. ''But for 2000, I said, 'Oh, I'll give it a shot.'
''
</P>
<P>
   So he switched to the 470 class, which is a little smaller than
the Flying Dutchman but also a two-person boat. He and Merrick,
himself a former college All-American, immersed themselves in
training, including an intense schedule in overseas regattas.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall in the 470 Olympic trials, Foerster and Merrick beat
1992 Olympic silver medalists Morgan Reeser and Kevin Burnham.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been three years of really, really hard work to get
enough ability to have a chance to win here,'' Foerster said. ''The
FD is a harder boat to sail, but the thing about the 470 is, when
it's easier to sail, that means you can have a lot more people that
are good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Foerster, a mechanical engineer, has met big
challenges before. After enrolling at the University of Texas in
1983, he walked onto the sailing team. Even though he didn't come
up through a junior sailing program like most of the other team
members, he ended up a three-time All-American.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Goalie Jamie Storr stopped all 20 shots in
his first full game to lead the Los Angeles Kings to a 2-0
preseason victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lubomir Visnovsky's power-play goal, a wrist shot inside the
right post, gave Los Angeles (4-2-0) a 1-0 lead at 2:32 of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnson scored at 7:49 of the third period with a wrist
shot underneath Phoenix goalie Sean Burke, who made 32 saves. The
Coyotes (2-3-1-1) took only four shots in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kings defenseman Rob Blake reassumed his role as team
captain Tuesday night. He relinquished the job before the
exhibition season to protest what he called an ultimatum from team
management during negotiations for a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, signed through this season, rejected a three-year
extension worth $22.5 million. The club then suspended
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor said Blake's return as captain
would have no effect on negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody on the team considers Rob the captain,''
Taylor said. ''It's nice to see that he's reconsidered.''

   Christine Traurig of Carlsbad, Calif., riding Etienne, edged the
United States past Denmark on Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team finished with 5,166 points, 17 ahead of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Germany won the gold with 5,632 points and the Netherlands took
silver with 5,579.
</P>
<P>
   Traurig wasn't told before her ride that she needed to score a
personal best to bring the bronze home. She scored 1,746 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable how close things can be,'' she said. ''It's
good not to know. You just go in and do your best.''
</P>
<P>
   Traurig called the moment ''a dream of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of my horse,'' she said. ''He went in there and was
there for me. After all the pressure that we were under, we handled
it well.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States put in four solid rides in the two-day
competition, including 1,695 points earned by Guenter Seidel of Del
Mar, Calif., on Foltaire earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   That was added to the 1,725 points earned by Susan Blinks of
Wellington, Fla., on Flim Flam on Tuesday. Robert Dover of
Flemington, N.J., had the drop score for the United States of
1,678.
</P>
<P>
   The leading riders leaders who will carry their scores over to
Thursday's individual competition are Isabel Werth of Germany on
Gigolo with 1,908, followed by her six-year rival Anky Van Grunsven
of the Netherlands on Bonfire with 1,875, and Coby van Baalen of
the Netherlands on Ferro with 1,873.

<HEADLINE> Williams Beats Dementieva For Gold  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Even in celebration, Venus Williams is
a captivating force on a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   This time the jubilant champion thrust her arms skyward, bowed
and twirled happily at the net. Then she borrowed an American flag
from the stands and gave it a wave.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd cheered, and with good reason. Williams beat
18-year-old Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-4 Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT)
to win an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The victory extended Williams' winning streak to 32 matches, and
she became only the second player to win Wimbledon, the U.S. Open
and the Olympics in the same year. Steffi Graf did it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was ready to go out and take it and not just hope somebody
gave it to me,'' Williams said. ''I guess I've graduated to a
different level where I can be like some of the greats.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will try for her second gold when she and sister Serena
play in the doubles final Thursday (Wednesday night EDT) against
Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is unbeaten since losing at the French Open in early
June, and her winning streak is the longest since Martina Hingis
won 37 consecutive matches in 1997. Martina Navratilova set the
record of 74 victories in a row in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Like other opponents, Dementieva couldn't cope with Williams'
power. In the sixth game, the Russian barely avoided getting hit in
the face by a second-serve ace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't ready for the second serve,'' Dementieva said. ''It
was like a first serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wowed a crowd that included her sister, their mother,
U.S. teammate and bronze medalist Monica Seles, coach Billie Jean
King and members of the U.S. swim team.
</P>
<P>
   Even Williams was a bit overwhelmed by the performance. When she
received her medal, she beamed and covered her face with her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt really emotional,'' she said. ''You see it on TV. It
was really great. It was me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles won the bronze Tuesday. The U.S. team lost a chance at a
singles sweep when defending champion Lindsay Davenport withdrew
because of a foot injury following her first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough,'' Williams said. ''Potentially, it could have
been all three of us standing there in any order.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnaud Di Pasquale became the first Frenchman since 1924 to win
a tennis medal by beating Roger Federer of Switzerland 7-6 (5), 6-7
(7), 6-3 for the bronze Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spaniards Alex Corretja and Albert Costa won the bronze in men's
doubles, beating South Africans David Adams and John-Laffnie de
Jager 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-seeded Dementieva, who reached the semifinals at the
U.S. Open earlier this month, started well against the
second-seeded Williams. The Russian won the first game and had a
point to up 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Then Williams won 15 of the next 18 points for a 5-1 lead. The
serving inconsistency that plagued her earlier in the tournament
was gone, and her laser groundstroke winners drew repeated gasps of
appreciation from the crowd. Once even Dementieva nodded in
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was difficult to play against her,'' Dementieva said. ''She
played very well. She's very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wavered after taking a 5-2 lead in the second set,
losing her serve for the third time in the set. She double-faulted
on the first championship point, but Dementieva then hit a backhand
wide to give Williams another victory.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Opposition Rejects Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav opposition leaders have
rebuffed President Slobodan Milosevic's claim that he earned enough
votes to force a runoff in presidential elections, pledging to
defend the will of the people by all means short of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic defied international and domestic appeals for him to
step down Tuesday, announcing a runoff election against opposition
leader Vojislav Kostunica, who insists he won Sunday's election
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica quickly counterattacked, rejecting a runoff and
planning a massive rally Wednesday night in downtown Belgrade to
defend the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about political fraud and blatant stealing of
votes,'' Kostunica said in a statement. ''This is an offer which
must be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders demanded the chance to inspect the election
commission's returns and insisted on restraint after the federal
commission's volatile announcement, its first since the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The commission reported that Kostunica finished first with 48.22
percent while Milosevic earned 40.23 percent. Under Yugoslav law, a
runoff is required since none of the candidates received more than
50 percent. It was set for Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   State television said the turnout was 64 percent, far below the
74 percent figure given by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff announcement came despite growing international calls
for Milosevic to accept an opposition victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even before it was declared, President Clinton insisted the will
of the people must be respected. The United States also pledged
Tuesday to lead an international campaign to pressure Milosevic
into accepting the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the government's attempts to manipulate the vote, it
does seem clear that the people have voted for change,'' Clinton
said. ''The question is, will the government listen in response?''
</P>
<P>
   During a foreign policy address at Georgetown University in
Washington, Clinton dangled the possibility that ''the doors to
Europe and the world will be open again to Serbia,'' provided the
wishes of the people were taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   A runoff would be critical for Milosevic because it would give
him time to maneuver and create more favorable conditions for the
next round. It would also give him enough time to clamp down on
opposition media and activists and resume his nationalist campaign
portraying Kostunica as a ''NATO lackey and Western stooge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, a dour law professor who surprised Milosevic with his
widespread appeal, tried to cut off the Yugoslav strongman's means
of escape, declaring that there was ''no single reason, not moral
or political, by which we would accept such trampling on the
electoral will of the citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The victory is obvious and we will defend it by all nonviolent
means,'' he said. ''The people have given their political 'no' to
Milosevic and his policies. Our first duty is to carry out that
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the opposition would, however, avoid ''careless moves
which could raise tensions in society, which could lead to
unforeseeable consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, opposition leader Zoran Djindjic demanded an urgent
session of the State Electoral Commission to inspect the official
returns, claiming the government had taken votes from Kostunica and
given them to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no reason to respond nervously,'' Djindjic said. ''We
will demand to see the election material. We will copy them all,
compare and see where the votes went missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the commission releases partial returns and
Djindjic said earlier that the opposition feared the delay might be
aimed at giving the government time to fabricate bogus votes from
Kosovo, where the U.N. administrators permitted Serbs to vote.
</P>
<P>
   There had been fears of public unrest if the government sought
to claim a Milosevic victory or call a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic has again proven that he is ready to do very nasty
things to stay in power,'' said Dragisa Burzan, a deputy prime
minister in Montenegro, the small republic that along with Serbia
forms Yugoslavia. ''It would be a fatal mistake for the opposition
if it accepted the runoff.''

<HEADLINE> Outrage Over Clinton Land Proposals  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sylvia Milligan admits it: In election years past, she was a
political boob.
</P>
<P>
   A retired teacher in northern California, Milligan called her
girlfriends for schooling on political issues. She voted, sure, and
always Democrat, although she can't remember her presidential
choices beyond Kennedy and Clinton. ''Anything political,'' she
confesses, ''went right over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Smouse was equally unenlightened. A plant supervisor in
rural Pennsylvania, Smouse can't recall whether he supported
Clinton or Dole in 1996, even though he's a registered Republican.
''I don't think I voted for Bill,'' he says. ''I hope to hell
not.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the West Coast Democrat and the East Coast Republican
have traded ignorance for involvement, driven by an issue uniting a
strange brew of voters nationwide: Access to public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Avid snowmobilers, Milligan and Smouse were so enraged by a
Clinton administration proposal to ban snowmobiles in national
parks that they're campaigning for Republican George W. Bush. Both
are proud owners of ''Snowmobilers for Bush'' bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Clinton started his shenanigans, it just made me mad,''
says Smouse of Towanda, Pa., who also is volunteering for the
campaign of a Republican congressman and plans to take Election Day
off to work a polling place.
</P>
<P>
   The snowmobile ban is one of a flurry of policies the Clinton
administration has proposed this year limiting access to national
forests and parks and other public lands. Others include a plan to
prohibit road development in 43 million acres of forest land and
Clinton's designation of 10 new national monuments at which mining,
logging, oil drilling and off-road vehicle use are banned or
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign says Gore isn't worried about
any political backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be those who disagree, but he thinks it's only right
to conserve public lands for our children and protect the
environment while we work to grow the economy,'' says Gore campaign
spokesman Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has vowed to review all Clinton-Gore administration
policies that limit uses of federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would work much more closely with states and local people
on these kinds of decisions, and not have high-handed edicts issued
from far away in Washington,'' Bush spokesman Andrew Malcolm says.
</P>
<P>
   ''High-handed'' is a polite way of describing the Clinton
policies, to some of the newly energized.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have voted Democrat all of my life, but at this point -- no
way,'' says Milligan of Anderson, Calif. ''I call this the War in
the West. We're fighting to keep the public lands open.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting along with her are bikers, ranchers, unionized mill
workers -- some Democratic turncoats, others longtime Republicans. A
few, like Milligan and Smouse, are political neophytes getting
involved for the first time. Others, while politically active in
the past, have never been so compelled to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ''This roadless thing and the national monuments are
ludicrous,'' says motorcyclist Harold Soens of Santee, Calif., who
has campaigned for Republicans before and is pitching yard signs
for Bush this year. He and other bikers attended the California
Republican Party convention to hand out literature against the
proposals. ''The only way to stop it is to get rid of the people in
office today.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Jerry Klemm has hit the Idaho speech circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Klemm, a lifelong Democrat, worked 39 years at a paper mill in
Lewiston, Idaho, was president of the local paper workers union and
served on the state board of the AFL-CIO. But in 1991, after
environmental proposals began closing the forests to timber
companies, Klemm started the Pulp and Paper Workers Resource
Council to speak out against policies affecting timber-related
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now retired, he travels the state talking to civic groups and
chambers of commerce, lambasting the Clinton administration's
proposals to restrict forest access.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals could result in protest votes not only against
Gore but against local Democratic candidates. Former Utah Rep. Bill
Orton, for one, blames Clinton's creation of the Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah for
contributing to his 1996 election loss.
</P>
<P>
   The designation, made without local input and restricting
grazing, mining and access to water, came just weeks before the
election. Orton was up 24 points at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people said the monument ought to be named after me,
because it was my political tombstone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, some Democratic candidates are distancing
themselves from Gore because he won't rule out removing dams in the
Snake and Columbia Rivers to restore salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In southeastern Washington, when you say dams and you say
presidential candidate you say Bush,'' said Nancy Aldrich, a
Democratic candidate for the Benton County Commission.

<HEADLINE> Attempted Chinese Hijacking Foiled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- The crew of a Chinese domestic airliner safely
landed their plane Wednesday morning after subduing a man who
attempted to hijack it, according to an official and state-run
media.
</P>
<P>
   The Xinhua Airlines flight took off at 7:20 a.m. from Baotou in
China's Inner Mongolian region on a flight to Beijing, 370 miles to
the east, said the government-run news agency, Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker attempted to take over the plane during the flight,
but was immediately subdued by the crew, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737 landed in Jinan, about 185 miles south of Beijing
about two hours after takeoff with all 143 passengers reported
safe, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected hijacker was taken off the plane and sent to a
hospital with unspecified injuries, said a security officer at
Jinan's airport. The officer, who only gave his surname, Xue, said
investigators were trying to determine if others on the flight were
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The official and Xinhua did not provide further details on the
hijacker's identity and his planned destination. Xue said the plane
was heading toward the unnamed locale when the crew foiled the
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Xinhua Airlines and the Civil Aviation
Administration of China did not answer telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese hijackers have in the past mostly demanded to be flown
to Taiwan, Beijing's rival in a 51-year-old civil dispute.

Greece Ferry Sinking Kills 28

   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek ferry carrying 511 passengers and crew sank
after hitting a reef near the Aegean Sea island of Paros, coast guard officials
said. At least 28 people on board were killed and about 50 were unaccounted for.
A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after hearing news of the
sinking, the coast guard said. The ferry boat Express Samina sank after hitting
a reef late Tuesday in rough seas about two miles off the popular resort island,
officials said. Survivors said panicked passengers started jumping overboard
when the ship listed and began sinking after striking the rocky outcrop.

glimpse of the chaos out in the streets than sat in the cavernous convention

a rally Wednesday night in downtown Belgrade to ''celebrate its victory'' --
apparently hoping for a show of strength to demonstrate to Milosevic the

   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Spared earlier this year in an unprecedented action

reprieve to keep him from the Texas death chamber. McGinn, 43, was set for
lethal injection Wednesday for raping and bludgeoning with an ax his 12-year-old
stepdaughter more than seven years ago. An execution date set for earlier this
year was postponed after some of his paperwork was lost when a tornado struck
his attorney's Fort Worth office. Then on June 1, only moments before he could
have been put to death, Bush for the first time used his gubernatorial authority
to issue a one-time, 30-day reprieve for McGinn so additional DNA tests could be

<HEADLINE> Williams Will Have Olympic Medal  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Ricardo Williams Jr. will have an
Olympic medal to take home to his infant son, whose picture he
proudly tapes to his ankle before every fight.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to make it a nice shiny one for Ricardo Williams III.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't come for no bronze,'' Williams said. ''I came for a
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams assured himself of at least a bronze medal Wednesday,
fighting his way into the 139-pound Olympic boxing semifinals with
a 17-12 win over Russia's Alexandre Leonov.
</P>
<P>
   He became only the second American boxer to reach the
semifinals, where he will face big punching Cuban Diogenes Luna on
Friday for the right to fight for Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''May the best man win,'' Williams said. ''I've trained too hard
for this. I don't want it to go down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams joined 119-pound teammate Clarence Vinson in the
semifinals, with two more Americans still with a chance to get into
the medal rounds Wednesday night. Earlier Wednesday, Jose Navarro's
Olympics came to an end when he lost to Jermone Thomas of France at
112 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to take a medal home like I dreamed of doing,''
Navarro said. ''But I'm going to learn from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will be taking a medal home to Cincinnati and his
6-month-old son. He has fought through the Olympics with a picture
of his son sitting in front of an American flag taped to his left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who might be the slickest boxer on the U.S. team, used
a big third round in which he landed a number of left hands to turn
a fight that had been tied early into the round into a 13-8
advantage. Williams was able to coast much of the last round,
ending the fight by dancing away from his Russian opponent for a
17-12 win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fight best when I'm moving,'' Williams said. ''When I was
little, that was the first thing my father told me to do -- move,
move, move.''
</P>
<P>
   The win gave Williams a semifinal bout against Luna and a chance
to improve the 2-8 record American fighters have had against Cubans
in the last three Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to treat it like any other bout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luna is one of six Cubans in the semifinals, with three others
yet to fight their quarterfinal bouts. Though Luna won Wednesday,
Cuban super heavyweight Alexis Rubalcaba was eliminated in perhaps
the most crowd-pleasing fight of the games by Mukhtarkhan
Dildabekov of Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   Dildabekov took three standing 8-counts from the massive Cuban,
but gave Rubalcaba two standing 8-counts of his own in brawling his
way to a 25-12 win.
</P>
<P>
   Luna, meanwhile, showed tremendous punching power in stopping
his Egyptian opponent with a right hand in the second round that
sent him reeling across the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Cuban boxers, though, Luna comes right at his
opponent. That may play into the plan of the left-handed Williams,
who likes to counterpunch off an opponent's miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to feed him a lot of lefts,'' Williams said.
''Aggressive guys are ones who take a lot of punches. I'm ready to
give a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tom Mustin said the key for Williams will be to stay
away from Luna's right hand and stick to his game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got great punching power, but he can be hit fairly
easy,'' Mustin said of the Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   The win by Williams came several fights after Navarro lost a
23-12 decision to Thomas of France.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro was in the fight, losing 14-11, when the third round
apparently ended early. But he was dominated in the final round as
Thomas picked him apart with counterpunches as Navarro tried to be
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did my best,'' he said. ''I just had nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting the Olympics with 11 straight wins, U.S. boxers
are now 18-7 overall, with one other boxer eliminated for not
making weight.
</P>
<P>
   The team will already fall short of the total medals of the 1996
team, which won one gold and five bronze in Atlanta. But Mustin
wasn't giving up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not over yet,'' the U.S. coach said. ''If we can get the
rest of the these guys through it won't be a disappointment.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Arrested For Throwing Bottle  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A pair of 22-year-old men were arrested at Shea
Stadium after a beer bottle landed near Atlanta Braves relief
pitcher John Rocker as he prepared to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Maniaci of Wyckoff, N.J., was accused of throwing the
bottle Tuesday night and charged with reckless endangerment, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested was Maniaci's friend, Brian Peterson, 22, who
pleaded guilty in 1998 to manslaughter -- along with his girlfriend
-- in the death of their newborn son at a motel room in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, vilified by New Yorkers after disparaging them in a
magazine article last year, was loudly booed when he sprinted out
of the Braves bullpen in the eighth inning to face the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached the mound, a beer bottle came flying out of the
first-base box seats and hit about 10 feet from Rocker. Within a
minute, police were leading a man out of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox picked up the bottle and carried it
toward the dugout, discarding it before he reached the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything to say,'' Rocker said after the Braves
beat the Mets 7-1 to clinch the NL East championship.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, also of Wyckoff, was charged with obstructing
governmental administration and disorderly conduct, police said.
The Mets confirmed Peterson was the same man involved in the 1996
infant death in Newark, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was given a two-year sentence, six months shorter than
girlfriend Amy Grossberg's, after he agreed to testify against her.
Peterson was released from prison after serving 1&AMP;frac12; years and
Grossberg was released eight months early.

<HEADLINE> Beach Volleyball Said Changing  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- In an Olympic tournament of magic
moments for beach volleyball, one of the most enduring was a match
that had nothing to do with medals or glory.
</P>
<P>
   An injury forfeit by the Mexican men's team left a sellout crowd
at Bondi Beach stadium grumbling about the hour-long wait for the
next game.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong, who advanced without
hitting a ball, could have gone off to practice or have lunch.
Instead, Wong grabbed the stadium microphone and did what came
naturally -- he got a game going.
</P>
<P>
   Wong goaded NBC analyst Mike Dodd, a silver medalist at the
Atlanta Olympics, into donning an extra game uniform and taking the
court. Mexico's Juan Ibarra, whose Olympics had just ended because
of his partner's injury, stuck around to team with Dodd against
Wong and Heidger.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a sun-filled blue sky, the four played for the fun of
it, leaping and diving in a friendly but inspired competition. The
crowd cheered and danced in a celebration of beach culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the essence of our sport, it's just four guys going out on
a beach with a ball,'' Wong said afterward. ''We all were once at
that stage where we weren't professionals. It's not that hard to
recreate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other magic came from expected sources -- the celebrating that
greeted home favorites Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst's gold
medal in the women's competition; a flag-waving outburst when
Americans Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana upset favored Brazilians
Ze Marco de Melo and Ricardo Santos for the men's gold; the
never-ending party by Brazilian fans, with pounding drums and
gyrating bodies, as their heroes won three of the six medals.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers got exactly what they wanted, with the high-profile
competition on a picturesque beach attracting more than 160,000
spectators over the 10 days of competition. One of NBC's signature
shots showed Pacific waves carrying surfers to the white sand
behind the 10,000-seat stadium where rock music blared and fans
clapped, stomped and sang the days away.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Acosta, president of the international volleyball
federation FIVB, said the 2001 beach volleyball world tour already
had commitments for $4 million in prize money, a boost over past
years due to the Olympic exposure.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he said, the success of the Sydney tournament
convinced some skeptical International Olympic Committee members
that beach volleyball and its blatant promotion of audience
entertainment belonged in the games. IOC President Juan Antonio
Samaranch handed out the men's medals Tuesday, signaling that
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is something that only beach volleyball is bringing to
the Olympic spirit -- the joy for life,'' Acosta said.
</P>
<P>
   With growth comes change. Acosta announced the sport next year
would use rally scoring -- with a point awarded each time the ball
is put in play -- instead of the traditional side-out system in
which only the serving team can score.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the switch is television.
</P>
<P>
   Under rally scoring, the matches last an hour so that television
schedules remain intact. Side-out scoring can have long stretches
with no points, resulting in matches like the 80-minute
quarterfinal in which Brazil's Ze Marco de Melo and Ricardo Santos
ousted John Child and Mark Heese of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Players and others close to the game oppose the move, saying it
destroys fundamental elements of the beach game, such as the mental
toughness needed for prolonged side-out matches.
</P>
<P>
   By awarding a point for what is now siding out -- winning the
rally to regain the right to serve -- the rally system benefits
less-talented teams, said Gene Selznick, 70, a beach volleyball
legend from when the sport first became organized in southern
California after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''You haven't earned anything that way. It's not competitive,''
Selznick said. ''I understand the television issue, but don't ruin
sports because of television.''
</P>
<P>
   Acosta said a final decision on which system to use would come
after 2001, but he signaled the likely result, noting indoor
volleyball already changed to rally scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are getting more interest from television around the world.
We are having more sponsors coming to volleyball,'' Acosta said.
''Then why should we let beach volleyball drown because they want
to keep playing side-out?''
</P>
<P>
   He called it part of an evolution, with rally scoring requiring
a different kind of player than those from the beach culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will not be possible to play the rally point system with
the same attitude or with the same type of players,'' he said. ''A
new type of players are coming. They have to be more aggressive,
accept challenges, and win over fear. They are a different type and
we like this type.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new type would play for the fun of it to entertain
fans, like the old days on the beach, remains to be seen.

<HEADLINE> Kolat Seeks Wrestling Gold  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Cary Kolat may be the best wrestler in
the world without a championship to prove it. He can't think of a
better stage to win that first gold medal than the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Kolat, one of the most decorated U.S. amateur wrestlers ever but
one who has known mostly bad luck -- or is it bad karma? -- in
world-class competition, wrestles his first match Thursday
(Wednesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Also hitting the mats for the United States as Olympic wrestling
segues from Greco-Roman to freestyle are former world champion
Sammie Henson; Brandon Slay, the first Texan to make a U.S. Olympic
wrestling team; and Melvin Douglas, who, at 37, is nearly twice as
old as Greco-Roman medalist Garrett Lowney.
</P>
<P>
   Freestyle wrestling usually flies under the radar of sports-fan
detection in the United States, even in an Olympic year, yet it has
been one of the most consistent U.S. medal-producers, with 44 gold
medals and 99 medals overall.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the optimistic forecasts of the three-man U.S.
head coaching staff (that's one head coach for every 2.667
wrestlers), the United States may have trouble matching its 1996
Atlanta haul of three gold medals and five medals.
</P>
<P>
   First, the 10 weight classes have been cut to eight, reducing
the opportunities for medals. Second, the three 1996 gold medalists
-- Kurt Angle, Tom Brands and Kendall Cross -- have retired, at least
from amateur wrestling. (Angle can be seen in Australia, but only
on late-night telecasts of WWF matches from the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, several Americans are at weights in which dominating
wrestlers have emerged since Atlanta, including 167&AMP;frac12; pounds, where
Slay contends with three-time world champion Buvaisa Saitiev of
Russia, and 213&AMP;frac34; pounds, where Douglas, seventh in Atlanta at a
lighter weight class, replaces the more successful Angle.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think it's exciting being on this team,'' said Kolat,
who might be the top U.S. gold-medal hope. ''I think the U.S. team
is a bad draw for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolat can become the fourth consecutive American to win at 138&AMP;frac34;
pounds (63 kg), joining Randy Lewis (1984); John Smith (1988-1992),
now one of the U.S. tri-coaches; and Tom Brands (1996), whose
brother, Terry, wrestles Friday at 127&AMP;frac34; pounds (58 kg).
</P>
<P>
   ''Cary is the best wrestler in the world right now,'' said West
Virginia assistant coach Zeke Jones, who is working with Kolat in
Sydney. ''Nobody has been as consistent as him.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, it would seem, as star-crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Kolat, so renowned as a high school wrestler that his name is on
the road sign leading into tiny Rices Landing, Pa., finished
second, third and fourth in the last three world championships.
Twice in those three years, he was stripped of victories he won on
the mat.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the appeals and protests that led to those two
reversals, Kolat is personally responsible for two international
rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   Following a 1997 loss in which an opponent gained advantage by
untying his own shoes on the mat, wrestlers now must tape their
shoes. Also, all protested matches now are re-wrestled, rather than
the decision being awarded to the protesting wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Kolat, now 27 and a former two-time NCAA champion at Lock Haven,
said Sydney affords the perfect opportunity to make up for those
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't intend to be the guy that people say should have been
or could have been,'' Kolat said.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, also a two-time NCAA champion at Clemson, was a 1998
world champion who had an uneven 1999 season at 119 pounds (54 kg).
A different wrestler has won the world championship at the weight
the last three years, so there is no overwhelming favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am working very hard to eliminate technical mistakes and
turn it into perfection,'' Henson said. ''Perfection equals a gold
medal. I won't be shy. I want to win this thing with all of my
heart.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coach Has Sydney Presence  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Even from thousands of miles away in
China, the famed coach who pushed Chinese runners to world record
times is still having a hand in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Excluded from the Olympics after six of his runners failed drug
tests, Ma Junren was still at trackside Wednesday in virtual form,
following the progress of his last remaining Olympic competitor by
telephone as she qualified for the final of the women's 10,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
   Ma and Chinese sports official Cui Dalin kept an open line
throughout much of the race. Cui relayed back split times and the
track position of runner Li Ji as the race progressed and shouted
commands to her on nearly every lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's running normally, she's following the runner in front,''
Cui told Ma by mobile telephone as the race neared its end.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's off!'' he suddenly added as Li picked up her pace on the
last lap. The 19-year-old placed sixth in 32 minutes, 28.96
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ma's telephonic presence was the latest bizarre twist in his
on-again, off-again Olympic saga.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese sports officials left Ma and his runners out of the 1998
Asian Games after he refused to put them through qualifying. But
after a dismal showing in long- and middle-distance events by China
at those games, they brought Ma back for the Olympics in hopes of
reviving the nation's saging fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 10 days before the start of Olympic competition, China
announced that it was cutting 27 athletes from its team, among them
six of the seven runners Ma had been expected to take to Sydney. Ma
too was cut, leaving only his runner Li in the squad.
</P>
<P>
   China's track and field association said all six of the runners,
among them a former 5,000-meter world record holder, had failed
blood tests that checked for the banned performance-enhancing drug
EPO, or erthyropoietin.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese Olympic Committee spokeswoman, He Huixian, also
confirmed that ''the overwhelming majority'' of the dropped 27
athletes had suspicious EPO blood test results, but refused to
provide a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Ma and his runners, meanwhile, suddenly left the high-altitude
camp on the Tibetan plateau where they had been training for the
Olympics, Chinese media said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cui, head of sports in the northern Chinese province of
Liaoning, where Ma has his training center, denied that the
runners' tests had shown elevated red blood cell counts, a possible
sign of EPO use.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many reasons'' for the runners absence, he said,
refusing to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether they come or not is very normal. There are many major
competitions, whether it be the Olympics, the World Championships,
or the World Cup,'' Cui added. ''Some they take part in, others
they don't. It depends on the situation of Ma and his runners and
all sorts of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Cui said Ma was back in Liaoning, but is not in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Ma's crew of long- and middle-distance women runners, known as
''Ma's army,'' stunned the sports world with a slew of world
records in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The chain-smoking, gravel-voiced coach attributed their success
to his regimen of daily marathons and tonics of Chinese caterpillar
fungus, worm and turtle soup. He denied suggestions of doping.
</P>
<P>
   Li's personal best for the 10,000 meters is 32:14.97, minutes
behind the world record of 29:31.78 held by another of Ma's former
runners, Wang Junxia, who shattered the record in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Cui denied that Ma was directing Li's race from afar. ''He was
not giving any help. I was just telling him the times, how fast she
had run 1,000 meters, 2,000 meters,'' said Cui.
</P>
<P>
   But after tele-conferring with Ma as Li was running on the far
side of the track, Cui would jump to his feet as she ran past his
stand and shout commands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pay attention to your pace,'' he said on one lap. ''Just run
with her, that's fine,'' he said on another.

By The Associated Press	   No, the Atlanta Braves don't clinch a division title
when they
report for spring training. It only seems that way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Division titles don't come easy, but it's still all about
winning the World Series,'' Tom Glavine said after the Braves beat
the New York Mets 7-1 Tuesday night to wrap up the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves painfully know, the first eight of those division
titles led to only one World Series title, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to start preparing for the playoffs,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ''We've got to start reading the scouting
reports and start getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   While some teams celebrate wildly when they clinch a division,
the Braves react much more calmly. The shook hands on the field,
keeping the high-fives to a minimum. The only sign this victory
meant more came when Atlanta relievers ran out of the bullpen to
join their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to show anybody up out there,'' Cox said.
''It's not the World Series, it's the playoffs, the division. But
you absolutely should celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games, it was Colorado 7, Arizona 6; Philadelphia 10,
Chicago 4; Los Angeles 9, San Francisco 0; Milwaukee 7, Cincinnati
4; St. Louis 7, San Diego 1; Pittsburgh 9, Houston 4; and Florida
5, Montreal 4, in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   At New York, John Burkett (10-6) improved to 3-0 against the
Mets this season, allowing three hits in six innings. Burkett also
hit an RBI single off Al Leiter (16-8) in the fifth for the game's
first run.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker drew loud jeers when he sprinted out of the Braves
bullpen to relieve in the eighth. A beer bottle landed about 10
feet from him as he prepared to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   New York can clinch the wild card with one more win or Los
Angeles loss.
Rockies 7, Diamondbacks 6:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was eliminated from playoff contention as Todd Helton
and Todd Hollandsworth hit two-run homers at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks won the NL West in 1999, only their second
season, and their slide this year might cost manager Buck Showalter
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo went 4-for-5, former Diamondback Bobby Chouinard
(2-2) worked one inning and Jose Jimenez got five outs for his 22nd
save.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Pierre hit an RBI groundout in the seventh to break a 6-all
tie against Mike Morgan (5-5).
Phillies 10, Cubs 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Wrigley Field, Omar Daal (4-19) avoided becoming the major
league's first 20-game loser in 20 years, helping his cause with a
two-out, two-run double in the second. He had been scheduled to
start Sunday's season finale at Florida, but won't pitch again this
year because of a sore knee. Jon Lieber (12-11) gave up four runs
and 10 hits in seven innings.
Dodgers 9, Giants 0:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield hit just his second homer since Aug. 19 and
Darren Dreifort (12-8) combined with two relievers on a two-hitter
at Dodger Stadium. Los Angeles won for the ninth time in 10 games,
beating Russ Ortiz (13-12), who allowed six runs and seven hits in
six-plus innings.
Brewers 7, Reds 4:
</P>
<P>
   In the start of the final series at County Stadium, Jeromy
Burnitz homered and doubled, and Jamey Wright (7-8) won for the
first time since July 28, allowing four runs -- three earned -- and
eight hits in 7 1-3 innings. Curtis Leskanic got four outs for his
12th save, and Steve Parris (12-16) was tagged for five runs on 10
hits in 4 2-3 innings.
Cardinals 7, Padres 1:
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes (11-9) won for the first time since July 13, allowing
one run and five hits in six innings at San Diego, and Edgar
Renteria drove in three runs. Jim Edmonds hit a two-run homer in
the third off Adam Eaton (6-4), his career-high 42nd.
Pirates 9, Astros 4:
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles hit a three-run homer in the first inning off Chris
Holt at Pittsburgh and Kris Benson (10-12) won for the second time
in 13 starts, allowing two runs and four hits in seven innings with
nine strikeouts.
Marlins 5, Expos 4:
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd singled in the winning run off Steve Kline in the
10th, sending visiting Montreal to its fourth straight loss.
Antonio Alfonseca (5-6) pitched a perfect 10th.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australia went outside to dominate
inside.
</P>
<P>
   With centers Jenny Whittle and Lauren Jackson combining for five
3-pointers, Australia advanced to the women's Olympic basketball
semifinals with a 76-48 victory over Poland and 7-foot-2 Margo
Dydek on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first four field goals of the game for Australia (6-0) were
a jumper by the 6-5 Jackson and three 3-pointers by the 6-6
Whittle, matching her total for the tournament. When forward Carla
Boyd hit a 3 with 15:27 left in the first half, the home country
had a 16-4 lead and Dydek had been negated as an inside force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I was going to get a chance to shoot a lot of 3s
because Dydek doesn't like to come out. So I knew I had to be on
target tonight,'' Whittle said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, which will play the winner of the Brazil-Russia
quarterfinal in the semifinals, has gotten this far in the Olympics
twice -- 1988, when it finished fourth, and 1996, when it won the
bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't be any more excited than we are about making the
semifinals,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dydek, who plays for the WNBA's Utah Starzz, entered the
quarterfinals as the tournament's leading scorer (22.0), rebounder
(12.2) and shot blocker (3.0).
</P>
<P>
   Her numbers against Australia were 12 points on 5-for-15
shooting, 12 rebounds and one blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our two bigs did a fantastic job on Dydek,''
Australia coach Tom Maher said. ''We got a lot of open shots and
played a lot of good defense. A coach would have to be stupid to
say he's not pleased with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson finished with 17 points and nine rebounds, while Whittle
had 16 points and seven rebounds. Whittle was 4-for-6 from 3-point
range; Jackson was 1-for-3 on 3s and had six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew we had to play hard against Margo and we did,''
Jackson said. ''Really, we did what we've been doing all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia pulled away from a 43-28 halftime lead, again using
long jumpers as Whittle hit a 3 and another shot where her foot was
on the line as part of an 11-4 opening run.
</P>
<P>
   Elzbieta Trzesniewska also had 12 points for Poland (3-3), which
was making its first Olympic appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came here hoping to win a medal and now that won't
happen,'' Trzesniewska said. ''Maybe people didn't think so, but we
showed we could be able to.''

<HEADLINE> Freeh, Reno Defend Government's Case  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prosecutors had a choice: Prosecute
scientist Wen Ho Lee and risk revealing classified nuclear weapon
information in court or give him a deal that would force him to
reveal what he did with the information he downloaded on computer
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was clear-cut, FBI Director Louis Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the moment we learned last year that our nation's nuclear
secrets were on missing portable tapes, we have had a central goal
in this matter: to find out what happened to the tapes,'' Freeh
told a Senate hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And, Attorney General Janet Reno said, ''This plea agreement is
our best chance to find out what happened to the computer tapes
containing some of the nation's most important nuclear designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh appeared before the committee to defend the
government's investigation and treatment of Lee, who was held in
solitary confinement without bail for nine months before being
released on terms of the plea bargain. On Wednesday, a Senate
subcommittee will continue questioning members of the Energy
Department, the Justice Department and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to only one of the 59 counts of his grand
jury indictment. In exchange, he was sentenced to time served and
agreed to tell officials what happened to the information he
downloaded at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was not at Tuesday's hearing. In a statement, his lawyers
said they wanted fair treatment for him from the government, and
the scientist hopes in time ''the world will better understand that
he has been and continues to be a loyal and proud citizen of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Lee is no hero,'' Reno said, rejecting his widespread
portrayal since his release as a victim. ''He is no absent-minded
professor. He is a felon. He committed a very serious, calculated
crime, and he pled guilty to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain, however, prompted U.S. District Judge James
Parker to apologize to Lee for the nine-month pretrial imprisonment
and to accuse government officials in charge of the case of
embarrassing ''our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers at Tuesday's hearing also found much to complain
about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the FBI's counterintelligence investigation was a
gravely flawed exercise, characterized by inadequate resources,
lack of management attention and missed opportunities,'' the Senate
Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a textbook example of how not to conduct an
investigation,'' added Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada, top Democrat
on Shelby's committee. He called it a ''Keystone Kops'' operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's supporters also contend the fired Los Alamos scientist, a
U.S. citizen born in Taiwan and educated in the United States, was
targeted because he is Asian-American. Some are demanding a
presidential pardon and an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has refused to apologize but has ordered an internal review
of Justice Department actions. She and Freeh deny, however, that
Lee was targeted because he is Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical to understand that Dr. Lee's conduct was not
inadvertent, it was not careless and it was not innocent,'' Freeh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Convicting Lee likely would have required revealing those
secrets in court to prove their importance, Freeh said, ''crossing
an exposure threshold we had already determined at the highest
level of government posed an unacceptable risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director did acknowledge the agents who interrogated Lee
should not have reminded him that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were
executed in the 1950s for espionage. ''Confrontational interviews
often call for tough statements by investigators, but that
implication was inappropriate,'' he said. Lee was never charged
with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Reno to appoint an
independent investigator, saying Congress and the Justice
Department are too close to the matter to be perceived as being
fair.

<HEADLINE> Budget Deals Sought in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Budget bargainers are narrowing differences on
a number of issues, but lawmakers facing plenty of unfinished
business have given initial approval to a stopgap bill providing
extra time for negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Top administration officials, including White House chief of
staff John Podesta, were expected on Capitol Hill Wednesday as the
two sides sought agreement on one bill financing federal land
programs and another for housing, veterans, the environment and
science.
</P>
<P>
   But with Sunday's start of fiscal 2001 looming, the House voted
415-2 Tuesday to keep federal agencies functioning for the first
six days of the new year. Senate passage and President Clinton's
signature were expected later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 535 different opinions on almost any issue,'' said
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.,
referring to members of Congress. ''It takes a while to resolve
those differences.''
</P>
<P>
   With leaders hoping to send lawmakers home by mid-October for
the presidential and congressional elections, the drive to solve
the disputes was being stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession by the administration, bargainers agreed to
block the Transportation Department from issuing a final rule in
fiscal 2001 limiting truckers' hours, said an official familiar
with the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The department has been working on a rule that would have
dropped the maximum number of daily driving hours to 12 from its
current 16 in an effort to reduce accidents caused by fatigue. But
the proposal has been widely opposed, with the trucking industry
and drivers' union complaining it would hurt them economically and
safety advocates saying it does not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate issue, leading lawmakers of both parties reached a
compromise Tuesday to create a major new land conservation program,
a proposal that has been one of the biggest remaining budget
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would create a six-year program, growing to $3 billion
annually by 2005, for federal and state land purchases, wildlife
management, historic preservation and other initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, Sen. Jeff
Bingaman, D-N.M., Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., the top members of the House and Senate resources
committees. But it was unclear if the measure would get support
from other members of Congress or from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has supported a House-passed bill that would provide $3
billion annually for land programs for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   House-Senate bargainers neared agreement on a $23.6 billion
measure financing energy and water projects.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter, White House chief of staff John Podesta wrote
that Clinton would veto the measure if it contained a provision
blocking the Army Corps of Engineers from raising water levels on
the Missouri River, a fight that has pitted environmentalists
against downstream farmers and shippers. Republicans vowed that, at
least for now, the provision would stay in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in an example of the spending bills' steadily rising
price tags, the compromise energy and water measure was $1.9
billion bigger than the House-passed version, and $1.1 billion
larger than the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Included were millions for projects included in neither measure,
including $3 million for a new water project in DeSoto County,
Miss., and $3 million for work on Baltimore's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Another growing measure was the bill financing housing,
veterans, environment and science programs. White House and
congressional bargainers were nearing agreement on a compromise
that would spend close to the Senate's $108 billion, more than $6
billion higher than what the House approved.
</P>
<P>
   Just two of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2001 have
become law.
</P>
<P>
   Several stopgap bills are likely to be needed before all the
spending bills can be completed. White House budget office
spokeswoman Linda Ricci said Clinton would sign a series of
short-term measures ''if that's what it takes for Congress to
buckle down and finish its work.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the stopgap bill were Reps. Peter DeFazio,
D-Ore., and Fortney ''Pete'' Stark, D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> American League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians can't catch the Oakland Athletics in the
AL wild card race, and no one will pass the Chicago White Sox in
the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson retired 15 straight hitters and won his 19th game as
Oakland stayed 1&AMP;frac12; games ahead of Cleveland for the AL wild card
spot with a 10-3 victory over Anaheim on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics also stayed a half-game behind Seattle, which beat
Texas 5-0, in the AL West. Despite winning 18 of 23, the Athletics
(87-69) can't shake the Indians (86-71), who beat Minnesota 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (19-6) will get a shot at his first 20-win season Sunday
against Texas -- but only if the A's haven't clinched a playoff
spot. If Oakland is already headed to the postseason, manager Art
Howe plans to save his ace for the playoff opener Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a no-brainer, (but) it might be a big game,'' Howe
said. ''Hopefully it doesn't mean anything, but it probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White Sox -- despite losing 4-3 to Boston --
clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs when the
Yankees lost 2-1 at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key for us is to get healthy,'' manager Jerry Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   In other AL games, Baltimore beat Toronto 2-1 and Kansas City
topped Detroit 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rough first, Hudson blasted through Anaheim with his
customary pinpoint control that led to five strikeouts and even
more weak grounders to the infield. After the Angels scored twice
in the first, he didn't allow another baserunner until walking Mo
Vaughn in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer and Jason Giambi added a
three-run shot in the eighth for host Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The A's scored five runs in a disastrous first inning for Angels
starter Scott Schoeneweis (7-10), who lost for the third time in
four starts as Anaheim was officially eliminated from the playoff
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're playing some good baseball right now,'' Angels manager
Mike Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
Indians 4, Twins 2
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley showed again that he's more than a Yankees' killer,
pitching seven solid innings as host Cleveland kept pace with
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (15-11) allowed two runs and six hits, improving to 5-1
with a 3.43 ERA in September.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome dribbled home the go-ahead run off J.C. Romero (2-7)
and Jolbert Cabrera hit his second career homer for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need some help,'' Thome said. ''But as long as we win our
games, I think we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
Mariners 5, Rangers 0
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (17-10) pitched a six-hitter to win his fourth
straight September start and host Seattle held on to first place in
the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle won its second straight following losses in the first
three games of a four-game series against the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a 3-0 lead in the third off Ryan Glynn (5-6)
on Rickey Henderson's RBI single and Mike Cameron's two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
Red Sox 4, White Sox 3
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez allowed just one hit before leaving after five
innings and Boston kept its remote playoff chances alive, winning
at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (18-6), who retired the first 13 batters before Carlos
Lee hit a single to right center with one out in the fifth, was not
injured when he was removed from what might have been his final
appearance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra hit a two-run homer off Kevin Beirne (1-3) in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Devil Rays 2, Yankees 1
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff's RBI single with two outs in the ninth inning off
Jeff Nelson (8-4) gave Tampa Bay a victory over New York and
prevented the Yankees from clinching the AL East title.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada had hit a game-tying homer in the top half off
Roberto Hernandez (4-6) to give New York a chance to wrap up its
fourth division crown in five years. The Yankees, who have lost 10
of 13, are assured of at least a tie in the division and can win it
with one more win or losses by Boston and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Orioles 2, Blue Jays 1
</P>
<P>
   Brook Fordyce drove in the tiebreaking run with a seventh-inning
sacrifice fly off David Wells (20-7) as Baltimore further dimmed
Toronto's flickering playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mercedes (13-7) allowed one run and five hits in seven
innings to snap a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
Royals 7, Tigers 6
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ordaz hit a game-winning single in the ninth inning off
Willie Blair (10-6) as Kansas City rallied from four runs down to
beat Detroit.

<HEADLINE> 36 Dead From Greece Ship Sinking  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek ferry carrying 510 passengers and
crew sank after hitting a rocky islet near the Aegean Sea island of
Paros, rescue officials said Wednesday. At least 36 people were
killed and another 44 were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after
hearing news of the sinking, the coast guard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ship fell apart as it sank. There were people hanging from
the railings. Children were crying and old people were screaming,''
said survivor Zoe Kolida. ''I jumped in and looked back after about
50 meters (165 feet) and the ship was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire chief Andreas Kois said 36 people were confirmed dead after
the 34-year-old ferry boat Express Samina sank after hitting a
large patch of rocks late Tuesday in rough seas about two miles off
the popular resort island.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said panicked passengers started jumping overboard
when the ship listed and began sinking. Dozens of fishing boats,
other vessels and British Navy helicopters rushed to the scene to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Kois said his force of 100 firefighters had picked up 17 of the
36 bodies on Punta beach, a popular resort.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Paros Health Center, Dimitris Stavrakis, said
there were ''a number of young children among the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast guard officials were baffled as to why the 450-foot,
4,407-ton Express Samina hit the Portes islet, which is marked on
maritime charts and has a navigation light.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be blind not to see it,'' Coast guard chief
Andreas Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of another ferry, Theoharis Tsoukalas, said he made
the same run almost every day and could not remember any other ship
ever hitting the islet.
</P>
<P>
   Greek air force planes and navy ships, aided by British
warships, scoured the area as life rafts and vests washed ashore.
Rescue efforts were hampered by a fresh gale with winds blowing up
to 46 mph.
</P>
<P>
   British warships on an exercise near the scene launched three
helicopters and rescued at least 12 people clinging to rocks in the
swelling seas. They were suffering from cold, shock and minor cuts
and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Sirigos said 430 people from the ship had been accounted for at
the island's health center. He appealed for any survivors staying
at hotels or private homes to register at the health center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem we have is with residents of Paros who may have
gone home and have not reported in,'' Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry makes regularly scheduled runs from the Athens port of
Piraeus to the island of Samos. It was about to make a stop on
Paros, 103 miles southeast of Athens, when it hit the reef.
</P>
<P>
   According to Minoan Flying Dolphins, the Express Samina's owner,
there were 447 passengers and 63 crew members aboard the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers and crew aboard said the Express Samina sank within
45 minutes of hitting the islet.
</P>
<P>
   Sirigos said the coast guard was also investigating why it took
the crew nearly 20 minutes to inform the coast guard the ship was
sinking. A crew member interviewed by telephone said there was an
orderly evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was time enough for all of us to get out, including the
people in the cabins. We got them all out,'' Stephanos
Papadopoulos, a ship's officer, told Athens' Antenna television.
</P>
<P>
   But passengers reported panic as the ship began listing to the
right after hitting the rocky outcropping.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, engineer Stamatis Delavinias, said the
collision ''was very strong. I thought of the Titanic. The boat
sank in about half an hour. There were old women and others who
were afraid to jump in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives waiting to board a Paros-bound ferry from Piraeus said
they were frustrated at the lack of information.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if they are alive or dead. I heard they were
getting people out but I don't know anything,'' said Ioulia
Vassalaki, whose brother was rescued but mother was missing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Pressure? What pressure?
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Marion Jones, after two days of intense scrutiny over
her husband's alleged steroid use, returned to the Olympic track
Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT) to win her qualifying heat in the
women's 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   And a beaming Venus Williams, facing an opponent with nothing to
lose in the Olympic final, cruised to a straight-set victory over
Elena Dementieva of Russia for the gold medal in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, winner of the Sydney 100 meters, took the next step in
her quest for five gold medals. She also answered -- emphatically --
those who wondered if the hoopla surrounding husband C.J. Hunter
would knock her off stride.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter repeatedly failed drug tests for a banned steroid,
international track officials charged this week. The world champion
shot putter, at an emotional news conference with Jones, denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Jones received loud applause when introduced before her heat,
and responded with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Sydney drug flap, world record-holder Mihaela
Melinte of Romania was removed from the Olympic Stadium track
infield just before her throw in the hammer competition. She was
suspended for using for the steroid nandrolone -- the same substance
found in Hunter's test.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, track and field competition had resumed with a historic
first: Marla Runyan, the first U.S. paralympian to reach the
Olympics, advanced past the qualifying round of the women's 1,500
meters.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan, who is legally blind, was joined in the semifinals by
teammate Suzy Favor Hamilton. A third American, Shayne Culpepper
was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, American Chris Huffins was fastest in the 100
meters as the men began the decathlon. Heavy overnight rain had
dissipated by the start of the events, but the track remained
slick.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TENNIS: Venus Williams became only the second player to win
Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the Olympics in the same year with her
6-2, 6-4 victory in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It took her just 58 minutes to dismiss Dementieva and join
Steffi Graf as the only players with the tennis triple. An exultant
Williams waved to the crowd, bowed and twirled happily at the net.
Then she borrowed a U.S. flag from someone in the stands, raising
it as she smiled widely.
</P>
<P>
   Williams tries for her second gold when she and sister Serena
play in the doubles final Thursday (Wednesday night EDT) against
Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- CYCLING: Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong wasn't
expecting a medal, so he wasn't disappointed Tuesday. Armstrong
finished 13th in the Olympics road race, where the gold went to
fellow Tour winner Jan Ullrich of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the two-time defending tour champion, was favored to
win the individual time trial on Saturday (Friday night EDT).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- GYMNASTICS: No gold? Then no silver, and no bronze either.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian gymnastics team, after 16-year-old Andreea Raducan
lost her all-around gold for taking cold pills containing a banned
substance, protested by sending back its silver and bronze medals
from the same event, Romanian national TV reported.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on an official Romanian protest was scheduled
Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT). IOC spokesman Franklin
Servan-Schreiber said the Romanians had not yet rejected the
medals, and were waiting until after the hearing to make a decision
on their return.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanians had swept the top three spots in the competition,
and Raducan was the first Romanian to win the all-around title
since Nadia Comaneci in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The report also quoted Romanian coach Octavian Belu as saying
that Raducan had decided to quit gymnastics. Even the IOC officials
who stripped her of the medal acknowledged the diminutive gymnast
had unwittingly ingested the banned substance, pseudoephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Belu could not be reached for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot-10, 82-pound Raducan was stripped of her gold from
the women's all-around on Tuesday. She is the first gymnast ever to
be stripped of a medal because of a drug violation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- TAEKWANDO: After making the Olympics through the generosity of
her best friend, American Kay Poe was upset in her first round
flyweight match. Poe was defeated 4-3 by Hanne Hoegh Poulsen of
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Poe, under Olympic rules, could still win a bronze medal. She
had expected to perform better after the gesture that brought her
to Sydney. Poe had suffered a dislocated kneecap in the Olympic
trials semifinal; unable to fight, she would have lost her spot to
her best friend, Esther Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who would have been a medal longshot, forfeited the match
to clear Poe's Olympic path.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: Early success have given way to late Olympic woe for
the U.S. boxers. Flyweight Jose Navarro became the third U.S.
fighter in four tries to lose in the quarterfinals when he was
outpointed, 23-12, by Jerome Thomas of France.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro, 19, closed to within 14-11 late in the third round
before Thomas dominated the final 2 minutes. The only American to
reach the semifinals is Clarence Vinson at 119 pounds. All
semifinalists are assured at least a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SOFTBALL: Completing an extraordinary comeback from the edge
of disaster, the U.S. softball team successfully defended its
Olympic gold medal with a 2-1, come-from-behind victory over Japan
on a raw, rainy evening.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in its fifth extra-inning game Down Under, the Americans
-- unable to catch a break for much of the Olympics -- took advantage
of a mistake to defend their Atlanta gold. After a pair of eighth
inning walks, a shot to left field by Laura Berg was misplayed by
outfielder Shiori Koseki, who landed a glove on the ball but
couldn't hold on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw her going back on it, and the ball just went out of her
glove,'' Berg said. ''We've been very unlucky in this whole
tournament, but luck finally went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   All the way.
</P>
<P>
   Before Koseki could recover, pinch-runner Jennifer McFalls had
scored the game-winner. The U.S. women, left for dead after a
three-game losing streak in the preliminary round, were suddenly
alive, well and celebrating at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   With five days of competition left, the United States topped the
medal chart with 63 (25 gold, 15 silver, 23 bronze). Russia was
next with 51 (17-14-20), followed by China's 50 (22-14-14).

   Pete Vagenas was the lone American scorer Tuesday, netting a

<HEADLINE> Students Shot at New Orleans School  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Each morning, students entering Carter G.
Woodson Middle School step through metal detectors while security
officers patrol the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of the traditional ways of ensuring school safety could
stop gunfire from erupting Tuesday as a 13-year-old and a
15-year-old traded shots in the school's crowded breezeway shortly
before noon.
</P>
<P>
   The younger boy got the gun from outside a chain-link fence and
shot the 15-year-old, only to have the older boy grab the gun and
shoot him in the back as he ran away, police Lt. Marlon Defillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said it wasn't clear what prompted the argument between
the two boys, but said detectives believed the dispute started
several hours before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-year-old boy who allegedly passed the gun to his
13-year-old friend is a former student at the school who had
recently been expelled for fighting, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded boys, both eighth-graders, were in critical
condition Wednesday. The teen who allegedly slipped the .38-caliber
revolver into the school faces felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This horrifying event brings too close to home the widespread
proliferation of gun violence and underscores our fighting belief
that handguns are too easily available to children,'' Mayor Marc
Morial said.
</P>
<P>
   Several fights had been reported over the past few weeks at the
600-student school, which sits in a poor neighborhood next to a
rundown housing project.
</P>
<P>
   But school superintendent Alfonse Davis denied that the shooting
was linked to any previous violence. ''There's no connection
between this incident and any past incidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pandemonium broke out after the shooting, as hundreds of parents
lined up to collect their children. Some yelled at police and
security guards, angry that no one saw the gun before the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Beronica Lewis hugged her daughter, Neshetta, 15, when she came
out of the school, saying she didn't want to send the child back
for classes. ''They could come back here and shoot again,'' Lewis
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old boy accused of providing the handgun, Alfred
Anderson, was arrested without incident about five hours after the
shooting at his home in a nearby housing project, Defillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was booked on charges of illegally carrying a weapon
and being a principal to attempted first-degree murder, Defillo
said. He faced a detention hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of students were in the breezeway and hundreds were in a
nearby cafeteria when the shots were fired. Teachers kept them
inside classrooms while the two wounded boys were taken to Charity
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitalized 13-year-old boy, who was not identified, will
be booked with attempted murder when he is released, Defillo said.
The 15-year-old was identified as William Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington, shot in the chest, had a kidney and spleen removed
during surgery, said hospital spokeswoman Jean Patterson. She said
doctors are unsure whether the 13-year-old will make a full
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Classes at the middle school were canceled until Monday,
although the school will remain open for students who want to talk
with counselors. Two or three police officers will be assigned to
the school when it reopens, in addition to the usual 10 assigned to
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, New Orleans was one of the first cities to sue
gunmakers to recover the cost of gun violence and accidental
shootings involving children. About 25 other municipalities have
filed similar lawsuits. Some have been dismissed while courts have
allowed others to continue.

<HEADLINE> Ivorian Junta Boss Isolated  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Nine months after Ivory Coast's
first coup, junta boss Gen. Robert Guei is increasingly isolated
among African leaders and beleaguered at home by a simmering ethnic
and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of a visit by a delegation of influential African
presidents looking for peaceful solutions to a political crisis
that threatens war, Guei rejected outside interference Tuesday and
said Ivorians could manage their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of the chiefs of state who came can impose what must be
in Ivory Coast,'' Guei told a throng of 300 supporters outside
presidential offices in the main city of Abidjan. ''We have all the
solutions to all our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments seemed likely to fuel concerns of mounting
instability in Ivory Coast, long a West African economic powerhouse
and financial center in a region fraught by civil wars and
instability.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that
Guei, who is standing in elections set for Oct. 22, could not be
both ''umpire and player'' in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Simmering xenophobia and ethnic tensions have contributed to the
political crisis, which centers around concerns over whether Guei's
main rival Alassane Dramane Ouattara should be allowed to stand
against the military leader in presidential elections set for Oct.
22.
</P>
<P>
   The regime has suggested Ouattara may be ineligible under a new
constitutional provision because at least one of Ouattara's parents
was born in Burkina Faso. Ouattara, a northerner in a political
arena long dominated by southerners, insists both his parents were
Ivorian-born.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting African delegation, which also included the
presidents of regional powerhouses South Africa and Algeria,
proposed that all candidates be allowed to run.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of placard-waving Guei supporters who were campaigning
Tuesday in front of the presidential offices rejected that
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say 'no' to foreigners in our country,'' said Stanislas
Tape, starting a similar chant among the crowd. Some among the
crowd chanted anti-foreigner slogans and angrily denounced the
African delegation for alleged meddling in Ivorian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Guei thanked the crowd for showing their ''patriotism'' and
called on them to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's show of support for Guei came despite a junta ban on
political gatherings. The supporters said they were members of a
study group.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's mission by Guei's fellow African leaders represented
unusually quick and concerted action by the normally conservative
Organization of African Unity. The OAU has long defended the
sovereignty of individual members.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders like South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's
Obasanjo have grown increasingly concerned that political upheaval
across the continent is hindering economic investment and growth.
</P>
<P>
   The trip also underscored African concerns that any conflict in
Ivory Coast could spill over into neighboring countries and deprive
the region of its economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   Guei insisted that Ivory Coast was a ''nation of peace'' that
would solve its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since taking power in a Dec. 24 coup d'etat that toppled
Henri Konan Bedie, Guei's junta has already weathered two mutinies
and a shooting last week that Guei said was a failed attempt on his
life. Dozens of soldiers were subsequently arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, military officials claimed that two deposed members
of Guei's junta were on the run after the military seized a cache
of weapons from one of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Lassana Palenfo and Brig. Gen. Abdoulaye Coulibaly were
second and third in command, respectively, under Guei. They were
ejected from the junta last week in the wake of the alleged
assassination attempt. They are both from the north -- the base of
support for Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans party.
</P>
<P>
   Many supporters of Ouattara, a former International Monetary
Fund deputy managing director and prime minister, are fearful the
junta is planning a move against him and have surrounded his home
to protect it.

<HEADLINE> Senate Mulls Domestic Violence Act  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women's rights groups and President Clinton
began heaping pressure on the Republican-controlled Senate to renew
the Violence Against Women Act that is to expire Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now time for the Senate to act,'' Clinton said. ''With
over 70 sponsors in the Senate, there is no reason for delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the act is at ''the top'' of Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott's list and could come up for a vote this week, his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The act's renewal passed the House, 415-3 on Tuesday. It
authorizes $3.6 billion over five years for programs that include
law enforcement and judicial training, grants for domestic violence
shelters, child abuse prevention programs and a national domestic
violence hot line. It was originally passed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   National Organization for Women President Patricia Ireland said
renewal ''is down to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some conservative members of Congress, including the
leadership, apparently do not consider stopping violence against
women a national priority,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said action has been
taken to keep money flowing even if Congress does not meet
Saturday's deadline. ''It remains a priority of this Congress,''
Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate version may face hurdles. Senate Republicans have
floated the idea of attaching the legislation to a bill that would
overhaul the nation's bankruptcy laws. The twinned proposals would
then be appended to one of the 11 appropriations bills that
Congress still must enact to keep the government in operation.
Women's rights groups oppose such action.
</P>
<P>
   House members voting against the measure were Republican Reps.
Helen Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, John Hostettler of Indiana and Mark
Sanford Jr. of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The House action came one day after Clinton accused lawmakers of
treating the measure like a political football for its stalled
passage.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said Tuesday the House ''has taken an
important bipartisan step toward final passage of this much-needed
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure remains without a key provision that would allow
rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The Supreme
Court said in May that it is up to states, not Congress, to choose
whether to protect women in that way, and Congressional Democrats
tried but failed this year to reinstate the provision in acceptable
language.
</P>
<P>
   As left by the Supreme Court, the law now essentially provides a
federal dispensary for grants and programs aimed at preventing
family violence and helping abused spouses -- normally women -- flee
it.

<HEADLINE> Experts Picked To Probe 'Carnivore'  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A team of legal scholars and information
technology experts affiliated with the Illinois Institute of
Technology has been chosen to review the FBI's controversial
''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
   Six people -- four from the IIT Research Institute's Virginia
facility and two legal experts who specialize in privacy issues --
will begin the analysis at a laboratory in Lanham, Md. on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department hired the group Tuesday to analyze
whether ''Carnivore'' has adequate protections against abuse. The
team expects to finish a report for public comment in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often there are more protections with concern to government
surveillance than private ... but as citizens we should be
concerned about both,'' said Harold Krent, one of the legal experts
who is associate dean of Chicago-Kent College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   The project's goal is to see whether Carnivore increases the
risk that FBI agents or someone else -- intentionally or
unintentionally, legally or illegally -- will see electronic
communications they have no right to see, and whether Carnivore can
safeguard against that risk.
</P>
<P>
   Krent said he believes his team was chosen because ''we were one
of the few proposals that talked about an interdisciplinary
review'' -- both technical and legal.
</P>
<P>
   He said legal questions might include how Carnivore
differentiates between people with the same names, or those who use
aliases. He said the system also must account for people who might
be using more than one information service provider, such as
America Online or Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore has drawn criticism from Congress and civil
libertarians. And some academics objected to FBI insistence on both
security checks of evaluation panel members and on veto power over
any changes in that panel, saying it could exclude critics of
government surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   They also criticized Justice's insistence on the right to edit
the team's report. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology
withdrew from the bidding because of its objections, said a senior
Justice official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The government said 11 private and academic organizations bid to
do the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''The review team will have full access to any information they
need to perform their review,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Stephen Colgate, who led the selection process. ''This organization
has both the technical expertise and the dedication to the project
to provide the most thorough, independent and timely review.''
</P>
<P>
   Krent and other members of the IIT team said they are confident
they can work independently enough to do a thorough job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's concerned about making sure this is an open
process, but we have assurance that it will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Watson, a senior vice president for the systems technology
sector at the IIT Research Institute facility in Virginia, said he
and his staff routinely do checks on systems for the Department of
Defense, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Institutes
of Health and have had no problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnivore system, installed by the FBI on the network of
Internet service providers, has software that scans Internet
traffic as it moves through that provider's network. The FBI says
it configures the software to capture e-mail to or from someone
under investigation, and that court orders limit which e-mails
agents can see.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates say only the FBI knows what Carnivore can
do, and Internet providers are not allowed access to the system.
They ask why the FBI retains control of Carnivore equipment and
doesn't give it to Internet providers so they can comply with court
orders.
</P>
<P>
   The government will continue to use the system during the study
-- a move criticized by David Sobel, counsel for the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, which filed a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit to obtain documents about the system.

<HEADLINE> Civilians Kill 3 Philippine Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- The mutilated bodies of three Muslim
guerrillas -- including a prominent commander -- were dumped
Wednesday at a police station on a southern Philippine island where
thousands of troops are looking for 17 hostages, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The three members of Abu Sayyaf were killed by frightened
villagers in Lapa, where a group of the rebels tried to hide on
Tuesday from pursuing troops, witnesses said. But the villagers
resisted and there was a fight. The three and another three
villagers were killed and the rest of the rebels escaped, the
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Abu Sayyaf rebels have fled through the jungles of
Jolo island with their hostages since Sept. 16. That's when the
Philippine government launched an assault meant to free the
captives: one American, three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 people on Jolo have fled their homes since the
raid began, local officials said, because of aerial bombardments
and fear of rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fled to that village because of the bombing of our own
village,'' said Langka Dahim. ''If there are Abu Sayyaf rebels
there, we will be bombed again.''
</P>
<P>
   The military insists only two civilians have been killed and
four injured in the attack, but unconfirmed reports continue to
mount of much higher casualties and extensive damage to villages.
</P>
<P>
   The three dead rebels included Hibib Sabtal Arola, who
participated in the kidnapping of 21 tourists and workers from a
Malaysian diving resort on April 23, officials said. Their bodies,
apparently mutilated by the villagers, were dumped by soldiers
outside the police station to be claimed by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's also a warning,'' said Police Chief Mohamad Alamia.
''People will know that people who do bad things end up like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels have kidnapped scores of hostages since
March. Most have been released after millions of dollars in ransom
payments by Libya and Malaysia, negotiators say.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada has ordered the military to look into
reports of human rights abuses during the attack, the presidential
palace said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jolo Congressman Hussin Amin said Wednesday he had received a
letter from a local leader complaining that soldiers had stolen
large amounts of property from a mosque and from the homes of
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf are the smaller of two rebel groups fighting for
an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, home of
the predominantly Christian country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Malaysian military said it is training
hundreds of soldiers guarding resort islands off Borneo on how to
combat armed kidnappers. The decision came after two raids by Abu
Sayyaf rebels from the southern Philippines on two separate
Malaysian diving resorts.

<HEADLINE> House Mulls Palestinian Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House was prepared to vote on a measure
that would cut off all except humanitarian aid to the Palestinians
should Yasser Arafat unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was brought to the floor ahead of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's scheduled testimony Wednesday before the House
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told a Senate panel on Tuesday that senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators had arrived in Washington at the request of
President Clinton to try again to arrange a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are giving it the full-court press,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Clinton administration has questioned the
wisdom of singling out the Palestinians but not the Israelis for
actions that could hinder the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But the House International Relations Committee approved the
bill late Tuesday and sent it to the House floor for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is ''meant to send a very clear signal to Chairman
Arafat and the Palestinian Authority. Do not destroy the peace
process. Do not condemn the Middle East to another round of
violence and war by unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state,''
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a co-sponsor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is significantly tougher than resolutions passed by
both the House and the Senate last year urging President Clinton to
denounce Arafat should he make a unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the measure does not allow for U.S. recognition of a
Palestinian state in any way. Diplomatic recognition would be
withheld as well as all U.S. assistance to the Palestinians, except
for humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   The president also would be authorized to withhold payment and
U.S. contributions to any international organization that
recognizes a unilaterally declared Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's sponsor, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman
of the House International Relations Committee, called it a
''forceful response to a real possibility.'' He said Congress
needed to act before adjourning next week.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Max Schemling Turns 95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Max
Schmeling, whose fights against Joe Louis were among the most
politically important in boxing history, has celebrated his 95th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations poured in from around the world Tuesday for
Schmeling at his home in Hollenstedt, near Hamburg. He canceled a
meeting with journalists because of a cold, but a spokesman said
the German boxer was in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Schmeling, one of Germany's biggest sports idols, won the world
title with a fourth-round win by disqualification against Jack
Sharkey in New York on June 12, 1930.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked out the previously unbeaten Louis in the 12th round
of their fight in 1936, handing the American his first professional
defeat. Two years later, Louis, by then the heavyweight champion
himself, knocked out Schmeling in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Schmeling refused to cooperate with the Nazis, and helped the
brother of a Jewish friend flee to the United States. After World
War II, Schmeling gained the license to sell Coca-Cola in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Discuss N.Korean Food Aid  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEJU, South Korea (AP) -- A high-level government delegation
from North Korea arrived Wednesday to discuss improving ties with
South Korea and plans to send food aid to the hunger-stricken
communist North.
</P>
<P>
   The chief North Korean negotiator, Jon Kum Jin, flew to South
Korea via Beijing because there are no direct air links between the
Koreas. After a brief stopover at the Seoul airport, the Northern
delegation flew to the Southern resort island of Cheju.
</P>
<P>
   Jon's meeting with South Korean Unification Minister Park
Jae-kyu comes amid North Korean warnings that it will face a
seventh consecutive year of acute food shortages next year because
its farm industry was again devastated by bad weather this year.
</P>
<P>
   In August, North Korea asked the South to provide up to 1
million tons of grain in food loans. South Korean officials have
said they will announce their food aid plan within the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Park said the two Koreas have already completed negotiations on
food aid and the government was persuading political parties to
support new food shipments to the North.
</P>
<P>
   All major South Korean dailies, quoting unidentified government
sources, reported Wednesday that South Korea will buy 500,000 to
600,000 tons of Thai rice and Chinese corn at a cost of $100
million and began shipping the food to North Korea in October.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers have accused President Kim Dae-jung of
pampering the communist regime in Pyongyang with massive food aid
at a time of economic uncertainty at home.
</P>
<P>
   They suspect the North of diverting outside food aid to its 1.1
million-strong military.
</P>
<P>
   Park and Jon planned to hold two days of official talks on
Thursday and Friday to follow up on an accord reached at a historic
summit in June. At that meeting, their countries' leaders pledged
to work together to promote peace and reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, up to 2 million North Koreans have died of
starvation, according to U.S. officials.

<HEADLINE> Greek Ship Sinking Kills 55  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek ferry struck a patch of rocks in
the Aegean Sea and sank, killing at least 55 of the more than 500
people aboard who panicked and started jumping overboard, rescue
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're finding bodies all the time. There are 55 dead and about
that number of people missing,'' rescue force chief Andreas Kois
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead were young children, who were not required to
be counted on the passenger list. A port official also suffered a
heart attack and died after hearing news of the sinking, the coast
guard said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos said the accident was
caused by ''criminal negligence,'' and prosecutors ordered the
arrest of the ship's captain and four crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard chief Andreas Sirigos said the 34-year-old ferry
boat hit a large rocky outcrop late Tuesday in rough seas about two
miles off the popular resort island of Paros.
</P>
<P>
   A crew member interviewed by telephone said there was an orderly
evacuation. But passengers reported a strong collision and then
panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ship fell apart as it sank. There were people hanging from
the railings. Children were crying and old people were screaming,''
Zoe Kolida told private Mega television. ''I jumped in and looked
back after about 50 meters and the ship was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought of the Titanic,'' another survivor, engineer
Stamatis Delavinias, told Mega. ''The boat sank in about half an
hour. There were old women and others who were afraid to jump in
the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of fishing boats, other vessels and British Navy
helicopters rushed to the scene and helped in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry's owner said there were 447 tickets sold and 63 crew
members aboard, but the exact number of passengers was not known as
some may have purchased their tickets onboard and children under
the age of 5 are not required to have tickets. Some reports said at
least 20 people from another ship owned by the same company may
have boarded the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Paros Health Center, Dimitris Stavrakis, said
''there a number of young children among the dead.'' A British Navy
helicopter in rescue operations touched down at Paros airport and
was seen unloading four bodies, including that of an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors taken to other locations, including the nearby
island of Antiparos, also said they had not been registered by
rescue authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many foreigners were aboard, but they
reportedly included passengers from Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Norway, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coast guard officials were baffled as to why the 345-foot,
4,407-ton Express Samina hit the Portes islet, a large rocky
outcrop which is marked on maritime charts and has a navigation
light.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be blind not to see it,'' Sirigos said. ''It is
inexplicable how the ship collided with a well-known rock that
carries a light visible from a distance of seven miles.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident was even more surprising for a vessel such as the
Express Samina, one of more than a dozen ferries that daily sail to
Paros and other resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's captain Vassilis Yannakis, his lieutenant, Anastasios
Psychoyos, and three crew members were arrested. A supreme court
prosecutor also summoned two senior officials from the ferry's
operator, Minoan Flying Dolphins, to give testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of another ferry, Theoharis Tsoukalas, said he made
the same run almost every day and could not remember ''any other
ship ever hitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek and British warships on maneuvers in the area scoured the
area as life rafts and vests washed ashore. Rescue efforts were
hampered by a fresh gale with winds blowing up to 46 mph.
</P>
<P>
   British helicopters rescued at least 12 people, including two
Britons, clinging to rocks in the swelling seas and took them
aboard the HMS Invincible for treatment. They were suffering from
cold, shock and minor cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Sirigos said 443 people from the ship had been accounted for at
the island's health center. He appealed for any survivors staying
at hotels or private homes to register at the health center.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry makes regularly scheduled runs from the Athens port of
Piraeus to the island of Samos with a final stop at the tiny Lipsi
islands near the Turkish coast. It was about to make a stop on
Paros, 100 miles southeast of Athens, when it hit the reef.
</P>
<P>
   Sirigos said the coast guard was also investigating why it took
the crew nearly 20 minutes to inform the coast guard that the ship
was sinking.

<HEADLINE> Service Chiefs Agree on Readiness  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to U.S. troops' combat
readiness, the military chiefs agree on at least three points:
</P>
<P>
   -- The armed forces are less ready than several years ago, but
still capable of carrying out the Clinton administration's national
security strategy of being able to fight two nearly simultaneous
major wars.
</P>
<P>
   -- To meet the demands of peacekeeping, normal training and
overseas deployments, the military needs more troops. It is
unlikely, however, that any of the services is ready to lobby for
specific increases.
</P>
<P>
   -- Defense spending increases of the past two years have met the
military's most pressing needs; but the budget will have to go even
higher for several years to pay for modernization and other
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is likely to come as a surprise to members of
Congress, Republican or Democrat. Nor is it likely to settle the
debate between presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush
over whether the Clinton administration has overused and
underfunded the military since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's testimony by the chiefs of the Army, Air Force,
Navy and Marine Corps may sketch the outlines of a broader
discussion that will take place once the election is over. That
discussion will focus not so much on whether the military is
''ready,'' as on what it should be ready for.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Clark, the retired Army general who was NATO commander
during the 1999 air war over Kosovo, has put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   Should we keep our military at home to prepare for the next big
war, staying out of far away crises like Somalia's 1992 famine,
Rwanda's 1994 genocide and ethnic slaughter in the Balkans? Or does
the United States want to be a world leader by dealing with
emerging international crises before major war is required?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been more expensive and more demanding to help out abroad
than just to stay at home, downsizing the force and preparing for
future all-out war,'' Clark wrote earlier this month in an opinion
column in The Washington Post. ''So the real issue is about
national purpose and strategy, not about readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, with the presidential campaign in high gear, the
defense debate is largely limited to questions about readiness.
Bush and running mate Dick Cheney can correctly claim that
readiness has eroded during the Clinton years, and Gore and running
mate Joseph Lieberman can say they are ready to spend more on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the service chiefs free to point out the spending
gaps that need filling, while steering clear of partisan wrangling.
They were called to testify Wednesday before the Senate and House
armed services committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, was prepared to say
he believes the Army is too small, considering the many demanding
missions it is assigned. Yet he preferred not to get specific when
it comes to numbers, aides said Tuesday. The Army currently is
authorized to have 480,000 men and women on active duty, down from
495,000 four years ago and 590,000 when Clinton took office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki believes the Army needs 30,000 to 40,000 more troops,
according to aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. The debate
over specific increases, however, is likely to wait until a new
president takes office.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Shinseki and the other service chiefs were less
concerned about expanding than keeping the people they already had
and meeting their minimum recruiting goals. Thanks to a series of
major increases in pay and other military benefits, the services
are now retaining troops and attracting more recruits.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks Tuesday in Chicago, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said that if the United States wants to keep a force capable of
influencing events abroad, the nation faces two choices: ''We
either have to increase the numbers in our military, or we
certainly have to increase the resources devoted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen did not say whether he thinks the United States needs a
larger military, but he left no doubt he believes the nation should
be willing to pay whatever it costs to maintain a global military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not the world's policeman, but we never can afford to
become a prisoner of world events,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Industry To Lessen 'R' Movie Ads  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hollywood executives are seeking to mollify
angry lawmakers with new pledges to curb the marketing of R-rated
movies to underage audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But as top studio executives prepared to present their
initiatives Wednesday on Capitol Hill, some lawmakers and
children's advocates already were questioning whether the industry
was going far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've taken some positive steps ... but it's not enough,''
Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, said Wednesday on CBS' ''The Early Show.''
''I've taken a look at it and they've got more they've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After being sharply rebuked for declining to testify at an
earlier hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, representatives
from eight studios answered their summons to appear before the
senators armed with a 12-point plan for limiting the marketing of
inappropriate films to children.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was unveiled Tuesday by the Motion Picture
Association of America, calls for the movie studios to ask theater
owners not to show ads for R-rated films during G-rated movies and
to not include people under age 17 in focus groups for R-rated
movies without a parent.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the companies have pledged to review their
marketing and advertising practices so as not to target
inappropriately R-rated movies at children, and they will appoint
senior executive compliance officers to review these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are starting a new era that didn't exist before,''
said MPAA President Jack Valenti. ''We're going to take a fresh
look at the way we market our films.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co., Dreamworks SKG, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Twentieth
Century Fox, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. all signed on to
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies already have unveiled plans to go beyond the
industrywide effort. News Corp. said Tuesday that its Fox network
would not accept ads for R-rated films in any family programming or
shows in which 35 percent or more of the audience is under age 17.
Also, the company's Twentieth Century Fox Film label will ask
theater owners not to show trailers for R-rated films during G- or
PG-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us in the media industry have a fundamental
responsibility to help parents cope with the many entertainment
choices facing their children,'' said Peter Chernin, News Corp.
president.
</P>
<P>
   Disney already has said it would prohibit theater owners from
showing trailers for R-rated films before movies released under the
Walt Disney label and that its ABC network would not accept
advertisements for R-rated films during prime time before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But these moves may not be enough to satisfy lawmakers, who say
they want executives to make a broader declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm appalled that the movie executives still have not stated
they will stop marketing violent movies to children. This is the
least they should do,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a longtime
advocate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee chairman, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said he hopes the studios offer ''a firm commitment to
stop marketing material to children that they themselves have
deemed unsuitable for that age.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it should be that complicated,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, which reported earlier this month
that the entertainment industry was peddling inappropriate
materials to children, said it was encouraged to see the industry
heeding the call for improved self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education,
said the industry's initiative was an important first step, but
added that the movie companies needed to extend their efforts to
TV, by not advertising R-rated movies on shows popular with young
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   A study being released Wednesday by the conservative Parents
Television Council found that of 54 movie ads aired on broadcast TV
during 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. -- the so-called family hour -- 83 percent
were for R-rated films. The sample was taken from Sept. 1 to Sept.
20 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Others groups argue that the movie executives are trying to
sugarcoat a more fundamental problem -- the rating system itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of putting a Band-Aid on a system that is truly
outdated,'' said Daphne White, founder and executive director of
The Lion &AMP; Lamb Project. She is pushing for a complete overhaul of
the movie rating system to make it more accessible to parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Valenti maintains there is no problem with the ratings
themselves and he offered several initiatives focused on explaining
the reasons for a given rating in print advertisement and on Web
sites.

<HEADLINE> Russians Charge American Businessman  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian prosecutors have officially charged
American businessman Edmond Pope with espionage and sent his case
to court, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the result of the investigation, E. Pope has been
incriminated in espionage,'' said a terse statement by the
Prosecutor-General's office obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors sent Pope's case to the Moscow city court on
Monday, after reviewing the charges drawn up against him by the
Federal Security Service, the statement said. Pope faces 20 years
in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the trial would take place in October,
though no specific date has been set. Last week, the court turned
down Pope's appeal for release on health grounds. He has been in
jail for almost five months.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, 54, asked to be released to undergo treatment for cancer,
but the court decided that the espionage charge was too serious.
According to his family and U.S. officials, Pope has a rare form of
bone cancer that was in remission when he was arrested and he can't
get adequate medical attention in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have also turned down other defense appeals, Pope's
lawyer Pavel Astakhov said Wednesday. Pope wasn't allowed to call
his ailing father in the United States, even though a prosecutor
had previously promised to let him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecutor said that there would be no problem, and prison
officials even asked Pope about the phone number, but then they
refused to allow him to make a call without giving any reason,''
Astakhov told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB,
arrested Pope on April 5, saying he had illegally bought plans for
a torpedo.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' decision Wednesday was mostly a procedural
move. However, they could have asked for more investigation into
Pope's case, further dragging out proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Pope denies doing anything illegal. His representative in the
U.S. Congress, John Peterson, says Pope was seeking information on
an underwater propulsion system that is at least 10 years old and
has already been sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Astakhov said that he had urged prosecutors to take into account
a conclusion by independent experts who said that the information
Pope was seeking wasn't confidential, but the prosecutors have
refused to include the document in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, a former Navy captain, worked for the Applied Research
Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University after retiring from the
U.S. Navy. He later founded CERF Technologies International, a
company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment. He
traveled to Russia frequently.

<HEADLINE> 8 Cops Die in Maoist Rebel Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Maoist rebels ambushed a police patrol in
a remote village in Nepal on Wednesday, killing eight policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-member patrol was scouting the area near Ghoretar village
when it was attacked, police said. A special police team was sent
in to investigate the assault, which took place about 125 miles
west of the capital, Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol was ambushed two days after the rebels attacked a
police station in Dunai, 200 miles northwest of Katmandu, killing
at least 14 policemen and wounding 36 others.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Maoist rebels began their campaign four years ago,
they have killed at least 231 policemen and lost 979 of their own
fighters and supporters, the government says. In addition, 249
civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are demanding an end to Nepal's constitutional
monarchy. They also allege police repression.

<HEADLINE> Greek Ship Sinking Kills 59  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek ferry struck a patch of rocks in
the Aegean Sea and sank, killing at least 59 of the more than 500
people aboard. Many of the victims panicked and jumped off the
boat, rescue officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's captain and four crew members were arrested after the
accident Tuesday night, amid reports at least some of them were
watching a soccer match on television at the time. Government
officials accused them of criminal negligence, and survivors
criticized the shipping company for complete disorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be blind not to see it,'' said Coast Guard chief
Andreas Sirigos. ''It is inexplicable how the ship collided with a
well-known rock that carries a light visible from a distance of
seven miles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many people were on board the boat. At least
443 were rescued, Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old ferry Express Samina was on its daily meandering
route through the Aegean Sea with an assortment of passengers --
foreign tourists heading for sun-soaked holiday isles, residents
heading home, army conscripts returning to military bases from
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many foreigners were aboard, but they
reportedly included passengers from Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Norway, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead were young children, who were not required to
be counted on the passenger list. A port official also suffered a
heart attack and died after hearing news of the sinking, the coast
guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship left Athens' port of Piraeus at 5 p.m. Tuesday and
headed for Paros, the first of six stops that would eventually
bring it to the tiny Lipsis islands near the Turkish coast.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 p.m., the 345-foot, 4,407-ton ferry rammed into the
Portes islet, a large rocky outcrop near Paros harbor that is
marked on maritime charts and has a navigation light, Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Shannon, 30, and artist and teacher from Seattle, was
one of the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were on the main deck,'' Shannon said. ''I saw it hit. It
was well above the top deck. ... It was like the movie Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   A small flotilla of fishing boats rushed to the scene, followed
by dozens of other vessels and British Navy helicopters. But rescue
efforts were hampered by gale-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   British helicopters rescued at least 12 people, including two
Britons, clinging to rocks in the swelling seas and took them
aboard the HMS Invincible for treatment. They were suffering from
cold, shock and minor cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the collision were not immediately known, but
Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos said the accident was caused
by ''criminal negligence.'' Results of a preliminary investigation
indicated that captain Vassilis Yannakis was not on his bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yannakis, his deputy Anastasios Psychoyos, and three crew
members were being questioned. A supreme court prosecutor also
summoned two senior officials from the ferry's operator, Minoan
Flying Dolphins, to give testimony.
</P>
<P>
   There were Greek media reports that coast guard officers were
also investigating allegations that most of the crew was watching a
European Champions League soccer match when the ferry crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone was watching the game. ... I joked with my husband,
'whose driving the ship?''' said German survivor Christa
Liczbinski, 37, from Seeheim near Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Although a crew member interviewed by telephone said there was
an orderly evacuation, Liczbinski and other passengers reported a
strong collision and then panic. Liczbinski, who is pregnant, and
her 33-year-old husband Mark -- a Lufthansa pilot -- said the
evacuation was disorganized. They were traveling with their son
Mark, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors accused the crew of ignoring the custom of
evacuating women and children first.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody told us to do anything. They were just yelling and
pushing. We were handing out life vests. People were starting to
jump out of the boat without vests. I thought we were going to die
the whole time. We got on a boat and they let it down. There was a
hole in it,'' said Heidi Hart, a 26-year-old accountant from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh company director Emil Popper said there was ''total
chaos'' as people leaped off the sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically it was chaos and mayhem at the back of the ship.
There was no organization, total chaos,'' said the 34-year-old from
Cardiff. ''People were jumping off the ship there was absolutely no
prioritization. There was nothing left of the boat on the side we
were holding on to and it was a question of clawing our way down
the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ferry's owner said 447 tickets were sold and 63
crew members were aboard, the exact number of people aboard was
unknown. Some people boarded from another boat and other bought
tickets on board.
</P>
<P>
   Sirigos said 443 people from the ship had been accounted for at
the island's health center. He appealed for any survivors staying
at hotels or private homes to register at the health center.

<HEADLINE> Indie Film 'Girlfight' a Contender  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Can romance survive when an angry young woman
squares off in the boxing ring against her boyfriend?
</P>
<P>
   That's the premise of a gritty independent film that turned
writer-director Karyn Kusama and star Michelle Rodriguez into
unlikely darlings of the Sundance Film Festival last winter. The
movie, ''Girlfight,'' split the top dramatic prize and won the
best-directing award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Girlfight,'' which opens in theaters Friday, tells the story
of Diana Guzman, a Brooklyn teen with a bad attitude, unhappy home
life and no prospects of escaping the housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   A chance visit to a boxing gym hooks Diana on the sport. She
begins training, eventually competing in gender-blind amateur
bouts.
</P>
<P>
   The idea grew out of Kusama's own time in the ring. The St.
Louis native took up boxing nine years ago in Brooklyn for fitness.
She never competed, but she did spar with men since there were so
few women in boxing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Kusama saw dramatic possibilities: a rough-edged
fairy tale about a young woman who stumbles on just the right
outlet for her anger and athletic ability. The story had the added
twist of romance in the ring: Diana ends up fighting Adrian
(Santiago Douglas), her new boyfriend, who's training for the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have men and boys who spar who are best friends, father
and son, brothers,'' said Kusama, 32. ''I got to thinking, what
would it be like to have a personal relationship, even an intimate
relationship, with somebody where you decide to get in there and
hurt each other?
</P>
<P>
   ''The ring to me is sort of like a stage, where, like love in
some ways, two people get into a sort of special zone where
everyone understands that somebody could get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kusama shopped the script to investors, she was asked, ''Is
this another 'Flashdance'?'' or ''Is this 'Rocky' for girls?''
</P>
<P>
   The best comparison she could come up with was to ''Saturday
Night Fever,'' with a ''sort of a working-class milieu, an underdog
who is charismatic and attractive but still feels like a loser,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hope for escape, the burgeoning romance, or not. That to
me was a perfect example of a kind of filmmaking that Hollywood was
capable of 20 years ago or 25 years ago, where you could have a
film that felt gritty, that was a bit rough on the edges but that
still had an appealing story and appealing characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusama raised $1 million, then set about trying to find an
actress with the pluck and athleticism to play Diana. The
filmmakers ran through a list of professionals, but none captured
the lead character's rawness.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who had no acting training and had done only a little
work as a film extra, showed up at an open casting call mainly on a
whim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had never gone on an audition before,'' said Rodriguez, 22,
who grew up in Texas, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and
was living in New Jersey at the time. ''I decided to just swallow
my pride and forget the fact that I'm being judged by people who
can't really figure out what I'm capable of in like five seconds. I
just walked in there, late as always, with a pessimistic attitude,
just wondering, what are these people thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   They were thinking they had found their Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michelle sort of emerged as a fresh presence that I just
hadn't come across yet,'' Kusama said. ''As we tested her, she sort
of exponentially was learning so fast about basic principles of
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the role, Rodriguez embarked on 4&AMP;frac12; months of
training at the same Brooklyn gym where Kusama had boxed. It
quickly became apparent that she also was a natural athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had a fearlessness that for a real boxer would eventually
be her downfall, but for a beginning boxer was the stuff of
greatness,'' Kusama said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez lifted weights and bulked up on protein and
carbohydrates. Her boxing handlers encouraged her to train for the
pros, Rodriguez said, but she declined. ''I like my teeth too much.
I'd like to keep them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kusama, she sparred with men, some 20 pounds heavier than
she was.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid of physical contact with other people ... as
long as it's not some humongous Mike Tyson,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sundance, Rodriguez has gotten an agent and landed movie
roles, as a deranged cab driver in ''3 A.M.,'' starring Danny
Glover and Pam Grier, and as a drag-racer in ''Redline,''
co-starring Vin Diesel. Kusama has turned down offers to direct in
order to concentrate on a sci-fi-horror script she is co-writing.
</P>
<P>
   The two women, who would like to collaborate again, say the
movies need more strong female heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The one collaboration Kusama rules out is sparring with
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd never get in the ring with Michelle,'' Kusama said.
''She'd kill me. I'm definitely a fighter out of the ring, but not
in it. At least not with her.''

<HEADLINE> Paul Hogan's Back for 'Dundee III'  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PASSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) -- In the spirit of the Sydney
Olympics, Paul Hogan compares the long-ago success of ''Crocodile
Dundee'' to an unlikely win in the 100-meter dash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always said it was like going to the Olympics in your
jeans and bare feet and saying, 'Can I have a run in the 100'?''
says Hogan. ''You win the gold medal, and from there on in, nothing
is ever going to match it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 film starring Hogan as the laconic, wisecracking
Outback hero of the title was produced for $6 million and grossed
$360 million worldwide, earning an Academy Award nomination for its
screenwriters. A sequel in 1988 grossed another $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   But if the first glow of success is never going to be repeated,
why bring Mick ''Crocodile'' Dundee back to life 14 years later for
a third time in ''Crocodile Dundee in L.A.''?
</P>
<P>
   A good story line, he says, and a decision by him and
co-producer Lance Hool to independently produce ''Croc III.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to wait until there was a good enough idea, a good
enough plan,'' says Hogan in his trailer during a break at Warner
Roadshow studios on Queensland state's Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just doing my best to make a good, funny movie and we'll
see how it turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks of shooting in Australia included a week-long stay in
McKinlay, in northwest Queensland, site of the Outback pub from the
original. ''We saw the same people, the same town drunk and the
same dogs we came across last time around,'' Hogan says. The
production moves to Los Angeles for another five weeks of filming.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Hool secured much of the movie's $39 million
financing, but admits to lying awake some nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tough act to follow,'' Hool says. ''Six studios turned
down the original, but it was grossing more in its sixth week in
the U.S. than it was in the first.''
</P>
<P>
   The third installment follows Hogan's Dundee from Outback
Australia to California, where his partner, Sue Charlton (reprised
by Hogan's wife, Linda Kozlowski), has been assigned to run the Los
Angeles bureau of her father's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   On a shooting day in August under sunny, cloudless Australian
skies, Hogan was working with a chimpanzee flown in from the United
States -- while fellow cast members kept their distance. Australia's
quarantine laws prevented Hogan from coming into contact with any
other cast members while working with the chimp, which was under
continuous quarantine during filming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was like a radioactive man -- I'd say, 'Don't come near me,
don't touch me,''' says Hogan, his sun-worn features cracking into
a laugh. ''Anyone who did had to burn their clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan looks fresh now in a new pair of jeans, casual shirt and
boots; the clothes he had on while working with Elly the chimp had
to be set alight moments after the scene was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan is hoping the new film's box-office reception will be
equally on fire to help erase memories of some clunkers in the past
eight years -- ''Almost an Angel,'' ''Lightning Jack'' -- and the
lukewarm reception for the movie version of ''Flipper.''
</P>
<P>
   A painter on Sydney's landmark Harbor Bridge before he turned to
stand-up comedy in the 1970s and a hit television show, Hogan
speaks of his roller-coaster film career with typical humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that a movie like 'Flipper' would ever be a
blockbuster -- but it was 10 weeks in the Bahamas swimming with
dolphins,'' he says. ''After I did the first 'Crocodile Dundee,'
anything I did wasn't going to match it and would become a failure
in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade late, Hogan says he's had a chance to
recharge Mick Dundee's batteries. And don't expect anything
different from the Australian bushman.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no real character art going on here,'' says Hogan.
''Mick finds there are other things to being a crocodile hunter.
It's not a mid-life crisis -- he wouldn't have one of those.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wouldn't want him to be sophisticated. He still doesn't
watch television, he has no computer, no cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan lives with Kozlowski in Santa Barbara, Calif., but also
has a multimillion-dollar home near the Australian resort town of
Byron Bay. He bristles at suggestions that his time in America has
dulled his Australian sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still come here three or four times a year, so I don't think
anything major happens in the time that I'm not here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''And as far as Mick goes, nothing has changed since 1964
anyway. He's older and uglier, but he was never cute anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Wednesday as the market
struggled to rebound from a selloff prompted by increasing concerns
about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunting helped push the market higher, but it wasn't
clear how long-lived the gains would be. The market has spent much
of the month in a decline, reflecting uncertainty about how the
moderating economy will affect third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 27.47 at 10,658.79 after falling 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite rose
58.97 to 3,748.07 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock-index
climbed 8.07 to 1,435.28.
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings reporting season less than two weeks
away, investors have been unloading stocks whose companies even
warn of lower-than-expected profits.
</P>
<P>
   The market has swung up and down, as investors, unsure where to
put their money, move in and out of technology and blue chip
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Micron Technology rose $2.50 to $49.56.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was up $1.75 at $119.25.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft appeared to rebound for a second day, up 69 cents at
$63.38. On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court said the software
company's appeal of a federal judge's decision to split the company
should be heard by a federal appeals court first. The Justice
Department had wanted the Supreme Court to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.17 at 513.06.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.81 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.04 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.36 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.86 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Math, Science Training Urged  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A generation after the space race spurred
concerns over math and science learning, such teachers are barely
ahead of their students and 10 times more money should be spent to
train them, says a panel headed by an ex-astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   The panel -- led by former Sen. John Glenn, the first American to
orbit the Earth -- maintains that more than 25 percent of high
school teachers of math and science lack even a college minor in
those areas.
</P>
<P>
   It has proposed a $5 billion budget for making sure teachers
earn majors or minors in math and science, teach those courses
instead of others, and get incentives to stay in their jobs. The
report stopped short of calling for a pay increase -- an issue many
educators say keeps schools from luring top teachers from
more-lucrative technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle public schools system, recruiter Michael Jones
hears stories of computer firms offering high school students
six-figure jobs upon graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they start thinking about college majors, it's not going
to math education or physics education,'' said Jones, who recruits
teachers of all subjects for the 47,000-student system. ''This is
something bigger than the school district. Pay needs to be better
and the profession needs more prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's plan, much more than the roughly $500 million
in federal teacher training grants, calls for two federal dollars
for every dollar spent at the state and local level -- an uncommon
slice of the education-spending pie.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's costly,'' said Glenn, who made history in 1962 on his
orbital flight and again 36 years later as the oldest person in
space. ''It's far, far more costly if we do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our kids aren't going to be competitive,'' he said. ''We'll
see the good jobs in the world go to other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Math and Science Teaching in the 21st
Century, also known as the Glenn Commission, was given a year to
study why as American children got older, they consistently did
poorer than other nations on math and science tests.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was also charged with recommending ways to prepare,
attract, and keep good math and science teachers. While pay has
been an issue for many educators, the panel did not call for
specific increases in how much math and science teachers earn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young people with an affinity for math and science can earn
more money than teachers,'' said Linda Rosen, math and science
policy adviser for Education Secretary Richard Riley. ''But we
don't just want to raise pay across the board until we really have
provided an opportunity for teachers to achieve the quality we are
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, disbanded with the release of this study, included
more than two dozen teachers, school superintendents, governors,
members of congress and industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended that states and schools boards assess their
teachers' knowledge and needs and increase degree requirements.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The markets were mixed Wednesday as investors
concerned about corporate profits again sold off stocks of poor
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunting helped push technology issues somewhat higher,
but it wasn't clear how long-lived the gains would be. The market
has spent much of the month in a decline, reflecting uncertainty
about how the moderating economy will affect third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   After advancing in the opening minutes of trading, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 16.28 at 10,615.04 in the first hour of
trading. It fell 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.75 at 1,431.96, and the
tech-focused Nasdaq composite index rose 47.13 to 3,736.23.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the market has been fixated on the approach of
third-quarter results. Increasing indications that the economy is
slowing, combined with high energy prices and Europe's weak
currency, have many investors looking to the third-quarter as a
sign of what is to come for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected earnings report helped push 3Com up
$3.25 to $17.44 on the Nasdaq. The computer networking company
posted a first quarter loss of $59.2 million Tuesday but fared
better than Wall Street had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $1.63 to $44.94, as the chipmaker struggled to
rebound from a slump that began Friday when it warned of
disappointing profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems also rallied, rising $3.06 to $120.56 after
ending Tuesday down.
</P>
<P>
   Corning announced it was buying part of the fiber optic
operations of Pirelli, an Italian company. The announcement sent
Corning down $8.75 to $316.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 5-to-3 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 135.87 million
shares, barely ahead of the 135.51 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.70 at 513.59.

<HEADLINE> Service Chiefs Urge Defense Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military is fully prepared to carry
out its war-fighting missions but the next president and Congress
will have to increase spending to keep the troops ready, the
nation's top military officer told the Senate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must find the resources necessary to modernize the force,''
said Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton mentioned no specific figures and said the amount of
additional defense spending would depend on the outcome of a
planned Pentagon review next year of the nation's military
strategy. He said some additional money could come from closing
more military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and other military chiefs spoke to the Senate Armed
Services Committee on a topic that has become a major point of
debate in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the hearing, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the
committee, said that although military reductions were begun under
former President Bush, the Clinton administration had gone too far
in cutting spending and shrinking the size of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said, however, that in measuring the war-fighting
readiness of U.S. forces, ''The curve has bottomed out and started
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan,
defended the administration's defense policies and said the
Republican-controlled Congress was partly to blame for military
weaknesses by forcing the Pentagon to buy weapons it did not want
and refusing to close unneeded bases.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that although troops are ready for their
war-fighting missions, too much of the Pentagon budget is being
diverted from long-term modernization accounts in order to fill
gaps in near-term readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are, collectively, robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' Shelton
said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to U.S. troops' combat readiness, the chiefs agree
on at least three points:
</P>
<P>
   --The armed forces are less ready than several years ago, but
still capable of carrying out the Clinton administration's national
security strategy of being able to fight two nearly simultaneous
major wars.
</P>
<P>
   --To meet the demands of peacekeeping, normal training and
overseas deployments, the military needs more troops. It is
unlikely, however, that any of the services is ready to lobby for
specific increases.
</P>
<P>
   --Defense spending increases of the past two years have met the
military's most pressing needs; but the budget will have to go even
higher for several years to pay for modernization and other
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is likely to come as a surprise to members of
Congress, Republican or Democrat. Nor is it likely to settle the
debate between presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush
over whether the Clinton administration has overused and
underfunded the military since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's testimony by the chiefs of the Army, Air Force,
Navy and Marine Corps may sketch the outlines of a broader
discussion that will take place once the election is over. That
discussion will focus not so much on whether the military is
''ready,'' as on what it should be ready for.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Clark, the retired Army general who was NATO commander
during the 1999 air war over Kosovo, has put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   Should we keep our military at home to prepare for the next big
war, staying out of faraway crises like Somalia's 1992 famine,
Rwanda's 1994 genocide and ethnic slaughter in the Balkans? Or does
the United States want to be a world leader by dealing with
emerging international crises before major war is required?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been more expensive and more demanding to help out abroad
than just to stay at home, downsizing the force and preparing for
future all-out war,'' Clark wrote earlier this month in an opinion
column in The Washington Post. ''So the real issue is about
national purpose and strategy, not about readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, with the presidential campaign in high gear, the
defense debate is largely limited to questions about readiness.
Bush and running mate Dick Cheney can correctly claim that
readiness has eroded during the Clinton years, and Gore and running
mate Joseph Lieberman can say they are ready to spend more on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the service chiefs free to point out the spending
gaps that need filling, while steering clear of partisan wrangling.
They were called to testify Wednesday before the Senate and House
armed services committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, was prepared to say
he believes the Army is too small, considering the many demanding
missions it is assigned. Yet he preferred not to get specific when
it comes to numbers, aides said Tuesday. The Army currently is
authorized to have 480,000 men and women on active duty, down from
495,000 four years ago and 590,000 when Clinton took office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki believes the Army needs 30,000 to 40,000 more troops,
according to aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. The debate
over specific increases, however, is likely to wait until a new
president takes office.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Dismisses Yugoslav Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton dismissed Yugoslav
government plans for a run-off election Wednesday as an apparent
attempt to steal a fair election.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly appears from a distance that they had a free
election and somebody's trying to take it away from them,'' Clinton
said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Belgrade called a runoff election for Oct. 8 on
grounds no clear winner emerged from Sunday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's official election commission has no
credibility whatever,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Election Commission in Belgrade announced that
opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica finished first
in the voting but without enough votes to avoid a runoff with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said Kostunica finished with 48.22 percent to
40.23 percent for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition clearly believes it got over 50 percent,'' and
independent observers agree, Clinton said before leaving Washington
for fund-raising appearances in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that Kostunica does not plan to participate in a
runoff, but did not say what if anything the United States might do
to bolster Kostunica's position.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what Europe and the United States should do is support
the expressed will of the Serbian people,'' Clinton said, adding
later: ''Whatever we do should be consistent, I think, with the
wishes of the majority of the people there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton said it seemed clear that Milosevic lost the
election ''despite government attempts to manipulate the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a Senate committee
Tuesday that the authorities in Belgrade ''have used every trick in
the book to prevent a fair campaign, rig the election and distort
the results. In so doing, they have fooled no one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly now, Milosevic is a figure of the past,'' Albright
said. ''For too long, his lawlessness has weakened Yugoslavia; his
cronies have robbed Yugoslavia; and his mismanagement has all but
bankrupted Yugoslavia.''

<HEADLINE> Commander Killed in Burundi Fighting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- A senior Burundi military commander
was killed in fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu
rebels, an independent radio station said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Audace Basuzuguye was killed and at least nine soldiers
wounded during the fighting Tuesday near the village of Tenga,
seven miles northwest of the capital, Bujumbura, Radio Umwizero
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been important casualties on the rebels' side and
some on our side,'' military spokesman Maj. Edward Ntibigira told
The Associated Press. ''Fighting continues, and we have seized a
lot of weapons. We can no longer tolerate attacks near the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not have the exact number of casualties and could
not confirm whether Basuzuguye was among them. He said the army
would issue a statement later.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
since civil war broke out in the tiny central African country in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The war began when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's
first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   Two years of peace talks ended Aug. 28 with a power-sharing
agreement between Hutu and Tutsi political parties and the
government of President Pierre Buyoya. But the two main Hutu rebel
groups have refused to accept the agreement, and they and the
government have refused to sign a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The parties were meeting in Arusha, Tanzania this week to
determine how to implement the agreement as the violence continued
to escalate.

<HEADLINE> China, Vatican Dispute Intensifies  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China intensified a war of words with the Vatican
on Wednesday, publishing rules to curb missionaries and getting
Communist Party-backed bishops to accuse Rome of fomenting
anti-government sentiment among Chinese Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, simmering for months, adds a bizarre chapter to
the 50-year rift between the Vatican and Beijing that both sides
claim to want to end.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has stirred fears about rivalry with Taiwan and
revived China's enchantment with the bloody, anti-foreign Boxer
Rebellion 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the dispute are long-laid Vatican plans to make
saints of 120 Western and Chinese Catholics killed in China, mostly
by the Boxers, and to do so on Sunday, Oct. 1 -- China's National
Day and a date given to celebrating the triumph of communism in
1949.
</P>
<P>
   ''This public humiliation and scorn for the Chinese people and
Chinese church is something we absolutely cannot tolerate and
accept,'' the state-backed Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association
and the Chinese Catholics Bishops College said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some in the Holy See want to use this 'canonization' to
distort and slander history, renew control over China's Catholic
church and encourage worshippers to oppose the government,'' the
groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Their statement, reported in major national newspapers
Wednesday, added to a barrage of harsh words from the Chinese
government and marked the clergy's most public criticism of the
Vatican in years. They demanded the Vatican ''repent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican spokesman denied that Sunday's ceremony was
politically motivated or ''directed against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, noted on Tuesday that
Sunday marked the feast of Saint Therese of Lisieux, patron saint
of missionaries, and was a natural time to name saints.
</P>
<P>
   Set up by Beijing in 1951 to prevent foreign influence, the
state-run church has recently tried to keep open channels to Rome
in hopes of reconciling. The government, too, would like to win
over the Vatican and get it to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan,
the island Beijing considers its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has encouraged contacts, while trying not to
alienate supporters in Taiwan and China's 8 million Catholics, half
of whom reject the state-run church. A high-ranking envoy, Cardinal
Roger Etchegaray, tried to allay Beijing's concerns over the
canonizations in talks with Chinese officials two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of its displeasure, China on Wednesday reissued rules
forbidding proselytizing by foreigners and prohibiting them from
bringing any religious items into China except for their own use.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party's most authoritative newspaper also defended
China's decision to run its own churches without foreign control.
''No foreign force should count on China to be its servant,'' the
People's Daily said in a front-page editorial.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, the Chinese bishops accused the Vatican of
violating its own rules on canonization by not seeking the approval
of China's clergy and allowing Taiwanese bishops to influence the
process at Beijing's expense.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Morning Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors
concerned about third-quarter profits again sold off shares of poor
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunting helped push technology issues somewhat higher,
but it wasn't clear how long-lived the gains would be. The market
has spent much of this month in a decline, reflecting uncertainty
about how the moderating economy will affect third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   After advancing in the opening minutes of trading, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 27.01 at 10,604.31 in the first hour of
trading. It fell 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators struggled to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 0.08 to 1,427.13, and the
tech-focused Nasdaq composite index treaded water, up 0.94 at
3,690.04.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing a little bit of a rebound from yesterday, as far
as the Nasdaq is concerned, and some pressure on blue chips,'' said
Dick Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc.
''It's just a continuination of what we've had over the last three
weeks. The market gets sold off, stocks get a little bit of a
bounce up and then we sell off again.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing particularly exciting going on today. It's
really just a little bit here and a little bit there.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the market has been fixated on the approach of
third-quarter reports. Increasing indications that the economy is
slowing, combined with high energy prices and Europe's weak
currency, have many investors looking to the third-quarter as a
sign of what is to come for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Wednesday again punished and rewarded companies
depending on their earnings outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline fell $8.14 to $10.50 -- a 43 percent drop -- after the
discount travel Web site said its bottom line would be hurt by weak
airline ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected earnings report helped push 3Com up
$2.69 to $16.63 on the Nasdaq. The computer networking company
posted a first quarter loss of $59.2 million Tuesday but fared
better than Wall Street had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   There was also limited bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $1 to $44.31, as the chipmaker struggled to rebound
from a slump that began Friday when it warned of disappointing
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems rose $1.38 to $118.88.
</P>
<P>
   But financial and consumer product stocks had a tougher time as
investors sought profits and moved money out of blue chips into
technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell $1.13 to $52.38. Procter &AMP; Gamble tumbled $1.13
to $60.63.
</P>
<P>
   And Corning tumbled $8 to $315 after it announced it was buying
part of the fiber optic operations of Pirelli, an Italian company.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 5-to-3 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 354.49 million
shares, ahead of the 332.97 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.70 at 513.59.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Group GRAPO Blamed for Bombs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- An underground group known as GRAPO
exploded small homemade bombs Wednesday in temporary employment
agencies in three Spanish provincial capitals, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A caller in the name of the anarchist group claimed
responsibility for the attacks in Vigo, Seville and Valencia, which
caused minor damage and no injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, six similar attacks, also blamed on GRAPO,
struck temporary employment agencies in Madrid, Barcelona and
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   GRAPO -- a Spanish acronym for October First Anti-fascist
Resistance Group -- has been blamed for other attacks on temporary
employment agencies in recent years. Police say they don't know why
employment agencies are targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Torres Hurtado, the central government's representative in
Seville, speculated the attacks Wednesday were to show support for
demonstrations against economic globalization in Prague at the
World Bank and IMF meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosions also come on the 25th anniversary of the last
capital punishments in Spanish history.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27, 1975, Spanish leader Gen. Francisco Franco ordered
the execution by firing squad of two members of the violent Basque
separatist group ETA and three members of FRAP, the anti-fascist
predecessors of GRAPO.
</P>
<P>
   GRAPO is associated with left-wing political movements, but its
political aims have never been clear.
</P>
<P>
   The group is thought to be behind the deaths of some 60 people
in bombing and shooting attacks over the last 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Freeh, Reno Defend Government's Case  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prosecutors had a choice: take
scientist Wen Ho Lee to court and risk nuclear weapon secrets or
give him a deal that would force him to tell what he did with the
information he downloaded on computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was clear-cut, FBI Director Louis Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the moment we learned last year that our nation's nuclear
secrets were on missing portable tapes, we have had a central goal
in this matter: to find out what happened to the tapes,'' Freeh
told a Senate hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And, Attorney General Janet Reno said, ''This plea agreement is
our best chance to find out what happened to the computer tapes
containing some of the nation's most important nuclear designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh defended the government's investigation and
treatment of Lee, who was held in solitary confinement without bail
for nine months before being released on a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, their subordinates insisted at a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee hearing that the plea bargain to find the tapes was
the only choice. ''The answers were more important than prosecuting
Dr. Lee for his admittedly very serious crimes,'' Assistant
Attorney General James Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers had even threatened prosecutors with forcing a
trial, promising a ''long slow death march'' toward publicity on
the nuclear secrets, said U.S. Attorney Norman Bay of Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone had told me they were going to put me on a long
slow death march, I would have told them, 'Let's start walking,'''
said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe you,'' Bay replied, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to only one of the 59 counts of his grand
jury indictment. In exchange, he was sentenced to time served and
agreed to tell officials what happened to the information he
downloaded at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was not at the hearing. In a statement, his lawyers said
they wanted fair treatment for him from the government, and the
scientist hopes in time ''the world will better understand that he
has been and continues to be a loyal and proud citizen of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Lee is no hero,'' Reno said, rejecting his widespread
portrayal as a victim. ''He is no absent-minded professor. He is a
felon. He committed a very serious, calculated crime, and he pled
guilty to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain, however, prompted U.S. District Judge James
Parker to apologize to Lee for the nine-month pretrial imprisonment
and to accuse government officials in charge of the case of
embarrassing ''our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers at Tuesday's hearing also found much to complain
about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the FBI's counterintelligence investigation was a
gravely flawed exercise, characterized by inadequate resources,
lack of management attention and missed opportunities,'' the Senate
Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a textbook example of how not to conduct an
investigation,'' added Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada, top Democrat
on Shelby's committee. He called it a ''Keystone Kops'' operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's supporters also contend the fired Los Alamos scientist, a
U.S. citizen born in Taiwan and educated in the United States, was
targeted because he is Asian-American. Some are demanding a
presidential pardon and an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has refused to apologize but has ordered an internal review
of Justice Department actions. She and Freeh deny, however, that
Lee was targeted because he is Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical to understand that Dr. Lee's conduct was not
inadvertent, it was not careless and it was not innocent,'' Freeh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Convicting Lee likely would have required revealing those
secrets in court to prove their importance, Freeh said, ''crossing
an exposure threshold we had already determined at the highest
level of government posed an unacceptable risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director did acknowledge the agents who interrogated Lee
should not have reminded him that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were
executed in the 1950s for espionage. ''Confrontational interviews
often call for tough statements by investigators, but that
implication was inappropriate,'' he said. Lee was never charged
with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Reno to appoint an
independent investigator, saying Congress and the Justice
Department are too close to the matter to be perceived as being
fair.

<HEADLINE> Small Business Bill Fails in House  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would have allowed small
businesses to avoid liability under the Environmental Protection
Agency's Superfund program failed in the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which needed a two-thirds majority, fell 23 vots short
on a 253-161 roll call.
</P>
<P>
   It would have exempted from lawsuits families or small
businesses with 100 or fewer employees and $3 million or less in
gross revenues, if the amount of hazardous materials disposed of is
not greater than 110 gallons or 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders quickly blamed the Clinton administration for
refusing to support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years, the EPA talked a good game about helping innocent
small businesses but when it was time to walk the walk, the
administration did nothing but drag its feet,'' said Dan Danner,
senior vice president of the National Federation of Independent
Business. ''It's a total betrayal of small business.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, small businesses would also have been exempted
from Superfund liability if it had disposed only municipal solid
waste, such as household garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption would not have covered commercial trash
operations. The bill also would have directed the president to
expedite settlements for parties that contribute less than 1
percent of the total amount of hazardous materials at a Superfund
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Superfund program aims to force businesses to pay to clean
up toxic sites they created or contributed to. It has been
criticized for spawning costly and lengthy lawsuits that have
crippled some smaller companies, but Congress has made little
headway in years of efforts to reform the program.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, said sponsor Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, would
''provide long overdue liability relief to individuals, families
and small business owners unfairly trapped in the litigation
nightmare of the Superfund program for over two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., another sponsor, said it was
''absolutely scandalous'' that people had been targeted under
Superfund for dumping mashed potatoes or pizza boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation was opposed by many Democrats who said that,
while they supported exemptions for small businesses, the bill had
been brought to the House floor at the end of the congressional
session without hearings or discussions with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added that ''it creates incentives
for businesses or entities to destroy or lose records or to engage
in other rascality to achieve a preference at the expense of all of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters, in a letter to members of
Congress, also urged opposition to the bill, noting that ''the
bill's failure to ensure that a business's parent corporation,
affiliate or subsidiary is liable for cleanup costs, may enable
businesses to escape responsiblity for their pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said Wednesday he had made changes in the bill to
answer the League's concerns about big corporations escaping
liability. He said he hoped to get another vote this year under
normal procedures requiring only a majority vote, but acknowledged
it would be difficult in the politically charged last days of the
session when ''everyone is maneuvering for partisan advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., has introduced similar legislation
in the Senate, but it is unclear whether the Senate will take up
the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is H.R. 5175.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is S. 2634.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends Oil Tap As Prudent  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, deflecting criticism that
his decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was politically
motivated, said Wednesday he acted because it was ''the most
prudent thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a very long and serious discussion about this,''
Clinton told reporters gathered in the White House Rose Garden.
''We discussed all the pros and cons.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators are accusing Clinton of tapping the oil
reserve to help Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla., speaking Tuesday, said: ''The emergency oil is
for a severe shortage and not to help a candidate seven weeks
before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that in weeks of discussions, one of several
options under consideration was doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he concluded that ''the most prudent thing to do is
what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he took the advice of Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson and energy experts, ''including the vice president,''
when he decided Friday to draw 30 million barrels of oil from the
government reserve in the face of continued high prices dictated by
policies established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Richardson had said previously that the release of
oil from the strategic reserve was intended to cushion a sudden
supply shortfall this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the government oil drawdown will ease a 40
percent shortfall in heating oil inventories in the eastern part of
the country and ''make sure American families keep warm this
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary infusion of oil, beginning in November, is
expected to put 4 million to 5 million additional barrels of
heating oil into the market, Richardson said Tuesday. He disputed
contentions by some senators that refineries, now operating at near
peak capacity, wouldn't be able to handle the oil.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million barrels of heating oil are used daily during the
winter, with two-thirds of it used in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast states, according to the Energy Department.
</P>

<HEADLINE> PBS Launches Six New Kids' Series  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A stuffed bear, a moose, a raccoon starting
kindergarten. Seven monster siblings, a tiny boy and a dancing
horse with taps on his (horse)shoes. What do they all have in
common?
</P>
<P>
   Well, starting this weekend on PBS, these disparate characters
lay claim to a new three-hour block aimed at the preschool set.
Their star power -- and that of the books that introduced them --
propel the six series making up the PBS Kids ''Bookworm Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the roster (all times EDT):
</P>
<P>
   -- 8 a.m.: ''Corduroy,'' the cartoon adventures of a cuddle toy
and the little girl who cuddles him. A gentle frolic through a big
city and its diverse life, ''Corduroy'' comes from Don Freeman's
best-selling books about the winsomely upholstered bear.
</P>
<P>
   -- 8:15 a.m.: ''Elliot Moose,'' a mixed bag of cartoons and live
action with callow Elliot (note how this youngster's antlers are
little more than buds) and his animal friends. What happens when
King Lionel is about to receive the award for loudest roar, but
then, suffering from stage fright, loses his voice? Find out on
this series, from the ''Elliot'' books by Andrea Beck.
</P>
<P>
   -- 8:45 a.m.: ''Timothy Goes to School,'' in which our cartoon
hero, a 5-year-old raccoon, faces the thrills and trepidations of
starting school. ''I wonder what it's gonna be like,'' says
Timothy, trying and failing to sleep the night before. It's created
by author-illustrator Rosemary Wells.
</P>
<P>
   -- 9:15 a.m.: ''Seven Little Monsters,'' an animated series set
in the loving household of Mom and her monstrous offspring. It's
adapted from the book by Maurice Sendak, the world-renowned
writer-artist whose ''Little Bear'' is now a hit series on
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   -- 9:45 a.m.: ''George Shrinks,'' an animated odyssey about a boy
3 inches tall whose Lilliputian stature doesn't keep him from
standing up to the normal-size world he inhabits. Or, for that
matter, from taking care of business. When nature calls, George
straps suction cups on his hands and feet and, then, like a
mountaineer scaling the Matterhorn, climbs to the rim of the toilet
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Shrinks'' springs from the nimble mind of
author-illustrator William Joyce, who also conjured up the
irresistible ''Rolie Polie Olie'' for cable's Disney Channel.
</P>
<P>
   -- 10:15 a.m.: ''Marvin the Tap-Dancing Horse,'' whose star has
the fleet-footedness of Fred Astaire -- with twice the feet. Marvin
has an equally quick wit: ''I can't do my tribute to 'Singing in
the Reins' without reins,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   This cartoon series about the carnival where a 9-year-old kid
takes a summer job comes from Betty and Michael Paraskevas, whose
books include ''The Tangerine Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   -- 10:45 a.m.: A second 15-minute segment of ''Corduroy.''
</P>
<P>
   The current ''Bookworm Bunch'' slate is in place for two years,
says John Wilson, PBS' senior vice president for programming
services. But ''Bookworm Bunch'' -- the network's first-ever foray
into Saturday morning -- is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely a commitment,'' Wilson declares. And, pointing
to the seven hours of children's programming aired each weekday by
PBS, he adds, ''This gives us a great opportunity to identify shows
that we might then want to bring out to the full
Monday-through-Friday schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Toronto-based Nelvana Communications Inc.,
''Bookworm Bunch'' was designed to fill a void.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of kids' programming on Saturday mornings,''
Wilson allows. ''But it's not necessarily age-appropriate for a
preschooler. And it certainly doesn't carry with it the
age-appropriate, pro-social curriculum that you'd expect to find on
PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBS alternative, he says, promotes ''good behavior, conflict
resolution, problem-solving, functioning as part of a group -- the
sort of things that 4-year-olds need to prepare them for school.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, each series has a stated educational mission, which
parents can review on the ''Bookworm Bunch'' Web page. ''George
Shrinks,'' for instance, emphasizes ''working within one's
limitations, creatively solving problems and overcoming
obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has a really cool theme song, arranged with
boogie-woogie stylings: ''Well, the boy's kinda small/ But it
doesn't show at all/ 'Cause he's always acting tall/ George
Shrinks, George Shrinks he's called!''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, PBS and Nelvana haven't forgotten to make the
''Bookworm Bunch'' swing.

<HEADLINE> Auditor Independence A Key Issue  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accountants are on the ramparts, with the Big
Five firms bitterly split. A parade of corporate leaders have
trooped through hearing rooms. Sympathetic lawmakers are pocketing
millions in donations from auditing firms this political season.
</P>
<P>
   It's all because of a proposal by the Securities and Exchange
Commission designed to keep accountants independent from companies
they audit. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, besieged over the issue,
says it is critical for ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing less than the public interest is at stake,'' he said
in an interview. ''If investors cannot trust the sanctity of the
numbers, our markets lose their credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt has tangled with contentious issues for more than seven
years as head of the watchdog agency amid a booming stock market.
The SEC proposal would impose new limits on the kinds of consulting
services that accounting firms can provide their clients. ''I don't
think I've faced an issue which is of greater importance to
American investors,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When he testifies before Congress on the proposal Thursday he
likely will face heavy opposition. The chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and its No. 2
Republican, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, have complained to
Levitt in a letter that the proposed SEC rules would ''force
dramatic changes in the structure and business practices of
accounting firms'' and require corporations ''to pay increased
costs for some types of accounting services.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one Republican members of Congress have signed another
letter accusing Levitt of rushing the proposal through before a new
administration takes office next year.
</P>
<P>
   And the Banking Committee's chief economist, John Silvia, has
told the SEC its cost-benefit analysis of the proposal is ''wholly
inadequate given the significant impact the rule may have on the
U.S. economy.'' The proposed rules would bring more than $100
million in compliance and restructuring costs for the accounting
industry, Silvia said.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting industry, meanwhile, has contributed $6.9 million
to presidential, House and Senate candidates this election cycle,
including $4.1 million to incumbents, according to data compiled by
the Center for Responsive Politics. Nearly twice as much has gone
to Republicans as to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top 20 recipients are Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.,
chairman of the Senate Banking subcommittee on securities
($56,348); GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush (about $1
million); Democratic contender Al Gore ($354,050); Hillary Rodham
Clinton ($73,500); and her Republican rival in the New York Senate
race, Rep. Rick Lazio ($87,786). Gramm, who was not in the top
group, received $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the midst of an election season and that's when
political pressure becomes the greatest,'' Levitt, a major
Clinton-Gore fund-raiser before joining the government, replied
when asked about the lobbying clout. ''The fact that enormous sums
of money have been spent on lobbying this issue is irrelevant'' to
the importance of auditor independence to protect investors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt and other SEC officials are worried that accounting firms
are jeopardizing their independence by becoming more financially
dependent on the lucrative consulting work they do for companies
they audit. They say accounting firms need to be more independent
of their clients to avoid conflicts of interest and preserve the
integrity of company financial reports -- thereby upholding
investors' confidence in the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of some big accounting firms and the industry's
trade group, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, say the rules would bring an undesirable restructuring
of their industry by forcing firms to split off their valuable
consulting businesses.

<HEADLINE> BOOKS AND AUTHORS: Isabel Allende  </HEADLINE>
By MARIA-BELEN MORAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUSALITO, Calif. (AP) -- At the wheel of her car and under the
cover of darkness, Isabel Allende risked her life over and over
again, maneuvering in the shadows of foreign embassies, becoming so
familiar with the getaway routes that she knew exactly when and
where to slow down so her passengers could jump out.
</P>
<P>
   So many times, she watched with relief as they scaled the walls
to freedom. She was fearful of her own fate but strongly believed
that democratic rule would be restored in Chile. And she never
really expected that one day, she, too, would have to escape the
brutal dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt fear many times -- a terrible fear,'' she says. ''But I
never asked myself if it was worthwhile. Of course, it was
worthwhile. It was a country that had been the strongest democracy
in Latin America and was at that moment under a regime of terror,
under a horrible military dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling author of such books as ''The House of the
Spirits'' and ''Of Love and Shadows'' thinks it's time that the
United States fully disclose the relationship it had with the
regime that terrorized her country for 17 years, leaving nearly
3,200 people dead or missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot build the future ignoring the mistakes of the
past,'' says Allende in an interview at her office in Sausalito.
''It is not about vengeance. ... It is about honoring those who
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Congress, the Central Intelligence Agency
recently posted on its Web site what is considered to be its most
revealing document so far chronicling covert activities following
the 1973 military coup in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the CIA admits its involvement with coup
plotters, false propagandists and assassins. It also describes
efforts to influence news media against the author's cousin,
Salvador Allende, a Marxist who in 1970 became the first socialist
president to win a democratic election in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Allende blames the United States for trying to sabotage her
cousin's leadership because ''if they could destroy the Chilean
experiment they would be able to stop the dream of a socialist
government in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The foreign policy of the U.S. has been one of many disasters.
... They have supported dictatorships that they would never
tolerate in this territory,'' Allende says. ''It's like if, for
example, in Chile we decide that we don't like the American
government, so we create a program to sabotage it and if it doesn't
work we kill their president. That is what happened in Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the year of Pinochet's coup, Allende was a journalist,
a wife and a mother of two young children. When she realized the
unjustified actions of the army were not going to stop, she joined
a group of friends and clergy members who wanted to restore a
Democratic government to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Allende helped keep lists of the names of ''desaparecidos'' --
the disappeared -- and forwarded those lists to Amnesty
International and other humanitarian organizations so they could
try to find them. She also sent information about the locations of
torture centers and the names of death squad soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people gathered that information and some paid for it
with their lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of Love and Shadows,'' translated into English in 1987, is
based on the discovery in 1978 of 15 corpses in an abandoned mine
near Santiago. The bodies were peasants who disappeared in police
custody shortly after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Allende remembers hiding fugitives in her house and then helping
plot their escapes. During one family's escape, she hid a baby
between vegetables in a diplomat's car. The safest routes, she
discovered, were over embassy walls, after night fell and when
security forces changed shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the 'carabineros' were distracted or when there was
change of guards we would pass with our cars as close as possible
to the embassy. We already knew which embassies' walls were easier
to jump,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   She had to make her own getaway in 1975, when she was
blacklisted by the military. She lived in Venezuela for a few years
before settling in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, she wrote her critically acclaimed ''The House of the
Spirits,'' which mixed politics and history with the literary style
known as magic realism to create a chronicle of a Chilean family
over three generations. ''The Infinite Plan,'' published in 1993,
was the first of Allende's novels to be set in the United States
and feature American characters. ''Paula'' was a memoir the author
wrote about her daughter's death at the age of 29 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Allende, who looks much younger than her 58 years, lives with
her second husband, Willie, in San Rafael, just north of San
Francisco. Her nearby Sausalito office is decorated with family
photographs and copies of her books that have been published in
several languages.
</P>
<P>
   In October, she will publish ''Portrait in Sepia,'' a story
chronicling Chile's history over the last century, told through the
eyes of a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very interesting era in Chile, because during the
19th century there were five wars and one revolution, and I think a
big part of the national character was forged there,'' Allende
says, her eyes twinkling as she talks about her latest work.
</P>
<P>
   And the passion she has for her writing mirrors the passion she
feels toward Chile.
</P>
<P>
   If Allende could talk to CIA director George Tenet, she says she
would encourage him to open every last one of the secret files, to
redeem those who died trying to reveal the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would tell him to talk to the people that suffered the
repression so that he can understand that behind every name, behind
every order and each classified document there is human being, a
family and an a pile of suffering,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Trying To Reawaken Regional Theater  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- When Nicholas Martin first walked into the
Huntington Theatre five years ago to see his friend Campbell Scott
play Hamlet, he remembers being struck by the stately if ramshackle
playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The building said 'theater' to me,'' says Martin. ''It had
real reverberation, like the Broadway theaters of my youth when I
first saw Ethel Merman and shows like 'Oklahoma!'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Martin has been given the chance to make other people notice
not only the building's special ambiance, but the Huntington
Theatre Company itself. As its new artistic director, Martin has
the formidable task of reawakening the slumbering regional theater
affiliated with Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a generation, the Huntington has had a minimal
national profile in a city that takes its culture very seriously.
The red-brick building borders the Fenway, a park-like area near
the Charles River, and its illustrious neighbors include Symphony
Hall and the Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed by the arty, ambitious American Repertory Theatre
across the Charles in Cambridge, the Huntington, if it was known at
all, was recognized outside of Boston for its stolid productions of
English and Irish playwrights as well as one of the stops on the
circuit that August Wilson's plays took in their journeys to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   That could change now that Martin has taken over from Peter
Altman, who left to run the Missouri Repertory Theatre in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, Martin opened his first season with a bang: a
production he directed of Sidney Kingsley's rarely revived 1935
social drama, ''Dead End,'' with a large cast of more than 40
actors. Boston critics threw around such adjectives as
''triumphant,'' ''breathtaking'' and ''stunning'' in describing
Martin's production, which has been extended an extra week, through
Oct. 15, because of the rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a 62-year-old, one-time actor who didn't
professionally direct his first play until nine years ago -- an
off-Broadway drama called ''Sophistry'' that featured a cast of
little-known performers including Ethan Hawke, Calista Flockhart
and Steve Zahn.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winding down to retirement, the ebullient Martin is
winding up and facing a new career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arthur Laurents said to me, 'Aren't you doing this
backwards?''' Martin says with a laugh, referring to a career that
is getting busier the older he gets.
</P>
<P>
   Born Joel Martin Levinson, Martin is a New Yorker, by way of
Brooklyn and New Jersey and back again. ''My parents were
middle-class Jewish people, who took me to the theater, including
the original 'Oklahoma!'''
</P>
<P>
   He spent his youth as an actor. Hence the stage name Nicholas
Martin, although everyone calls him ''Nicky,'' which more than
suits his impish sense of humor, large laugh and compact,
5-foot-5&AMP;frac12;-inch frame.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a living most of the time, but took off seven to 10
years to be a drunk and then got some help -- and you can say
that,'' he instructs a visitor with disarming directness.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his early acting career was with APA-Phoenix, the
legendary troupe headed by director Ellis Rabb that featured such
performers as Helen Hayes, Rosemary Harris and Donald Moffat.
Later, Martin did regional theater, primarily in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a kid who should have been a musical comedy person. I
sang, but then I fell in love with Shakespeare and with the advent
of blank verse, my singing voice evaporated and I became this
little classical actor -- which was good because I was too odd to
have had a mainstream career.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin credits actor Victor Garber, best-known for his roles in
''Art,'' ''Sweeney Todd'' and ''Assassins,'' with jump-starting his
career as a professional director in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Martin had worked out a comfortable life teaching in
the fall and winter in colleges, doing shows with the students and
then acting in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Garber who told Don Scardino, then head of off-Broadway's
Playwrights Horizons, that he should hire Martin as associate
artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   As Martin tells it, he first declined Scardino's offer, but then
Garber sat him down and said, ''First of all, you want to direct
professionally, and Don will let you do that. The other thing is:
I've heard you stand in front of your classes and say, 'The theater
as I knew it is dead, and it's up to you kids to bring it back to
life.' This is your chance to bring it back to life, and if you
don't do it you're a hypocrite.'
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing I could do,'' Martin concluded. ''So it
really is to Victor more than anyone else that I owe my directing
career and my success.''
</P>
<P>
   That success first registered on the New York radar screen in
1997 with his production of ''Full Gallop,'' Mary Louise Wilson's
tour de force impersonation of fashion maven Diana Vreeland.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same year Martin also first directed ''Dead End,'' in
a memorable production at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in
western Massachusetts. Martin's relationship with Williamstown has
been particularly fruitful. Since ''Dead End,'' he has gone on to
do acclaimed productions there of ''Camino Real'' by Tennessee
Williams and ''Hedda Gabler'' with Kate Burton as Ibsen's heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Actors delight in his deceptively easygoing manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nicky makes you feel that you already know how to play the
part,'' says Blair Brown, who appeared in his ''Camino Real.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He fills you with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Martin, ''Collaboration is everything to me. All directors
say that, but I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet behind the charm and support, according to Brown, you know
Martin has worked the hardest of all, carefully researching each
play he is about to direct.
</P>
<P>
   What made Martin take the job in Boston -- just as his career in
New York solidified with such off-Broadway successes as ''Betty's
Summer Vacation,'' by Christopher Durang, and the one-man ''Fully
Committed'' and the Lincoln Center revival of Laurents' ''The Time
of the Cuckoo''?
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of things. First of all, I can't resist a challenge
of any kind. The bigger the better,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the dithering over what to do with ''Betty's
Summer Vacation,'' a black comedy that received excellent reviews,
but never was able to transfer for a commercial run, primarily
because, among other things, a suitable off-Broadway theater
couldn't be found. Martin found it frustrating -- and discouraging --
waiting for producers to produce results.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least now I can produce the plays I want and the writers I
want,'' he says, talking of his inaugural effort for the theater's
18,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This season sort of arranged itself,'' he says, in explaining
how he and the theater's veteran managing director, Michael Masso,
put the schedule together. ''It's not like we sat down and said,
'We'll do a classic and an English play and a black play.' It just
happened. The best seasons evolve in a mysterious way that isn't
programmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   How else to describe a mix that also includes ''A Fair
Country,'' a family drama set in South Africa, written by Jon Robin
Baitz, a young playwright little seen in Boston; an obscure Moliere
comedy, ''Amphityron'' in a new translation by Richard Wilbur; Tom
Stoppard's take on poet A.E. Housman in ''The Invention of Love'';
and another rarely seen play, James Baldwin's ''The Amen Corner,''
produced in association with Chicago's Goodman Theater.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, the season also includes ''Fully Committed,'' with
its original New York star, Mark Setlock, and directed by Martin.
The play, written by Becky Mode, looks at the frenzied world of a
telephone reservation clerk at one of New York's hottest
restaurants, with Setlock playing all the roles.
</P>
<P>
   As for next season and beyond?
</P>
<P>
   Martin has plans to bring ''Betty's Summer Vacation'' to Boston
during the 2001-2002 season. And he dreams of getting the use of
two more theaters in the nearby South End. One would be a 350-seat
proscenium house for new plays and the other a tiny 99-seat black
box that would be given to other local companies most of the year,
but which the Huntington would use occasionally for one-person
shows and to develop works.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had my way, I would make a triangular arrangement between
Lincoln Center Theater in New York, the Williamstown Theatre
Festival and the Huntington,'' Martin says, of the three venues
where he has had the most success.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his busy schedule in Boston, he will return to New
York late next spring to direct a new play at Lincoln Center by
John Guare called ''Chaucer in Rome'' about three Americans in the
Eternal City at the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it is an achievement but the thing that I
think is remarkable about me is that I have proven that it is never
too late,'' Martin says. ''You can go into your 50s and 60s and
completely change your life.''

   The Jayhawks led the alternative country movement that was a
counterpoint to grunge in the early 1990s. Yet when they never
became a big success, their debt-ridden saga was often cited by
writers as a metaphor for what's wrong with the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when co-leader Mark Olson quit in 1995 and the
Minneapolis-based band decided to carry on without him, the
decision splintered their loyal fans and became a subject for
near-endless debate.
</P>
<P>
   All irresistible fodder. Yet it would be a shame if these
stories overshadowed ''Smile,'' the band's most recent and -- get
ready for a fight -- best album.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times called ''Smile'' ''one of the most
beautifully ambitious rock records of the year, an exquisitely
melodic and literate concept album about wanderlust and the
distance people will go to run away from their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The compliment, however, came under the headline, ''What If You
Made a Classic, and No One Cared?'' The story concentrated on why
it was unlikely many people would even hear the disc.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Louris, the band's chief songwriter, reacts to it all with
a polite fib.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really worry too much about what people think, which
may be why we don't sell millions of records,'' he said. ''Maybe I
should calculate things a little more. We're so out of step with
the times that in certain ways, it's hopeless to even try.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe him, especially when you hear his evident
pride in the way devoted fans argue over which Jayhawks album is
the best, and the delight he feels when people respond to the new
music.
</P>
<P>
   In the old Jayhawks, Olson and Louris seemed inextricably bound.
They shared songwriting, and their tight harmonies were the
foundation of the band's pastoral music.
</P>
<P>
   The new Jayhawks are slightly tougher-sounding, led by the new
interplay of Louris' voice with those of drummer Tim O'Reagan and
keyboardist Karen Grotberg. The female voice has proven so crucial
that when Grotberg recently left to raise a family, the band looked
for another woman who could sing and found Jen Gunderman.
</P>
<P>
   Louris is careful not to say the Jayhawks are better now. Just
different.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the band saw an opening and they went for it,'' he
said. ''Mark left, and they thought maybe it could be less of a
Mark and Gary thing. I think everybody stepped forward and filled
the void a bit, as opposed to just finding a Mark Olson sound-alike
guy and putting him up there saying, 'Hope nobody notices.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, some fans concentrate so much on the differences
between the two bands that they overlook the similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ''People kind of get taken aback by the frosting -- there's a
Neil Young solo on that album and this one has strings and samples,
so they've really changed,'' he said. ''But, really, the
songwriting's the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In making ''Smile,'' the Jayhawks were initially looking for a
bigger departure from their old sound. They contacted several
producers to gauge their interest, including the Minneapolis rhythm
'n' blues partners Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, electronic wizard
Flood and even the eccentric genius, Phil Spector.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Bob Ezrin, best known for his 1970s work with
Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper and Lou Reed.
</P>
<P>
   All the prospective producers were sent a tape of about three
dozen songs. Ezrin wrote a detailed critique of each one, as well
as a general discussion about the band. Impressed with the
enthusiasm, the Jayhawks hired him.
</P>
<P>
   Louris had to get used to someone saying his songs weren't good
enough, to stop being lazy and get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''He energized us,'' Louris said. ''He focused us. He cracked
the whip on our songwriting. More than anything else, he was a real
confidence builder. The Jayhawks have a lot of ideas, and we can
definitely sing and play our instruments. What we get in trouble
with is decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks record ''became his life,'' he said. ''He was
laying carpet at my house, he was at my wedding. He becomes part of
your life. It's inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Laying carpet?
</P>
<P>
   You can't fault that enthusiasm. Ultimately, Louris believes
Ezrin has pushed the Jayhawks to a point where it has the freedom
to go in several different directions and not have it appear
unnatural.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next record we make could be a Folkways, Alan Lomax-style
country-blues record,'' he said. ''Or, we could go make a super pop
record and nobody would be surprised, which is kind of cool. I
think we just start trying to not repeat ourselves, which is
usually a sign of panic.''
</P>
<P>
   The future, where the Jayhawks are not chased around by a ghost
of themselves, is a nice place to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   First, one last piece of old business. Do the Jayhawks know
whether their old partner, Olson, who moved to California, has
heard the new music? Do they care?
</P>
<P>
   ''I sent him the record,'' Louris said. ''We've probably had
more contact this year than at any time since 1994 or 1995. He just
wrote back saying, 'Wow, this record is great.' He sent me his and
I think it's pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good contact. It's not reuniting contact. I don't really
like when bands try to recapture something. Most of it is never
quite as good as what it was.''

<HEADLINE> Sally Field Makes Directorial Debut  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- It took a lot of training and persistence for
Sally Field -- TV's Gidget and The Flying Nun -- to break into the
snootier world of feature films. She's taking the same methodical
pace now moving into directing.
</P>
<P>
   Field's directorial debut, the comedy ''Beautiful,'' which opens
Friday, comes after two smaller TV projects that the Oscar- and
Emmy-winning actress took on to see if she had the desire and knack
for directing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to do it sort of slowly, very gradually,'' Field said
during an interview at the recent Toronto International Film
Festival, where ''Beautiful'' played. ''I really started the way I
started to find out if I wanted to be doing it or if I could do it.
... I found that I very much want to and want to be able to get
better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Beautiful'' stars Minnie Driver as an obsessive,
opportunistic, sometimes mean-spirited contestant on the
beauty-pageant circuit, a woman so committed to winning that she
goes to extremes to cover up a secret that would disqualify her
from competition.
</P>
<P>
   Field chose ''Beautiful'' for her behind-the-camera debut
because the script presented a rarity in Hollywood: a strong but
deeply flawed, at times unpleasant, female lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's boldly funny the way women don't get to be very often,
and very flawed and complicated, and walks a fine line between
being likable and not likable,'' Field said. ''I love seeing a
female character that doesn't come on the screen from the very
beginning and ask the audience to like them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't like having pleasant people thrown at me,
especially women. I like to see a woman be colors that are not
acceptable, not politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Field knows something about making the transition from pleasant,
politically correct roles to characters with substance and grit.
She began in television in the mid-1960s with the perky title role
in ''Gidget'' and later starred as the do-good, airborne Sister
Bertrille in ''The Flying Nun.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she was taking on serious training as an actor,
looking to break out of such campy TV parts into feature films. She
found a snobbery among Hollywood studios toward television actors
that was difficult to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''The motion-picture business was very against television people
coming in -- it gave a bad onus to the magic of movies,'' Field
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't letting me in the room to audition. All I felt
was that when I got good enough, I would somehow change my own
fate, and that it was somehow resting in my own hands to do that. I
studied and studied and studied, and eventually there was a little
crack in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Field won a role opposite Jeff Bridges in ''Stay Hungry'' in
1976 (which was also Arnold Schwarzenegger's first movie). She made
a series of films with Burt Reynolds, including ''The End'' (1978)
and two ''Smokey and the Bandit'' flicks. She grabbed her first
Oscar for the union drama ''Norma Rae.''
</P>
<P>
   The title role in ''Sybil,'' about a woman with multiple
personalities, earned Field an Emmy, and she won her second Oscar
for the farmland drama ''Places in the Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Field played the mother of Tom Hanks' character
in ''Forrest Gump'' and the ex-wife of Robin Williams' character in
''Mrs. Doubtfire.'' She also had a brief, unbilled role as a
white-trash mother in ''Where the Heart Is.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up is another mother role, in ''Say It Isn't So,'' a
whacked-out comedy written by the Farrelly brothers and due out
next year. Field co-stars as the mother of a woman, played by
Heather Graham, who becomes involved with a man she thinks is her
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a different kind of mother character,'' Field said.
''She's not Mama Gump, let's put it that way. She's pretty crazy. I
can't even tell you what the movie's about. It's the Farrelly
brothers, so it's completely out there. It's a kind of comedy I've
never done before. I was interested in doing something I'd never
done.''
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the appeal of directing, too. Like most
actresses, Field, 53, said she finds fewer interesting roles coming
her way as she ages.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a group of us still out there working here and
there,'' Field said. ''We are pushing the envelope as hard as it's
ever been pushed. But it's always been a fact: Even in the '30s,
women like Rosalind Russell were making 25 movies a year, but their
careers still ended when they started to get into their 40s.
Katharine Hepburn, thank God, would come back occasionally and do a
wonderful role, but her ongoing career changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're facing that today. I'm a baby-boomer female, and we're
changing things. Not fast enough, but the more women who begin
writing and directing, the more I believe the stories will be about
women in all the varied stages of their lives. ... I think
ultimately, instead of raising a fist and shaking it, the only
thing that changes anything is an individual, not necessarily me,
but the other people like me. The other women like me that have
stories to tell. If you don't see enough stories about you, get up
and tell your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Field's first directing effort was the TV movie ''The Christmas
Tree'' in 1996, which she co-wrote. Next was an episode of Hanks'
HBO series ''From the Earth to the Moon,'' an installment that
dealt with the wives of NASA astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   She said she plans to continue acting while looking for new
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, right now, I'm more intrigued with directing,''
Field said. ''It's a more difficult task to me right now. But I
love acting. It's been my first love. I would wish directing would
take over and I would love it more, but I'm not as good a director
as I am an actor. I would like to be one day.''

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Explores Tramp Photographer  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Stage and screen stars like Lillian Gish
asked for James Abbe by name when they wanted their portraits
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe also photographed the major European leaders of the 1920s
and '30s, from Stalin to Mussolini to Hitler, and pioneered the
photo essay before there was a Life magazine. Yet, the once-famous,
self-described ''tramp photographer'' is largely forgotten today.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Johnson, curator of photography at The Chrysler Museum of
Art, is trying to change that with ''James Abbe: Photographer,''
the first American retrospective of Abbe's works.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit opened in June and runs through Nov. 5 at the museum
in Norfolk, about 15 miles from Newport News, where Abbe grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson first became intrigued by Abbe when he read about an
exhibit of Abbe's works at The National Portrait Gallery in London
in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''This looked like a really fascinating photographer, and I
didn't know anything about this guy,'' Johnson said. Johnson began
researching Abbe and by the time he saw the exhibit a year later
when it was in Wales, he had already determined to mount an exhibit
of his own in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Abbe's name may not have been forgotten if he had
covered World War II. It also didn't help that his private life was
problematic; he had four wives and pieces of his estate were left
with various parts of his families. In addition, many negatives and
prints were lost when Abbe could not pay shipping costs and
abandoned two trunks at the American Express office in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler exhibit contains 125 black-and-white, often
striking, photos. His subjects included such celebrities as Charlie
Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Mae West and Rudolf
Valentino.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Maine, Abbe moved in 1892 to Newport News, where his
father, a traveling encyclopedia salesman, bought a bookstore. At
12, he persuaded his father to get a Kodak agency license to sell
cameras and develop film.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe made a name for himself as the ''boy photographer of
Newport News,'' using his $1 Kodak camera to photograph battleship
launchings in the shipyard town. He would get the film developed
quickly and sell postcards for 10 cents apiece to spectators as
they left the launch site.
</P>
<P>
   His postcard portrait of the battleship USS Maine, which he
photographed in Newport News, became a hot seller when the ship
blew up in Cuba during the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's that entrepreneur spirit that you see in the boy of 15
and younger that carries him throughout his whole career,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, Abbe moved to Lynchburg, where, as a yearbook
photographer at nearby girls' schools, he honed his skills,
learning how to pose and light his subjects to make them more
interesting and attractive, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair wanted to buy a photograph he took of ballet dancers
at Randolph-Macon College, but the college president asked him not
to publish the photo because it was revealing: The girls' knees
were visible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow, my ballet girl setback, coupled with such
encouragement (from the magazine) ... influenced me to go all-out
and move to New York'' in 1917, Abbe wrote in an autobiography
excerpted in a book that accompanies the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   What made Abbe stand out in New York was that he was one of the
first people to photograph actors in costume on the stage, Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   That technique began with a challenge from actor John Barrymore
in 1919 to photograph him and his brother Lionel on stage rather
than in the studio, Johnson said. Abbe did so after dress
rehearsal, photographing the actors between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., then
processing the film and enlarging the photos in time to displayed
in the theater lobby for the show's opening that night.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe also traveled between New York and Hollywood, selling
pictures of celebrities to fan magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''He helped develop the idea of media-induced celebrity,''
Johnson said. ''Because of his photos, people got to know the
celebrities, or at least think they did.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lillian Gish went to Italy to film the movie ''The White
Sister'' in 1922, she requested that Abbe come along to take
photographs. In Italy, Abbe fell in love with the third of his four
wives and moved to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to photograph performers but also traveled the
world as a photojournalist, calling himself a ''tramp
photographer.''
</P>
<P>
   His work appeared in major publications such as London Magazine,
the Berliner Illustrire Zeitung of Germany and the French magazine
VU -- prototypes of Life.
</P>
<P>
   He covered the Spanish Civil War and chronicled the Nazis' rise
to power in Germany during the 1930s, from the burning of censored
books to portraits of Hitler. He also documented events in
post-revolutionary Russia and became the only photographer at some
battles of the civil war in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, he persuaded Joseph Stalin to let him take a portrait
to quell rumors that the Soviet leader had been ill and died. The
photograph was reprinted around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly alarmed by Nazi tactics, he returned to the United
States in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II broke out, Abbe tried to get an assignment in
Europe, but at 58, he was told he was too old, Johnson said.
Instead, he began a career in radio broadcasting in the western
United States, eventually having his own commentary program in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1973.

<HEADLINE> The Poetry of Willis Barnstone  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- If Willis Barnstone does not exactly outsell J.K.
Rowling, he has written 12 times more books. And his wizard is no
fictional character but rather the author himself.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Barnstone's flights of poetic fancy is like playing
quidditch without a broom. If you look past snowy hair to his eyes,
he seems slightly younger at 72 than Harry Potter is at 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, is he good?'' Barnstone replies when asked if he has read
Harry Potter books. With a diffident chuckle, he adds, ''I've been
a little busy lately.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he is doing a fresh translation of the Bible from
Ancient Greek. It took 24 scholars to produce the King James
version, and he is doing his alone, although he is leaving out the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped in France for his first visit since 1956 and dashed
off lines in perfect French, a pleasant parody of Apollinaire. He
visited the grave of Antonio Machado, whose Spanish works he
brought to English.
</P>
<P>
   Barnstone also translates from Chinese, German and Italian. He
used to read Bengali. With his prolific son and daughter, he has
edited literature anthologies from every continent but Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing obsesses him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe we could talk about poetry,'' Barnstone says, hesitantly
and apologetically, when the subject lingers too long on magical
kids and musty old religious texts. ''I'm really quite a good poet,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, of course. While doing his day job as professor of
comparative literature at Indiana University in Bloomington, he
stayed up most nights until nearly dawn composing highly lauded
verse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as professor emeritus with a part-time home in Oakland,
Calif., he is still at it.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Luis Borges, the great Argentine whom he also translated,
wrote: ''Four of the best things in America are Walt Whitman's
leaves, Herman Melville's whales, the sonnets of Barnstone and my
daily corn flakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Stone notes Barnstone's ''passionate wisdom and wit, scope
and cunning.'' She once praised ''this gorgeous energy of a poet of
genius ... (who) floats us to resonant surprise.'' She added: ''I
don't believe he sleeps.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Barnstone says, poetry may not be at its highest
literary level, but there is plenty of it -- more and more each year
-- and that is vital to keeping a fast-changing world on a
reasonable course.
</P>
<P>
   ''Poetry is another reality, a way to make sense of things,'' he
says. ''I see it everywhere. I drum meters on my fingers while
walking down the street. I tap it out on women's backs in bed at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   As an observer of a new Old World, Barnstone is rich in context.
</P>
<P>
   He saw baseball up close as a kid. Babe Ruth was his neighbor.
His father, an itinerant jewelry salesman, took him to Mexico as a
teen-ager. At 20, he moved to Paris and then on to Greece during a
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunday Morning in Fascist Spain'' is a set of early memoirs,
missing such later moments as traveling the Chinese Silk Road and
teaching in Argentina as the ''dirty war'' raged in the background.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Funny Ways of Staying Alive,'' he messes with simple
whimsy: ''Smoke/And croak.'' Or: ''Doubt/And you're
out./Persist/And you exist.'' Or: ''If your shoes are tight,/You're
not so bright.''
</P>
<P>
   But his ''The Other Bible'' is an exhaustive study of gospels
edited out of the New Testament. He has also translated forgotten
scriptures of the Gnostics, early Christians who saw their own
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   His new Bible will stick close to the original texts, written in
the old Greek of the Holy Land, with Semitic names. Jesus is Jeshua
the Messiah. His parents are Yosef and Myryam.
</P>
<P>
   Barnstone -- whose family's name began as Bornstein -- was
raised a Jew, but the scholar in him prevents his tinkering with
what he regards as slanderous text in the four gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were a Christian, and I grew up reading the New
Testament, I'd want to kill every Jew in the world,'' he says. Then
he laughed at the notion of his slight frame and poetic soul
menacing even a mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 20 of Barnstone's 50 or so books are still in print.
Some sell well over 100,000 copies. But he is no household word.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as I have my family,'' he says of daughter Aliki and
sons Tony and Robert, ''I don't need any more audience.''
</P>
<P>
   His childhood was hard, but he remembers his father as in a poem
he calls ''Love Tent,'' imagining his own death:
</P>
<P>
   ''The sun on that black Monday will/forget to rise, I'll be
holed up in bed/yet scrawl a letter back to him. Dad went/except in
me. He takes my hand. I fill/his palm of dust with sun. And we're
not dead/because we love and chat in his blue tent.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from scholarly work, Barnstone burrows toward the essence
of reality with a poet's disdain for stingy facts.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in Chile, he messaged a magazine to which he often
contributed that he was only a short hop from Christmas Island. He
knew the subject well, he noted, and wanted to go write about it.
</P>
<P>
   The editors' reply came back: ''We assume you mean Easter
Island. Go ahead.'' To a wizard, what's the difference?

<HEADLINE> Stocks' Decline Blamed on Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors
concerned about third-quarter profits again sold off shares of poor
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunting helped push technology issues somewhat higher,
but it wasn't clear how long-lived the gains would be. The market
has spent much of this month in a decline, reflecting uncertainty
about how the moderating economy will affect third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   After advancing briefly when the market opened, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 16.37 at 10,614.95 in midday trading.
It fell 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators appeared to be having a mild recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.61 at 1,429.82. The
tech-focused Nasdaq composite index was up 19.03 at 3,708.13, after
moving in and out of negative territory all morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing a little bit of a rebound from yesterday, as far
as the Nasdaq is concerned, and some pressure on blue chips,'' said
Dick Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc.
''It's just a continuation of what we've had over the last three
weeks. The market gets sold off, stocks get a little bit of a
bounce up and then we sell off again.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing particularly exciting going on today. It's
really just a little bit here and a little bit there.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the market has been fixated on the approach of
third-quarter reports. Increasing indications that the economy is
slowing, combined with high energy prices and Europe's weak
currency, have many investors looking to the third-quarter as a
sign of what is to come for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Wednesday again punished and rewarded companies
depending on their earnings outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline fell $8.14 to $10.50 -- a 43 percent drop -- after the
discount travel Web site said its bottom line would be hurt by weak
airline ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected earnings report helped push 3Com up
$3.06 to $17 on the Nasdaq. The computer networking company posted
a first quarter loss of $59.2 million Tuesday but fared better than
Wall Street had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   There was also limited bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $2.06 to $45.38, as the chipmaker struggled to
rebound from a slump that began Friday when it warned of
disappointing profits. Micron Technology $3.81 to $51.50, a 7
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems rose $2.50 to $120.
</P>
<P>
   But financial and consumer product stocks had a tougher time as
investors sought profits and moved money out of blue chips into
technology issues or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell $1.13 to $52.38. Procter &AMP; Gamble tumbled $1.19
to $60.56.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies also suffered. Web portal Yahoo! fell $7.75
to $94.69, while e-tailer Amazon was down $1.50 to $38.25.
</P>
<P>
   And Corning tumbled $3.50 to $319.50 after it announced it was
buying part of the fiber optic operations of Pirelli, an Italian
company.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 523.26 million
shares, well ahead of the 482.63 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.20 at 512.09.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Netanyahu Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's attorney-general on Wednesday rejected
a police recommendation to try former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on corruption charges, clearing the way for the popular
hard-liner to challenge Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In a 22-page statement distributed to news organizations,
Elyakim Rubinstein cited ''difficulties with the evidence'' that
made a conviction of Netanyahu and his wife Sara unlikely. Police
suspected the couple of conspiring with a government contractor in
a kickback scheme, illegally keeping gifts, and obstructing
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have decided to close the file against Mr. Netanyahu
concerning the suspicions attributed to him because of evidence
insufficient for a criminal trial,'' Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes at a sensitive time for Barak, who
soundly defeated Netanyahu in May 1999 elections. His far-reaching
peace proposals have lost him majority support in Parliament, and
Netanyahu's hard-line Likud party hopes to force him out once
Parliament reconvenes on Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate that Barak would handily defeat
Netanyahu's successor, Ariel Sharon, but the same polls show Barak
and Netanyahu in a dead heat.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Palestinian Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to cut off all
except humanitarian aid to the Palestinians should Yasser Arafat
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The 385-27 vote came as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
testified before the House International Relations Committee. It
has not passed the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told a Senate panel Tuesday that senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators had returned to Washington at the request
of President Clinton to try again to arrange a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are giving it the full-court press,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Clinton administration has questioned the
wisdom of singling out the Palestinians but not the Israelis for
actions that could hinder the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But the House International Relations Committee approved the
Palestinian sanctions bill late Tuesday and sent it to the House
floor for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is ''meant to send a very clear signal to Chairman
Arafat and the Palestinian Authority. Do not destroy the peace
process. Do not condemn the Middle East to another round of
violence and war by unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state,''
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a co-sponsor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is significantly tougher than resolutions adopted
by both the House and the Senate last year urging Clinton to
denounce Arafat should he make a unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the measure does not allow for U.S. recognition of a
Palestinian state in any way. Diplomatic recognition would be
withheld as well as all U.S. assistance to the Palestinians, except
for humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   The president also would be authorized to withhold payment and
U.S. contributions to any international organization that
recognizes a unilaterally declared Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's sponsor, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman
of the House International Relations Committee, called it a
''forceful response to a real possibility.'' He said Congress
needed to act before adjourning next week.

<HEADLINE> Iran May Let Girls Study Abroad  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- After heated debate, reformist lawmakers
voted Wednesday to lift a ban on unmarried Iranian women studying
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The measure -- which passed 137-74 -- now goes to the hard-line
Guardian Council, which must approve it for the bill to become law.
The parliament debate and vote were broadcast live on Tehran radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We voted to lift the ban on unmarried women studying abroad so
that women could gain access to scientific studies not available
here. Reformists are determined to fulfill their promises despite
opposition and pressure from hard-liners,'' said Fatemeh
Haqiqatjou, a reformist lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''To protect women's dignity and high standing in Islam, the ban
should not be lifted,'' said an opponent of the bill. ''Allowing
unmarried women to study abroad without any custodian where there
are no restrictions on relations between men paves the way for the
corruption of our girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker Elahe Koolaei replied that Islam does not ban women
from studying abroad. ''Your remarks are an insult to women and
Islam,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of female guests in the visitor's gallery stood and
clapped after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Haqiqatjou said she expects the Guardian Council to oppose the
bill, meaning it would then go to the Expediency Council, which
arbitrates between parliament and the Guardian Council.
</P>
<P>
   The status of women in Iran has improved since the 1997 election
of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who appointed a woman as
one of his vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists backed by Khatami want increased social and political
freedoms and a loosening of the strict Islamic rules that govern
the lives of Iranians. Hard-liners believe any shift in the laws
will dilute the ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners hold less than a quarter of the seats in the
290-member house -- but they still control the judiciary, military
and the broadcast media.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Get Help With Submarine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help
retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear
submarine Kursk, a top government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is overseeing the
salvage mission, told lawmakers that a contract would be initialed
Saturday with a Norwegian company. He did not name the company.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said the retrieval work would begin before Oct. 10, and
could be finished next month. But he cautioned that the operation
would be complex ''because sections one through five (of the
submarine) are just heaps of metal,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   While Klebanov wouldn't name the company that will help Russia
do the work, he said it was not Norway's Stolt Offshore. A deal
with Stolt had been expected, but reportedly fell through over the
amount of the fee.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper Kommersant, Stolt Offshore wanted $12
million but Russia offered $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Russian divers don't have the equipment or the training to
conduct the operation alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was shattered by an explosion and sank in the Barents
Sea during exercises Aug. 12. The cause of the accident has not
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ship Mstislav Keldysh arrived at the scene of the
disaster on Tuesday, carrying Mir deep water capsules to examine
the submarine. The capsules have been used previously to inspect
the Titanic.

<HEADLINE> 55,000 Homeless in Calcutta Flood  </HEADLINE>
By CHANDRA BANERJEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- Flood waters inundated parts of this
giant city of 13 million on Wednesday, leaving 55,000 people
homeless -- many rowing in boats.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by monsoon rains, the rising waters of the Hooghly River --
running through Calcutta -- swept away sandbag barriers and coursed
through the city's central, eastern and northern regions.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths were reported in Calcutta, but authorities said 727
people have died in eight days of floods in West Bengal state, of
which Calcutta is the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Police in jeeps patrolled the crowded shanty clusters along the
river, warning Calcutta residents over loudspeakers to move to
safer areas in India's second most populous city after Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless waded from their flooded homes or rowed in boats to
a partly constructed market complex where the government had been
planning to relocate street hawkers in a cleanup drive.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers set up community kitchens to provide cooked food --
mostly rice gruel and lentils -- to the 55,000 made homeless by the
rising Hooghly, which is part of the Ganges river system.
</P>
<P>
   More rain was predicted, and Calcutta weather official R.N.
Goldar said a high tide was expected Thursday that could reach 21
feet and flood the whole city.
</P>
<P>
   ''High tide is a regular phenomenon this time of year. But it's
worse now'' with the rains continuing, said Goldar. The high tides
flushed torrents of water from the Hooghly into the two main canals
flowing through the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not seen such a high tide in the Hooghly during the
four decades that I've been living in this area,'' said Samar
Haldar, a resident of the Kalighat district, one of the first
places submerged.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine worst hit districts of West Bengal state -- through
which the Hooghly runs -- air force helicopters dropped food to
people marooned on rooftops since the floods began Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-year-old woman was killed and another was injured when they
were hit by bags of rice dropped from a helicopter in Murshidabad
district, about 100 miles north of Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual late monsoon floods have caused more than $671
million of damage in West Bengal state.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 794 people are dead or missing in the floods that
have submerged vast tracts of eastern India and Bangladesh and
marooned more than 11 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, where more than 1 million people have been
affected by the floods, pirates in boats looted rice, cattle and
furniture from the homes of thousands of people who fled their
marooned villages.
</P>
<P>
   Calcutta residents were worried that the floods will wash away
the annual surge in business that accompanies 10-day Durga Puja
celebrations honoring the Hindu warrior goddess, Durga.
</P>
<P>
   ''The floods have ruined everything,'' said shopkeeper Ramen
Saha in Calcutta's Kalighat area. ''We were expecting brisk sales
during these days. I don't know how I am going to feed my family in
the coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of owners of shops in Kalighat pulled metal shutters
over the fronts of their stalls as water seeped in.
</P>
<P>
   In Bihar, one of India's poorest states, at least 39 people have
died and thousands are stranded without food and water.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, at least 200,000 people have lost their homes as
swirling waters swept away thousands of mud-and-thatch huts across
the farming region that shares a border with India's West Bengal
state.

<HEADLINE> Nazi War Crimes Suspect Dies  </HEADLINE>
By LIUDAS DAPKUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- Aleksandras Lileikis, indicted for
sending scores of Jews to their deaths while he headed this city's
security police during World War II, has died of a heart attack
before a court could pass final judgment. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Nazi hunters sought for years to bring Lileikis, considered one
of the last major Nazi war criminals, to justice. He was indicted
by Lithuanian prosecutors, but the trial that began in 1998 never
went beyond the preliminary stages. He died Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis maintained his innocence throughout the on-again,
off-again court proceedings and claimed in a recent memoir that he
actively backed the anti-Nazi resistance and tried to foil the
massacres of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups balked at the claims. A leader of Lithuania's
5000-strong Jewish community, Simonas Alperavicius, expressed
regret Tuesday that Lileikis died without admitting guilt or facing
a court verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't repent before he died,'' he said. ''Let God be his
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis was charged with genocide for allegedly turning Jews
over to be executed during the 1941-44 German occupation, when he
headed the Vilnius security police. His alleged victims were shot
in sand pits near Vilnius.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Algimantas Matuiza said Lileikis was taken to
the Vilnius University Hospital Monday and died the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Lileikis's physical and mental ability to stand
trial led to repeated delays, as court-appointed doctors examined
him. His trial restarted in June under a new law allowing trials in
absentia, but it was quickly suspended after judges said he was too
ill even to follow proceedings via closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis appeared in court only once, in 1998. In a wheelchair
and wearing a neck brace, he briefly declared his innocence, then
began trembling and gasping. He was rushed away in an ambulance and
never again appeared in court.
</P>
<P>
   Matuiza said his death was the ultimate rebuke to those who said
Lileikis was feigning illness to avoid trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''His death is a disgrace to experts who said that the old man
could be tried up to his very last days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis emigrated to the United States after the war and lived
in Norwood, Mass., where he worked in publishing. He returned to
Lithuania in 1996 as a U.S. court moved to revoke his citizenship
for lying about his Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment among Lithuanians about the Lileikis trial was mixed.
Many said a trial would have helped Lithuania come to terms with
its past. But others were angered at seeing an elderly man
subjected to such rigors.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups accused prosecutors of moving too slowly to try
Lileikis, saying Lithuania wants to avoid uncomfortable questions
about Nazi rule, during which 240,000 Lithuanian Jews were killed,
many by Lithuanians.
</P>
<P>
   Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which tracks
people accused of atrocities against Jews, criticized Lithuania on
Wednesday for failing to convict Lileikis, saying that, in death,
he had evaded justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''His guilt was unquestionable. He should have died in jail,
where murderers are supposed to die,'' he said from his office in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis is survived by his 65-year-old daughter and only child,
Aldona Vaitys, and by three grandchildren. His funeral was set for
Thursday in Vilnius, his lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Opposition Calls for Rally  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Police loyal to Slobodan Milosevic
ordered opposition supporters to rip apart a stage erected for a
rally Wednesday, an attempt to discourage crowds from protesting
his alleged moves to steal Yugoslavia's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders urged ordinary Serbs to take to the streets
anyway, handing out 10,000 baby rattles for people to shake at the
evening rally to show Milosevic that his time was over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can feel a lot of happiness in the air,'' psychologist Zarko
Trebjesanin said of Belgrade, the capital. ''The genie of freedom
and democracy has escaped from the bottle and it's impossible to
push it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying not to inflame tensions, opposition leaders moved the
rally to a central Belgrade square from the site where it was first
planned -- a platform in front of Yugoslavia's federal assembly,
which also is the seat of the State Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our aim is to avoid clashes, but there are hard-liners in the
state leadership who want something to happen,'' said Zoran
Djindjic, a key Milosevic opponent. He said the opposition received
assurances from police that they would not intervene during the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of opposition challenger Vojislav Kostunica claim he
defeated Milosevic in Sunday's vote by a wide enough margin that no
runoff is necessary, and say he should be declared the new
president.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition results showed that with 98.7 percent of the ballot
counted, Kostunica had 52.54 percent to Milosevic's 32.01 percent.
The State Electoral Commission, which is loyal to Milosevic, says
Kostunica finished first with 48.22 percent while Milosevic polled
40.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would necessitate a runoff, since neither received more
than 50 percent. The opposition quickly rejected the idea, but the
government set the runoff for Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elections are not car races, in which a contestant can catch
up in the second round,'' Jovanovic said. ''Our victory is not
negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders backed the opposition stance. In Washington,
President Clinton dismissed Yugoslav government plans for a runoff
as an apparent attempt to steal a fair election.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly appears from a distance that they had a free
election and somebody's trying to take it away from them,'' Clinton
said Wednesday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's official election commission has no
credibility whatever,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition delegation attempted to inspect the election
commission's returns on Wednesday, claiming they are short some
400,000 pro-Kostunica votes. The guards, however, allowed only one
member of the opposition team to enter briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is great fear among the commission,'' delegate Nebojsa
Bakarac said after coming out.
</P>
<P>
   Bakarac said he could not single-handedly inspect more than 5
million ballots and appealed to commission members to ''publish the
real results and act according to their conscience, without
creating tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the potential consequences, opposition officials urged
Belgrade's people to act with restraint. Though cafes buzzed with
theories on what Milosevic would do next, most people went about
their business. Many quietly expressed optimism over the political
upheaval taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislava Vukovic, 48, a lawyer, seemed excited about the
prospect of change. Echoing the battle cry of student protesters
who have swept into the streets, Vukovic said simply that Milosevic
is ''finished.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know he is done with,'' Vukovic said. ''He cannot harm
us any more.''

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Mulls Mysterious Poisoning  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLESLAVCHYK, Ukraine (AP) -- The cluster of four villages in
southern Ukraine was bathed in scorching summer heat when the
mysterious illness struck, creeping from one house to another.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were soon complaining of symptoms that
included drowsiness, head and stomach pains, burning eyes and skin
rashes.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 of the more than 2,600 village residents were
hospitalized in July and August. Doctors were unable to diagnose
the ailment, which also affected the livers and pancreases of
victims, saying only that it was apparently caused by an unknown
chemical agent.
</P>
<P>
   But some residents thought they knew the cause: rocket fuel and
debris from Soviet-era missiles that had been based less than a
mile from their homes in the villages of Boleslavchyk, Pidhiria,
Michuryno and Chausovo. They rejected the Defense Ministry's
denials, and suspected the military wasn't interested in
discovering the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be something military, what else? But I have my
remedy,'' said an elderly man named Mykola, fishing in a pond in
Boleslavchyk. He swallowed the last drops from a small bottle of
vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Boleslavchyk, a peaceful village of small white
houses, overgrown bushes conceal heaps of broken concrete -- the
remains of a destroyed missile silo. The area once held liquid-fuel
nuclear missiles and still serves as a base for solid-fuel SS-24s.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine inherited 46 SS-24s and 130 SS-19 missiles from the
Soviet Union. Kiev has since surrendered all its nuclear warheads
to Russia and destroyed the SS-19s, while most of its SS-24s along
with their silos are to be destroyed under a disarmament plan
running through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Boleslavchyk maintain the health menace can be traced to
a farm where the Soviet army supposedly buried debris while
dismantling outdated missiles in the late 1970s. Metal scavengers
recently excavated an old pit there, and some villagers swear they
saw a strange cloud that later swept over Boleslavchyk.
</P>
<P>
   But retired tractor driver Ivan Muliar was skeptical. He said
that plenty of people had worked at the farm for years and never
gotten sick, and the scavengers weren't among the victims of the
mysterious illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, those boys who dug out the metal did not get sick,''
argued Muliar. ''There must be some other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry adamantly denies the missiles or their fuel
could have caused the poisoning, and health experts have backed off
from their initial finding that the soil and water contained traces
of substances usually produced by decomposing missile fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The region has a host of other environmental scourges, including
an ammonia pipeline and an abandoned nickel plant. Official
explanations for the poisoning range from excessive amounts of
nitrates presumably used in fertilizer to poisonous fumes released
by scavengers burning plastic insulation off copper cables.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts from the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, an Israeli medical team
and Ukrainian investigative commission have all visited the site.
None could offer any conclusive explanation and said full analysis
would be costly and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery could remain unsolved forever.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it has brought some good to the area 190 miles south of the
capital, Kiev, throwing a spotlight on its poverty and
environmental ills. Charities have sent food and clothes. The
government is building a running water supply and has promised a
pipeline network to provide household gas.
</P>
<P>
   The victims have recovered, the investigators have gone, and
life in the villages is returning to normal. Yet the residents
remain fearful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know what caused all this,'' said Oleksandra
Pochekha, the mayor of Boleslavchyk. ''But we want a clear
answer.... Next year, spring will come, it will be hot again and
this could start all over again.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Falun Gong Members Reportedly Die  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FACKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Two members of the banned Falun Gong sect have
died in custody, the latest deaths in China's crackdown on the
spiritual movement, a rights group reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths bring to at least 52 the number of Falun Gong
followers who have died in detention, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy reported. While
it has not commented on every case, the government has denied the
deaths were the result of mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Jiang Zemin, Falun Gong practitioners
have threatened to mount more protests if authorities detain sect
members ahead of National Day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the Falun Gong followers throughout China will go to
Tiananmen Square to peacefully petition'' for an end to the
crackdown on the group, said the letter dated Sept. 20. The letter
was faxed to foreign news agencies and posted on the group's
U.S.-based Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was outlawed in July 1999, Falun Gong attracted
millions with its mix of exercise, meditation, Buddhist and Taoist
philosophy and the teachings of Li Hongzhi, who fled to the United
States two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The communist government has mounted a media campaign to
discredit the banned sect. An editorial Wednesday by the state-run
Xinhua News Agency was typical fare, calling Falun Gong ''an evil,
treasonous teaching'' and accusing it of causing more than 1,500
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, state media reported Liu Hongfeng, a
36-year-old elementary school vice principal, hanged himself at
home in the northern city of Lingwu on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Liu was put into a mental hospital in June after efforts to
persuade him to quit the sect failed, and was released in July when
his attitude ''took a turn for the better,'' Xinhua said. The
writings of the Falun Gong founder were found in the room with
Liu's body, said a police officer who confirmed the Xinhua account.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong-based information center said Tao Hongsheng, a
46-year-old former policeman in Hebei province, died Sept. 20 after
suffering from diarrhea and other ailments. Sentenced to three
years for protesting in Tiananmen Square in December, Tao was held
in a detention center in Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the detention center were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Another sect follower, Shi Bei, died Sept. 10 after being put
into a mental hospital in eastern Hangzhou city. During three
months there, she was regularly denied food and given unspecified
injections, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the mental hospital refused to comment on the
report.

<HEADLINE> Some HIV Patients Could Stop Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small number of patients stopped taking their AIDS drug
cocktails and still managed to keep the virus under control,
researchers say in one of the first studies to suggest that people
with HIV may not have to be on medication for the rest of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved just eight people, all of whom began taking
potent AIDS drugs within six months of infection, before the virus
had done too much damage.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings offer hope that the immune system can be primed
to battle the virus alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least in a select group of patients one can turn the tables
so that the immune system has the upper hand rather than the virus
having the upper hand over the immune system,'' said Dr. Bruce
Walker, a co-author of the study and director of Partners AIDS
Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Since potent drug cocktails containing protease inhibitors were
introduced in 1996, researchers held out hope that some day
patients would be able to get off the medication, which must be
taken according to a strict and complicated schedule and can have
toxic side effects.
</P>
<P>
   But finding patients to test that strategy has been difficult
and raises tricky ethical questions. Nobody could guarantee that
the virus would not bounce back with a vengeance, newly resistant
to the medication.
</P>
<P>
   The new study involved volunteers who were closely monitored and
checked twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   The eight patients had been taking AIDS drug combinations for
periods ranging from one year to three.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the eight remain off the drugs. One has been off the
treatment for 11 months. Two chose to resume the regimen even
though their viral levels remained relatively low. A third resumed
the drugs because of a sharp increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The patients who participated deserve an enormous amount of
credit for being willing to take the risks that were involved,''
Walker said. ''This was not a risk-free endeavor. We couldn't
guarantee that we weren't going to make these people worse.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are no guarantees that their viral levels will not
increase again.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time results from the study have been
published in a scientific journal, though preliminary findings have
been discussed at several AIDS conferences over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the new study is that drug cocktail therapy started
before much damage was done to the immune system, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   More research is needed on the effects of drug interruptions on
people who have been infected for more than six months, he said.
Most patients do not find out about their infection until much
later -- after the virus has damaged the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we're confident that someday we will be able to apply
these findings to treatment of chronic HIV infection, there's a lot
more we need to learn about augmenting the immune system's
response,'' said Dr. Eric Rosenberg, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Potent drug cocktails have saved lives but cost as much as
$12,000 a year and can cause severe side effects such as diabetes
and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers stressed that patients should not quit their
medication until more studies are performed.
</P>
<P>
   Future studies will attempt to determine the optimal timing for
starting the drugs, stopping them and restarting them if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Mitsuyasu, director of the Center for Clinical AIDS
Research and Education at the University of California at Los
Angeles, said that while the study was small, it gives some support
to the possibility that HIV could be reduced to a chronic,
manageable disease.

<HEADLINE> Report Aims at Better AIDS Education  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A slowing of the AIDS epidemic has led to
complacency, says a new report that calls on the government to
launch stronger prevention efforts and improve tracking of the
virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Improved treatments may have contributed to a false sense of
security and a dangerous complacency, but the need for prevention
has not diminished one bit,'' warned Dr. Harvey Feinberg, provost
of Harvard University and co-chairman of the committee that
prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
   While the spread of AIDS among gay men has declined over the
last 15 years, there has been an increase among women, minorities
and adolescents, according to the report released Wednesday by the
Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been recent reports of an increase in risky
behavior by men who have sex with men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of new HIV infections could be avoided each year if
we gave greater emphasis to prevention, and were smarter in the way
we spent our prevention dollars,'' said Feinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helene Gayle of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which requested the study, said her agency feels the
report ''is in keeping with where we are going as we look to shape
our strategic direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Its a very useful and comprehensive report. They state
unequivocally that prevention works ... but there is more that
could and should be done,'' she said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle said the agency's goal is to reduce the number of new HIV
infections by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The current tracking system collects data on AIDS but does not
provide a detailed picture of infections by the HIV virus that
causes the disease. Years can pass between infection and
development of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''By focusing mainly on AIDS cases, where diagnosis lags behind
HIV infection ... today's surveillance system looks at the past
rather than to the future and tracks where the epidemic has been
rather than where it is going,'' said James Trussell, associate
dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs at Princeton University and co-chair of the study
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lag is particularly problematic in light of the reality
that the epidemic has shifted into new population groups,'' he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The report called on the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to establish a system to identify new HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to count every newly infected person, the
report suggested estimating the number of new infections by testing
a sample of those at the highest risk, such as people visiting
clinics specializing in sexually transmitted diseases,
tuberculosis, substance-abuse treatment, and family planning.
</P>
<P>
   The report also stressed the need for increased prevention
programs and was critical of federal spending of $250 million to
promote abstinence ''without any evidence that this approach is
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report said, comprehensive sex education and condom
availability ''have been shown to reduce the risk of HIV and other
sexually transmitted diseases without promoting sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   It also called for a lifting of legal barriers to programs that
supply clean needles to drug addicts, as HIV is often spread by
needle reuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration in 1998 refused to use federal tax
dollars to buy clean needles for drug addicts, even though it said
needle exchanges fight AIDS without encouraging illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
said her scientific endorsement should encourage more communities
to start their own needle exchanges. But Shalala, under orders from
the White House, sidestepped a political fight with conservatives
and stopped short of providing communities with federal money to
let addicts swap dirty needles for clean ones.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences is an independent organization
chartered by Congress to provide advice to the government on
scientific topics. This report was requested by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic May Use Army To Hold Power  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- His rule badly shaken by an apparent
electoral defeat, Slobodan Milosevic may turn to his faithful army
commanders to help him hold onto power.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactic could backfire. Despite the loyalty of the top
brass, lower army ranks are not universally among the hard-line
Yugoslav president's allies.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the rank and file -- especially conscripts doing their
one-year compulsory military service -- support Vojislav Kostunica,
who claimed victory in Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Milosevic has decided to overturn the electoral will of the
people, he may try to do it by force,'' said Gen. Momcilo Perisic,
a former army chief of staff and now a Milosevic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he won't succeed,'' said Perisic, who was purged by
Milosevic from the military in 1998. ''There are many army officers
who applauded the opposition victory in the elections. I know what
I'm talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to verify Perisic's claim, sources
within the 60,000-member army confirm widespread soul-searching in
the ranks about how to respond to any order to use force against
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's longtime communist leader, Josip Broz Tito,
promoted the image of the armed forces as an institution to defend
the nation and avoid internal political bickering.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the old spirit has waned, commanders are
trained to see the military as an institution designed to confront
foreign -- not domestic -- enemies and to defend the constitutional
order.
</P>
<P>
   If the opposition convinces most Yugoslavs that it was robbed of
victory, the dilemma facing many in the ranks will be: Who is the
usurper? Milosevic or the opposition?
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Bulatovic, a Milosevic ally from Montenegro, which along
with Serbia forms Yugoslavia, rejected claims the army would step
in to safeguard Milosevic's stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone in this country is going to defend power
with the use of force, nor do I believe the army will step in,''
Bulatovic said. ''The army has always adhered to the constitution
and I urge it to do so now as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, however, has used the army in the past when he was in
trouble. In March 1991, he called out tanks to disperse massive
opposition demonstrations against him in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The army -- which shares Milosevic's communist ideology -- was
also instrumental in his military campaigns in Slovenia, Croatia,
Bosnia and Kosovo. The army -- not trained to fight civil wars --
ended up as a loser against ragtag forces from the former Yugoslav
states.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing fears that Milosevic may impose martial law to stay
in power, Serbian Orthodox Church Patriarch Pavle called on
''everyone, including the army and police, to defend the interests
of the people and the state rather than the individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, army commanders always felt they were playing
second fiddle to the powerful state police. Fiercely loyal to
Milosevic, the state police always had better salaries and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of the police -- which has repeatedly used brutal force
against anti-Milosevic demonstrators -- consists of less-educated
townspeople. The military ranks, especially the officer corps, come
mostly from villages and are considered less threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the disgruntled military might stage a coup against him,
Milosevic purged the top army echelons during last year's NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia, promoting his loyalists to command
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The generals, such as Defense Minister Dragoljub Ojdanic -- who,
like Milosevic, was charged with war crimes by the international
tribunal at the Hague -- have given unprecedented political support
to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   They have taken an active role in Milosevic's pre-election
campaign, claiming the army would never allow ''NATO lackeys and
Western stooges'' -- the phrases used by Milosevic to depict
Kostunica and other opponents -- to come to power in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But loyalty of the army's rank and file has remained suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army will think hard before they decide to protect the man
who actually lost the elections,'' said opposition leader Zarko
Korac.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Attack Russian Policy  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came
under attack Wednesday from House Republicans regarding Russia
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has failed ''to truly stand up to the
massive corruption in the Yeltsin government,'' said Rep. Benjamin
A. Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the International Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will anybody now call the Putin government to account for the
sake of democracy?'' he asked Albright, setting the tone for a
two-hour hearing, possibly Albright's last as Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms were wide-ranging.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., accused the administration of
secretly supporting the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban movement in
Afghanistan, a charge Albright flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. John Cooksey, R-Calif., said the administration had not
pressured Russia to close what he called an espionage facility at
Lourdes in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   --And Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said the administration ''has not
identified with the problems of the Russian people and more closely
identified with the new Russian oligarchy.'' As the economy
declines and the health of Russian children grows worse,
''relations with Russia are worse in many different ways than they
were a decade ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright countered that ''democracy is hard'' and ''it has been
especially difficult in Russia, whose people have no living memory
of political and economic freedom to guide them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton-Gore administration has not seen Russia through
rose-colored glasses,'' she said. ''We have been very realistic.
And we have dealt with something that has never been dealt with
before: how you deal with a former adversary that had an empire and
help to manage the devolution of that empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats rallied to Albright's defense, with one suggesting the
allegations were politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people have a need to make politics out of Russia's
problems,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., adding that the
Clinton administration had made the United States safer with arms
control agreements that have reduced Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the administration had pursued
''the only rational way'' of dealing with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is beyond our prerogative and power to determine Russia's
future,'' Albright said, telling the Republicans, ''We can work
together on a bipartisan basis to explore every avenue for
cooperation with Russia'' on arms control and security.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the political season, Albright, a longtime Democrat,
said that when she became secretary of state in 1997, ''I had my
political instincts removed.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, she said, ''maybe I have to see the surgeon again.''

</P>
<P>
   Tune in this week to MoneyWatchTV.com, a television show, and
watch five different women deliver the news. Then decide which one
you'd like to be the anchor, go online and vote for your favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In Survivor-like fashion, four of the five finalists will be
booted off until the most popular contestant remains. The anchor
with the most votes wins on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The talking-head wannabes include an actress, a producer for The
Oprah Winfrey Show, a singer and a couple of television reporters.
Some deliver the news with authority. One has a soft, throaty voice
that sets her apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each one has her own style,'' said Mary Mills,
MoneywatchTV.com's on-air director. ''To me, this is the ultimate
focus group. We tried to choose different types of people for broad
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The women were selected from hundreds of hopefuls who mailed in
videotapes after an ad for the $100,000-a-year job ran in Variety,
Hollywood Reporter and other entertainment publications. The
applicants included a former Saturday Night Live regular, a
chiropractor, a former MTV host, a CNBC correspondent and daytime
television actors.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gimmick the show's producers hope will give viewers the
anchor they want, not someone selected at random by a news
director. Of course, it can't hurt ratings, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a new one,'' said Barbara Cochran, president of the
Radio-Television News Directors Association, in Washington. She
called the show's approach a refreshing change.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences are astute enough to detect whether anchors are
credible and trustworthy, and whether they understand the material
they are presenting, Cochran said. The job doesn't necessarily
require a news reporting background, although it is helpful, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one contestant's friends could just go online
and vote repeatedly to knock the other contestants out, Cochran
said.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants said they prefer being judged by the audience
rather than by a news director.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel much less pressure,'' said 33-year-old Melinda Morrison
of Chicago and Seattle, an Emmy award-winning producer for Oprah
who says she has dreamed of being a news anchor since age 7.
</P>
<P>
   On the set, there's no lack of primping, but the contestants
seem mostly down to earth. Toni Redman walked into the studio
perfectly coiffed and decked out in a hot pink suit -- but barefoot
-- during taping one day last week. The actress from New York City
has no reporting experience, and delivering the news has been
tougher for her than for other contestants. But she has a sense of
humor to go with her Marilyn Monroe-like voice.
</P>
<P>
   ''That sounds bimbo-ish,'' she said after reading one line, and
asked to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Win or not, Redman said, she's happy for the experience. She
confides that her favorite candidate isn't herelf, but she won't
say who it is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think she deserves to win,'' Redman said. ''She is the
best one here.''

<HEADLINE> Pleasantville man sentenced to 14 years for killing 4-year-old  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - A Pleasantville man who beat his
girlfriend's 4-year-old son to death, then helped her hide the body
has been sentenced to 14 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Antwan Dixon, 23, ''has the character flaw of callousness,''
First Assistant Prosecutor Murray Talasnik told state Superior
Court Judge Albert Garofolo on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Dixon was baby-sitting Nico Lloyd on June 12,
1999, while his mother worked in an Atlantic City casino when he
punched the boy three or four times, knocking him backward and
causing his head to hit a bed frame.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother, Altovise Lloyd, returned home, Dixon told her
the boy had fallen and was hurt, Talasnik said. Neither his mother
nor Dixon sought medical help for him and he died between that
afternoon and the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and Dixon wrapped the boy's body in a sheet, put him
in a black plastic garbage bag and hid him in the attic of the
Pleasantville apartment they shared.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found a week later when a landlord went searching
for the source of what neighbors said was a foul odor.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon was charged with murder, evidence tampering, conspiracy
and hindering apprehension in the boy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Altovise Lloyd, 20, was sentenced to up to five years in prison
in February for her part in hiding the body. She had pleaded guilty
to child endangerment and evidence tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd agreed to testify against Dixon as part of her plea
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic's Opponents Rally  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of banner-waving
opponents of Slobodan Milosevic poured into Belgrade's main square
Wednesday to protest his alleged moves to steal Yugoslavia's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic stopped around Republic Square as the crowd streamed in
from all directions, carrying banners saying ''He is finished'' -- a
reference to Milosevic's apparent loss in Sunday's elections, in
which challenger Vojislav Kostunica claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the rally began, Yugoslavia's foreign minister
tried to discourage protests, appearing on state television and
alleging strong pressure by foreign countries against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Zivadin Jovanovic said the pressure was being applied through
foreign media and independent news organizations at home, which he
said were trying to present a distorted picture of the country in
service of Western enemies.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared, however, that many people in Belgrade were unmoved
by that. Crowds covered the square after opposition leaders urged
them to take to the streets, despite an earlier police ban on the
original site for the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition handed out 10,000 baby rattles for their
supporters to shake in the face of the Yugoslav leader and show
that despite his alleged efforts to rig the vote, he was a broken
figure -- playing on a Serbian language expression to describe
something defective as ''broken like a baby's rattle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can feel a lot of happiness in the air,'' psychologist Zarko
Trebjesanin said of Belgrade, the capital. ''The genie of freedom
and democracy has escaped from the bottle and it's impossible to
push it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, trying not to do anything that might give
Milosevic a pretext for a crackdown, did not contest a police order
to move the rally from the initial venue -- a platform in front of
Yugoslavia's federal assembly -- after authorities said it would
disturb work of the State Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our aim is to avoid clashes, but there are hard-liners in the
state leadership who want something to happen,'' said Zoran
Djindjic, a key Milosevic opponent. He said the opposition received
assurances from police that they would not intervene during the
rally. There was no visible police presence as the rally began.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, using figures from its poll watchers, claimed
Kostunica won 52.54 percent to Milosevic's 32.01 percent -- enough
for a first-round victory in the five-candidate field. But the
State Electoral Commission, which is loyal to Milosevic, says
Kostunica finished first with 48.22 percent while Milosevic polled
40.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would necessitate a runoff, since neither received more
than 50 percent. The opposition quickly rejected the idea, but the
government set the runoff for Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elections are not car races, in which a contestant can catch
up in the second round,'' opposition spokesman Cedomir Jovanovic
said. ''Our victory is not negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders backed the opposition's claim. In Washington,
President Clinton dismissed Yugoslav government plans for a runoff
as an apparent attempt to steal a fair election.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly appears from a distance that they had a free
election and somebody's trying to take it away from them,'' Clinton
said Wednesday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's official election commission has no
credibility whatever,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's ally Russia, however, warned Western countries not to
interfere. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow
''stands firmly for the peoples of Yugoslavia to have full freedom
to express their will without internal or external pressure'' and
urged other countries ''not to allow destabilization of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   An opposition delegation attempted to inspect the election
commission's returns on Wednesday, claiming they are short some
400,000 pro-Kostunica votes. The guards, however, allowed only one
member of the opposition team to enter briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is great fear among the commission,'' delegate Nebojsa
Bakarac said after coming out.
</P>
<P>
   Bakarac said he could not single-handedly inspect more than 5
million ballots and appealed to commission members to ''publish the
real results and act according to their conscience, without
creating tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cafes of this riverside Balkan capital buzzed
with theories on what Milosevic would do next. Many people went
about their business, quietly expressing optimism over the
political changes taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know he is done with,'' said Vladislava Vukovic, 48, a
lawyer. ''He cannot harm us any more.''

<HEADLINE> Backdrop Rockwell House for Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. (AP) -- In 1952, the home inspired a Norman Rockwell
painting. Today, it's in foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   A brick townhouse that was the backdrop for a painting depicting
America's optimism and vibrancy was recently turned over to the
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which will
offer it for sale for six months. If no one buys the house, valued
at $66,876, the city of Troy can acquire it for $1.
</P>
<P>
   The painting ''The Street Was Never the Same'' shows
rambunctious children chasing Henry Ford in his first automobile
and adults gawking from the stoop and open windows. The scene was
painted for a calendar marking the automobile's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pero, curator of the Norman Rockwell collection at the
Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., said Rockwell chose
Troy for several paintings because it was the nearest big city to
his home, first in Arlington, Vt., then in nearby West Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The building was last owned by a local businessman.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower in P.M. Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices slumped Wednesday as investors
concerned about third-quarter results again punished the shares of
poor performers.
</P>
<P>
   A round of bargain hunting early in the day helped push some
issues higher, but the rebound did not hold. The lack of staying
power was not a surprise: the market has spent much of this month
in a decline, reflecting uncertainty about how the moderating
economy will affect corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 34.78 to 10,596.54 in
late afternoon trading. It fell 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators struggled to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index dropped 43.92 to 3,645.18, after
spiking into positive territory earlier in the day. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 5.15 to 1,422.06.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a continuation of what we've had over the last three
weeks. The market gets sold off, stocks get a little bit of a
bounce up and then we sell off again,'' said Dick Dickson, a
technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing particularly exciting going on today. It's
really just a little bit here and a little bit there.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the market has been fixated on the approach of
third-quarter reports. Increasing indications that the economy is
slowing, combined with oil prices at decade-high levels and
Europe's weak currency, have many investors looking to the
third-quarter as a sign of what is to come for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Wednesday again punished or rewarded companies
depending on their earnings outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline fell $8.14 to $10.50 -- a 43 percent drop -- after the
discount travel Web site said its bottom line would be hurt by weak
airline ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected earnings report helped push 3Com up $3
to $16.94 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks were up, as well, on persistent concerns about
fuel costs as winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil rose $2.25 to $88.88; Enron jumped $1.44 to $86.94.
</P>
<P>
   There was also limited bargain hunting, but most stocks weren't
able to hang on to their gains.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 68 cents to $44, as the chipmaker struggled to
rebound from a slump that began Friday when it warned of
disappointing profits. Micron Technology rose 88 cents to $50.56,
after failing to sustain a nearly $4 increase.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems rose $2.75 to $117.63. Hewlett Packard climbed
$3.44 to $102.44.
</P>
<P>
   But investors didn't blindly snap up technology-related stocks.
Web portal superstar Yahoo! fell $12.44 to $90, while e-tailer
Amazon was down $3.06 to $36.69. Both companies have faced
questions in recent weeks about profitability and whether their
business models will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology is seeing some real concerted selling across the
board on profit-taking. It's fear of a slowdown,'' said Scott
Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. He believes
Internet stocks and some of telecom and semiconductor issues are
especially vulnerable because they traded at such high premiums
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those sectors that are the most expensive will have the
biggest downside, and that includes technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and old-economy stocks also had a tougher time as
profit-seeking investors moved money out of blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell $1 to $52.50. Caterpillar slipped $2.25 to $32.75
</P>
<P>
   And Corning tumbled $16 to $307 after it announced it was buying
part of the fiber optic operations of Pirelli, an Italian company.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 925.16 million
shares, well ahead of the 868.24 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.92 at 508.92.

<HEADLINE> City moves to solve thousands of unsolved rapes  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Trying to clear thousands of unsolved rapes, the
city announced Wednesday that it has contracted with three DNA labs
to analyze evidence before the statute of limitations on the crimes
expires.
</P>
<P>
   The city has a backlog of about 16,000 ''rape kits'' -
biological evidence collected from victims after sexual assaults.
About half of the kits were taken more than five years ago, too
long to even prosecute the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that the $12 million in contracts make
New York the first city to award such contracts in order to deal
with its backlog of rape investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This initiative will enable us to make a significant
investment in making the city safer for the city's women,'' Bronx
District Attorney Robert Johnson said at a news conference. ''This
DNA testing of the backlog combined with the databank that's being
assembled in Albany will allow the district attorneys to make cases
and prosecute people who had for years eluded capture and evaded
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Johnson and Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau
pointed out that the analysis could also clear some men who have
been wrongly convicted of rape or other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It works both ways,'' said Morgenthau. ''It exonerates the
innocent, convicts the guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests on the rape kits will be performed first for rapes that
occurred within the state's five year statute of limitations for
prosecuting sex crimes. Rape kits for crimes that can no longer be
prosecuted will be analyzed anyway, said Police Commissioner
Bernard Kerik.
</P>
<P>
   But of the 16,000 rape kits that need analysis, the three
contracts cover testing for only 12,000 of the rapes. The rest,
some dating from the early 1990s, will be analyzed later, city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Once analyzed, the DNA from the kits will be stored in city,
state and federal databanks and compared with genetic material from
convicted offenders, as well as DNA from unsolved cases and missing
persons.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 state law also requires those convicted of violent
felonies, including sex crimes, to provide DNA samples for the
databank.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of DNA testing say the process violates the civil
rights of individuals, but Harriet Lissel, executive director of
the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assaults, said the tests
are an important tool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rape victims who have been raped by strangers who have not
been caught lack a sense of closure to the incident,'' she said.
''They continue to feel unsafe and fearful because rapists often
tell them that they will come back to harm them as a way to keep
them quiet. ... DNA testing gives them new hope.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,087 rapes reported in the city in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to do away with the five-year statute of limitations
on sex crimes died in the state Assembly last year.

<HEADLINE> Leading pediatrician Frank Disney dies at 88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Dr. Frank Albert Disney, a pediatrician
for 59 years credited with popularizing office-based clinical
research, is dead at age 88.
</P>
<P>
   Disney died after a lengthy illness Sept. 18 at his home in the
Rochester suburb of Pittsford.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Disney and Dr. Burtis Breese started the longtime
practice in pediatrics of combining clinical practice with
office-based studies of strep throat and related childhood
diseases. He retired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York City, Disney grew up in Darien, Conn. He
earned his medical degree from the College of Physicians and
Surgeons at Columbia University. After interning at Babies Hospital
in New York, he moved here in 1939 to become a resident at Strong
Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of World War II, Disney directed the Rochester
Blood Bank, then one of less than a half-dozen blood collection
centers in the nation. He served with the Army in the Pacific
theater, on Guam and later in the Philippines, from 1943 to 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He never met his famous third cousin, animator Walt Disney,
because ''he was too busy seeing sick children,'' Noreen Ireland, a
clinical research colleague, said in Wednesday's Rochester Democrat
and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife of 33 years, Rosemary Disney; a
daughter, Linda Bennett of Glenfield, N.Y.; two sons, Dr. George
Disney of Johnstown, N.Y., and Robert Disney of Aspen, Colo.; two
stepsons, David Johnston of California and Todd Johnston of
Georgia, and a stepdaughter, Susan Johnston of Rochester; and a
sister, Ruth Currie of Williamsburg, Va.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Rock has struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation champ has signed a $5.5 million
deal with Universal Pictures to star as the action hero in ''The
Scorpion King,'' a spinoff of the upcoming ''The Mummy 2.'' It is
one of the highest amounts paid an actor in his first starring
role.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock, whose real name is Dwayne Johnson, had a small role as
the Scorpion King in ''The Mummy 2,'' in which his formerly
virtuous character becomes evil.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we watched the Rock in dailies of 'The Mummy 2,' his
charisma jumped out at us and we created a story that has a
prehistory context, adventure and humor,'' said Universal president
Kevin Misher. ''It's a terrific template for the birth of an action
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mummy 2'' will be released in May, and ''The Scorpion
King'' is expected to hit theaters around Christmas 2001 or summer
2002.

<HEADLINE> Streisand Concerts 'sold out'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Scalpers expecting to make a profit on Barbra
Streisand's farewell concerts at Madison Square Garden have
resorted to selling tickets for less than face value -- about
half-price in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts Wednesday and Thursday night were officially sold
out within hours. But plenty of tickets were being offered by
brokers over the Internet on Wednesday at prices ranging from $500
to $1,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The face value of the tickets was $125 to $1,500, with VIP
tickets going for $2,500, including dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Several brokers who would speak only on condition of anonymity
said that as the concerts approached, the more expensive tickets
started selling for less than face value.
</P>
<P>
   One man who described himself as a ticket wholesaler who sells
to other brokers said that he could probably secure one of the
$1,500 tickets for $700 or $800.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's spokesman, Ken Sunshine, said he was glad some
brokers had lost money on the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled about that,'' he said. ''They're the scourge of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand has said the shows plus two performances in Los
Angeles last week would mark the end of her concert career.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's live performances have been infrequent. Up until a
pair of 1993-94 New Year's concerts in Las Vegas, she had not
performed before a paying audience in nearly three decades.

<HEADLINE> Unions among those in new coalition to boost school resources  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state's strongest teachers' unions are
part of a new coalition dedicated to increasing resources so
schools in New York can help students reach new academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Quality Education said Wednesday that while the
state is demanding more from schools and students, those schools
and students have the right to demand more from the state. Namely,
said Sarah Hafensteiner of the group's steering committee, schools
need ''the necessary resources and tools to enable all children -
rich and poor, upstate and downstate, the rural and urban - to meet
the higher standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafensteiner, a school board member in the
Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk district south of Albany, said the state
Board of Regents' new standards have left schools throughout the
state at a ''crossroads.'' More resources are needed in most
districts, or their students run the risk of failing to meet the
Regent's demands, she contended.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in state aid to education have been at record-high
levels in the past three years, but poorer urban and rural
districts still face a number of serious deficiencies, several
members of the group said at a news conference in Albany and in six
other cities Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest teacher unions in the state - New York State United
Teachers, the National Education Association-New York and the
United Federation of Teachers - are part of the 100-plus member
coalition. Other groups involved ranged from statewide consumer
groups like Citizen Action to neighborhood civic groups from
Buffalo, Harlem and Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union and the Fiscal Policy
Institute, a think-tank funded partly from union contributions, are
also in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members agreed on a four-point agenda they said they
would lobby for in the coming months with Gov. George Pataki and
the state Legislature: Reducing class sizes; improving the quality
and training of teachers; improving the quality of classrooms and
other school facilities; and making early childhood education
programs available to all youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The group had no estimate how much it would cost to address all
four issues over the next five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not have a specific dollar amount at this time,''
Hafensteiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Per-pupil spending on public education in New York is typically
among the top two or three among all the states.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Mauro, chief researcher with the Fiscal Policy
Institute, said that statistic is skewed by the high spending in
affluent, chiefly suburban, districts in New York. Schools in rural
and inner-city districts typically spend far below the state
per-pupil average, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the right amount of per pupil spending in all
the districts where all the needs are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is providing more than $13 billion in the 2000-01
fiscal year to public schools, a record. The year-to-year education
aid increases from the state the past three years, in fact, have
set records.

<HEADLINE> 'T-Boz' Won't Tour With TLC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tionne ''T-Boz'' Watkins, a member of the
Grammy-winning R&AMP;B group TLC, says she won't be touring with the
group anymore because of health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, who is pregnant, has been hospitalized several times
for the blood disease sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   She made the decision to stop touring after the all-girl group
did a pay-per-view special at the end of its last tour. She went
directly from a hospital to the stage and barely got through the
performance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Touring was ''not healthy, not good and not smart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, an effervescent bleached blonde, wrote the single ''My
Getaway'' for the upcoming movie ''Rugrats In Paris.'' The movie is
to hit theaters in November.

<HEADLINE> Streisand farewell concerts 'sold out,' but brokers still have tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Barbra Streisand's farewell concerts at Madison
Square Garden this week were officially sold out within hours, but
the true story is closer to ''I Can Get It for You Wholesale.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerts Wednesday and Thursday night were officially sold
out within hours. But plenty of tickets were being offered by
brokers over the Internet on Wednesday at prices ranging from $500
to $1,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The face value of the tickets was $125 to $1,500, with VIP
tickets going for $2,500, including dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Several brokers who would speak only on condition of anonymity
said that as the concerts approached, the more expensive tickets
started selling for less than face value.
</P>
<P>
   One man who described himself as a ticket wholesaler who sells
to other brokers said that he could probably secure one of the
$1,500 tickets for $700 or $800.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's spokesman, Ken Sunshine, said he was glad some
brokers had lost money on the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled about that,'' he said. ''They're the scourge of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand has said the shows plus two performances in Los
Angeles last week would mark the end of her concert career.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's live performances have been infrequent. Up until a
pair of 1993-94 New Year's concerts in Las Vegas, she had not
performed before a paying audience in nearly three decades.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Seeks Limelight on Unity Day  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Scandal-tarnished Helmut Kohl stepped back into
the limelight Wednesday to recall his greatest accomplishment -- a
reunited Germany -- and appeared to blink back tears at an event
staged after he wasn't offered a chance to speak at the national
Unity Day celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as the ''Unity Chancellor,'' Kohl received polite
applause and a brief standing ovation from a crowd of supporters at
the event organized by a foundation allied with his Christian
Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has said he will stay home for the national celebration in
Dresden on Tuesday, 10 years after the country became one again on
Oct. 3, 1990. Although he was invited as a guest, the ex-chancellor
wasn't offered the chance to take the podium.
</P>
<P>
   In one of two events planned this week to give him a chance to
take credit and recall his party's better days, Kohl criticized
leaders of the then-opposition Social Democratic and Greens parties
-- now running the country -- by saying East and West Germany would
never have reunited without the visionary policies of his Christian
Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''In contrast to many Social Democrats and most Greens, the
Union has since its founding considered itself the party of German
unity,'' Kohl said. ''And it has remained that way up to today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl singled out comments by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, made before the collapse of the
Berlin Wall in 1989, in which they talked pessimistically about the
chances it would ever come down.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event was held in a run-down hall that once served
as a border checkpoint on the communist side of the Wall and now is
a cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   The location prompted a quip from Kohl, 70, who said during his
nearly hourlong speech that he had once been refused entry into
East Germany at the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see how I enjoy the fact that today there is no unwelcome
person in this hall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl didn't have to leave the hall to find critics.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Merkel, now the leader of the Christian Democrats, said
the scandal that Kohl touched off by admitting he accepted
anonymous donations had led to ''difficult months for us all.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has grown to include revelations of off-the-books
campaign funds, money laundering, and an investigation by
parliament into whether decisions were bought during Kohl's 16
years in power. Prosecutors are considering criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Hear Suit Against Eastwood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. (AP) -- The jurors hearing a disabled woman's
federal lawsuit against Clint Eastwood got a tour of the actor's
ranch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with muscular dystrophy is seeking unspecified damages
from Eastwood because parts of his historic Mission Ranch hotel
were inaccessible to her wheelchair when she had dinner there in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were driven 75 miles from their San Jose courtroom to
see for themselves whether Eastwood could have done more to
accommodate wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood was present but did not lead the tour and was not
allowed to talk to jurors. The plaintiff, Diane zum Brunnen, 51,
did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood bought Mission Ranch, which has buildings dating to the
1850s, in 1987 for $4.2 million and has spent more than $6 million
on renovations. He testified last week that he has tried to provide
wheelchair access while maintaining the historic feel of the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments were expected Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Poll shows Hillary Clinton hitting 50 percent for first time  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Clearing a psychological as well as a
statistical hurdle, Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Wednesday hit the 50 percent support mark for the first time this
year in a major statewide independent poll.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac University Polling
Institute, termed it ''the magic 50 percent mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The days of wine and roses are here for Hillary, if they
stick,'' Carroll said. ''With 50 percent, you can't lose. You can
tie, but you can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponent Rick Lazio, professing a lack of concern as
he campaigned in upstate New York, did call himself ''the underdog
in this race'' - a term he hasn't used in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac poll showed the first lady leading the
congressman from Long Island, 50 percent to 43 percent, among
likely voters. A Sept. 12 poll from the Hamden, Conn.-based
institute had Clinton leading, 49 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign was crowing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know this race is going to be close, but it's nice to hit
the big five-oh,'' Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a difference a point makes,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Lazio campaign has made much of Clinton's
failure to hit 50 percent in the polls. On Wednesday, his campaign
downplayed the new poll with spokesman Dan McLagan noting that
statistically ''there's no change from the last Quinnipiac poll.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's numbers have been edging up in recent weeks after
being stalled for most of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls detected a bounce for her in the wake of their first
debate, a Sept. 13 faceoff in Buffalo notable for Lazio's striding
across the stage and demanding she sign a pledge to ban soft money
from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters, especially women, were offended by what Wolfson
called a ''menacing'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was for her already before the debate and it made me feel
for her even more,'' said Fran Goodstein of Yonkers as she shopped
Wednesday at the Galleria Mall in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Not all women at the mall agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thought he had to do what he did and you can't tell me it
was so terrible,'' said Serena Maglio of suburban Greenburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 46 percent of voters surveyed by Quinnipiac who
watched the debate, Clinton had the edge, 44 percent to 34 percent.
While earlier polls had found her struggling among white women, the
new one had her up slightly, 49 percent to 45 percent, in that
group.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's push for the soft-money ban did pay off when Clinton
agreed on Saturday to stop using such funds for advertising in her
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But some voters were unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what soft money is and neither does anybody else,
so to me they're both wasting a lot of time,'' undecided voter
Dolores Ray of Lewisboro said Wednesday. ''Talk to me about taxes,
(if) you want me to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   While other recent polls have shown Clinton edging close to the
50 percent mark, two out last week disagreed on the closeness of
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion had the two tied
at 48 percent each while a New York Times/CBS News poll had Clinton
leading Lazio, 48 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a disheartening note for Lazio, the Quinnipiac poll found the
race extremely close - he at 46 percent, she at 44 percent - in
traditionally more conservative upstate New York. She has been
campaigning widely in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''The upstate stuff shouldn't be that close'' if Lazio is to
win, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban-based congressman did lead, 53 percent to 40
percent, in the suburbs surrounding New York City, but she was
ahead in the heavily Democratic city, 67 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   She led, 60 percent to 35 percent, among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   While 38 percent of voters said they viewed the first lady
unfavorably - no real change from past polls - his unfavorable
rating reached 29 percent in the wake of the debate and heavy
anti-Lazio TV advertising from the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And while Lazio has been making much of the ''trust''' issue,
his work in Congress and her lack of electoral experience, 67
percent of voters said a candidate's position on issues was more
important than ''experience and personal qualities'' or
''character.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent of voters said Clinton shared their views on
key issue while 51 percent said that about Lazio. He had the edge,
72 percent to 57 percent, on understanding the issues and problems
facing New York. She only moved into the state in January.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac's telephone poll of 889 likely voters was conducted
Sept. 20-25 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country music singer Chris LeDoux is
suffering from liver disease and needs a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   LeDoux, 51, has been diagnosed with primary sclerosing
cholangitis, which blocks the bile ducts and leads to cirrhosis.
The disease is marked by fatigue and yellowing of the eyes and
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say many patients with the condition survive only about
two years without a transplant. The cause of the disease is not
known.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tell LeDoux he can make a full recovery with a
transplant, he said Tuesday. He has been added to organ donation
lists.
</P>
<P>
   LeDoux specializes in songs that celebrate the rodeo and cowboy
subculture. He has sold more than 5 million albums, and been cited
as an influence by country music star Garth Brooks.

<HEADLINE> Game which had $100 million jackpot in '99 will reappear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state Lottery game which generated a $100
million jackpot in 1999 is returning next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales will begin Sunday for a new Millennium Million
jackpot, state Lottery Director Margaret DeFrancisco said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing for a starting jackpot of $50 million will be held
Oct. 21. If there is no grand prize winner, another drawing would
be held weekly starting Oct. 28 until someone hits the jackpot. New
tickets must be purchased for each drawing, DeFrancisco said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the game sold well in 1999 and short-order cook
Johnnie Ely from the South Bronx collected $100 million for being
the sole jackpot winner.
</P>
<P>
   Players must select five numbers from 1 to 50 and one additional
number from a field of 1 to 25, called the Millennium Ball. Tickets
cost $2 per play.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Oneida Land Claim, 1st Ld-Writethru,0560  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday joined other
politicians to ask the federal government to withdraw from Native
American land claims in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called on the Clinton Administration to end the U.S.
Justice Department's involvement in all land claim lawsuits against
land owners in New York, noting that a judge had scolded the
federal government for acting in ''bad faith'' in the Oneida Indian
Nation land claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton Administration should not wait for another federal
judge to say their actions amount to bad faith before dropping
these outrageous claims that threaten the private property rights
of thousands of innocent New York State citizens,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn rejected the Oneida's
motion to add 20,000 individual property owners as parties to their
claim seeking compensation for 250,000 acres of lost ancestral
lands in Madison and Oneida counties. The Oneidas have said they
sought to add landowners to their claim as a negotiating strategy
and would not actually seek any evictions.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn, however, allowed the Oneidas to add the state of New
York as defendants in their 26-year-old lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said adding landowners to the lawsuit ''would only
unnecessarily further prolong this litigation and increase
community tensions in the claim area.'' He said he could not
''countenance'' needlessly keeping 20,000 innocent landowners in a
state of legal limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas could appeal McCurn's decision, but representatives
for the three bands of the Oneidas said they have reached no
decisions. Mark Emery, spokesman for the Oneida Indian Nation of
New York, said lawyers were still studying McCurn's 66-page
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The justice department, required by federal law to represent the
interests of Native Americans, has supported the Oneidas in their
claim.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, and
Republican Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, the local congressman, wrote
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno asking the justice department not
to appeal McCurn's ruling. They also asked the justice department
to drop all claims against property owners in Indian land claim
cases, including the Seneca Nation case in Grand Island, in western
New York, and the Mohawk Nation, in northern New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that Judge McCurn has released the landowners from this
suit, it is high time for the department to begin serving as a
mediator in these cases, and stop acting as a litigant threatening
innocent landowners,'' Schumer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, landowners took it upon themselves to write a
letter to Congress asking for a law that would permanently protect
property owners from eviction in Indian land claim cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want (Congress) to pass a bill which will remove eviction
and, more importantly, clear our titles so we can have transferable
titles,'' said John Ben Carroll, the lawyer for the group,
Madison-Oneida Landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Some players in the case are hopeful the decision will reopen
the door to a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope it would make a difference and that (the Oneidas)
would come back to the bargaining table,'' said Madison County
Board of Supervisors Chairman Rocco DiVeronica.

<HEADLINE> Official Accused of Obstruction  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee chairman accused a Labor
Department official Wednesday of ''serious obstruction'' by
lobbying against proposed legislation to revamp veterans employment
and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans
Affairs Investigative Subcommittee, told Assistant Labor Secretary
Espiridion ''Al'' Borrego at a hearing that he asked the
department's inspector general to investigate whether the official
violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   A statute prohibits use of federal funds for lobbying campaigns
intended to influence a member of Congress' position on
legislation. Borrego has opposed the bill -- now expected to die in
committee -- that would have imposed performance standards for
veterans job counselors whose pay is funded by the Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he was concerned about allegations that Borrego
attempted to persuade Miss America, Heather French, to change House
testimony she was giving in favor of the bill; threatened to
withhold grant money from a homeless veterans organization unless
the group backed his view on the bill; and used federal funds to
lobby against the legislation in Everett's district.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said it appeared that Borrego was ''orchestrating active
opposition'' to the legislation despite the anti-lobbying law.
''This is serious obstruction to Congress doing its business. Who's
going to run the country, duly elected members of Congress or
overzealous bureaucrats?''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego, who is in charge of veterans employment and training
programs in the Labor Department, responded that the agency's chief
lawyer concluded earlier this month that no rules or laws were
broken by Borrego in his conversation with French. Borrego said he
made ''no attempt to have Ms. French advance any position in her
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not address other allegations, but previously has denied
through a department spokesman that he threatened to withhold grant
money.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general acts independently of the labor secretary,
unlike the department solicitor who conducted the initial review;
that official who works directly for the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   French, who has made homeless veterans her cause, had told The
Associated Press in July that on the eve of her testimony in favor
of the legislation, Borrego tried in a telephone call to persuade
her to change her position. The AP reported last week that the
director of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, Linda
Boone, has told Labor Department investigators that Borrego had
threatened to withhold grant money.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, the department rejected a request from Boone's
coalition for a $121,277 grant to assist community groups serving
homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph McGowan, a spokesman for the inspector general, said the
office is evaluating Everett's request.

   But officials from the Justice Department, the FBI and the
Energy Department insisted at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
hearing that their only choice was a plea bargain to get Lee to
tell them what he did with the tapes. Lee has sworn he has
destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answers were more important than prosecuting Dr. Lee for
his very serious crimes,'' said James Robinson, assistant attorney
general overseeing the criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to one of the 59 counts of his grand jury
indictment. In exchange, he was released after being held for nine
months. He also agreed to tell officials what happened to the
information he downloaded at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno told
the Senate Select Intelligence and Judiciary committees Tuesday
that they had decided that they couldn't reveal nuclear secrets in
court to prosecute Lee. The presiding judge had indicated he would
force the government to do so, said U.S. Attorney Norman Bay of
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had that happened, our indictment would have been gutted,''
Bay said, because prosecutors would not have any evidence, other
than the secrets they were unwilling to use. ''At the end of the
day, we would have had nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers took advantage by threatening prosecutors with a
trial, promising a ''long slow death march'' toward publicity on
the nuclear secrets, Bay said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone had told me they were going to put me on a long
slow death march, I would have told them, 'Let's start walking,'''
said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain prompted U.S. District Judge James Parker to
apologize to Lee for the nine-month pretrial imprisonment and to
say that government officials in charge of the case had embarrassed
''our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers had offered prosecutors a similar bargain earlier,
Specter said. ''The underlying question is ... whether the
government could have gotten the same deal in December if you had
pursued it,'' Specter said, and spared Lee the time spent in jail
and the government the cost of prosecution since then.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson said: ''I don't have any doubt in the world ...
that the government could not have gotten this arrangement any time
before it was negotiated in this very extensive way over this very
extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also said Tuesday one of the reasons they decided against
going to court was that FBI Agent Robert Messemer had admitted
giving false testimony during a bail hearing for Lee. ''While we do
not believe this error significantly undercut the overall evidence
against Doctor Lee, it did affect the agent's creditability and
thereby damaged the prosecution,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   But Messemer simply made a mistake, FBI lawyer Larry Parkinson
said. ''He said he made an honest mistake and the judge did not
challenge his characterization of it,'' he said. ''I know Agent
Messemer has been flatly condemned as a liar and that is unfair to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Messemer is now being investigated by the FBI's Office
of Professional Responsibility, which is triggered any time a judge
questions an agent's testimony, Parkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to Tuesday's hearing, the hearing was halted after
Democrats invoked a Senate rule that limits committee hearings when
the Senate is in session. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., asked for the
action to protest what he called the Republicans' failure to
approve judicial nominees.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Halt Afghan Refugee Flood  </HEADLINE>
By LIDA ISAMOVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) -- Tens of thousands of frightened
Afghanis fled intensified fighting toward Tajikistan on Wednesday,
and Russian and Tajik troops braced to turn back a refugee flood at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for the United
Nations to push for talks between Afghanistan's warring factions,
saying there is no military solution to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian envoy, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, was in Islamabad and
urged Pakistan to help close training camps for Islamic militants
in Afghanistan. Pakistan is considered an ally of the Taliban
militia that claim to control 95 percent of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia fears that a Taliban victory in all of Afghanistan would
boost the spread of armed Islamic movements throughout Central
Asia. Tajikistan is still scarred from a five-year civil war with
Islamic forces that ended in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also contends that the Taliban have been aiding rebels
fighting Russian forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 135,000 Afghanis were believed to be heading toward
the Tajik border Wednesday, a flood that could overwhelm the
country's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has about 25,000 troops and border guards in Tajikistan.
Their commander, Gen. Alexander Markin, declared that ''we will
take all the necessary measures to prevent border violations and
keep refugees from getting into Tajikistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees from the fighting were already camping on islands
in the Pyandz River that marks the boundary between Tajikistan and
Afghanistan, Markin said. He said the fighting they were fleeing
was getting closer -- tanks and artillery were seen in combat just
six miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russian border guards are strong enough to stop any
provocations,'' he said, but Russia and former Soviet Central Asian
states are clearly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's call for greater U.N. efforts was echoed by Uzbek
President Islam Karimov, who lambasted the world organization for
limiting its efforts on Afghanistan to ''sanctions that don't
frighten anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurgents trying to carve out an Islamic state in the area
where Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan meet are believed to
have received training in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, although apparently few in number, have been
tenacious fighters. Uzbek and Kyrgyz troops have failed to wipe out
the rebels in fighting that has dragged on since last month.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Tajik troops began joint four-day maneuvers Tuesday.
Border guards say there have been no major incidents since last
week, when artillery shells fired by the Taliban at the opposition
landed in Tajikistan. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have won a string of victories this month, driving
the northern-based opposition alliance into an isolated northeast
corner of the country.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Saved From Severe Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices failed to rebound Wednesday as
investors concerned about third-quarter results again punished the
shares of poor performers.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline could have been much worse. Bargain-hunting in
the last hour of trading helped battered issues stage a mild
recovery, allowing the Dow Jones industrial average to almost break
even and limiting the size of the Nasdaq composite index's drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed down 2.96 at 10,628.34, according to preliminary
calculations, after dropping as much as 40 points during the day.
It fell 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also were lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped 61.01 to 3,628.09, after spiking into
positive territory earlier in the day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 6.03 to 1,421.18.
</P>
<P>
   ''You did see some bargain hunting for some of these beat-up
tech stocks and that perhaps is one reason why you saw the Nasdaq
and Dow come back,'' said Dick Dickson, a technical analyst at
Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. ''But by and large, investors are more on
the sell side. When a stock comes down or a company warns, they
sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the market has been fixated on the approach of
third-quarter reports. Increasing indications that the economy is
slowing, combined with oil prices at decade-high levels and
Europe's weak currency, have many investors looking to the
third-quarter as a sign of what is to come for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Wednesday again penalized or rewarded companies
depending on their earnings outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline fell $8.14 to $10.50 -- a 43 percent drop -- after the
discount travel Web site said its bottom line would be hurt by weak
airline ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected earnings report helped push 3Com up
$3.06 to $17 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks were up, as well, on persistent concerns about
fuel costs as winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil rose $2.88 to $89.50; Enron jumped $1.94 to $87.44.
</P>
<P>
   There was also limited bargain hunting, but most stocks weren't
able to hang on to their gains.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 56 cents to $43.88, as the chipmaker struggled to
rebound from a slump that began Friday when it warned of
disappointing profits. Micron Technology rose $1.94 cents to
$51.63, after failing to sustain a nearly $4 increase.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems rose 44 cents to $117.93, unable to hold a
nearly $3 gain. Hewlett Packard climbed $3.81 to $102.81.
</P>
<P>
   But investors didn't blindly snap up technology-related stocks.
Web portal superstar Yahoo! fell $12.06 to $90.38, while e-tailer
Amazon was down $1.88 to $37.88, after being down more than $3
earlier in the afternoon. Both companies have faced questions in
recent weeks about profitability and whether their business models
will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology is seeing some real concerted selling across the
board on profit-taking. It's fear of a slowdown,'' said Scott
Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. He believes
Internet stocks and some of telecom and semiconductor issues are
especially vulnerable because they traded at such high premiums
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those sectors that are the most expensive will have the
biggest downside, and that includes technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel fell $4.56 to $59.44.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and old-economy stocks also had a tougher time as
profit-seeking investors moved money out of blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell $1.13 to $52.38. Caterpillar slipped $2.19 to
$32.81.
</P>
<P>
   And Corning tumbled $15.75 to $307.25 after it announced it was
buying part of the fiber optic operations of Pirelli, an Italian
company.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.16 billion shares,
ahead of the 1.10 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 3.13 at 506.76.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs: Combat Readiness in Threat  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's military leaders told Congress on
Wednesday that American troops are in danger of losing their
war-fighting edge unless the next president adds tens of billions
of dollars to the defense budget or adopts a less ambitious agenda
for using the military in hot spots around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must find the resources necessary to modernize the force,''
said Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Otherwise the cumulative strains of carrying out
peacekeeping and other overseas missions -- while also preparing for
major wars -- will erode combat readiness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current budget of nearly $300 billion should be increased,
said Shelton, who did not specify by how much, saying the exact
figures could be established after next year's planned review of
national security strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He and the chiefs of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps
were called before the Senate and House armed services committees
to assess military readiness, a hot topic of debate in the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the
Senate committee, pleaded for a bipartisan discussion, but the
hearing quickly became a verbal tug-of-war between Democrats
defending the Clinton administration's record and Republicans
accusing the administration of running down the military.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the committee's ranking Democrat,
said George W. Bush has called for adding $45 billion in defense
spending and Al Gore has proposed adding $100 billion, several
Republican members objected, saying Bush has not offered a firm
figure on how much he would increase spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., even dragged into the discussion
Defense Secretary William Cohen, the only Republican in Clinton's
Cabinet, and Cohen spokesman Kenneth Bacon, although neither was
present. Roberts chided Bacon for having told reporters that Cohen
had cautioned the military chiefs not to ''beat the drum with a tin
cup'' when they appeared at Wednesday's hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe his bow tie is a little tight,'' Roberts said of Bacon,
citing the spokesman's fashion trademark.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Convention last month, Bush declared
the military in dangerous decline and laid blame on a Clinton-Gore
administration that he said had overused and underfunded the armed
forces. His assertions triggered a debate on military readiness
that led to Wednesday's hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that for several years the Pentagon has moved money
from procurement accounts -- for the purchase of new weaponry and
equipment -- to pay for training and other day-to-day costs of
maintaining the force. That has kept troops ready for combat, but
at the cost of replacing aging equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our equipment is wearing out at a much faster rate than
expected,'' said Shelton, who is the highest-ranking military
adviser to the president and the secretary of defense.
''Consequently, our troops are paying the price'' by spending more
time fixing mechanical problems instead of training for war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are, collectively, robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without formally endorsing the specific figure, Shelton cited a
Congressional Budget Office report that said the Defense Department
procurement budget, now $60 billion, should be increased to $90
billion for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the problem could have been lessened if Congress
had accepted Cohen's request for more military base closures. The
Pentagon estimates it can save $3 billion a year by closing more
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Warner countered that President Clinton spoiled the chance for
more base closures when he intervened in 1996 -- during the last
round of closures -- to avert the shutdown of a major base in Texas
and another in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, said reductions in
the Army during the 1990s went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more people,'' he said. ''Our soldiers believe that
the Army is too small for the missions it is asked to perform and
underresourced for the operational tempo it executes.'' He did not
say how many soldiers the Army needs beyond the 480,000 it now has
on active duty. Aides have said he favors adding 30,000 to 40,000
soldiers, although a specific proposal is unlikely before next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, each of the military chiefs said they are
confident U.S. troops can meet the worst-case scenario of having to
fight two major wars at nearly the same time. But they said there
would be ''high risk'' that in the second of the two wars, the
fight would last longer and cost more lives.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they felt comfortable with that level of risk, each
chief replied no.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq, S&AMP;P All End Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   (New York-AP) -- The major averages slumped again as investors
concerned about third-quarter results punished the shares of poor
performers. After moving in and out of positive territory, the Dow
Jones industrial average ended down almost three points at 10,628.
But the broader market was higher as advancing issues topped losers
15 to 13, with about 1.1 billion shares changing hands on the New
York Stock Exchange. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite saw
the most weakness, closing down 32 points, or nearly 1 percent, to
end at 3,656. The S &AMP; P 500 was down a fraction at 1,426.
</P>
<P>
   A round of bargain hunting early in the day helped push some
issues higher, but the rebound did not hold. The lack of staying
power was not a surprise as many big name stocks have spent much of
this month in a decline, reflecting uncertainty about how the
moderating economy will affect corporate profits.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Helps Colorectal Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the biggest advance against end-stage colorectal cancer in 40
years, researchers have found that combining a new drug with the
standard ones can more effectively slow the cancer and prolong
victims' lives slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're starting to bring science to the point that it's
breaking the logjam in progress,'' said Dr. Leonard B. Saltz of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The drug irinotecan, also known as Camptosar, already is
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating patients
with advanced, Stage IV colorectal cancer after standard drugs
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Because such advanced colorectal cancer is practically a death
sentence, researchers led by Saltz tested irinotecan together with
the standard drugs, fluorouracil and leucovorin.
</P>
<P>
   The three-drug combination increased average survival from 13
months to 15 months, and the share of patients whose tumors
temporarily shrank went from 28 percent to 50 percent, compared
with the standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, far fewer patients suffered from two serious side
effects -- one of them a life-threatening decrease in
infection-fighting white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a big step forward in giving patients a better chance
for tumor shrinkage and longer survival,'' Saltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important, the promising three-drug approach
is now being tested in Stage III patients, or those whose tumors
have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to other organs, as in
Stage IV.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that this will lead to a greater number of people
being cured,'' Saltz said.
</P>
<P>
   The study appears in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the results earlier this year, the FDA called the
three-drug combination the standard against which future treatments
should be tested, and many oncologists already are adopting it,
Saltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Fluorouracil has been the standard drug for colorectal cancer
since 1960; since the 1970s, leucovorin has been added to boost
fluorouracil's effectiveness slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Colorectal cancer is America's No. 2 cancer killer after lung
cancer, claiming 56,000 lives annually. While its exact cause
remains unclear, it involves alterations in many genes over years
and changes in the colon wall that let precancerous polyps develop.
Doctors advise people 50 and older to get regular colonoscopies so
polyps can be detected and removed.
</P>
<P>
   In the current study, conducted at dozens of sites in North
America, Australia and New Zealand, 226 patients received
fluorouracil and leucovorin injections, while 231 patients got
periodic shots of those two drugs plus irinotecan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides surviving longer, patients in the three-drug group had a
longer period when the tumors stopped growing or shrank: seven
months versus four months. Many patients had such mild side effects
they never missed work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about them living longer, living better, but
ultimately the treatment fails,'' Saltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients over 65 fared the same as younger ones on the
three-drug regimen -- a key point because many doctors hesitate to
treat elderly patients aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Irinotecan is as expensive as most new cancer drugs, roughly
$6,000 for a six-week course, but insurance companies routinely pay
for it, Saltz said.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Robert J. Mayer of
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston wrote that because
irinotecan blocks reproduction of cancer cells differently than the
way fluorouracil and leucovorin attack, ''progress, albeit slight,
has at last occurred in the treatment of patients with advanced
colorectal cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Saltz is now heading a National Cancer Institute study at
hospitals across North America to determine whether the three
drugs, given after surgery to remove tumors in Stage III patients,
can cure the more than the 65 percent now saved by surgery and the
standard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Saltz said the study of about 1,200 Stage III patients should
produce results within five years.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Clinic Restraints Ban  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House gave final legislative approval
Wednesday to a measure that would ban the use of restraints in
mental health care facilities unless a patient is a danger to
himself or others.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has supported the proposal, which
passed 394-25 as part of the Children's Health Act. A White House
spokeswoman said Wednesday the administration will review the bill,
which also calls for increases in children's health research
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people who work at these facilities are good
people and good employees,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn,
the chief sponsor. ''But there are problems that this bill
addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill cleared the Senate last week.
</P>
<P>
   Physical restraints restrict a person's movement, and may
include the use of straitjackets and leather straps. Chemical
restraints such as sedatives, and confining patients to isolated
areas also would be restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, restraints could be used only under the
written order of a licensed health care practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would apply to any hospital or health care
facility that receives federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional report concluded last year that there were 24
deaths caused by the misuse of restraints and seclusion during
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would require institutions to report any deaths
attributable to the use of restraints or seclusion. Additionally,
the legislation would ensure that the mental health facilities have
enough well-trained staff members.

<HEADLINE> Glickman: $2B Needed in Farm Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than $2 billion in government aid will be
needed from Congress to compensate farmers and ranchers for damages
from drought and other weather problems this year, Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some $1.4 billion would cover losses from crops, while another
$800 million would go to livestock producers, many of whom have
lost pasture to drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those numbers could rise as we watch and see what happens''
with the fall harvest, Glickman told the House Agriculture
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Most farmers have enjoyed good weather this year. Growers are
expected to harvest record amounts of corn and soybeans this year,
the nation's two biggest crops, but several states, including
Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Georgia, have been going through a severe
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska lawmakers have been seeking more than $500 million in
aid for their state alone.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are planning to include money for disaster payments in
the final version of a pending appropriations bill for the
Agriculture Department. The Senate version of the bill earmarked
about $1 billion for disaster assistance; the House version had
none.
</P>
<P>
   The money is intended to compensate producers for losses that
aren't covered by federally subsidized crop insurance. About 30
percent of the nation's acreage isn't covered by the insurance, and
some farmers who do have only enough coverage to reimburse them for
near-total losses.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to get more producers to buy the
insurance. Congress passed legislation earlier this spring that
would provide $8.2 billion over the next five years to reduce
premiums and expand the coverage to more crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''By and large this is a good deal for American farmers,''
Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   But he told the committee that private companies that sell and
service the policies are making excessive profits in comparison to
other lines of insurance. Glickman, who leaves office in January,
said his successor should renegotiate the terms of the government's
contract with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, companies had an operating profit of $276 million on
the insurance and received another $500 million to cover their
administrative expenses. Some 18 companies now sell the insurance.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lapse in Aviation Security  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lapses in computer security have put the
safety of U.S. skies at risk, according to a congressional report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators said ''serious and pervasive
problems'' plagued the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency
that runs the nation's air traffic control system and oversees its
airlines and airports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wile FAA is working to address computer security weaknesses,
its progress has been slow in key areas,'' the report from the
General Accounting Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the agency puts itself through the comprehensive measures
suggested by the GAO, it will continue to have ''undue exposure to
intrusions and malicious attacks on its facilities, information and
resources,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Garvey, the agency's head, highlighted the improvements
that have come after a 10-month GAO investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident that the changes we have put into place and the
new policies that we have developed ensure that this issue receives
the priority and attention it deserves,'' Garvey told the House
Science Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Science Committee chairman Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
agreed that much had improved at the FAA, but complained about the
agency's cooperation on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''At every turn, FAA has attempted to minimize the importance of
the issue and give the committee and its staff misleading
information about the state of security at FAA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said FAA efforts had fallen short when it came to
policing the most critical security areas, including the physical
security of facilities, systems security and personnel security.
The report did not deal with how a computer attack might happen, or
what problems it might cause.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability of federal information systems has been
highlighted by the potential threat of hackers and computer viruses
like the ''Love Bug'' that afflicted computers worldwide earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Just three of the FAA's 90 air traffic control systems have been
given a clean bill of health, according to the report. The agency
cannot properly protect such systems until they are analyzed and
weaknesses are identified, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also failed to make adequate background checks on
outside contractors hired to locate and repair the weaknesses of
its most critical systems, particularly during the massive effort
to deal with the Y2K computer glitch. In doing so, the agency went
against its own security procedures, which conducting special
background checks on foreign nationals hired to work FAA
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FAA... failed to conduct background checks on these
foreign nationals to ensure they were not a security risk to the
agency,'' said Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Now that many of these workers have left the country, the
agency's most sensitive systems are ''at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report detailed how FAA security officials cited ''name
checks'' of the foreign nationals performed by the Central
Intelligence Agency against a database of suspected terrorists as
their only background investigation. It said FAA would now need to
re-assess all the systems worked on by non-U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Until the backlog of security checks are finished, ''the full
extent of these systems' potential vulnerability to unauthorized
access will remain unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It should not require a Congressional hearing for a federal
agency to realize that it needs to abide by its own security
requirements,'' said Sensenbrenner. ''Unfortunately, with FAA, that
appears to be the case.''

<HEADLINE> Higher Response Rate Aids Census  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress in the midst of budget
negotiations, the Census Bureau announced it had a $305 million
surplus in large part because more people than expected mailed back
a form, director Kenneth Prewitt said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House and Senate overseers, Prewitt reported that
the savings resulted from ''...higher than expected mailback
response rates'' for Census 2000, and ''...better than expected
quality of the field management team in the 520 local offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 120 million forms mailed, 67 percent were returned, the
Census Bureau has said, beating an expected 61 percent response
rate. That meant fewer non-responding households to for
census-takers to track down -- the most expensive part of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials hope news of the surplus plays well with
congressional appropriators. President Clinton requested $719
million for the Census Bureau next fiscal year, which starts
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform census subcommittee, said ''the intent
is to allow the bureau to tack on'' about $20 million for new
programs and plans to renovate agency headquarters. A House-passed
version currently allots $667 million.
</P>
<P>
   While echoing Prewitt's praise of the public, Walker also said
''However it will not be acceptable for there to be large surplus
if we have a large undercount.''
</P>
<P>
   The $305 million was part of more than $4.4 billion in emergency
appropriations Congress authorized for the Census Bureau earlier
this year, to avoid counting it against spending limits.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Plane Had Previous Problems  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Learjet that carried golfer Payne Stewart
to his death last October -- probably after losing cabin pressure --
had previous problems with its cabin pressure system, maintenance
logs show.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, 1998, a pilot reported that the plane sometimes would
not hold cabin pressure at low altitude, and in July 1999,
mechanics again were asked to check the system, according to
maintenance reports released Wednesday by the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The logs also showed that a valve had to be replaced following
inflight loss of cabin pressure on June 28, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Stewart was on departed Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 25, for
Dallas. Radio contact was lost with the plane as it passed north of
Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The flight continued on autopilot until it ran out of gas and
crashed near Aberdeen, S.D. There has been speculation that the
cabin pressure system failed, causing the crew and passengers to
pass out from loss of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The crash destroyed or damaged several parts of the oxygen and
pressure systems; some remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB, which continues to investigate the accident, has
released, without comment, a series of reports on the crash
describing the findings of various teams of analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was operated by Sunjet Aviation Inc., which had done a
repurchase inspection on the plane on Feb. 8, 1999. Since then,
company records showed there had been a repair on a cabin door,
some service was done on emergency air lines, an oxygen bottle line
was replaced and a flow valve was cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, two weeks before the crash, a bleed air leak was
found in the plane's tail and was repaired by replacing a gasket.
Bleed air is drawn from the plane's engines to increase the
pressure inside the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the accident, Sunjet maintenance workers fixed an
engine power problem by replacing a fuel flow valve, the report
showed. The morning of the crash the plane was flown to Orlando at
altitudes of 12,000 feet to 13,000 feet with no pressure problems
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes are pressurized so that the atmosphere inside never
feels higher than about 8,000 feet, even if the aircraft is flying
much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has reported that Stewart's plane climbed as high as
51,000 feet during its flight across the nation's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   The jet flew four hours and 1,400 miles before it crashed in
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The new report showed no conversation on the plane's cockpit
voice recorder which, though heavily damaged in the crash, saved
the final 30 minutes of sound.
</P>
<P>
   That included an altitude warning alarm, which stopped just
before the crash as the plane descended, and a high speed alarm
which continued until the end of the tape. The cabin altitude
warning alarm sounds when pressure drops below the 10,000 foot
level.

<HEADLINE> Scalpers Losing on Streisand Tickets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Scalpers expecting to make a profit on Barbra
Streisand's farewell concerts at Madison Square Garden have
resorted to selling tickets for less than face value -- about
half-price in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts Wednesday and Thursday night were officially sold
out within hours. But plenty of tickets were being offered by
brokers over the Internet on Wednesday at prices ranging from $500
to $1,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The face value of the tickets was $125 to $1,500, with VIP
tickets going for $2,500, including dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Several brokers who would speak only on condition of anonymity
said that as the concerts approached, the more expensive tickets
started selling for less than face value.
</P>
<P>
   One man who described himself as a ticket wholesaler who sells
to other brokers said that he could probably secure one of the
$1,500 tickets for $700 or $800.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's spokesman, Ken Sunshine, said he was glad some
brokers had lost money on the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled about that,'' he said. ''They're the scourge of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand has said the shows plus two performances in Los
Angeles last week would mark the end of her concert career.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's live performances have been infrequent. Up until a
pair of 1993-94 New Year's concerts in Las Vegas, she had not
performed before a paying audience in nearly three decades.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 3; Nasdaq Falls 61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices failed to rebound Wednesday as
investors concerned about third-quarter results again punished the
shares of poor performers.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline could have been much worse. Bargain-hunting in
the last hour of trading helped battered issues stage a mild
recovery, allowing the Dow Jones industrial average to almost break
even and limiting the size of the Nasdaq composite index's drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed down 2.96 at 10,628.34, according to preliminary
calculations, after dropping as much as 40 points during the day.
It fell 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also were lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped 61.01 to 3,628.09, after spiking into
positive territory earlier in the day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 6.03 to 1,421.18.
</P>
<P>
   ''You did see some bargain hunting for some of these beat-up
tech stocks and that perhaps is one reason why you saw the Nasdaq
and Dow come back,'' said Dick Dickson, a technical analyst at
Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. ''But by and large, investors are more on
the sell side. When a stock comes down or a company warns, they
sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the market has been fixated on the approach of
third-quarter reports. Increasing indications that the economy is
slowing, combined with oil prices at decade-high levels and
Europe's weak currency, have many investors looking to the
third-quarter as a sign of what is to come for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Wednesday again penalized or rewarded companies
depending on their earnings outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline fell $8.14 to $10.50 -- a 43 percent drop -- after the
discount travel Web site said its bottom line would be hurt by weak
airline ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected earnings report helped push 3Com up
$3.06 to $17 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks were up, as well, on persistent concerns about
fuel costs as winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil rose $2.88 to $89.50; Enron jumped $1.94 to $87.44.
</P>
<P>
   There was also limited bargain hunting, but most stocks weren't
able to hang on to their gains.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 56 cents to $43.88, as the chipmaker struggled to
rebound from a slump that began Friday when it warned of
disappointing profits. Micron Technology rose $1.94 cents to
$51.63, after failing to sustain a nearly $4 increase.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems rose 44 cents to $117.93, unable to hold a
nearly $3 gain. Hewlett Packard climbed $3.81 to $102.81.
</P>
<P>
   But investors didn't blindly snap up technology-related stocks.
Web portal superstar Yahoo! fell $12.06 to $90.38, while e-tailer
Amazon was down $1.88 to $37.88, after being down more than $3
earlier in the afternoon. Both companies have faced questions in
recent weeks about profitability and whether their business models
will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology is seeing some real concerted selling across the
board on profit-taking. It's fear of a slowdown,'' said Scott
Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. He believes
Internet stocks and some of telecom and semiconductor issues are
especially vulnerable because they traded at such high premiums
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those sectors that are the most expensive will have the
biggest downside, and that includes technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel fell $4.56 to $59.44.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and old-economy stocks also had a tougher time as
profit-seeking investors moved money out of blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell $1.13 to $52.38. Caterpillar slipped $2.19 to
$32.81.
</P>
<P>
   And Corning tumbled $15.75 to $307.25 after it announced it was
buying part of the fiber optic operations of Pirelli, an Italian
company.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.16 billion shares,
ahead of the 1.10 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 3.13 at 506.76.

<HEADLINE> FTC To Allow Boeing To Buy Hughes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and European regulators will allow Boeing
Co.'s $3.75 billion purchase of Hughes Electronics Corp.'s space
and communications division, though Boeing will have to undertake
measures to prohibit a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Wednesday that the moves are necessary to prevent
Boeing from potentially raising costs to other competitors or
having access to information that would reduce competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''This consent agreement will ensure that competition in the
highly specialized markets for satellites and launch vehicles will
be maintained,'' said Richard Parker, the FTC's competition bureau
director.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing president Harry Stonecipher said the restrictions would
not be a problem for the acquired company, which will be run
separately as a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The restrictions themselves don't cause us any anguish,''
Stonecipher said. ''They're the kinds of things we would be doing
in the business anyway. But, certainly, having them written down
made the outside world feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Wednesday, European Union antitrust regulators
approved the deal after its own probe into its impact on the
European satellite market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation dismissed earlier doubts that the operation
could significantly strengthen Hughes' position in commercial
geostationary communication satellites as well as the concern that
the parties might induce Hughes' satellite customers to procure
launch services from Boeing,'' said a statement from the European
Commission in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The EC said it had worked closely with the U.S. antitrust
authorities on the case and that its decision ''does not prejudice
the outcome of the assessment in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. agreement, Boeing could no longer provide systems
engineering and technical assistance services to the Defense
Department for a classified program. The FTC said Boeing is the
sole supplier of a particular unidentified classified program and
Hughes is one of two competing contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's launch vehicle division also could not have access to
nonpublic information its satellite division receives from
competing suppliers and must ''erect firewalls'' between its
satellite and launch vehicle divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also would be required to provide satellite interface
information to all other launch vehicle suppliers. The agreement
also appoints a trustee to ensure Boeing complies.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher said integrating satellite building with Boeing's
launch facilities wasn't Boeing's intent when it agreed to buy
Hughes' satellite arm. He cited Hughes' ''intellectual capital'' as
a huge asset, pointing to the joint contract for new U.S. spy
satellites recently won by Hughes and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher noted that their communications expertise would help
Boeing to provide wireless Internet access on board its commercial
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be the Yahoo! in the air,'' Stonecipher said.
''That means if somebody's eyeballs fall on a screen on an
airplane, they're going to be able to participate in e-commerce
right from their seat. We're going to be in that revenue stream and
Hughes is going to be a player in helping us be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is subject to public comment until Oct. 27. The
FTC then will decide whether to give final approval.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing shares closed down $1.50 Wednesday at $64.56 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Partisanship on Drugs Resumes  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed
Wednesday that prescription drug coverage for Medicare recipients
is more important than partisan politics, then swiftly resumed
campaign-season warfare over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats were AWOL'' when Republicans pushed their
legislation through the House earlier in the year, charged Rep.
Bill Thomas, R-Calif. As for Vice President Al Gore and his
campaign rhetoric on the subject, Thomas said the Democratic
presidential candidate ''appears to be a pathological
prevaricator'' -- a liar in plainer, dictionary terms.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats rolled wheelbarrows piled high with empty drug
vials along a sidewalk outside the Capitol in a made-for-television
event designed to dramatize the urgency of helping Medicare
recipients cope with the high cost of medicine. Senior citizens
walked alongside, some holding their pill bottles aloft.
</P>
<P>
   ''For months Republicans in Congress have blocked these benefits
in the name of sham bills that don't provide universal coverage --
that don't help people who truly need it -- and that the president
will not sign,'' said Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
''They have blocked these benefits as a favor to the pharmaceutical
companies and the insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   With rhetoric hardening on both sides, the prospect for
legislation appeared dim beyond an effort to allow reimportation of
drugs from Canada, where they are less expensive than in the 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, several Republicans said during the day that a
plan to pass year-end prescription drug coverage for low-income
seniors, possibly by tacking it onto an unrelated spending bill,
was losing favor among GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally favor establishment of prescription drug
coverage under Medicare, a system in which seniors would pay a
monthly premium in exchange for a standard benefit. Republicans
generally oppose that approach.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a GOP measure that relies on subsidies to
the insurance industry as an inducement to offer prescription drug
coverage. Several proposals are circulating in the Senate,
including one that would help low-income seniors while deferring
further action until next year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent exchanges of letters among President Clinton and
congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans have each rejected
the other's approach and stepped up the political maneuvering
despite periodic declarations that partisanship isn't important.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too important for partisan politics,'' said Rep. Ernie
Fletcher, R-Ky., a physician in a tough re-election fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that helping all seniors with skyrocketing
prescription prices is more important than partisan politics,''
Gephardt and 179 other Democrats wrote House Speaker Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks before the election, the prescription drug issue
has emerged as a key concern among voters, and while most polls
show Democrats hold a preference over Republicans on the issue, the
GOP has been making a strong effort to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
   The debate mirrors the presidential campaign, where Gore and
Bush have swapped charges over their differing approaches to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans criticize the Democratic approach as a ''big
government'' solution to the problem, and liken it to the plan for
universal health care that Clinton sought in 1994. ''The Bush plan
provides seniors prescription drug coverage without a
'Hillary-style' national drug plan,'' says one piece of mail the
Republicans sent to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the Gore plan you have no choice, no flexibility,'' it
says. ''You get one chance to join his proposed prescription drug
plan - at age 64 1/2. After that, you are left out forever. It's
the Gore plan for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized upon the same letter during the day to
underscore their claim that Republicans have historically opposed
Medicare, and are attacking a proposed benefit that would be a
companion to existing coverage for doctor bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans' dirty little secret is finally out. The only
problem that they have with Al Gore and the Democrat prescription
drug plan is that it's run by Medicare,'' said Jenny Backus, a
Democratic spokeswoman. ''We've always knon that they were opposed
to Medicare. Now they're saying it in TV ads and mail pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the letter suggested Republicans were
sharpening their attack on Gore's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It describes the monthly premium as an ''access fee,'' and says
it would be ''deducted from your Social Security check.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare premiums are currently paid from Social Security
benefits.

<HEADLINE> Euro Up Before Denmark Referendum  </HEADLINE>
By MIRANDA LEITSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro edged slightly higher against the
dollar and other major currencies Wednesday, an indication that
Friday's joint intervention was providing a solid short-term base
for Europe's ailing currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It at least has broken the psychology,'' said Ricardo Gomes,
head of foreign exchange at HSBC USA. ''Those people that were
hedging are starting to come to the market. They know that the
Central Bank is going to act as a base.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro maintained its post-intervention gains Wednesday,
supported by steady yen and dollar sales.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 88.30 cents, up
from 88.27 cents late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Compared to the activity over the last few days, it was a
relatively calm day,'' Gomes said. ''The ranges were reasonably
narrow. In New York, it stayed in the 87.00 and 88.60 range.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly joined the European
Central Bank and the Bank of Japan Friday to stop the euro's free
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now all eyes are on the next event that could affect the euro:
the Danish referendum on the single currency. On Thursday, Denmark
will vote on whether to join 11 other European Union countries in
replacing its national currency with the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democratic-led government strongly favors replacing
the 125-year-old Danish krone, but the latest polls show the
referendum remains too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The market has already prepared itself for a 'no' vote, Gomes
said, adding that he did not expect any dramatic changes if the
Danes reject the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Thursday's vote, Gomes said that currency traders
expected there to be a ''continued upside pressure on the euro.
It's the idea that with the euro, people are working on a short
term bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar also was quoted at 107.29 Japanese
yen, down from 107.64 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.7253 Swiss francs, down from
1.7290, and 1.4968 Canadian dollars, almost unchanged from 1.4869.
The British pound rose to $1.4620 from $1.4607.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 2.2153 German
marks, down from 2.2220; 7.4301 French francs, down from 7.4524;
and 2193.20 Italian lire, down from 2,198.93.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 3; Nasdaq Falls 33  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Wednesday, failing to rebound
as investors concerned about third-quarter results once again
punished the shares of poor performers.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline could have been much worse. Bargain hunting in
the last half hour helped some battered issues stage a mild
recovery, allowing the Dow Jones industrial average to almost break
even and limiting the size of the Nasdaq composite index's drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed down 2.96 at 10,628.36 after dropping more than
50 points during the day. It fell 176 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also closed lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped 32.80 to 3,656.30, its fifth straight
decline, after spiking into positive territory earlier in the day.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 0.64 to 1,426.57.
</P>
<P>
   ''You did see some bargain hunting for some of these beat-up
tech stocks and that perhaps is one reason why you saw the Nasdaq
and Dow come back,'' said Dick Dickson, a technical analyst at
Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. ''But by and large, investors are more on
the sell side. When a stock comes down or a company warns, they
sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the market has been fixated on the approach of
third-quarter reports. Increasing indications that the economy is
slowing, combined with oil prices at decade-high levels and
Europe's weak currency, has the market pessimistic about earnings
for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Wednesday again penalized or rewarded companies
depending on their earnings outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline fell $7.89 to $10.75 -- a 42 percent drop -- after the
discount travel Web site said its earnings would be hurt by weak
airline ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   But a stronger than expected earnings report helped push 3Com up
$3.06 to $17 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks were up, as well, on persistent concerns about
fuel costs as winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil rose $2.63 to $89.25; Enron jumped $1.96 to $87.46.
</P>
<P>
   There was limited bargain hunting, but most stocks weren't able
to hang on to their gains.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 56 cents to $43.88, as the chipmaker struggled to
rebound from a slump that began Friday when it warned of
disappointing profits. Micron Technology rose $1.94 cents to
$51.63, after failing to sustain a $3 increase.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems rose 44 cents to $117.94, unable to hold a
nearly $3 gain. Hewlett Packard climbed $3.81 to $102.81.
</P>
<P>
   But investors didn't blindly snap up technology stocks. Yahoo!
fell $12.06 to $90.38, while Amazon.com was down $1.88 to $37.88,
after being down more than $3 earlier in the afternoon. Both
companies have faced questions in recent weeks about profitability
and whether their business models will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology is seeing some real concerted selling across the
board on profit-taking. It's fear of a slowdown,'' said Scott
Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. He believes
Internet stocks and some of telecom and semiconductor issues are
especially vulnerable because they traded at such high premiums
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those sectors that are the most expensive will have the
biggest downside, and that includes technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Communications equipment manufacturer Nortel Networks fell $4.72
to $59.28, while Motorola was down $1.25 at $28.63.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and old-economy stocks also had a tougher time as
profit-seeking investors moved money out of blue chips. Citigroup
fell $1.13 to $52.38, and Caterpillar slipped $2.19 to $32.81.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-10 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.39
billion shares, ahead of the 1.32 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.76 at 508.13.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.81 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.72 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose
0.90 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.41 percent.

<HEADLINE> Giordano campaign chief dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERBURY, Conn (AP ) - With just six weeks to go in his
long-shot bid for U.S. Senate, Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano has
dismissed his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Longino, who left his job as mayoral chief of staff to
run Giordano's campaign, left the campaign last week, campaign
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Longino's departure earlier this week, Giordano
initially denied any rift and said the two men parted by ''mutual
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Waterbury Republican-American reported Wednesday that
Longino lost his job because he failed to disclose that his
girlfriend's father runs a printing company Longino hired to print
campaign literature. Giordano's campaign paid Totalgraphics Inc. of
South Norwalk more than $300,000, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Company president Richard Marino is the father of Longino's
girlfriend, Jennifer Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Totalgraphics received $305,000 in business from the Giordano
for U.S. Senate Committee to print campaign literature, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Longino said he has been dating Jennifer Marino for a little
more than a year, but that he's used Totalgraphics for at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Giordano said there have been discrepancies with invoices
from Totalgraphics and that some bills were overpaid. Campaign
officials were scheduled to visit Totalgraphics Wednesday to seek
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working with the company to clear up the invoice
problem. They have agreed there were errors and they will be
returning money to the campaign,'' Giordano said. ''I'm glad we can
work this out...and get back to the mission of winning on Nov. 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said Wednesday that Longino had long been
planning to leave his $2,500-per-week campaign post and return to
his job as captain in the Waterbury Fire Department, but that the
disclosure over the printing issue hastened his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano's friends told the newspaper he is angry and hurt over
what he perceives as a betrayal by a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Longino said Wednesday that the printing controversy had
nothing to do with his decision to leave the campaign. Instead,
Longino said he left because the campaign didn't have enough money
to pay him.
</P>
<P>
   Longino, a divorced father of three, told the Associated Press
that he could not afford to rely on the struggling campaign to pay
his bills. Giordano, who trailed Lieberman by 53 percentage points
in a recent Quinnipiac University poll, has had trouble raising
money.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano himself provided the campaign's biggest boost with a
$300,000 line of credit that he secured with his house and a
savings certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaign doesn't have any money. They can't pay me,''
Longino said.
</P>
<P>
   Longino also said he has reimbursed the campaign $250 for
personal calls he made on a campaign cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Longino, who ran all three of Giordano's mayoral campaigns and
briefly served as his chief of staff, acknowledged that his
relationship with Giordano has been ''strained'' by the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very frustrated,'' Longino said of Giordano. ''On a
personal note I think he's finally realizing that after nine
campaigns, you can't always win. It's a tough road running against
a guy who's running for vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Longino's departure leaves campaign manager Jim Paolino as the
top staffer. Paolino said Wednesday that Giordano will
''definitely'' air TV ads in the next few weeks criticizing
Lieberman. Paolino also predicted that the race will tighten as
voters grow weary of Lieberman's insistence on running for two
offices at the same time.

<HEADLINE> McCain Blocks Bailey NHTSA Bid  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain is blocking a vote on
President Clinton's nominee to lead the government's auto safety
agency, saying that Sue Bailey did not completely disclose to his
committee all the contributions she has made to Democratic
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey wrote McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
on Wednesday to apologize for the ''most embarrassing oversight.''
She included a complete list of her political giving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always intended to provide a complete list of information
about my 10 years of contributions, and it was an oversight that
that didn't happen,'' said Bailey, the former assistant secretary
of defense for health affairs who is line to head the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain aide said Wednesday that the Arizona Republican was
reviewing Bailey's documents.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's committee last week recommended approval of Bailey,
acting administrator since August. But McCain, R-Ariz., learned
later that Bailey had contributed more than $119,000 to Democratic
campaigns since 1992 instead of the $53,000 she reported to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Using Senate rules, McCain has blocked his colleagues, who must
approve the nomination, from voting on Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find this discovery especially troubling in light of the
fact that you swore to the accuracy of your statements to the
committee,'' McCain wrote Bailey on Tuesday. ''A number of these
contributions were very recent, so there should not be much cause
for confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes amid Capitol Hill's focus on the agency for
its investigation of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s recall of 6.5
million Firestone tires that have been linked to 101 U.S. traffic
deaths.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Mideast Peace Is Possible  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says a Middle East peace
agreement remains possible but elusive, and success requires all
sides to ''leap off into the future together.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Palestinian official offered little hope for continuing
negotiations, predicting that the meetings would end Thursday after
just three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that these negotiations will end tomorrow,'' Hassan
Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian representative in Washington, said
Wednesday. But he added, ''Efforts are ongoing to breach gaps
between the Israeli and Palestinian positions on all the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators returned here at
Clinton's request Tuesday to try once more to arrange a
comprehensive peace settlement. The two sides remain deadlocked
over the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say there will be; I can't say there won't be,''
Clinton said when asked if an agreement is reachable. ''We're
working as hard as we know how,'' he told reporters in the Rose
Garden of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can do it,'' he said. ''But it will require what these
difficult things always require: a remarkable convergence of both
sides willing to make difficult decisions and kind of leap off into
the future together.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, actions by lawmakers on Capitol Hill threatened to
hamper the negotiations. The House voted 385-27 Wednesday to cut
off all except humanitarian aid to the Palestinians should Yasser
Arafat unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said they were concerned Arafat would act after
Congress adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's vote reaffirms that the United States will not support
any Palestinian entity that is not created through peaceful
negotiations with Israel,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Abdel Rahman said, ''Without any doubt this vote will affect
the credibility of the United States as a mediator in the peace
process and the possibility of playing a more active role in this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The House measure does not allow for U.S. recognition of a
Palestinian state in any way. The president also would be
authorized to withhold payment and U.S. contributions to any
international organization that recognizes a unilaterally declared
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli delegation was headed by Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami, and the Palestinians' by senior negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
   The parties met with Clinton in New York earlier in the month,
but the deadlock over Jerusalem persisted. In July, Clinton was
unable to persuade Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to compromise on that and other issues at a summit
meeting at Camp David, the presidential retreat in western
Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Corzine's TV spending no guarantee for ultimate ratings in election </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Jon Corzine is spending an average of $1.7
million a week to tell people who watch television he should be the
U.S. senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic contender is even ponying up about $5 million for
commercials aired during coverage of the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's done, the one-time Wall Street financier will
have spent almost $12 million on TV advertising in New York and
Philadelphia for the nine weeks of the fall campaign. That could
put the Corzine campaign's total outlay close to $50 million for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   TV contracts might guarantee Corzine viewers, but they won't
necessarily deliver voters.
</P>
<P>
   And all that money might be wasted if New Jersey voters do what
they did in 1996: Turn out to vote and then tune out the Senate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all living through a first. None of us have ever seen
anything like this before,'' said Ingrid Reed, director of the
Eagleton Institute's Project New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden State is home to a traditionally independent
electorate, a majority of which makes its mind up in the days
before Election Day, not weeks or months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   So are Corzine's millions being spent now in advertising wasted?
No one is really sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe this is just a waste of money. You just really don't
know,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Election watchers have seen enough for them to know what might
prompt a large voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the last statewide race for U.S. Senate in 1996,
when 72 percent of registered voters actually voted. Only 31
percent voted in the 1999 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Senate race between Democrat Bob Torricelli
and Republican Dick Zimmer drew national attention for its negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared to be competitive, one reason people say they
feel compelled to vote, according to Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of voter turnout seems to depend on whether people feel
their vote will be important,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 election also featured the presidential election, which
usually draws a larger turnout. But many New Jersey voters skipped
over the choice for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers can't be certain, but ''it's likely there was a
connection'' between the negative campaign and the voter drop off,
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jerseyans have a reputation for being able to tiptoe their
way around the ballot,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters do want to know their candidates and Corzine's
advertising on television can help there, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But voters might see the spending itself as an issue and avoid
either Corzine the candidate or the Senate race altogether, Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At what point do people say enough already. We don't know if
that turns them off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One early return is in, at least on a portion of Corzine's
advertising. And the number's aren't necessarily good for the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   National Nielsen ratings for the Olympic games are 35 percent
lower than those from Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In one early stretch, a week when television contracts showed
Corzine paid $63,000 for several 30-second commercial spots,
ratings were the lowest for any Olympics since the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Appellate Court gives priest right to intervene in sexual abuse cases </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state Appellate Court has ruled that
seven Roman Catholic priests have the right to intervene in a
lawsuit filed by 12 men who claim another priest sexually abused
them as children.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which overturns a lower court decision, allows
lawyers for the seven priests to argue motions to prevent
disclosure of their personnel files.
</P>
<P>
   The seven other priests are not named in the lawsuit and are not
accused of any sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for 12 men who have accused the Rev. Raymond Pcolka
of sexual abuse sought the personnel files of the seven priests to
buttress their case against Pcolka and the Diocese of Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the lawyers hoped to use information from the
personnel files to show that the diocese had a pattern of covering
up sexual misconduct by its priests, said Cindy Robinson, a lawyer
for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have learned of information from people within the
community indicating that these seven priests had also committed
sexual abuses against children who were parishioners of diocesan
parishes,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reasons that we're seeking the documentation is to show a
pattern of negligence on the part of the diocese in handling these
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark R. Kravitz, a lawyer for the seven priests, however, said
there has been no claims filed against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''These individuals have never been sued by anyone, nor have
they ever had a claim filed against them by anyone for sexual
misconduct,'' Kravitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What she wants to do and what the plaintiffs want is
essentially a witch hunt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the appellate ruling allows the plaintiffs to
continue their deposition of former Bridgeport Bishop Edward Egan,
who is now archbishop of New York. Egan succeeded the late Cardinal
John O'Connor as spiritual leader of New York's 2.4 million Roman
Catholics in June.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Egan's deposition had been put on hold in January,
pending the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Kravitz said it is still up to the lower court to decide
whether the plaintiffs can question Egan about the seven priests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear by a long shot whether she can question
(Bishop) Egan about these seven priests. I think she has absolutely
no legal justification to do so, and now, finally, I'm going to be
heard on that,'' Kravitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The lower court had denied the priests' motion to intervene in
the Pcolka lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court, in a unanimous decision released
Wednesday, said the priests should be permitted to intervene for
the limited purpose of arguing motions to prevent disclosure of
their personnel files.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the priests argued that their personnel records are
protected from disclosure by the federal and state constitutions,
state law and common law.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Drohan, a spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said
the diocese is pleased by the appellate court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, we think the effort on the part of the ... law firm
to invade the privacy of individuals was nothing but a fishing
expedition,'' Drohan said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she has not decided yet whether to appeal the
ruling to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses Pcolka of sexually abusing boys in various
parishes in the Bridgeport diocese from the late 1960s through the
early 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Bill for Auto Industry Passed  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Auto industry executives who withhold
information on defective products that kill or injure consumers
could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison under legislation
that passed a House Commerce subcommittee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed unanimously 23-0, originally did not
contain criminal penalties -- a provision strongly opposed by the
auto industry, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., offered the amendment to add them, but
admitted he is not an expert at criminal law and said that the
House Judiciary Committee would review the provision.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin said the goal was not to punish executives after someone
is killed, but to use the threat of jail time to get company
officials to admit problems when they are discovered. He said if
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co. had gone to U.S.
regulators earlier with information about defects in Firestone
tires, some of the 101 deaths and more than 400 injuries being
investigated in the case might have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job is to try to prevent casualties in the first place,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's authority to collect information about possibly
defective products and expand its budget for investigations.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA is investigating Bridgestone/Firestone's Aug. 9 recall of
6.5 million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires. The agency has
received more than 2,200 complaints about tread separations,
blowouts and other problems with Firestone tires, usually on the
Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, a co-sponsor of the legislation and chairman of the
House Commerce consumer protection subcommittee that passed it,
said he amended the bill so that it would be more in line with one
sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that already cleared the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment and the bill were approved without objection. The
bill advances to the full House Commerce Committee, and its
sponsors hope it will pass before Congress adjourns next month.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal penalty provision in the House version is different
from the one in the Senate version. McCain's bill would punish
executives from a company that knowingly produced a defective
product that killed or injured a consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry lobbyists had objected to the wording, saying that
punishing for a ''defect'' is too vague. In the House version,
sponsored by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., company officials would not
be punished for producing a defect, but for withholding information
from federal regulators about a defect.
</P>
<P>
   Upton's bill also addresses another auto industry concern -- that
the threat of criminal penalties will keep officials from sharing
information with regulators -- by exempting whistleblowers from
being charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I happen to believe that the approach we took will identify
bad products before we get to serious injury or death versus
punishing someone after the horse is out of the barn,'' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   Eron Shosteck, spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, a coalition of 13 automakers, said Upton's bill was
an improvement over McCain's because it provides a clearer
distinction for when criminal penalties would apply. But he said
the Alliance still opposes criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members are concerned about legislation moving this
quickly without full consideration of its real-world
consequences,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Group says New Jersey has highest cost for apartment rent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey is tops in the nation when it
comes to the cost of renting apartments and leaders of an advocacy
group said Wednesday that makes affordable housing a crisis in the
Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those renting apartments can't afford the
payments on a three-bedroom apartment, said Peter Kasabach, an
executive board member of the Housing and Community Development
Network.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is based on federal standards that say housing is
affordable if rent is less than 30 percent of a person's income,
Kasabach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Families are working harder, longer hours, yet they continue
to fall further behind in making their housing payments,'' he said
at a Statehouse news conference.
</P>
<P>
   A person being paid the minimum wage would have to work 131
hours a week to earn enough to afford rent, Lucy Voorhoeve said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Or more than three full-time jobs,'' said Voorhoeve, the
group's associate director.
</P>
<P>
   Higher costs force people into substandard housing, Voorhoeve
said. Others face eviction or homelessness, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates cited a study by the National Low Income Housing
Coalition that said the average rent in New Jersey was $878 in
1999. That figure was up $51 from the year before, enough to move
New Jersey above Hawaii for the highest average in the country,
Kasabach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people in New Jersey are suffering from this,'' he
said. ''If you don't see that as a crisis, as a major issue, I
don't know what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adair is a 30-year-old father of two now living in a
shelter with his family in Toms River.
</P>
<P>
   Adair told reporters he earns $1,500 a month, but can't afford
to rent an apartment or house and then pay other costs, including
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''My monthly bills come out to $2,000. So what's the answer?''
Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasabach suggested more housing and tax credits for developers
to promote building.
</P>
<P>
   The working poor would also be helped by an increase in state
and federal voucher programs to use in market rentals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also need to be more aggressive to promote the state's
existing affordable housing regulations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Govt. Overpays for Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government overpays hundreds of
millions of dollars a year for drugs through the Medicare program,
congressional investigators report.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-month study by the House Commerce Committee found that for
dozens of drugs, most of which are used to treat AIDS and cancer,
drug companies report one wholesale price publicly, then charge
doctors a much lower price to encourage them to use the drug. The
federal government reimburses at a rate similar to the publicly
announced price, so doctors can make large profits -- a practice the
report acknowledged is legal.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Rep. Thomas Bliley, criticized the
Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, for not
doing more to ensure reimbursement rates are more in line with what
drug companies actually charge doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The report found Medicare is overcharged by $447 million per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley, in a letter to the agency's administrator, Nancy-Ann Min
DeParle, said the current reimbursement methods are ''so deeply
flawed that they invite rampant abuse'' and the findings have
''frightening implications for public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed reducing the amount it
reimburses physicians for drugs from 95 percent of the wholesale
price to 83 percent of the wholesale price, but the idea has
stalled in Bliley's committee.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA does not need congressional approval to reduce the
reimbursement for about 50 drugs for which the Justice Department
already has determined drug companies were charging doctors
artificially low prices. The agency plans to reduce those rates on
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA's top Medicare payment official Dr. Robert A. Berenson,
said the changes would ''protect access to care for beneficiaries
while reducing excessive drug charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley, R-Va., said the agency needs to do more to force drug
companies to change their pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legislative proposals made by the administration have been
deeply flawed, in part because they ignore the rampant price
manipulations in which certain drug manufacturers have been
engaged,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal prosecutors are investigating more than 20
drug makers for similar pricing arrangements. Its findings could
add more drugs to the list for which HCFA may set prices.

<HEADLINE> Capano seeks to overturn death penalty; cites U.S. Supreme Court decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Convicted murderer Thomas Capano has
asked the Delaware Supreme Court to throw out his death sentence on
the grounds that a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively
voids the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed this week, Capano's lawyers said the June 26
ruling by the high court leaves the decision of whether capital
punishment should be meted out in the hands of a jury, not a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Judge William Swain Lee ordered Capano to death row
after the wealthy, politically influential lawyer was convicted in
January 1999 of killing his 30-year-old mistress, Anne Marie Fahey.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Capano shot Fahey, then stuffed her body in
a cooler and dumped it in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   With neither the body or the murder weapon ever recovered,
prosecutors relied on circumstantial evidence to prove that Capano
planned to kill Fahey because she wanted to end their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the jury voted 11-1 that Fahey's murder was
premeditated by Capano. Capano's lawyers say the jury should have
decided unanimously that Capano had planned out the murder in order
for capital punishment to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court this summer, the justices
decided in a New Jersey case that only a jury may decide whether a
case contains special circumstances, such as premeditation of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Also, that jury's decision must be unanimous, according to the
papers filed by Capano's nine-member defense team.
</P>
<P>
   The question of premeditation in Capano's case was crucial
because it was the single aggravating factor that made him eligible
for capital punishment. In Capano's case, it was Lee, not the jury,
who made the decision that Capano was eligible for death by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Capano's lawyers are asking for a new penalty phase, where
Capano may be considered for life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Supreme Court is expected to hear Capano's appeal
on Oct. 24.

<HEADLINE> Famed theater organist's death doesn't signal an end of the art  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - When Lee Erwin played the theater organ in old
fashioned movie palaces, friends say his boney hands resembled two
tarantulas fighting on the keyboard but the sounds he created were
like a string of pearls massaging your ears.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Erwin say the former Alabama boy who went off to
study music in France and became famous plying his trade in
Cincinnati, then in New York City, and finally across the country,
really, truly, was that good.
</P>
<P>
   With a twinge of sadness but mostly awe and gratitude, family
and friends celebrated Erwin's life at a funeral Wednesday at a
Harlem church. He died at age 92 on Sept. 21, nearly 18 months
after a fall left him incapable of playing publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Some may worry that since Erwin was one of the last remaining
original theater organists, his death might signal an end to the
art. But due in part to people like him, the love for the theater
organ is still alive - even if most people don't know a thing about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I met Lee 20 years ago when I became interested in silent
film, which is not a field you go into,'' Ben Model told mourners
at St. Luke's Episcopal Church. Model, 37, added that Erwin prodded
him to expand his interest in silent films to playing the
instrument, saying ''There are no young organists!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the lack of knowledge about the art results because few
people these days other than devotees have heard a theater organ
accompanying silent movies.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Anderson, an orchestra conductor and film restorer, says
she doesn't approve of the label ''silent films'' because organs
almost always played throughout the show. A former music archivist
at the Library of Congress, she prefers the term ''early films.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Anderson, theater organ enthusiasts are like other
serious collectors - but more fanatic. It's not uncommon for people
to knock walls out of their homes to install an organ, or even
build a new house around the instrument. The fervor grows out of
fans' love for the instrument's peculiarity, says Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theater organ, far more than the piano, when it's played
at its best, is really capable of getting the power of an
orchestra,'' she said. ''But it also requires a lot of maintenance.
I guess though if you're prepared to take out the side of your
house to install it, you definitely are the sort who will be
prepared to keep it maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater organs are similar to church organs but typically have
fewer sound-emitting pipes. In later models, however, each pipe
could make multiple sounds. And some were equipped to create sound
effects like honking cars, train whistles, sleigh bells and police
sirens.
</P>
<P>
   But Erwin took theater organ playing in a different direction.
He believed the music should never call attention to itself and
complained when other organ players used gimmicks, as if to scream
''look at me!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Erwin told The New York Times: ''It's always a
compliment after a film when people come up and say, 'You know, I
completely forgot that you were playing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his innovations continued, whether it was
playing at Radio City, on the radio for a late-night show in
Cincinnati entitled ''Moon River,'' or on TV for the ''Arthur
Godfrey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   After many huge old theaters were knocked down around the
country, Erwin championed their past by traveling to places like
Atlanta, or Wichita, Kan., or Akron, Ohio, where he played
surviving instruments. He also helped start a silent film festival
at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York that has become
an annual event on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a marvelous sense of imagination and he had a subtle
ear that made him able to improvise anything,'' said Joseph Erwin,
who showed his own organ skills by performing a few of his older
brother's favorites during the funeral. ''He never played what was
on the page, unless it was classical. He could make pop music of
his day to be as moving as the New York Philharmonic with a great
conductor.''

<HEADLINE> Three killed in crash near Conshohocken identified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. (AP) - Two men and a woman in their early 20s
were identified through dental records Wednesday as victims in a
fiery 13-car, chain-reaction accident in the Philadelphia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   James Millard, 23, and Nicholas Litterio, 22, both of East
Stroudsburg, died when their pickup truck was hit from behind by a
tractor-trailer while traveling early Monday on Interstate 76. The
impact pushed their vehicle into a Hyundai driven by Tiffany
Davies, 20, of Mt. Laurel, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Several others were injured, one critically, in the early
morning accident that shut down the highway used heavily by
commuters traveling to and from Philadelphia, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   A tractor-trailer and about 10 more vehicles were involved in
the accident in the westbound lanes of the highway at about 12:30
a.m. Monday near the Conshohocken exit in Montgomery County, police
said. The area of the highway is known as the Conshohocken curve
and is a frequent spot for traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Several vehicles and the cab of the tractor trailer caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the scene indicated the accident may have happened
after traffic slowed from an earlier accident, which happened just
after midnight. Debris was spread over about 100 yards of the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   State police in Philadelphia identified the tractor-trailer
driver as Walter Seifert, 64, of Groton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Seifert was hauling 18,000 pounds of soy products.
Montgomery County District Attorney said Tuesday that Seifert was
cooperating with investigators. He told them he did not have time
to stop when he saw the traffic jam.

<HEADLINE> NiMo, National Grid face Assembly leaders over proposed NiMo acquisition </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - It is too early to say how National Grid
Group's proposed purchase of Niagara Mohawk would affect the rates
of NiMo customers, officials of the power companies told Assembly
leaders examining the planned merger Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after National Grid announced the $3 billion cash
and stock deal, the British firm is just beginning to assess
consumer impact, said Lawrence Reilly, director of National Grid
USA.
</P>
<P>
   While National Grid expects to save about $90 million a year
through consolidation and improved efficiency, it is unknown
whether the savings will translate into lower rates for customers,
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   At the first in a series of planned public hearings, Reilly and
Niagara Mohawk's chief financial officer, William Edwards, said the
merger would strengthen Niagara Mohawk, allowing it to stabilize
energy delivery prices and improve customer service. Niagara Mohawk
provides electricity to 1.55 million New York customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this agreement offers benefits and opportunities for
our customers, our shareholders, our employees and all other
stakeholders,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Sheldon Silver, presiding over the hearing, said
ratepayers have too often been forgotten in agreements reached
between utilities and the state's Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when businesses and families are dealing with rising
oil, gas and natural gas prices, it is time to put the customer
first,'' the Manhattan Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Chairman Paul Tonko said the proposed merger, the first
of its kind in New York state, ''requires an unprecedented level of
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only should its effects on shareholders and ratepayers be
assessed, Tonko said, but also its potential impact on the economy
of upstate New York and Niagara Mohawks' work force.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid said it anticipates trimming 500 to 750 positions
over a four-year period through attrition and voluntary programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Niagara Mohawk would merge with another
electric system that National Grid owns and operates in three New
England states. The resulting company would be the ninth largest
utility in the country, with more than 3.3 million customers over
29,000 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk would continue operating under its present name
and retain its operating headquarters in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid USA expects that within four years, it will save
as much as $90 million annually through consolidation and improved
efficiency across its New England and New York operations.
</P>
<P>
   Future hearings will focus on the effects of the proposed merger
on workers, the upstate economy, change-in-control issues, local
community impacts and the role of regulators.

<HEADLINE> Accused money launderer asks court to drop racketeering charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A Colombian accused of being one of the
''most significant money launderers in the world'' is seeking to
have racketeering charges against him dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Stroh claim the statute of limitations on the
charges, which date back to the 1980s, has expired. In U.S.
District Court Tuesday, they urged Senior U.S. District Judge Alan
H. Nevas to dismiss the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Bridgeport indicted Stroh and two of his
Panamanian corporations in July 1996. They are charged with
violation the federal Racketeer Influenced Organizations Act by
running a money-laundering operation and structuring financial
transactions to avoid federal reporting rules for the Cali drug
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment remained sealed until Stroh's arrest in Miami on
Feb. 14, 2000. It identifies 20 banks between Stamford and
Bridgeport where $271,000 was exchanged in 64 transactions between
July 14 and July 21, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Appleton argued that in 1987
alone Jose E. Stroh's operations laundered $129 million for the
Cali drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not low-level,'' Appleton said. ''This is one of the
most significant money launderers in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Slotnick of New York, a lawyer for Stroh, told the judge
his client withdrew from the conspiracy and returned to Israel in
1988. Slotnick said he has a passport, witnesses and government
documents to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said Slotnick's request was unprecedented.
''You've cited no cases in which a trial judge has dismissed an
indictment under these circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge reserved decision on Slotnick's request and gave him
until Monday to submit additional documentation.

<HEADLINE> Wheel guards lacking at garage where car crashed through wall  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - A parking deck where four New York
nurses were killed when their car crashed through a wall lacked
concrete wheel guards designed to prevent vehicles from hitting the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether the Sandcastle Resort Hotel's garage
had to have such wheel guards under the national building code in
force when it was built. City officials confirmed the absence of
wheel guards but said Wednesday they had not yet determined whether
any building codes were violated.
</P>
<P>
   The four women died Sunday when their car broke through a
3-foot-tall wall and plunged 41 feet, landing on a beach access
path.
</P>
<P>
   Building Officials and Code Administrators International, based
in Country Club Hills, Ill., drafts and updates construction codes
that many states have adopted. The codes have the force of law in
Virginia. The garage was built in 1985, under 1981 code rules.
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 BOCA code requires parking garages with open sides to
have a parapet wall or guardrail to prevent vehicles from going off
the side, said Ken Schoonover, BOCA's vice president of codes and
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The code also requires a wheel guard at least six inches high to
prevent vehicles from striking the wall or guardrail, Schoonover
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the wall is strong enough to handle the impact of a
vehicle, such wheel stops are not needed and the building would
comply with the intent of the code, Schoonover said.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the garage wall and how it was built need to be
determined, Schoonover said. ''You can't draw a firm conclusion
just based on the fact that it was cinder block,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There also may be questions as to whether the rooftop originally
was intended for parking and whether wheel stops were there and
were removed at some point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Scott, the city's planning director, added, ''We want
to have a discussion with code officials so we get to the bottom of
this. This should not be a rush to judgment here. We need to get
the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel manager Varshid Vachhani did not return a telephone call
seeking comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   City real estate records show that John W. Vakos Sr., who owned
the hotel when the garage was added, sold the hotel to Sandcastle
Resorts L.L.C. for $7.5 million last year. A telephone number for
Vakos could not be found Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Joan Ellen Walsh, 56; Mary Ann Going, 60; Kathleen M.
Mollick-Kelly, 63; and Mary Ann Dono, 60, died upon impact. They
had been vacationing from their jobs at St. Vincent's hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the car was moving no faster than 10 mph when it
struck the wall, which had no reinforcement and crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash has not been determined, but police have
ruled out mechanical failure and alcohol as factors. Some witnesses
said it appeared that the driver failed to brake in time or stepped
on the accelerator instead of the brake.

<HEADLINE> Cops arrest alleged scalper at front of Yankee ticket line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man who won a lottery to be the first person
in line for Yankee playoff tickets struck out Wednesday when cops
claimed he was a scalper.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Napoleon, 42, was arrested shortly after noon at Yankee
Stadium - just before he was about to buy tickets for next week's
playoffs, said police spokesman Alan Krawitz.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon was among scores of fans who were given numbered
bracelets as part of a lottery to determine spots in line. After
his number was called first, news photographers snapped pictures of
the lucky winner.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, two police officers recognized Napoleon as a
suspect wanted for scalping, and he was quickly led away, Krawitz
said.

<HEADLINE> Film actors rally for striking colleagues  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A bevy of faces famous from movies and
television gathered Wednesday to lend support to some of their
less-celebrated colleagues, commercial actors who are striking
against the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this most visible of industries, in this most visible of
unions, they are the people who are overlooked,'' Richard Dreyfuss
said at a rally sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts, Mia Farrow, Rosie O'Donnell, Susan Sarandon, Tim
Robbins and Billy Baldwin were among the celebrities who came out
to support the strikers, who they emphasized were not famous
millionaires but poorly paid workers trying to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This industry can afford an honest wage,'' Dreyfuss said.
''They can afford a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders continued meeting with advertising industry
representatives in an effort to end a strike that is nearly five
months old, the longest in Hollywood history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The little guy is not going to roll over for corporate
America,'' Sarandon said, drawing loud cheers from union members.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Shepard, a negotiator for the advertisers, did not
immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and AFTRA want actors to be get ''pay-for-play'' residuals
for ads on cable television, as they are now paid for network
spots, and also want jurisdiction over commercials shot for the
Internet. Advertisers are seeking to pay actors a flat fee for all
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Actors say that would make it nearly impossible for them to make
a living.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question will ultimately become whether this will be able
to be a profession or a hobby,'' said union member Russell Horton,
who until the strike started did commercial voice-overs.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is the first major Hollywood walkout in 12 years. It
affects only radio and TV commercials, not movies or television
series.

<HEADLINE> Verizon service complaints up nearly ninefold from 1995-99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Complaints about Verizon Communications
repair and installation service in New Jersey rose nearly ninefold
in five years, but still remain a tiny fraction of its 4 million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Public Utilities received 1,995 complaints
about service in 1999, compared to 205 in 1995. Some 2,365
complaints have been recorded so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995-99, the number of Verizon lines rose 25 percent, to
6.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, formed in June by the merge of Bell Atlantic Corp. and
GTE Corp., controls 99 percent of local phone service for homes in
New Jersey. Verizon provides telephone service to some 95 million
U.S. homes in 30 states and to an additional 25 million wireless
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Service complaints involve phone repair, delayed or improper
installation, tree trimming and missed appointments, BPU
spokeswoman Angela Adekola said. They do not involve billing.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were reported Wednesday in The Record of Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon-New Jersey president Dennis Bone told The Associated
Press on Wednesday he was uncertain why the increase in complaints
outpaced the growth of the state network, but believes part of it
is related to the changing role of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customers use their telephone service, and rely on it today,
far, far differently than they did in the past,'' he said, noting
that few people were connected to the Internet in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, many students do research from home computers, and
if their line is out even a two-day wait makes it difficult to meet
deadlines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that it explains the phenomena. I know it
explains a little bit of it,'' Bone said.
</P>
<P>
   Bone said that 98 percent of the 200,000 service orders the
company gets a month in the state are processed on time.
</P>
<P>
   Service orders have increased over the past five years, Bone
said, but he could not immediately say by how much.
</P>
<P>
   ''We care about individual customers. But we run a huge and
complex organization, and things happen: a truck breaks down,
someone calls in sick, and you have to reschedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is seeking permission from the BPU to raise its basic
telephone rates. Bone said the company's proposal would not provide
it with additional revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The BPU has scheduled a third public hearing to hear comments on
the proposal, 1 p.m. Oct. 18 in the Marlboro Township
Administration building.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens and consumer advocates complained at hearings
over the past week in Newark and Trenton that the two hearings were
not publicized enough and, for senior citizens, held too late in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has proposed raising its basic telephone rate from $8.19
a month to as much as $17.50 a month. The new price would include
three premium services like call waiting and caller ID.

<HEADLINE> Joyce becomes a hurricane as Isaac rebuilds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - Joyce, the 10th named Atlantic storm of the season,
developed into a hurricane Wednesday while Hurricane Isaac rebuilt
its strength after weakening for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Both storms were far out at sea and posed no immediate threat to
land.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was a chance that Joyce, which formed as a
tropical storm Monday off West Africa, could reach the northeastern
Caribbean islands in five to six days, said James Franklin, a
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a possibility that it could turn sharply enough
to miss the islands altogether,'' Franklin added.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce's top sustained wind reached 85 mph Wednesday - the
threshold for a hurricane is 74 mph - and it was likely to continue
strengthening into Thursday as it moves across warm ocean water,
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, Joyce was about 1,270 miles east of the
Windward Islands and moving west at about 14 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac, about 925 miles northwest of Joyce, reached top sustained
winds of 110 mph Wednesday. It had top wind of 120 mph on Saturday
but weakened as other weather systems affected it. Satellite
photographs Wednesday showed Isaac had developed a new eye wall,
signaling a new intensification stage, Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac was about 1,125 miles southeast of Bermuda on Wednesday
evening and moving northwest at about 16 mph. Forecasters expect it
to turn northward in a few days, and Franklin said it should pass
well east of Bermuda.

<HEADLINE> Parents of abducted boy sue city, three agencies for $75 million  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The parents of a 4-year-old boy taken last year
from a West Side playground by a registered sex offender have filed
a $75 million lawsuit against the city for giving the suspect a
''workfare'' assignment there.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed Tuesday, Steven Johnson and Michelle
Montes accuse the city and three of its agencies of ''gross
negligence'' for assigning Tony Sanchez to the Chelsea Park
playground, which is frequented by children.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Ramseur, lawyer for Johnson and Montes, said the
workfare assignment ''was the same as putting the king cobra of
perverts in the hen house. The city couldn't have been more
negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez told police after his arrest for abducting the boy that
he is a registered sex offender, court papers say. He also said he
was a volunteer worker at the park where he formerly had been
assigned a maintenance job as part of the requirements for
receiving welfare benefits, court papers say. The playground is on
10th Avenue between 27th and 28th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Papers filed in Manhattan's State Supreme Court say Sanchez took
the boy from the park around 3:30 p.m. on Oct. 23, 1999, and
brought him to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, 40, left the boy, apparently unmolested, with a token
clerk at a subway station the next day, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Sanchez on Oct. 24 after witnesses said they had
seen him with the boy on a Bronx-bound train the previous
afternoon. He was charged with second-degree kidnapping and
endangering a child's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lawson, a Parks Department spokesman, said Sanchez was a
workfare employee at several sites, including Chelsea Park, January
1995 to October 1997. Lawson said he does not know why Sanchez'
workfare stint ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not registered with our volunteers,'' Lawson said. ''If
he was working there, it was not under the direction of out
volunteer program. We have a comprehensive data base of volunteers,
and he's not in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Goodman of the city's Law Department said she was unaware
of the lawsuit, but added, ''If he was not working for the city at
the time of the alleged abduction, then I don't believe the city
has any liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Glenn Abolafia said Sanchez was found fit for
trial following a psychiatric exam ordered by a judge after his
arrest. Sanchez is due to appear before Justice Bonnie Wittner on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez completed a five-year probation period late last year
after pleading guilty to sex abuse in a 1994 Bronx incident
involving a 7-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Court records also show that in April 1999, Sanchez was charged
with endangering the welfare of a child after he allegedly offered
a 12-year-old girl $10 to give him a massage. He is due in court
Oct. 19 on that case.

<HEADLINE> Physician pleads guilty to hindering prosecution of colleague  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan physician pleaded guilty Wednesday
to hindering the prosecution of a colleague and countryman who was
indicted on charges of drugging and sodomizing two female Swedish
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Turker Sengul, 28, a St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
anesthesiology resident, admitted that he obstructed the
investigation to help Dr. Selim Can Alkoc, 29, flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman, scolding Sengul for
his reluctance to admit his crimes, promised him a sentence of one
to three years. She scheduled sentencing for Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Alkoc, a psychiatry resident at St. Luke's-Roosevelt, met the
two 21-year-old women in Canada and invited them to his West 59th
Street apartment, prosecutors say. While the women were there on
May 23, Alkoc allegedly drugged, raped and sodomized them.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, a Manhattan grand jury indicted Alkoc on charges of
rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and assault. Prosecutors say the
defendant fled to his native Turkey before he could be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Sengul was accused of going to Alkoc's apartment after he was
indicted and removing several videotapes of the sexual encounters,
which were hidden under a bed and in a vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity
said after the indictments were announced that the tapes show Alkoc
having sex with many different women who appeared to be drugged.
</P>
<P>
   Sengul, who lived in the same hospital-subsidized building as
Alkoc, collected his colleague's mail, got clothing from his
apartment and even carried his pager to mislead police, prosecutors
have said.
</P>
<P>
   Alkoc's lawyer, Brian Perskin, said his client did not flee. He
said Alkoc hadn't been charged two weeks after the Swedish women
complained to police, so he moved back to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Perskin said he believes extraditing Alkoc may be impossible
because he is a Turkish national.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Civil rights trial attracts the attention of federal prosecutors  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A police officer who says she was harassed
because she was a lesbian testified Wednesday at a trial being
watched by federal prosecutors for violations of the New York
Police Department's pledge to properly investigate sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Elizabeth Bryant told a jury in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan that she was continually harassed by supervisors and
peers after she bonded with her ''life partner'' in a Central Park
ceremony three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that other police officers in her South Bronx
precinct mocked her repeatedly after learning of the June 24, 1997
ceremony, and supervisors failed to investigate and stop the
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Among items shown to the jury was a photograph Bryant said she
found posted in the station house after officers learned she was a
lesbian. The picture featured the body of a male body builder with
Bryant's head superimposed above it and male genitalia drawn below.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was feeling humiliated,'' she said of seeing the picture.
''I wanted to rip it down. I felt embarrassed, very alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with examples of derogatory remarks allegedly made by
fellow officers, Bryant was trying to show through her $5 million
lawsuit that the police department has violated its pledge to
eradicate harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The department in 1998 signed an agreement with the federal
government promising to greatly expand its Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity, revise its policy on the display of
sexually explicit materials, and improve investigations into sexual
harassment complaints.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said at the time that the deal would
help ensure that police officers were free ''to do their jobs
without fear of sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, White's spokesman, on Wednesday would only say
that White's office was watching the trial.
</P>
<P>
   During her day of testimony before Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, Bryant
described numerous incidents in which she said her co-workers and
bosses made her feel unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was told that if she ever put out a radio call
requesting emergency assistance, which summons scores of officers,
''nobody's going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, she said, officers made derogatory references to her
sexual orientation. An officer once told her to ''mind your own
lesbian business,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   On cross examination, city attorney Patricia Miller portrayed
Bryant as a habitual liar and questioned whether much of what she
had described had ever occurred.
</P>
<P>
   She forced the officer to tell how she had once married a man
from England so that both of them could more easily participate in
theater in each other's countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what it was,'' Bryant said. ''It's what we both wanted -
to work on opposite stages. I wasn't married in my mind.''

<HEADLINE> Nobel Panel Picks Peace Prize Winner  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A half-dozen people in Norway now know who
will win this year's Nobel Peace Prize, to be awarded in about two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, the secretive members of the awards committee
didn't give a hint following Wednesday's final meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our last regular meeting, and have reached a decision
that will be announced on Oct. 13,'' said Geir Lundestad, a
non-voting secretary who attends the five-member awards committee's
meetings. ''I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee never even says who was nominated for the coveted
prize, only the number of candidates -- a record 150 this year, with
115 individuals and 35 organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pretty open,'' said Lundestad. ''We said that we had
our last meeting and picked a winner, and then expect to keep that
to ourselves for more than two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they succeed, despite the efforts of avidly curious
Nobel-watchers, mainly the news media, to guess the name of the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always watch the speculation with interest,'' said
Lundestad.
</P>
<P>
   This year's prize includes a $968,000 cash award, plus a medal
and a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The committee trims the list and adds its own nominations at its
first meeting of each year. Some candidates become publicly known
when those making the nominations announce their favorites.
</P>
<P>
   This year that includes President Clinton and former President
Carter for wide-ranging peace efforts, as well as former U.S. Sen.
George Mitchell for his efforts to resolve conflict in northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported nominees are former Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for
their Balkan peace efforts; South Korean President Kim Dae-jung for
promoting good relations in Asia; and such organizations as the
Salvation Army, Human Rights Watch and various church groups.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual nomination was for a town, northern Albania's Kukes,
for accepting 150,000 refugees during the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the committee has used the prize to encourage
peace processes. In 1998, the prize went to Protestant David
Trimble and Catholic David Hume to encourage the Northern Ireland
peace talks. In 1994, the prize went to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres to help
nurture the Middle East Peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The prize also can recognize years of effort. Last year, the
award went to the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Prizes always are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary
of the death of Alfred Nobel. The Swedish industrialist endowed
prizes for medicine or physiology, physics, chemistry, literature
and peace in his 1896 will.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes were first awarded in 1901. The peace prize,
traditionally the last to be announced, is presented in Oslo, and
the others in Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the prize for medicine or physiology will be
announced Oct. 9; for physics and chemistry, Oct. 10; for
economics, established and endowed by the Swedish national bank in
1968 and first awarded in 1969, Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The date for the literature prize winner to be announced has not
been publicly disclosed. If, like last year, it's the Thursday
before the other prizes, that would be Oct. 5.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Mayor Backs Reagan Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mayor of the nation's capital is cool to
the idea -- backed by Republicans in Congress -- of building a
monument to Ronald Reagan on the National Mall, which he called
crowded enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony A. Williams said Wednesday that what he called the
nation's most hallowed real estate should be preserved to honor
events of defining significance in the nation's history and people
of equal significance to their eras. Without saying so, he made it
clear he did not put Reagan in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Monuments to Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt honor
great personalities of their respective centuries, he said, adding
that a monument to the nation's contributions to victory in the
Second World War is also worthy. The Mall site of a World War II
monument is to be dedicated by President Clinton in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''World War II, like the Civil War, is a defining moment,''
Williams said in an interview with Associated Press reporters and
editors.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Washington, denounced by Richard Nixon in the 1970s
as the nation's ''crime capital,'' is bouncing back, Williams said,
with ''zillions of people'' moving in. The long lines at the
Department of Motor Vehicles are testament not to the city's
inefficiency but to the return of people from the suburbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the elected Democratic mayor of the city's 528,000 residents,
Williams holds a seat on the 12-member National Capital Planning
Commission. He also appoints two other members of that board. The
panel is one of three federal agencies that review designs and
proposals for new memorials in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the panels banned any new memorials on the
National Mall and restricted adjacent areas to ''commemorative
works of pre-eminent historic and national significance.'' All
three panels recently rejected the idea of building a Reagan
memorial on the Mall, citing a requirement that the honoree be
deceased for at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican-controlled House is moving toward overriding
the panels with a bill taking the first step toward locating a
Reagan monument on the Mall between the Capitol and the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Since Reagan, 89, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, left
office in 1989, Washington's airport and a new federal building in
the district have been named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   District residents recently have criticized the increasingly
crowded vistas on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, Congress has authorized 21 new memorials,
seven of which were built on or near the Mall. A monument to Martin
Luther King Jr. awaits construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The King Memorial, alongside of the FDR Memorial, seems like a
great location,'' said Williams, adding that he would also like to
see an African-American History Museum located near the site.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said the city is bouncing back from years of
political dominance by former Mayor Marion Barry, whom he succeeded
nearly two years ago. But Williams also said Barry, who was
returned to office in 1994 despite a drug conviction, remains a
political force, especially among younger city residents. Williams
called Barry ''very, very bright'' and ''very, very gifted
politically'' but a tragic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ''He still has a following,'' said Williams, who has expanded
Barry's youth leadership program while trying to restore youth job
and recreation programs and improve the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also touted his work to boost business development, new
housing and decentralized government in a neglected corner of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of my term there will be two new government
centers'' east of the Anacostia River, he said, noting that an
estimated $500 million in new development -- including two new
supermarkets -- is occurring in that area that has been economically
depressed since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is also pushing the idea of a partnership between
Washington and its neighbor Baltimore, 40 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Washington's best opportunities for growth could
be in joint promotion of the Baltimore-Washington area as a single
entity. He noted that the two are linked by contiguous suburbs; if
they were placed in an area the size of Los Angeles, where he grew
up, they would be neighborhoods, he said.

<HEADLINE> State could profit from high energy costs  </HEADLINE>
By RIK STEVENS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - While consumers keep a wary eye on heating
expenses this winter, the state stands to collect a windfall of $30
million due to high energy costs, according to critics of a
much-maligned state tax.
</P>
<P>
   A repeal of the gross receipts tax on energy and the 4 percent
state sales tax on electricity and gas distribution would help ease
the minds of homeowners and small businesses who head into winter
uncertain of how much they'll pay to stay warm, Assembly
Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   Faso said the average homeowner could save $100 this heating
season, about two-thirds of the anticipated cost increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''By cutting these energy taxes now, we'll be protecting both
jobs and homeowners and preventing a state tax windfall,'' Assembly
Minority Leader John J. Faso said.
</P>
<P>
   The state anticipated $650 million in revenues from the taxes
this fiscal year. A $30 million windfall represents a 4.7 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Energy Information Administration estimates someone
using 680 gallons of heating oil - assuming moderate temperatures -
will spend $900 this season, about $140 more than last.
</P>
<P>
   ''These skyrocketing costs will hurt upstate consumers and
businesses and New York state has a responsibility to help keep the
costs as low as we can, not profit from the increase,'' said
Republican Assemblyman James Tedisco of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   The gross receipts tax is among the state's most debated levies,
opposed by those who say it scares away businesses and hurts
consumers. Under the law that created it, utilities are not allowed
to show on bills how much the tax costs rate payers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000-01 budget, the state eliminated the gross receipts
tax on energy for manufacturers and cut the tax on energy for
non-manufacturing commercial customers by 25 percent each year
until its elimination on Jan. 1, 2005. It also reduced the tax for
residential electric rate payers by $75 million immediately and $50
million to be phased in over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats called the repeal of the tax a small step in
the right direction and they joined with a public advocacy group in
the call for comprehensive energy reform in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact remains that the $3 (per $100 billed) we're talking
about is a drop in the bucket compared with what the consumer is
going to begin to face,'' Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said
Wednesday in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has called for an energy summit to focus on long-term
solutions to high prices and stopgap measures like putting extra
money into state programs that help low-income families pay heating
bills and improving the energy-efficiency of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Paul Tonko, chairman of the Assembly Energy
Committee, said Gov. George E. Pataki was responsible for imposing
a tax on the delivery of natural gas, something Assembly Democrats
fought. Tonko said that in budget negotiations there was only so
much room for tax cuts and energy didn't make the final threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   There is no gross receipts tax or state sales tax on home
heating oil and no sales tax on natural gas for residential
consumers, Tonko said, adding that the Republican plan would be a
short-term, punchless solution.
</P>
<P>
   Tonko said failing to address the spectrum of energy needs and
problems could leave the state vulnerable to a ''full-blow energy
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we need a comprehensive strategy that puts together
a blueprint that will allow for drastic reductions in the bills
that energy consumers pay,'' the Amsterdam Democrat said. ''Not
just a standalone tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The repeal ''should only be done as part of a comprehensive plan
that must include energy-efficiency and conservation efforts,''
agreed Jason K. Babbie, environmental policy analyst for the New
York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   A repeal of the tax is supported by utilities and the New York
State Business Council, Albany chief corporate lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would be a timely occasion,'' said Nicholas Lyman,
spokesman for Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. ''Everybody knows home
heating costs are going to be up significantly this year and as the
price of the product goes up, the tax levy goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   The utility is warning its customers who heat with natural gas
to expect bills about 20 percent higher this winter than last
winter due to energy price spikes.

   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) - A condemned man who won an
unprecedented reprieve from Gov. George W. Bush for DNA tests that
only confirmed his guilt was executed Wednesday for killing his
12-year-old stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky McGinn, 43, received a lethal injection for raping
Stephanie Flanary and bludgeoning her with an ax. He insisted
evidence was planted or tampered with, but DNA tests completed in
August again linked McGinn to the 1993 crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want nobody to be mad at nobody,'' McGinn said moments
before his death. ''I don't want nobody to be bitter. Keep clean
hearts and I will see y'all on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   The McGinn case drew attention because of the June 1 reprieve
granted by Bush, the Republican presidential candidate who has been
criticized for allowing executions to continue in his home state
while he campaigns as a ''compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time he had used his authority as Texas
governor to issue a 30-day reprieve to a condemned killer.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, when Texas resumed capital punishment, 232 people
have been executed. Texas is on pace to execute 40 people this
year, which would break the record of 37 executed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said no innocent person has been put to death in Texas
during his five-plus years in office.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Nominees Get OK  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
approved the appointments Wednesday of seven ambassadors whose
nominations had been held up because of they had amassed scores of
what one senator described as minor violations of security rules.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department acknowledged that the career foreign
service officers had committed some 100 infractions of security
rules such as leaving a document unattended in a secured area.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said the behavior was ''sloppy'' but
that the infractions ''were minor.'' He compared holding up the
nominations to someone taking away a person's drivers license
because of some parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations must still go before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little disappointed,'' said Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.,
after the committee action. Grams had put a hold on the nominations
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   He said the delay focused on the security issue and ''will send
a clear signal'' to the State Department which has had a number of
embarrassing incidents involving security problems including the
disappearance last winter of a laptop computer containing
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was somebody with bad security habits at the State
Department, I wouldn't take any comfort from this,'' said committee
spokesman Marc Thiessen. He said committee members have made clear
security will be a key issue in evaluating future foreign service
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Grams said he dropped his hold on the nominations after the
State Department agreed to tighten its disciplinary procedures
involving security infraction.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's action came only days after the revelation that
Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, had been stripped of
his security clearance because he allegedly mishandled classified
work-related material, taking some home and working on an
unclassified laptop computer while traveling. State Department
officials have said there was no indication any intelligence
information was compromised by Indyk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the State Department has asked that Senate
consideration of the nomination of Ronald Neuman as ambassador to
Bahrain be temporarily put on hold. Neuman, Indyk's former deputy
in the department's Near East Bureau, has been suspended from his
job without pay in connection with an inquiry into his handling of
classified materials.
</P>
<P>
   The department has acknowledged that five other employees have
been suspended this year for security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees approved Wednesday were listed on the committee agenda
as Brian Dean Curran of Florida for ambassador to Haiti, Rust
Macpherson Deming of Maryland to Tunisia, Howard Franklin Jeter of
South Carolina to Nigeria, Ronald D. Godard of Texas to Guyana,
Douglas Alan Hartwick of Washington to Laos, Lawrence George Rossin
of California to Croatia and Michael J. Senko of Washington to
Marshall Islands and Kiribati.

Bush Ahead in L.A. Times Poll
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Los Angeles Times poll gives Republican George W.
Bush a 48-42 percent lead over Democrat AL Gore in the presidential race. With
Bush and Gore are about even in other national polls, both Republicans and
Democrats said today they feel the race is very close, maybe the closest since
1960. Bush is said to have reclaimed momentum, attracting women and senior
citizens and benefiting from concerns about Gore's truthfulness. After several
weeks when the campaign appeared to be moving in the Democrat's direction,
evidence pointed to a Bush comeback fueled largely by his renewed appeal to
female ''swing voters'' and seniors.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Convoy Bombed in Gaza  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NETZARIM JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Two roadside bombs exploded
next to a convoy of Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip Wednesday, a
settlement leader said. Channel 2 television reported two soldiers
were wounded, one seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy was accompanied by Israeli military vehicles and
heading for the isolated settlement of Netzarim, south of Gaza
City, said Netzarim spokesman Shlomo Kostiner.
</P>
<P>
   Netzarim and the road leading to it through the
Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip have been constant flashpoints
with assailants attacking the vehicles with firebombs and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Kostiner said the convoy was making a routine trip when two
bombs exploded nearby and the vehicles were fired on. Israel
television's Channel 2 said two soldiers were injured, one
seriously, suffering from a head injury. The Israeli military
refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomit Ziv, a settler at Netzarim, said one settler was
slightly injured in the attack. She told The Associated Press that
her husband was planning to take the next convoy home.
</P>
<P>
   Armed convoys leave every 40 minutes to and from Netzarim, where
60 Israeli families live in the settlement atop a sandy hill. The
settlers are banned from entering or leaving the settlement without
a military escort.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, the Israeli military closed off the area. The
road is patrolled by Israeli forces, while Palestinian police
control nearby populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian security official complained that the Israeli
military kept Palestinian police away from the scene, preventing a
joint investigation in violation of agreements. The official, who
insisted on anonymity, said a protest would be filed with the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak denounced the attack, Israel radio
said. Barak demanded that the Palestinian Authority take steps to
arrest those responsible and prevent such incidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians demand that all Israeli settlements be removed from
Gaza. Most of them are along the Mediterranean coast, but several,
like Netzarim, are isolated and surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory. Israel controls about one-third
of the territory, where about 6,500 settlers live. More than one
million Palestinians live in Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Promises To Help Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman met Wednesday with senior
citizens so strapped by the cost of prescription drugs that they
boarded buses for Canada to buy their medication. He called the
situation ''an embarrassment'' and said Al Gore's Medicare plan
would help.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore endorsed his Democratic vice presidential
running mate's controversial decision to stick with his
simultaneous Connecticut campaign for re-election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree with his view on that,'' Gore told reporters as he
traveled to Washington from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has argued that to quit now would leave a handful of
party leaders to choose an alternative Democratic candidate because
there's no time for a primary before Nov. 7. Gore agreed: ''I think
if you have just 20, 30 people making the decision then it's not
democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman is elected vice president, Connecticut's Republican
governor, John G. Rowland, gets to appoint a placeholder until a
special election can be held.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people ought to have a chance to fill it and the best
thing would be to set a special election early, but that will be
for the people of that state to determine,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   At Lieberman's Milwaukee campaign stop, George McKinney, 70,
said he takes high blood pressure and prostate medicine and his
wife needs heart medicine. Together, they pay $500 per month in the
United States for their drugs but saved 63 percent in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a little ashamed sometimes,'' McKinney said. ''We're
the richest country in the world. Why do we have to go all the way
to Canada?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman assured McKinney and five other seniors participating
in a forum at the Wilson Park Senior Center that, if he and Gore
are elected, help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is one of the great areas of unmet human need in
this country,'' Lieberman said. ''It's an embarrassment, isn't it?
It's an embarrassment, and it makes me angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' competing Medicare plans have become a focus of
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman propose adding a $253 billion prescription
drug plan to Medicare to give free complete coverage to the elderly
poor and a cost-sharing benefit to others. It would cover half the
cost of drugs up to a $5,000 annual limit and offers a catastrophic
benefit that caps a person's annual costs at $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The $198 billion Medicare plan of Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney would let the
states administer a program covering the full prescription drug
costs of the elderly poor and subsidizing a choice of drug plans
for other Medicare beneficiaries. The Bush plan also has a
catastrophic benefit that caps drug costs at $6,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   After the forum, Lieberman was attending a fund-raiser expected
to raise $250,000 for Wisconsin Democrats.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Alex Ramos is a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the blighted South Bronx, he escaped via the boxing
ring. A four-time Golden Gloves winner, the middleweight contender
swapped jabs with Michael Nunn and jibes with Howard Cosell. When
he wound up in jail after becoming an alcoholic and drug addict,
Alex Ramos fought on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will die a boxer,'' he once vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, his biggest fight seemed won. A newly sober
Ramos had discovered his life's purpose by starting a foundation to
aid ex-fighters. Despair gave way to delight - until Ramos took a
sucker punch from his past.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter was blindsided by Alberto Lugo.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo, a childhood neighbor of Ramos, receded into the South
Bronx scenery as the fighter exploded out of it. When Ramos won a
big fight, Lugo was inevitably among the triumphant crowd that
filled Willis Avenue to greet its conquering hero.
</P>
<P>
   He was a hanger-on, a wannabe who longed for a taste of the
boxer's high life: the attention, the money, the women.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't make it happen, he simply made it up.
</P>
<P>
   Across nearly two decades, in bars and casinos and parties, Lugo
impersonated Alex Ramos. Like a fighter donning his trunks and
robe, he slipped easily into the skin of his old acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ''My name is Alex Ramos,'' Lugo said, over and over, parlaying
his performance into fight tickets, hotel rooms and cash.
</P>
<P>
   When Lugo was arrested for a 1983 rape, he used Ramos' name. He
did his prison time under Ramos' name. When he was released four
years ago, he became Alex Ramos again.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, when Lugo was arrested for drugging and
sexually assaulting women, he informed the cops they had found
their man: Yes, he was Alex Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I boxed for a while,'' he boasted to a Manhattan prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The real Alex Ramos, reborn and living in California, was
unaware of his East Coast doppleganger's return. When he finally
heard, the retired middleweight knew there was one more battle to
wage - the fight to reclaim his name.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramos was born in January 1961, two months after the Lugos
welcomed their son, Alberto. When the Ramos family moved from
Manhattan to the South Bronx, the two families became neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Their sons crossed paths on the playground behind P.S. 40, where
Alex's mother taught and the local kids hung out.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was not one of my boys,'' Ramos says now of Lugo. ''I've
said hello to him, even shaken his hand. But he was never a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramos was the son of a fighter. At age 11, the 90-pound kid
followed his old man into the ring, punching his way to four local
Golden Gloves titles and a spot on the national amateur boxing
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time Howard Cosell did my fights,'' he recalls proudly,
''I won by first-round knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos' shot at the 1980 U.S. Olympic team was lost in America's
boycott of the Moscow Games. Undaunted, the 19-year-old Ramos
turned pro in late 1980, knocking out his first two opponents
within 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had the potential to go far,'' remembers Hall of Fame
fighter Jose Torres, the ex-light-heavyweight champ. ''He was a
good puncher - oh, yeah. He had the physical ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood followed Ramos intently. A sign on a local
candy shop proudly proclaimed, ''Ramos - The East 136th Street
Champ.'' His loose-knit South Bronx fan club included Lugo, dubbed
''Spooky'' for the vacant look that sometimes crossed his face.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1981, Ramos' record stood at 12-0 with 7 knockouts.
An August 1982 eighth-round KO loss put a crimp in his title shot
plans, but an undeterred Ramos moved to Scottsdale, Ariz., and
began working with Sugar Ray Leonard's trainer, Janks Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in New York, Alberto Lugo was discovering that just
five words - ''My name is Alex Ramos'' - could catapult him from
obscurity to instant celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to impersonate someone, you're going to pick
something with glamour,'' says Richard Lapchick, head of the Center
for the Study of Sports in America. ''Athletes, with the amount of
money they command and the star power - perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, a variety of athletes were victimized by
impersonators: football stars Lawrence Taylor and Charles Mann,
basketball's Dee Brown, former boxing champion Freddy ''Red''
Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a huge segment of American men who would have loved to
be professional athletes,'' Lapchick says of the impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Lugo was among them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, as Ramos did roadwork in Arizona, Lugo was on the prowl
in Manhattan. He was charming, articulate, charismatic. He was, as
he told everyone, Alex Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, the phone in Scottsdale rang. A Manhattan rape
victim had told detectives that she was attacked by the boxer, Alex
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos had an alibi, and police had a suspect. The fighter flew
back to his hometown, where police showed him an array of pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew only one guy,'' Ramos recalls. ''I knew Spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugo, convicted in 1985, began a 3-to-9-year prison stretch on
Jan. 8, 1986. Throughout the process, Lugo insisted that he was
Alex Ramos; nobody ever corrected him. State correction officials
still list him under a combination of his birth and bogus names:
''Ramos, Alberto.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramos, struggling with his career and his own demons, put
the bizarre impersonation behind him when Lugo was jailed. Ramos
relocated to California, where his life in and out of the ring soon
crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he earned the United States Boxing Association
middleweight crown - and lost it the next year, taking a vicious
beating in a second-round TKO defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine and booze became a devastating one-two that Ramos
couldn't slip as the fighter blew through an estimated $500,000 in
earnings. He spent too much time chasing women, too little time in
the gym.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 title shot ended with a loss to future two-time champion
Michael Nunn, and the big money fights disappeared. Two years
later, Ramos received word that his mother was dying back in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos needed money for a flight home. There was none, his
managers said. Alex Ramos was broke.
</P>
<P>
   Stranded in California, Ramos waited helplessly as his mother
died. A drunken and enraged Ramos accused his managers - rightly,
he still says - of stealing a $54,000 purse. And then brutally beat
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon - his fists
- and spent 22 months in Corcoran State Prison. After his release
in 1990, he returned to the ring. He also returned to cocaine, and
then returned to prison on a 1993 parole violation.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, released and reinvigorated, Ramos won nine
straight fights before heading to Argentina for a $25,000 payday
and a WBA title shot against Jorge Castro. He was knocked out in
the second round in what became his last professional fight.
</P>
<P>
   His lifetime record was 39-10-2, with 24 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, Ramos awoke one morning ''in a sweat and in
tears'' after a nightmare that he had died penniless, like the
great heavyweight Joe Louis. He longed to escape the drugs, the
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1995, and Ramos spent the next six months in a free Santa
Monica rehabilitation clinic. Now clean, the ex-pug decided to give
something back to the fight game: he helped create the Retired
Boxers Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization lends a hand to needy ex-fighters -
those battling drug and alcohol woes, those left penniless or
homeless, those who just took too many shots to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos reclaimed his prominent position in the boxing community.
Flashing a wide smile and raising a boxer's fist, he posed for
pictures with referee Mills Lane, ex-heavyweight contender Gerry
Cooney, Olympic boxing champion Mark Breland.
</P>
<P>
   He began raising funds for his new project.
</P>
<P>
   As Ramos rebuilt his life, Lugo resurrected his own version of
the Ramos saga. He endured a failed marriage, according to one of
his lawyers, and did his time on the rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo was released on Christmas Eve 1989, but couldn't avoid
trouble: city and state records show he was jailed repeatedly for
violating parole and probation, including once for selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, 1996, Lugo was released after three months behind
bars on his latest violation.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo moved into an apartment complex near the Hudson River in
Manhattan. He was single, childless, and ready to party. Lugo took
to the town as Alex Ramos yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ''He held himself out to be Alex Ramos on a daily basis,''
acknowledged Lugo's latest attorney, Kyle Watters.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Lugo arrived for dinner at a friend's home. There he
introduced himself to one and all as boxer Alex Ramos, a happy
spiel that only served to infuriate one guest.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was Miriam Martinez, and she was Ramos' sister. Lugo
left the party.
</P>
<P>
   Other nights, Lugo headed to the bars of the Lower East Side.
There, buying drinks and holding court for the ladies, he was again
Alex Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   He was still in training for a title shot, explained
Lugo-as-Ramos. He talked up his manager, Shelly Finkel, who also
handled Mike Tyson. (Lugo mistakenly thought that veteran boxing
impresario Finkel was a woman).
</P>
<P>
   Lugo found a number of women quite willing to say ''yes'' to a
successful athlete's sexual overtures, his lawyers said. For those
who said no, Lugo used another technique, authorities charged.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1998, Lugo lured a 19-year-old woman to a Manhattan
hotel room with a promise of a job as a ring-card girl. Once in the
room, Lugo gave her a soda and asked her to strip to her underwear
- a preview of how she would look in a bikini.
</P>
<P>
   The teen sipped her drink and collapsed in the room, where Lugo
tried to rape her, the girl said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, 1999, a 26-year-old woman visiting from Atlanta met
Lugo at a bar. He bought her a beer, insisting she drink it. When
she woke up later, she was naked from the waist down and knew she
had been raped.
</P>
<P>
   There was a third incident, although Lugo later insisted all
three involved consensual sex.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities disagreed. Lugo, still identifying himself as Alex
Ramos, was arrested in February 1999 for rape, kidnapping and
sodomy. When Lugo was taken into custody, two police detectives
asked for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread around New York in the weeks before the March 13,
1999, Madison Square Garden title fight between Lennox Lewis and
Evander Holyfield: Alex Ramos was a rapist.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Lugo sitting in Rikers Island on $250,000 bail, even
if no one knew him by that name. In court papers, in an NYPD press
release, in conversations with his lawyer, he remained Alex Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Alex Ramos took a call from his panicked father
about the rape case. Ramos' reputation, and his fledgling
foundation, suffered a major hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large donor called from New York and said they would not
contribute to any foundation with a rapist,''' Ramos recalls.
''This was really damaging to me, to my family, to my foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time around, Alex Ramos had shrugged off Lugo's
identity swapping. His attitude had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt it was the last fight of my life,'' Ramos says. ''I had
lived in the darkness. I'm trying to move forward, do the right
thing. And here it is, 20 years later, and I'm going back to
court.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Ramos returned to his hometown and went toe-to-toe
with Lugo in a Manhattan courtroom. Sitting in the witness chair at
Lugo's rape trial, he stared down his one-time fan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not look at me,'' Ramos says. ''My eyes were burning
holes in his soul, in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Jose Muniz, looking back and forth, noticed a
slight resemblance between the pair: ''A little bit, not
striking.'' Ramos' chin was more chiseled, his eyes brighter, his
hair a little grayer
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Martha Bashford, who had called
Ramos to testify, began her questions.
</P>
<P>
   No, Ramos said, he never committed the crimes charged against
Lugo.
</P>
<P>
   No, Ramos said, he had never given permission for Lugo to use
his name.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Muniz asked if he was Alex Ramos, the
middleweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   It was over quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo didn't testify, but Bashford played a videotaped interview
with Lugo insisting he was Alex Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I boxed for a while,'' he boasted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amateur? Professional?'' Bashford asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both,'' he replied. ''Amateur and professional.''
</P>
<P>
   During the week-long trial, not a single friend or family member
appeared in court to support Lugo. The only face familiar to the
defendant belonged to Alex Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   It took a Manhattan jury just five hours to convict Lugo and
return Alex Ramos his name. Lugo seemed surprised by the guilty
verdict, squinting at the jurors as each conviction was read.
</P>
<P>
   He then leaned over toward Muniz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jose,'' he asked, ''how could they find me guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   Muniz offered a one-word answer: ''Credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing a 50-year prison term, Lugo decided to start fighting,
too. After the conviction, he hired a new lawyer and planned an
appeal that he will watch from behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   For Alex Ramos, the fight is finally over: his name is again
his, and Lugo is going to jail. If Lugo ever abuses his name again,
Ramos vows, there will be one last brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put me in a room with this guy, and I'll tell you for a fact -
I'm the only one coming out of that room,'' Ramos says, his voice
hard. ''You'll know who the real Alex Ramos is.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Housing Executive Convicted  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A city housing executive was convicted
Wednesday of taking thousands of dollars in bribes from people
seeking low-income homes in one of the nation's tightest housing
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Williams, 57, was convicted following a yearlong FBI
probe into the San Francisco Housing Authority. Williams, another
city official, Yolanda Jones, and 20 others have pleaded guilty or
been convicted in the scam to illegally obtain subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public officials who take bribes and make false statements ...
abuse the public trust,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller said after
the verdict in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a 23-year housing agency veteran who supervised the
authority's relocation office from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said she conspired with others to sell access to
public housing units, and Section 8 rental vouchers for as much as
$2,500. Williams was accused of receiving more than $34,000 in
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that they either gave Williams money or saw
her take money to help secure public housing for people who could
not qualify for subsidies because of criminal records or their
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance cited by prosecutors, a woman received $33,550
in federal housing subsidies with Williams' help but did not live
in a city housing project. The woman, Tracy Baker, pleaded guilty
to two felony counts of making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 39, who no longer works for the city, pleaded guilty to
10 felony charges and testified against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jury foreman Greg McGiboney said Williams wasn't corrupt, but
fell to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an opportunity that presented itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is on unpaid leave from her job that pays $72,400
annually, was convicted of 30 felony counts and acquitted of seven
others. She faces a potential life term at her Jan. 13 sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   She is free on bail and immediately left the San Francisco
courtroom with her attorney, Randy Sue Pollock. They refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The city is the nation's most expensive housing market. Last
week, the National Low Income Housing Coalition said San Francisco,
Marin and San Mateo counties -- all in the San Francisco area -- were
tied as the least affordable in the country.

<HEADLINE> Gore Prepares for Debate  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the vice presidential dining room, Texas
wiseacre Paul Begala drawled zinger after stinging zinger, winning
applause as a dead ringer for Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Begala's best lines? Those are kept under wraps, said a Gore
adviser, just in case the vice president wants to use one himself
in the three debates against Bush that start next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his full slate of advisers -- including wife Tipper,
brother-in-law Frank Hunger and daughter Karenna -- are planning to
settle in at Sarasota, Fla., this weekend to finish up preparations
that have been going on for months.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same place where, during his 1996 rehearsals to face
Republican Jack Kemp, Gore insisted aides replicate the debate hall
exactly -- right down to room temperature. Gore said he's not going
to be as picky this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it matters that much,'' he told reporters
Wednesday aboard Air Force Two. ''I'll be doing some more reading.
We'll probably do a couple of practice sessions. It's a unique
forum in American politics. You know, you never know what's going
to happen. You try to do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted some concern that he could score points on
substance, but lose to Bush on style. ''I think it's the same
question people ask about how people vote: do they vote on the
issues or on the person? Both. How do you separate them out? ...
It's above my level of expertise. I just feel my way along.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate hunkered down Tuesday night in his Des Moines
hotel suite with briefing materials after a dinner of takeout
barbecue with Hunger and son-in-law Drew Schiff. But most other
debate rehearsals were staged at Washington's Naval Observatory,
Gore's official residence, where the dining room is the only room
with space enough to set up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not complicated. You try to guess at the subject areas --
the three or four that will come up in each'' debate, said campaign
chairman William Daley. Beyond that, Daley didn't want to talk
debate strategy for fear of giving away intelligence to the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, strategist Carter Eskew and speechwriter Bob Shrum are
among the tight circle of advisers involved in debate rehearsals to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Begala, who helped engineer the Clinton-Gore defeat of Bush's
father in 1992, is not the only Clinton veteran on that team. White
House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed has taken leave from his
West Wing job until at least Oct. 17, the date of the third and
final presidential debate in St. Louis, to shepherd the issues
research.
</P>
<P>
   Begala, who just this month released a book on Bush's record
that borrows its title, ''Is our children learning?'' from one of
the Texas governor's more infamous malapropisms, said the hardest
part of playing Bush in mock debates is ''the total rewiring'' of
his own thought processes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Democrat. I went to public schools. I have student
loans. And now I've got to wrap my mind around a guy who's a
perfectly decent guy, but who's reflexively against all that,''
said Begala.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest part, he added, is coming up with cheap shots. ''One
thing I like about Bush, we both have an affinity for the
occasional smart-alecky line,'' Begala chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   Begala's Texas accent also helps in sharpening Gore's
preparation. Former New York Rep. Tom Downey, who played Kemp in
Gore's mock 1996 vice presidential debates and Bill Bradley in this
year's primary rehearsals, had been slated to play Bush but excused
himself after a videotape of Bush's secret debate rehearsals was
mysteriously delivered to his office. The FBI is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the debates as the next great proving ground in this
election, the Gore camp has focused the public side of its debate
prep on lowering sky-high expectations for Gore, a proven debater.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have an overconfident bone in my body,'' Gore said,
when asked recently about the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cited Bush's 1994 Texas gubernatorial debate against
incumbent Ann W. Richards. ''He was supposed to be slaughtered in
that,'' Gore mused. ''She's certainly a better debater than I am,
she's got a very quick wit and silver tongue and is just smart as a
whip, and he beat her in that debate, so put that in your
formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Begala: ''No one with any sense would underestimate George
W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   On the private side of debate prep, Gore has hundreds of pages
of material on his own and Bush's records gathered by researchers
into three black three-ring binders. Aides said he's pretty much
shelved one tactic he used in the winter primary debates against
Bradley -- the use of human props to illustrate policy points.
</P>
<P>
   For those primary debates, Gore stocked the audience with
citizens -- identified through exhaustive searches by his
researchers -- whose real-life stories illustrated the points he
wanted to make.

Homolka Being Transferred To Maximum Security Prison
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Karla Homolka, notorious for her role in the
deaths of Ontario schoolgirls Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, is
being transferred to a maximum security prison for psychiatric
evaluation, says a Correctional Service of Canada official.
</P>
<P>
   She will be transferred from the medium-security Joliette
Institution, 70 kilometers northeast of Montreal, where she had
been serving a 12-year sentence for manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials were notified of the move Wednesday and
arrangements are being made, said Michele Pilon-Santilli,
spokeswoman for Correctional Service of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The move is unrelated to pictures published in newspapers last
week of Homolka enjoying a birthday party with other sexual
offenders at the prison, said Pilon-Santilli.
</P>
<P>
   An outraged public flooded the correctional service with calls
and Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay was called to account in
the House of Commons after the photos were published.
</P>
<P>
   The warden of Joliette requested the evaluation after it was
recommended by a prominent outside psychologist following many
psychiatric and psychological assessments on Homolka,
Pilon-Santilli she said.
</P>
<P>
   Homolka will have served two-thirds of her sentence by July 6,
2001 and would normally be eligible for release.

Experts: Biker Summit May Lead To More Crime
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A bold courthouse summit between rival biker
gangs might bring an end to their bloody turf war but could also
lead to more street-level crime, experts warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hells Angels and Rock Machine leaders surprised and angered
Quebecers on Tuesday when they met, of all places, at the Quebec
City courthouse. Among those upset by the meeting's location was
Premier Lucien Bouchard, who called it ''totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll look into what happened and how the solicitor general
regards the matter,'' said Bouchard, who was questioned by
reporters in Milwaukee at the windup of a Quebec trade mission to
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Police and biker experts agreed the gangs were probably trying
to reach a truce and agree on a division of territories for their
crime rings.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs were likely responding to increased public pressure
for tougher anti-gang laws that followed the shooting this month of
a reporter who covered the biker war.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that these negotiations were held in the courthouse
is a snub at society,'' Yves Lavigne, who has written extensively
on organized crime, said in an interview from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message to society from the bikers was that they're not
afraid of society's institutions, be it the courts or the police .
. . this was grandstanding.''

Aboriginals Fight For Return of Blood Samples
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Scientists using human
materials to conduct groundbreaking genetic research need to brush
up on their manners, says a medical ethicist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael McDonald said simple courtesy might have avoided a
current dispute between members of a Vancouver Island aboriginal
group and an English researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists regularly get so wrapped up in research they forget
to mention how donations can end up in unrelated experiments, said
McDonald, director for the Center for Applied Ethics at Vancouver's
University of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuu-chah-nulth is fighting for the return of almost 900
blood samples provided to an Oxford University researcher by
aboriginals in the early 1980s who believed they were participating
in an arthritis study.
</P>
<P>
   The blood was never returned and the aboriginals discovered it
was being used in genetic experiments beyond the local arthritis
study.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not supposed to happen that way, but it is going on,''
McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, representing 13 Vancouver
Island First Nations, is meeting this week in an effort to have the
blood samples returned.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticist Richard Ward, who originally took the samples from
the aboriginals, apparently used the blood for anthropology
research beyond arthritis. He could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Crew of Sunken Greek Ferry Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAROS, Greece (AP) -- Greek authorities on Wednesday arrested the
captain and four crew members of a ferry that struck a rocky
outcrop marked by a light beacon that could be seen for seven
miles. At least 66 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Searches continued throughout the night for possible survivors.
Some survivors said crew members were watching a soccer match on
television Tuesday night when the ship, holding more than 500
people, went aground in a gale in the Aegean Sea just two miles
from shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I joked with my husband, 'Who's driving the ship?''' said
Christa Liczbinski, a pregnant, 37-year-old from Seeheim, Germany,
who was traveling with her husband -- a Lufthansa pilot -- and their
4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's lead prosecutor, Panagiotis Dimopoulos, said he would
seek indictments for the crew on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inexplicable how the ship collided with a well-known
rock that carries a light visible from a distance of seven miles,''
said coast guard chief Andreas Sirigos. ''You have to be blind not
to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors described a scene of panic and chaos as passengers
tried to slip off the sinking ship into the swelling seas.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many people were aboard, and how many of them
were foreigners. At least 473 people were rescued, including two
Americans, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people are still officially listed as missing, but that
number could be considerably higher since tickets can be bought on
the ship and are not issued to children under age 6.
</P>
<P>
   Navy divers planned to search through the sunken ferry Thursday,
which went down within 45 minutes of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Express Samina was on its daily meandering route
through the Aegean with an assortment of passengers -- foreign
tourists heading for sun-soaked holiday isles, residents heading
home, army conscripts returning to military bases from leaves.
</P>
<P>
   There were reportedly also passengers from Australia, Belgium,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown if any Americans died. Among the first 20 dead to
be identified was Eli Hestnes Juul, a 51-year-old Norwegian woman.
The rest were Greek.
</P>
<P>
   A port official suffered a heart attack and died after learning
of the sinking, the coast guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship left Athens' port of Piraeus at 5 p.m. Tuesday and
headed for Paros, the first of six stops that would eventually
bring it to the tiny Lipsis islands near the Turkish coast.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 p.m., the 345-foot, 4,407-ton ferry rammed into the
Portes islet, a large rocky outcrop two miles from shore that is
marked on maritime charts and has a navigation light, Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Shannon, 30, an artist and teacher from Seattle, said
she was on the main deck at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw it hit,'' Shannon said. ''It was well above the top
deck. ... It was like the movie 'Titanic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A small flotilla of fishing boats rushed to the scene, followed
by dozens of other vessels and British navy helicopters. They
rescued dozens of people, but gale-force winds hampered their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Among those saved by the British helicopters were at least 12
people, including two Britons, who had been clinging to rocks. They
were taken to the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, suffering from
cold, shock and minor cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Even while the rescue operation was under way, authorities began
investigating the role of the crew in the crash. Results of a
preliminary investigation indicated the captain, Vassilis Yannakis,
was not on his bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yannakis was arrested, along with his deputy, Anastasios
Psychoyos, and three crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos blamed the accident on
''criminal negligence'' shown by the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Coast guard investigators were examining passenger reports that
most of the crew was watching a European Champions League soccer
match when the ferry crashed.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor, Manolis Diktas told state television that ''members
of the crew, including officers, were watching the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, according to some survivors, people panicked
and the crew ignored the custom of evacuating women and children
first.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody told us to do anything,'' said Heidi Hart, a
26-year-old accountant from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just yelling and pushing,'' Hart said. ''We were
handing out life vests. People were starting to jump out of the
boat without vests. I thought we were going to die the whole time.
We got on a boat and they let it down. There was a hole in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Emil Popper, a 34-year-old company director from Wales, said
there was ''total chaos'' as people leaped off the sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically it was chaos and mayhem at the back of the ship.
There was no organization, total chaos,'' Popper said. ''People
were jumping off the ship. There was absolutely no prioritization.
There was nothing left of the boat on the side we were holding on
to and it was a question of clawing our way down the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Greece's worst ferry accident in 35 years. In 1965, 217
people died in the sinking of the passenger ship Iraklion.
</P>
<P>
   Messages of condolence reached Greece from political and
religious leaders around the world, including Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Claims 1st Death  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- An 82-year-old New Jersey man has become
the first person in the United States this year to die of the West
Nile virus, Gov. Christie Whitman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not immediately identify the man, who died on
Sept. 14, 11 days after he became ill. They said that he had other
ailments but that West Nile virus had been the principal cause of
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''People shouldn't panic,'' said Whitman, who urged residents to
wear insect repellent and long-sleeved clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven people died and 55 others were infected in the
New York metropolitan area during the first known appearance of the
virus in the Western Hemisphere. The virus is typically transmitted
by mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 13 people have been infected in New York and four in
New Jersey, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. New York reported its 13th case on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also has been detected in birds in Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and
Pennsylvania officials Wednesday said they had found the virus in
two dead crows outside Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The disease can cause flu-like symptoms and can be dangerous to
young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune
systems.
</P>
<P>
   CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said it is increasingly unlikely that
there will be any more human cases this year since the cooler
weather reduces the number of mosquitoes.

Gore Offers End To 'Soft Money' Ads
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore offered today to pull the plug on all presidential
campaign radio and TV ads paid for by political parties with unregulated ''soft
money'' -- but only if George W. Bush does likewise. Bush had signaled his
reluctance to do so just a day earlier, saying he wanted to get rid of such ads
but that Gore couldn't be counted on to abide by such a deal. ''I don't trust
him, to be frank with you,'' the Texas governor said.

Polls: Gore, Bush Race Close
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Los Angeles Times poll gives Republican George W.
Bush a 48-42 percent lead over Democrat Al Gore in the presidential race, but
the candidates are about even in other national polls. Both Republicans and
Democrats said today they feel the race is very close, maybe the closest since
1960. After several weeks when the Bush campaign appeared to be moving in the
Democrat's direction, evidence pointed to a comeback fueled largely by his
renewed appeal to female ''swing voters'' and seniors.

Texas Executes Inmate

   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A condemned man who won an unprecedented reprieve

executed today for killing his 12-year-old stepdaughter. Ricky McGinn, 43,
received a lethal injection for raping Stephanie Flanary and bludgeoning her
with an ax. He insisted evidence was planted or tampered with, but DNA tests
completed in August again linked McGinn to the 1993 crime. The McGinn case drew
attention because of the June 1 reprieve by Bush.

prices a ''resurrection.'' Chavez, a driving force behind the resurgence of a
cartel that was on the brink of collapse in 1998, urged oil producing nations to
use their newfound influence in this era of high crude prices to improve their

Gore's Medicare plan would help. The candidates' competing Medicare plans have
become a focus of the presidential race. Separately, Gore endorsed his

warmed up on the mound at Shea Stadium, where the Braves played the Mets on last

hometown friend Brian Peterson got between them and his friend and refused to
step away, police told newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Sheen Steps Into 'Spin City'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stepping into Michael J. Fox's squeaky-clean
shoes on ''Spin City'' has given Charlie Sheen a chance to laugh at
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The show's creator came to me early on and said, 'Look,
Charlie, we want to make this guy pretty colorful; how do you feel
about that?' And I said, 'Let's do it,' because that gives me good
opportunity to deal with my notoriety head-on and let people know
that I don't take myself that seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean, if I can't laugh at it, I'm missing one of the best
jokes of the day,'' Sheen tells the October issue of Maxim
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, 35, was convicted in 1997 of beating a girlfriend. The
next year he was hospitalized for a drug overdose and was ordered
into a rehabilitation program after his father reported the
overdose to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, whose film credits include ''Money Talks,'' ''The
Chase,'' ''Hot Shots! Part Deux,'' ''Major League'' and ''Young
Guns,'' also told Maxim he's clueless about the opposite sex,
despite being linked to numerous women.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I've learned anything at all, it's that I know nothing
about women,'' he said. ''They remain a mystery. But I've learned
to stop trying to figure them out. There's no end to the journey,
and that's what makes it so compelling.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Inmate Is Executed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A condemned man who won an
unprecedented reprieve from Gov. George W. Bush for DNA tests that
only confirmed his guilt was executed Wednesday for killing his
12-year-old stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky McGinn, 43, received a lethal injection for raping
Stephanie Flanary and bludgeoning her with an ax. He insisted
evidence was planted or tampered with, but DNA tests completed in
August again linked McGinn to the 1993 crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want nobody to be mad at nobody,'' McGinn said moments
before his death. ''I don't want nobody to be bitter. Keep clean
hearts and I will see y'all on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   The McGinn case drew attention because of the June 1 reprieve
granted by Bush, the Republican presidential candidate who has been
criticized for allowing executions to continue in his home state
while he campaigns as a ''compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time he had used his authority as Texas
governor to issue a 30-day reprieve to a condemned killer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good job, Mr. Bush,'' Janet Roberts, McGinn's ex-wife and the
girl's mother, said after watching McGinn die. ''I think I can go
home and sleep real good tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel relief... He will not breathe our air any more. My
daughter can rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, when Texas resumed capital punishment, 232 people
have been executed. Texas is on pace to execute 40 people this
year, which would break the record of 37 executed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said no innocent person has been put to death in Texas
during his five-plus years in office.

<HEADLINE> Inmate accused of stabbing two prison workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STORMVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - A convicted murderer on Wednesday
allegedly used homemade knives to stab both a high-level official
and officer at the Green Haven Correctional Facility maximum
security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate Tyrone Walker, a 31-year-old committed out of Brooklyn,
is accused of the 2 p.m. attack in the prison's exercise yard.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Superintendent for Security George S. Schneider, 52,
sustained puncture wounds to the back, shoulder, and above the
right eye; Corrections Officer Gary L. Mitchetti, 28, wounds to the
back of the head and base of the skull.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said Schneider was making his daily round of
the yard when Walker called to him and then attacked him wielding
knives in both hands. When Corrections Officer Glen Williams struck
Walker with his baton, Walker allegedly circled behind Schneider
and began attacking Schneider from behind. As Williams again used
his baton to protect Schneider, Walker allegedly stabbed Mitchetti.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is serving a sentence of 32&AMP;frac12; years to life for crimes
that include fatally shooting a woman as she loaded her car in
Manhattan in 1993 and the 1993 murder of a man in Ulster County.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations by the state Department of Correctional Services,
the New York Division of State Police and the Dutchess County
District's Attorney's Office are underway.
</P>

   Stormville is 95 miles south of Albany.

By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - Nine alleged members and associates
of the Gambino Mafia family have been charged with crimes ranging
from racketeering to murdering a stripper and then planning to
murder her accused killer.
</P>
<P>
   All nine were charged with racketeering and some with
loansharking, counterfeiting checks and being accessories to
murder, U.S. Attorney Guy A. Lewis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This indictment should send a message to organized criminals
who are targeting South Florida that they will be prosecuted and
punished,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony ''Tony Pep'' Trentacosta took control of the New
York-based Gambino family's Florida operations in March 1999 after
the death of Anthony ''Fat Andy'' Ruggiano, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Trentacosta, an Atlanta resident, gave his orders to Frederick
J. Massaro, 60, who owned Beachside Mario's, a storefront
restaurant in Sunny Isles, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   They say the restaurant was used as a front to procure
information needed to counterfeit checks, sell stolen merchandise,
conduct loansharking and as a place to plot Jeanette ''Jade''
Smith's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Smith, 22, of Pembroke Pines, was strangled on
March 20, 1999, at a Sunny Isles motel. Her body was found two days
later in the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel A. Hernandez, 35, is facing state first-degree murder
charges for her death. Federal prosecutors say Massaro knew about
the killing in advance and on March 25, 1999, solicited Carlos
Garcia, 33, of Miami, and another man they did not name to kill
Hernandez. Police arrested Hernandez before the hit could be
carried out, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis would not say why investigators believe Hernandez killed
Smith or why Massaro wanted him killed.
</P>
<P>
   Trentacosta, 61, was arrested Tuesday and charged with
racketeering. Prosecutors did not know who his attorney is.
</P>
<P>
   Massaro, also arrested Tuesday, is charged with murder, murder
conspiracy, racketeering, bank fraud, loansharking, theft and
illegal possession of firearms
</P>
<P>
   Fred Haddad, his attorney, did not return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is charged with murder, racketeering, bank fraud and
counterfeiting checks. Prosecutors did not know his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested Tuesday on racketeering and other charges were:
</P>
<P>
   - Julius B. Chiusano, 52, of Hallandale Beach, who is also
charged with bank fraud and counterfeiting checks. Attorney Don
Spadero said Wednesday he had not spoken to his client in detail
about the charges and declined specific comment. He pointed out
that the counterfeit checks his client allegedly helped pass
totaled less than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Miami residents Charles P. Monico, 43, and Anthony R. Banks,
27. Both are also charged with helping dump Smith's body. Public
defenders were being assigned to the pair Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   - Francis ''Little Frankie'' Ruggiero, 62, who is also charged
with loansharking. His attorney, Sam DeLuca, of New Jersey, could
not immediately be reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and Adam T. Silverman, 33, were being sought by police
Wednesday. Garcia is also charged with conspiracy to commit murder
and loansharking. Silverman, whose hometown is unknown, is also
charged with loansharking and helping to dispose of Smith's body.

<HEADLINE> Drug Cos. Gave $800,000 to GOP  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pharmaceutical industry gave more than
$800,000 to Republican Party committees last month after the Senate
voted to allow reimports of lower-priced U.S.-made drugs --
something the companies oppose.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president of Bristol-Myers Squibb co-chaired a
fund-raising dinner Wednesday for Senate Republicans. But despite
the intensive lobbying effort, Congress is likely to pass the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry also is fighting a Democratic
proposal to expand Medicare, the health care program for the
elderly, to cover the cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Three drug companies -- Bristol-Myers, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn -- gave $200,000 apiece in unregulated ''soft
money'' donations to the National Republican Senatorial Committee
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers also gave $107,200 and Schering Corp. contributed
$100,000 to the Republican National Committee. The RNC is spending
millions of dollars on issue advertisements designed to help elect
Republican George W. Bush president, including commercials
criticizing Democrat Al Gore on prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee received
only $2,500 from the pharmaceutical industry in August, a single
donation from Bristol-Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the Republican senatorial committee,
said the six-figure donations were made for the fund-raising
dinner, headlined by Republican vice presidential nominee Dick
Cheney. The event was raised more than $8 million, a record for
this event, helping to fatten a campaign account that had $22.8
million as of Aug. 31. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
had a slightly larger sum, $24.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to reform Medicare so that it is solvent, so that it
survives, so that our seniors have choices and are able to choose
and so that we can also provide a prescription drug benefit to
seniors,'' Cheney said at the dinner in his only mention of the
drug issue.
</P>
<P>
   Roy noted that the Democrats, too, have received pharmaceutical
industry contributions. Since Jan. 1, 1999, Republicans have
received $10.5 million compared with $5.5 million for Democrats.
Already, the industry has given more -- $16 million -- than the $12.8
million in contributions it made during the 1997-98 election cycle,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to solicit the contributions for the GOP dinner was
Bristol-Myers President Peter Dolan, one of the dinner co-chairs.
Other co-chairs include former Republican National Committee
chairman Haley Barbour, now a lobbyist whose clients include
Bristol-Myers and two other drug companies, Amgen and Glaxo
Wellcome, and former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, R-Texas, also a lobbyist
for Bristol-Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats criticized the drug industry's heavy involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only are the big pharmaceutical companies spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars feeding Bush running mate Dick
Cheney and the Republican senators dinner, but they are feeding
them millions of dollars in donations to mount a full-scale attack
on Medicare and a Medicare prescription drug benefit,'' Democratic
National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy said the drug donations had no impact on legislation. ''What
we offer is a good meal and good government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers spokesman Patrick Donohue said there was no
connection between the company's donations and the legislation
pending on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly feel there are a lot of issues that are important
facing the industry, but there's no link between contributions made
to the party and something that has come before a vote,'' Donohue
said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is legislation allowing pharmacists and drug wholesale
distributors to import American-made drugs sold abroad for less
than they cost in the United States. The Food and Drug
Administration would be required to certify that all reimported
drugs are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this amendment does is allow international competition to
bring rational pricing practices to the prescription drug
industry,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., who sponsored the
measure as an amendment to the agriculture spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports the bill. Bush has not taken a position.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry's trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, contends the reimported drugs may be
unsafe. To get that point across, the group has aired television
commercials, run newspaper ads, written letters and met with
lawmakers and their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also has been handing out booklets of letters
from 11 former Food and Drug Administration commissioners, all of
whom question the safety of reimported drugs.

<HEADLINE> Gore Questions GOP on Medicare  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTOONA, Iowa (AP) -- Winifred Skinner won kisses -- three on the
forehead, two on the cheek -- from Al Gore Wednesday for her tale of
making ends meet with the recycling-center nickels she gets for
soda cans picked from the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, 79, didn't want Gore or the IRS to know how many
nickels, though. ''I withdraw that question,'' the vice president
chuckled. ''Because I'm all for you.''
</P>
<P>
   That sweet exchange at Gore's campaign stop at a community
center here juxtaposed the Democratic presidential candidate's
sharp indictment of Republican rival George W. Bush for allegedly
having it in for Medicare, the government health program upon which
39 million seniors and disabled Americans rely.
</P>
<P>
   At a community center here, Gore described seeing on television
in his Des Moines hotel that morning a Bush ad accusing Gore of
wanting, through his proposal to add a prescription drug benefit to
Medicare, to turn the program into a ''government-run HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way they describe Medicare. There's no big
government HMO,'' Gore huffed. ''You get to choose your doctor. You
get to choose your pharmacy.''
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponents, Gore continued, ''never really have
liked Medicare and putting it down that way is in keeping with the
opposition on the other side to the creation of Medicare in the
first place -- and their support of Newt Gingrich's plan to let it
wither on the vine in 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal that (Bush) put out this year would have
essentially the same effect,'' Gore finished.
</P>
<P>
   That loaded charge, aimed at riling senior citizens who vote in
reliably large numbers, came as Gore looked for ways to break out
ahead in a very tight race against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett, in turn, said Gore's Medicare plan
''creates more than 400 government regulations and gives federal
bureaucrats greater control over medical decisions for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett added that Gore is ''lashing out by trying to fight
five-year old budget battles with Newt Gingrich. Governor Bush has
said that Medicare is one of the most successful programs for our
seniors and his reforms will make sure that it is successful for
the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a lunchtime rally with more than 1,000 supporters in a
downtown Des Moines square, Gore counted the time remaining, ''40
days 8 hours and 20 minutes,'' before polls close on Nov. 7 in this
state, which awards just seven of the 270 electoral votes needed to
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party pitched in with a new TV ad -- airing in
Delaware, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Oregon,
Washington state and Wisconsin -- noting that Bush came from the oil
business and says he supported laws to let the industry regulate
itself. It also says Texas is No. 3 in water pollution and No. 1 in
air pollution while Gore has fought for the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''America's environment is cleaner now,'' an announcer says.
''Do we really want it to look like Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   In Altoona, where local unions and senior centers had gathered
an invitation-only crowd of 200, Gore tossed his sportcoat over the
lectern and roamed the room fielding supportive questions about his
proposal to add a drug benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, recruited by the United Auto Workers to attend, told
Gore that, because she pays around $250 each month for
prescriptions, she walks Des Moines' city streets ''an hour and a
half to two and a half hours -- sometimes three hours -- seven days a
week and I pick up cans and that's what puts the food on my
table.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, she added, a ''smart aleck'' driving past ''looked at
me and he yelled back and says, 'Get a life!' And I thought, if I
wasn't picking up these cans I wouldn't have a life. ... I don't
get food stamps or nothing like that. I want to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, putting his arms around her and gently kissing her
forehead, said: ''Well, you're going back to work. ... How much do
you earn a week, seven days of picking up cans?''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner worried: ''You're not going to tell the government are
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gore: ''You know, I don't want to know the answer to that.
I withdraw that question. Because I'm all for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Washington, D.C., Gore contrasted his supported for
abortion rights with Bush's opposition in remarks before about 500
people at a Women Leadership Forum reception. He also previewed the
economic speech he plans for Thursday, boasting of budget surpluses
and record low unemployment. ''I'm not satisfied,'' Gore said.
''You ain't seen nothing yet.
</P>
<P>
   He and running mate Joseph Lieberman also were attending a
dinner benefiting the Democratic National Committee.

<HEADLINE> 2 Students Wound Each Other With Gun  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Amid concerns that an ongoing turf battle may
have led to a school shooting, the mayor sought to turn the
discussion toward why children have such easy access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neighborhood and school rivalries are as old as the city. What
changes that is when children have access to guns,'' Mayor Marc
Morial said Wednesday. ''That takes an innocent shoving match and
turns it into a violent incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Johnson, 13, and William Pennington, 15, traded gunshots
in the crowded breezeway of Carter G. Woodson Middle School shortly
before noon Tuesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson got the gun from a 13-year-old friend outside a
chain-link fence and shot Pennington; Pennington then grabbed the
gun and shot him in the back, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's mother, Catrice, seemed caught off guard by her son's
alleged involvement in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like somebody at school should have known something. My
son is not a troublemaker,'' she said. ''I'm not saying he's a
perfect kid, but he's not a bad kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys were upgraded to stable condition Wednesday, said Jean
Patterson, Charity Hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The boy who allegedly passed the .38-caliber revolver to Johnson
had been expelled from the school for fighting, police said. Alfred
Anderson was arrested and booked on juvenile charges of illegally
carrying a weapon and being a principal to attempted first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   A home number for Anderson's family could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be booked with attempted murder as a juvenile when
he is released, police Lt. Marlon Defillo said. Pennington will
likely not be charged, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Classes at the school were canceled until Monday, although the
school remained open for students and parents who wanted to talk
with counselors.
</P>
<P>
   The boys lived in neighboring housing developments that
residents described as having a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   An unrelated shooting occurred Wednesday just two blocks from
the school, apparently when a resident of the Guste housing
development drove through the nearby C.J. Peete development, Police
Capt. Michael Ellington said. A 35-year-old man was wounded and an
18-year-old man was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, New Orleans was one of the first cities to sue
gunmakers to recover the cost of gun violence and accidental
shootings involving children. Gun makers' attempts to dismiss the
lawsuit have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 other municipalities have filed similar lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Officer pleads innocent to extortion, drug distribution charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Schenectady police officer Michael Siler
pleaded innocent Wednesday to the latest charges in a six-count
federal court indictment alleging he used drugs seized from a
dealer to bribe an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Siler, 32, insisted he would be exonerated once the case went to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fully expect to be cleared because I've done nothing
wrong,'' Siler said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-year-old Richard D. Barnett, Siler's former partner, has
already pleaded guilty to extortion and drug charges, admitting in
court that he and Siler traded 3.5 grams of crack cocaine for
details about criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett has since been fired from the force. The U.S. Attorney's
office has ordered a plea agreement with him sealed. He will be
sentenced Jan. 12, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, together with high-ranking members of the police
department, have been conducting a joint investigation into the
department since August 1999. The probe was sparked by complaints
that black residents were being mistreated and abused by some
officers. As part of the probe, Siler is accused of having heroin,
crack cocaine and marijuana in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   Siler faces a maximum of 30 years in prison for allegations that
include extortion, narcotics trafficking, and carrying a firearm
during the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Aides Erroneously Stopped By Police  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two White House aides said they were
traumatized, embarrassed and humiliated when gun-wielding police
stopped them in a Washington suburb, erroneously believing they
were driving a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Nash and his wife, Janis Kearney, both of whom are black,
said in a three-page statement Wednesday in response to media
inquiries that they were victims of racial profiling and were
stopped for the ''bogus crime of driving while black.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred Sept. 6 in suburban Montgomery County, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The county's police chief, Charles A. Moose, has denied the case
involved racial profiling but said during a radio call-in show,
''We're very sorry that this happened. We're not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the incident, the two White House staffers said after
they were stopped by police, who, aiming pistols and shotguns,
surrounded their vehicle, patted them down for weapons and
handcuffed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pistols and shotguns were aimed at us until we were
handcuffed. ... We were traumatized as a result of the stop,''
wrote Nash, adding that the incident left the two ''embarrassed,
humiliated and afraid for our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash is director of the Office of Presidential Personnel at the
White House, and Kearny works as a special assistant to the
president and records manager.
</P>
<P>
   A county police spokesman, Capt. William O'Toole, said Nash's
car was stopped because it was believed to be a car reported stolen
in the same area about 45 minutes earlier. He said Nash was
handcuffed for ''his own safety'' and maintained that Kearney was
ordered to remain in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Although police denied that Nash and his wife were stopped as
result racial profiling, authorities have acknowledged that the
stolen car was reported to have been taken by a black male.
</P>
<P>
   The incident became public Tuesday when a fellow White House
worker asked Moose to comment on it during a radio call-in show.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, Montgomery County police have begun using
hand-held computers to track race, ethnicity and gender information
about all motorists they stop. It is part of a settlement of a
three-year civil rights investigation of the department.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Mull Easing Cuba Embargo  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders agreed
Wednesday to a compromise aimed at easing four-decade-old
restrictions on U.S. food and medicine sales to Cuba, a GOP
lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said the deal would ban Cubans from using
credit from American banks or the U.S. government for such sales,
but let American financial institutions help arrange third-country
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from farm-state lawmakers, House GOP leaders
agreed last summer to support lifting the ban but barring U.S.
financing. Many lawmakers from farm states, particularly in the
Senate, had complained that simply barring U.S. financing would
make it nearly impossible for trade to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt told reporters that the accord would provide ''a
significant opening'' for trade with the Caribbean island nation. A
ban against trading most products to Cuba has been in effect since
1963, after Fidel Castro became the country's leader and Cuba
became a Soviet satellite.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he favors drug and food sales to
Cuba. White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said administration
officials had not seen the agreement yet and would not comment on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt said he expected the White House to support the provision,
which is part of an agriculture spending bill for the coming fiscal
year that is expected to exceed $75 billion. The measure could be
considered by the House next week.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how congressional Democrats would
react to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., who with Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., helped lead the effort to liberalize Cuban trade, said the
compromise would write into law regulations that currently restrict
U.S. tourist travel to Cuba. Many Democrats have said they oppose
such an action.
</P>
<P>
   The move to ease the sanctions against Cuba had been strongly
opposed by anti-Castro members of Congress and GOP leaders,
including House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   But their position was weakened in July when the House voted
overwhelmingly to stop enforcing the restrictions against food and
drug sales to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also approved legislation in July that would lift
sanctions against food and medicine sales to Cuba. It also would
prevent presidents from blocking shipments of food and medicine to
any country without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has entered the realm of presidential politics. GOP
nominee George W. Bush has said he opposes lifting sanctions, while
Democratic candidate Vice President Al Gore has said he favors more
contacts with Cubans ''without helping the Castro government.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of medicine to Cuba have been allowed since 1992, with
some restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, eight prominent Republicans called for an end
to restrictions on food and medicine sales to Cuba and on travel by
Americans to the island.
</P>
<P>
   They also recommended that a time limit, or ''sunset''
arrangement, be placed on a 1996 Cuban sanctions law so the next
president and the new Congress could have ''an unfettered
opportunity to determine how best to approach the Cuba issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy shift was recommended by John Block, a former
secretary of agriculture; Frank Carlucci, a former defense
secretary and national security adviser; William Clark, also a
former national security adviser; Carla Hills, former U.S. special
trade representative; Illinois Gov. George Ryan; John Whitehead, a
former deputy secretary of state; Clayton Yeutter, a former U.S.
special trade representative, agriculture secretary and chairman of
the Republican National Committee; and Jim Courter, a former New
Jersey congressman who served on the House Armed Services Committee
for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The eight said in a statement that in the post-Cold War era, the
policy of isolating Cuba no longer makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, with the Soviet bloc gone and Cuban military
capabilities vastly reduced, it is possible to use a different mix
of policy measures to serve important American interests such as
promoting human rights, assisting the Cuban people, and building
contacts with the generation that will govern Cuba in the new
century,'' the eight said.
</P>
<P>
   Their statement was released by the Lexington Institute, a
nonpartisan public policy research organization.

<HEADLINE> Peru Congressman: Army Plotting Coup  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- An opposition congressman who defected to
President Alberto Fujimori's ranks charged Wednesday that the army
high command was pressuring lawmakers to participate in a plot to
provoke a coup within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Miguel Mendoza, who defected from the opposition to
join Fujimori's Peru 2000 party, said the army intended to permit
the return of the president's deposed spy chief, Vladimiro
Montesinos. He announced Wednesday that he was quitting Fujimori's
party, and added that joining it had been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am denouncing that a group of congressmen from Peru 2000
have been pressured to sign letters of resignation, prepared in the
army's high command, to form a congressional group in favor of
Vladimiro Montesinos,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the purpose ''would be to promote disorder within
Congress and throughout the country to unleash generalized chaos
and carry out a coup d'etat within 20 days, which would allow the
return of ... Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   The army's information office issued a brief communique
Wednesday night calling Mendoza's allegations ''absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Federico Salas called on Mendoza to submit
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very serious charge, but it's clear the congressman who
made it will have to show proof,'' Salas said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting between government and opposition representatives was
suspended soon after Mendoza made his allegation. The talks are
aimed at repairing Peru's damaged democracy and are being held
under the auspices of the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Latorre, the OAS' permanent secretary in Peru, who was
at the talks, downplayed Mendoza's charge, saying it had been
mentioned in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Fernando Olivera said there had been a
''unanimous reaction'' to Mendoza's charge by both sides to ''close
ranks and ''reject any kind of coup attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who fled the country for Panama on Sunday amid a
corruption scandal, hand-picked the top commanders of the army, who
are believed to be loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who ruled for a decade, announced Sept. 16 that he
would call new elections in which he would not be a candidate. He
said he would relinquish power to a new government on July 28,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was prompted by a corruption scandal surrounding
Montesinos, who was caught on videotape apparently bribing an
opposition congressman to defect to Fujimori's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 lawmakers from Fujimori's Peru 2000 political
alliance have abandoned the party since the scandal broke,
including Mendoza. As of Wednesday, Fujimori's legislative bloc
held only 54 seats in the 120-member Congress, eliminating the
control he maintained during the last eight years of his 10-year
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Moises Wolfenson, one of the lawmakers who quit Peru
2000 on Monday, said his decision was not influenced by any outside
forces. ''There was no type of pressure, as (Mendoza) has
alleged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori lost the congressional majority at the polls in April,
but regained it before he swore his oath to a third five-year term
two months ago, amid accusations that Montesinos had used bribes
and coercion to gain support from opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo on Wednesday
called on Congress to oust Fujimori and install a transitional
government ahead of new elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''To wait until July 2001 to have a new president is a costly
agony that Peru cannot afford,'' said Toledo, who boycotted a
presidential runoff against Fujimori in May because he said it was
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prosecutor Nina Rodriguez said Tuesday she had moved
to quash a criminal investigation of Montesinos, a shadowy figure
whose spy network has long been accused of human rights abuses and
forcefully bending Peru's democratic institutions to Fujimori's
will.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a provisional appointee widely viewed as acting under
Montesinos' orders, argued that Montesinos was simply a
presidential adviser with no official title, and could not be
charged with official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos was the de-facto head of the National Intelligence
Service but did not hold an official appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation was conducted in a proper manner, without
any outside pressure,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' request for political asylum in Panama has been
supported by the Organization for American States and the Clinton
administration, which views his exile as necessary for Peru to
repair its shaky democracy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Gen. Peter Pace, who was recently appointed commander of
U.S. military operations in Latin America, met Tuesday with
Fujimori, as well as Peru's defense minister and the commander of
Peru's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Pace made the visit to express the
''continued support of the United States for democratic efforts in
Peru,'' and that it was part of a routine tour of the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S., North Korea Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By KARINE G. BARZEGAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States and North Korea opened a new
round of talks Wednesday aimed at ending a stalemate over the
communist state's development and export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which are expected to last a few days, also will deal
with U.S. allegations that North Korea sponsors terrorism and with
the terms of an accord that froze North Korea's nuclear weapons
program in exchange for two civilian reactors and supplies of
energy, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Charles Kartman, said
after nearly nine hours of talks Wednesday evening that he and Vice
Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, who heads the North Korean
delegation, would return to the U.S. mission to the United Nations
on Thursday morning for another session.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a ''good atmosphere'' in the discussions and
that during a working lunch at a nearby restaurant, the two sides
talked about the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We congratulated each other on the performance of our teams,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is believed to be capable of targeting virtually all
of Japan as well as other Asian countries with its missiles. A
potential long-range missile threat has been cited by the Clinton
administration as one reason for considering a U.S. missile defense
program -- a decision President Bill Clinton has deferred to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   The talks come amid slowly improving U.S.-North Korean relations
following attempts at reconciliation between North and South Korea.
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and the North's reclusive
leader, Kim Jong Il, held a summit meeting in June and there are
plans for another one.
</P>
<P>
   The previous round of missile talks ended in July with North
Korea insisting its program was a sovereign exercise in
self-defense, but also with indications from cash-strapped
Pyongyang that it might curb the program in exchange for payments
of about $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains that North Korea shouldn't be
compensated for stopping a program it shouldn't be developing in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Wednesday, the U.S.-led U.N. Command
has given South Korea the right to negotiate with North Korea to
reconnect a cross-border rail line, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The command controls all activities within the southern half of
the 2 1/2-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, which has separated the
capitalist South from the communist North since the 1950-53 Korean
War. It remains the most heavily fortified border in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, South Korea broke ground for reconnecting a rail line
across the DMZ as part of agreements reached during the first
summit between the two Koreas in June.
</P>
<P>
   That project will entail the removal of up to 100,000 mines
planted in the area of the rail corridor -- and coordination between
the two Korean armies operating in the potentially volatile DMZ.

Gore Offers To Pull 'Soft Money' Ads
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore offered today to pull the plug on all presidential
campaign radio and TV ads paid for by political parties with unregulated ''soft
money'' -- but only if George W. Bush does likewise. Bush had signaled his
reluctance to do so just a day earlier, saying he wanted to get rid of such ads
but that Gore couldn't be counted on to abide by such a deal. ''I don't trust
him, to be frank with you,'' the Texas governor said.

Drug Industry Gave $800,000 to GOP

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pharmaceutical industry gave more than $800,000 to
Republican Party committees last month after the Senate voted to allow reimports
of lower-priced U.S.-made drugs -- something the companies oppose. In addition,
the president of Bristol-Myers Squibb co-chaired a fund-raising dinner today for
Senate Republicans. But despite the intensive lobbying effort, Congress is
likely to pass the legislation. The pharmaceutical industry also is fighting a
Democratic proposal to expand Medicare, the health care program for the elderly,
to cover the cost of prescription drugs.

received a lethal injection for raping Stephanie Flanary and bludgeoning her

completed in August again linked McGinn to the 1993 crime. The McGinn case drew

many tech stocks were down -- as shares of Dell fell to a 52-week low midday on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock recovered somewhat to end regular trading at
$32.44, down $1.19, or 3.6 percent. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell said it was

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Down to Three Guys  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seattle beauty queen Jamie got the boot from
''Big Brother'' Wednesday, leaving three guys to run the house
until Friday's finale of the CBS reality series.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is cool!'' Curtis crowed after Jamie was ousted by a
phone-in viewer poll. ''We're making it to the last day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough guy Eddie, a college student; easygoing law clerk Curtis;
and hunky Josh, also a student, are all that remains of the 10
original contestants -- five men and five women -- who moved into
CBS's microphone-and-camera-filled house on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   One will leave during Friday's finale with the $500,000 grand
prize. That choice, too, will be made by a phone poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, wow, it's been tense all day,'' Jamie told ''Big Brother''
host Julie Chen during the traditional post-eviction interview.
</P>
<P>
   Chen asked her why, with three attractive guys in close range,
were there ''no sparks''?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very, very single at the moment,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   A six-nights-a-week series since July 5, ''Big Brother'' has
played peeping Tom on the shrinking population sequestered in the
house near Los Angeles. Viewers have followed -- and played a role
in -- the elimination process leading up to Friday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   But the audience hasn't been what CBS had hoped for with ''Big
Brother,'' thanks to its general lack of sparks -- romantic,
dramatic or otherwise.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Milosevic Opponents Rally  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- More than 200,000 joyful opponents
of Slobodan Milosevic swarmed the capital's downtown district
Wednesday, supporting an opposition claim of an electoral triumph
over the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, government early Thursday released final official
figures showing that the opposition failed to win enough votes for
first round victory in last weekend's election, prompting the
opposition to threaten to increase the pressure against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest demonstration ever against Milosevic completely
blocked Belgrade's main streets around Republic Square. Much of the
downtown area teemed with people waving flags and chanting: ''He's
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, thousands
streamed into city streets, celebrating what they say was the
opposition's stunning triumph in Sunday's presidential and
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The final voting figures from Sunday's balloting showed that
opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica finished first with 46.4
percent of the 5.5 million votes to Milosevic's 38.6 percent,
thereby forcing an Oct. 8 runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition as well as President Clinton and other Western
leaders had earlier rejected a runoff, saying Kostunica had won
more than the required 50 percent of votes cast to win outright.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, distributed by the state news agency Tanjug,
said Kostunica had fallen short of the required majority. The
opposition, using figures from its poll watchers, claimed Kostunica
won 52.5 percent to Milosevic's 32 percent -- enough for a
first-round victory in the five-candidate field.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the government announcement, Kostunica told the crowd
there will be no runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we bargained with them, then we would recognize the lie
instead of the truth,'' Kostunica said. ''If we bargain, we would
recognize that the will of one man, Slobodan Milosevic, was
stronger than the will of the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   There was quick protest from the opposition to the final voting
figures with campaign manager Zoran Djindjic saying protests would
go beyond daily marches, which in the past have failed to remove
the Milosevic government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will call for a total blockade of the system and
institutions,'' Djindjic told Index radio early Thursday without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   And opposition member of the electoral commission, Sinisa
Nikolic, said the head of the body simply presented delegates with
figures late Wednesday without allowing them to inspect the
returns.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Wednesday, former Prime Minister Milan Panic
urged Russia, Yugoslavia's traditional ally, to offer Milosevic
exile in order to spare the country from civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise, conflict is almost inevitable,'' said Panic, who
was defeated by Milosevic for the Serbian presidency in December
1992.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflict, Panic suggested Russian President Vladimir
Putin send a plane to Belgrade ''to take Milosevic and his clique
out.''
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's protest, demonstrators threw firecrackers and
flares, and waved thousands of banners reading ''He's done with,''
referring to Milosevic's apparent stunning defeat in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the square, a note displayed on a digital clock
read ''Slobo, where is your courage now?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic is a strongman left without his strength,'' said
Kostunica, calling on the police and the army ''not to defend
Milosevic's family, but the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge crowd also marched past the Federal Parliament
building, booing and jeering at state electoral officials meeting
inside. The state election commission is to issue final, official
results Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Such a large opposition turnout -- despite fears of clashes with
police -- indicates Milosevic's attempt to intimidate his opponents
may fail.
</P>
<P>
   The victorious atmosphere in Belgrade also suggested the
pro-democracy Serbs no longer fear Milosevic's autocratic
government, sensing he may not be able to hold on much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders backed the opposition's claim of victory. In
Washington, Clinton dismissed the runoff, saying, ''it certainly
appears from a distance that they had a free election, and
somebody's trying to take it away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's official election commission has no
credibility whatever,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, however, warned Western countries not to interfere in
Yugoslavia. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow ''stands
firmly for the peoples of Yugoslavia to have full freedom to
express their will without internal or external pressure'' and
urged other countries ''not to allow destabilization of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richard Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the
United Nations, said his country will move to lift sanctions
against Yugoslavia and restore its rights as a U.N. member state
once the democratically elected challenger to Milosevic is
installed in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the winds of change blow true, a government in Belgrade
committed to respecting the will of its people will take its
rightful place in the international community,'' Holbrooke told the
Security Council Wednesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Belgrade rally, Yugoslavia's foreign minister
tried to discourage protests, appearing on state television and
alleging other nations were meddling in Yugoslav affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Zivadin Jovanovic said pressure was being applied through
foreign media and independent news organizations at home, which he
said were trying to present a distorted picture of the country in
service of Western enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Unmoved, the protesters shook baby rattles to show Milosevic's
regime was broken and couldn't be fixed -- playing on a Serbian
expression ''broken like a baby's rattle'' to describe something
that's beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can feel a lot of happiness in the air,'' psychologist Zarko
Trebjesanin said of the mood in Belgrade. ''The genie of freedom
and democracy has escaped from the bottle and it's impossible to

</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, trying not to do anything that might give
Milosevic a reason to crack down, did not contest a police order to
move the rally from the initial venue -- a platform in front of
Yugoslavia's federal assembly -- after authorities said it would
disturb work of the state election commission.

<HEADLINE> Gambino Family, Associates Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Nine alleged members and associates
of a New York crime family have been indicted on federal charges,
including involvement in a stripper's murder and plotting the death
of her accused killer.
</P>
<P>
   All nine men, including the alleged head of the Gambino family's
Florida operations, are charged with racketeering, U.S. Attorney
Guy A. Lewis announced Wednesday. Some are also charged with
loansharking, counterfeiting checks and being accessories to
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''This indictment should send a message to organized criminals
who are targeting South Florida that they will be prosecuted and
punished,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony ''Tony Pep'' Trentacosta, 61, who prosecutors say has
run the family's Florida operations since March 1999, is charged
only with racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, a Sunny Isle restaurant owned by
Frederick J. Massaro, 60, was used as a front to procure
information for counterfeiting checks, sell stolen merchandise,
conduct loansharking and plot the March 1999 slaying of 22-year-old
Jeanette Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The man accused of killing Smith, Ariel A. Hernandez, 35, is
jailed facing first-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Massaro knew about the plan to kill Smith and
solicited Carlos Garcia, 33, to kill Hernandez the week Smith's
body was found in the Everglades. Police arrested Hernandez before
the hit could be carried out, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis wouldn't discuss possible motives for either case.
</P>
<P>
   Massaro's attorney, Fred Haddad, told The Miami Herald his
client intends to fight the charges against him: murder, conspiracy
to murder, racketeering, bank fraud, loansharking, theft and
illegal possession of firearms. Prosecutors didn't know who was
representing Trentacosta and Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested Tuesday on racketeering and other charges were
Julius B. Chiusano, 52, charged with bank fraud and counterfeiting
checks; Charles P. Monico, 43, and Anthony R. Banks, 27, both
charged with helping dump Smith's body; and Francis ''Little
Frankie'' Ruggiero, 62, charged with loansharking.
</P>
<P>
   Police were searching for Garcia, charged with conspiracy to
commit murder and loansharking, and Adam T. Silverman, 33, who is
charged with loansharking and helping dispose of Smith's body.
</P>
<P>
   Chiusano's attorney, Don Spadero, said he had not spoken to his
client in detail about the charges but said the counterfeit checks
his client allegedly helped pass totaled less than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Public defenders and attorneys representing the other men could
not be immediately reached.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 6, Expos 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A.J. Burnett hit an RBI triple to spark a four-run
fifth-inning and also pitched 6 2-3 strong innings to lead the
Florida Marlins to a 6-3 win over the Montreal Expos on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett (3-7) allowed two runs -- one earned -- three hits and
five walks to help Florida win for the fourth time in five games.
He also struck out seven as Montreal lost its fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at 1 in the fifth, Sandy Martinez doubled off the wall in
right-center for Florida. Burnett worked the count full against
Tony Armas (7-9) before burning the Expos' drawn-in outfield with a
drive to left-center for his first career triple. Burnett is
batting .280 (7-of-25).
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo then singled in Burnett to make it 3-1. Mark
Kotsay walked and Cliff Floyd greeted reliever Julio Santana with
an RBI single. Mike Lowell followed with a run-scoring infield
single to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Armas allowed five runs, four hits and four walks in 4 1/3
innings, snapping his three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his major league-leading
43rd save in 47 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins tied it at 1 without a hit in the fourth. Castillo
walked, stole second and advanced to third on a groundout before
scoring on Floyd's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barrett's double set up Montreal's run in the third
inning. Burnett walked three batters in the inning, including
Wilton Guerrero to force in a run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Expos' LF Andy Tracy struck out to end the first inning and
then was pulled for Wilton Guerrero because he sustained a
hyperextended right elbow. X-rays were negative and he's day to
day. ... Florida Talmadge Nunnari's pinch-hit single was his first
major league hit in his third at-bat. He scored on Peter Bergeron's
double and error by right fielder Andy Fox. ... Armas struck out
the first four batters and had six after three innings. ... Kotsay
hit his team-leading fifth triple in the seventh and scored on
Lowell's sacrifice fly to make it 6-2. ... Preston Wilson who was
scratched from the lineup to avoid breaking a major league record
for strikeouts in a season, came into the game as a defensive
replacement in the eighth inning. His 185 Ks are four shy of Bobby
Bonds' record.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 10, Reds 6  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Scott Sullivan's wild pitch allowed the
go-ahead run to score in the seventh as the Milwaukee Brewers beat
the Cincinnati Reds 10-6 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The last night game in Milwaukee County Stadium history was
followed by a fireworks show. The teams close out the venerable
stadium's 48-year run with a sold-out afternoon game Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With Marquis Grissom at the plate and Luis Lopez on third with
two outs in the seventh, Sullivan uncorked the Reds' 94th wild
pitch of the season, tying a major league record set by the Texas
Rangers in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   That capped the Brewers' three-run rally that erased a 4-2
deficit and made a winner of Valerio De Los Santos (2-3) and a
loser of John Riedling (3-1), who faced three batters, allowing two
hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers added five runs in the eighth, when Raul Casanova
hit a grand slam off Danny Graves.
</P>
<P>
   The game pitted two promising rookie starters who combined for
no walks, 13 strikeouts and plenty of long balls.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bell allowed just four hits -- but three solo home runs -- in
six-plus innings for Cincinnati. Paul Rigdon surrendered three runs
on seven hits in six innings. He gave up two home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker led off the game with his 14th homer and Juan
Castro's two-run shot, his third, made it 3-0 Cincinnati in the
second inning. Rigdon's first career homer, a 410-foot shot in the
third, made it 3-1, and Grissom's 14th homer cut it to 3-2 in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz lost Chris Sexton's two-out flyball
in the lights and it struck the right fielder in the right leg,
allowing Jason LaRue to score from second and make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Richie Sexson's 30th homer of the year, his 14th with the
Brewers, made it 4-3 in the seventh and chased Bell. Riedling
surrendered Casanova's game-tying RBI single before Sullivan's wild
pitch gave the Brewers a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez added an RBI single off Graves in the eighth
before Casanova's second career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bell hit a two-run shot, his second homer of the season,
off Curtis Leskanic in the ninth to cap the scoring.
</P>
<P>
Notes: LaRue had his first career three-hit game for Cincinnati.
... Cincinnati's Jack McKeon managed his 1,500th game. ... In the
fifth inning, Hank Aaron flipped a placard in the upper deck that
showed the number 1, signifying just one day left for the old
ballpark. ... The Reds have not been shut out in any of their 158
games so far, tied for the second-longest stretch to begin a
season.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Linebacker May Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Eleven months ago Sunday, Brian Williams'
1999 season ended when he tore a knee tendon while making a tackle
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Two surgeries and a lot of rehabilitation later, the Green Bay
Packers' top linebacker is expected to return to the field when the
Packers play the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Sherman said it's not known how much playing time
Williams will get.
</P>
<P>
   One determining factor will be the way the knee responds to the
full day of practice he had Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got a pretty good load of work,'' defensive coordinator Ed
Donatell said. ''He looked fine. I'm getting excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' replacement, Nate Wayne, has performed well through
four games. After making 16 tackles in the opener against the New
York Jets, Wayne is second on the Packers with 34 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne, however, suffered a hip pointer against the Cardinals and
didn't practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He might be limited Sunday, which could increase Williams'
playing time, although the Packers don't want to force Williams
into more playing time than he's ready for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nate Wayne's done a fine job for us,'' Sherman said. ''There
is no need for us to rush Brian back. He will play in this ball
game, but to what capacity remains to be seen.''

Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Berezin scored twice for Toronto (3-4).

	   WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) - Freshman forward Kirk Johnson's
unassisted goal in the 104th minute of play gave the Syracuse men's
soccer team a 2-1 victory over Army Wednesday, snapping the
Orangemen's four-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse is now 3-3-2 overall and 1-2-2- in the Big East. Army
drops to 3-5-1 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also had a hand in the Orangemen's first goal of the
night. Senior midfielder Mario Cristofori put Johnson's crossing
pass into the lower left corner of the goal to give Syracuse a 1-0
lead in the 22nd minute. It was Cristofori's first goal of the
season. Johnson now has four points over the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Army tied the game in the second half on a penalty kick by
Thomas Obaseki. It was the first penalty kick given up by the
Orangemen this season.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse outshot Army, 17-5. Senior goalkeeper Kevin Bacher
needed only two saves to complete the victory. Kevin Larrabee made
13 saves for the Cadets.

<HEADLINE> Blast at Office of Indonesian Group  </HEADLINE>
By ALI KOTARUMALOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A bomb exploded outside the office of
a prominent Indonesian human rights group Wednesday, just hours
before the corruption trial of former president Suharto was set to
resume.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries in the bombing, the latest in series of
blasts in Jakarta. Damage was minimal, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred late Wednesday in front of Kontras, an
organization that investigates cases of kidnappings and violence by
Indonesia's security forces.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a series of deadly blasts in Jakarta recently,
including a Sept. 13 explosion at the Jakarta Stock Exchange that
killed 15 people and another outside the Philippine ambassador's
home on Aug. 1 that killed two.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the blasts coincided with advances in the corruption
case against Suharto, leading to speculation that they were the
work of his supporters and elements of the security forces opposed
to President Abdurrahman Wahid's democratic reforms. At least 30
suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Suharto, ousted from office in 1998 amid
pro-democracy protests, have denied any involvement in the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned Anteve television said a group calling itself
the ''Anti-Communist Movement'' had accepted responsibility for
Wednesday's explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Munir, the chairman of Kontras, said his office had received
several anonymous bomb threats recently. Like many Indonesians he
uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, is accused of siphoning off at least $583 million
in state funds to bankroll businesses controlled by his cronies and
children.
</P>
<P>
   The former dictator has denied any wrongdoing and has failed to
appear at the trial on the grounds of failing health. His lawyers
say he is frail after three stokes and cannot face the rigors of a
long court case.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, on a trip to Caracas, Venezuela, said Wednesday that
police should allow students protesting outside Suharto's house to
vandalize it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most they can do is throw stones at the windows. Leave
them be, I mean, Suharto was very corrupt, wasn't he?'' Wahid said,
according to the state Antara news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prosecutors considered whether to arrest Suharto's
youngest son, following a ruling by Indonesia's Supreme Court
sentencing him to 18 months in prison on corruption charges,
judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Hutomo ''Tommy'' Mandala Putra said they have not
yet decided whether to appeal the decision, which reversed a lower
court acquittal in October, or ask the president for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy, 37, was charged in a multimillion-dollar property deal
with the state's main food supply agency in 1997. Prosecutors said
it enriched him but cost the government $10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy was also ordered to pay the equivalent of $3.5 million in
compensation and fines.

<HEADLINE> Ex-KLA Chief Warns Yugoslav Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Any attempts by Yugoslav leaders to
return police or military units to Kosovo would ''bring another
war'' that could trap NATO-led forces in the middle, the former
Kosovo Liberation Army political chief warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly sharp comments by Hashim Thaci are part of
efforts to tap into pro-independence sentiments and memories of the
KLA's struggle against Serb forces before Oct. 28 municipal
elections. Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo is particularly
critical of the more moderate positions of ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci made it clear there would be no compromise on permitting
Yugoslav security forces back in Kosovo. Such a move has been
suggested by opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica in the campaign
to unseat Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they attempt to bring back the Serb army and police to
Kosovo ... that would re-ignite the conflict in Kosovo and bring
another war,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Such a showdown would place NATO-led peacekeepers in the very
difficult position of tolerating their former Serb foes -- the Serbs
could only come back if allowed to do so by Kosovo's U.N.
administrators -- while trying to quell the KLA rebels they had
supported.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations mandate to run Kosovo allows for a limited
force of Yugoslav troops and police to return and assist
peacekeepers in guarding borders, churches and historical
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kosovo has its own political tensions -- violence
linked to next month's municipal elections has escalated, including
arson attacks on political offices.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Rugova supporters flocked to Pristina's sports
stadium Wednesday to hear him speak in his first pre-election rally
since the campaigning period began two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, ''stands strongly
behind the realization of the independence of Kosovo,'' Rugova told
a wildly cheering crowd. Teenagers hung out of car windows with
horns blaring, waving black and red Albanian flags racing along the
main roads of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is still officially part of Yugoslavia, although it is
run by the United Nations and NATO-led peacekeepers. Yugoslav
forces pulled out of the province last year.

Drug Industry Gave $800,000 to GOP

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pharmaceutical industry gave more than $800,000 to

of lower-priced U.S.-made drugs -- something the companies oppose. In addition,
the president of Bristol-Myers Squibb co-chaired a fund-raising dinner today for
Senate Republicans. But despite the intensive lobbying effort, Congress is
likely to pass the legislation. The pharmaceutical industry also is fighting a

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln plans to sit down
with manager Lou Piniella and All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez
after the season to talk about their futures in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is in his last year of his contract and Rodriguez is
eligible for free agency after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to sit down with Lou after the season,'' Lincoln

''We'll do the same thing with Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied a report in the Toronto Globe this week that said
sources close to Mariners general manager Pat Gillick and Boston
manager Jimy Williams already have an informal agreement that
Williams will be named Seattle's manager after the World Series.

<P>
   ''That story is total nonsense. It has no basis,'' Lincoln said.
''It really does everyone a disservice. Besides, Jimy Williams is
under contract in Boston and we're not in the tampering business.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella, 57, is in his eighth year in Seattle. He reportedly is
earning $1.3 million to manage the Mariners this season.
</P>
<P>
   Under Piniella, the Mariners are trying to win their third AL
West title. Piniella managed Cincinnati to a World Series title in
1990, and managed Seattle to division crowns 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella has hired an agent and said he doesn't want to think
about his future until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to sit down with Lou and have a glass of wine and
see what we're going to do,'' said Lincoln, who said Gillick and
team president Chuck Armstrong also will be at the meeting. ''I
think he's comfortable with that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lou's done a tremendous job this season,'' Lincoln said.
''He's done a great job of managing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners promised Rodriguez, 25, a four-time All-Star and
the first player taken in the 1993 June draft, that they would not
talk contract during the season. Lincoln said in spring training
that the team, if it was in contention, would not trade Rodriguez
this season although there was the risk of losing him as a free
agent at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll talk to Alex and see where it goes from there,'' Lincoln
said. ''I feel good about our decision in spring training. We felt
the best way to keep Alex was to have a winning team and we've had
a winning team. We'll see where it goes from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has lost two franchise players in the past three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners traded Ken Griffey Jr. to Cincinnati in February
because Griffey said he wanted to go to the Reds. He was headed
into the final year of his contract in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners traded Randy Johnson to Houston July 31, 1998,
rather than risk losing him as a free agent at the end of the
season.

By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago's Cal Eldred didn't stay past the fourth
inning Wednesday night. But with a surgically implanted screw near
his right elbow, he did show he can still pitch in the major
leagues and be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred didn't figure in the decision as the Boston Red Sox --
eliminated from the wild card race earlier in the day by Oakland's
9-7 victory over Anaheim -- sent the AL Central champion White Sox
to their fourth straight loss 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night for the White Sox to hold tryouts for injured
hurlers Eldred and James Baldwin to see if they might be able to
rejoin the rotation for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred threw 49 pitches over 3 1-3 innings, reaching the low 90s
mph in velocity and giving up two hits and a run on Nomar
Garciaparra's 21st homer.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin (14-6), bothered by shoulder tendinitis, went four
innings in relief, giving up an unearned, go-ahead run in the fifth
and four hits. They both could pitch again this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton Crawford (2-1) allowed just four hits and a run in six
innings to pick up the victory. Derek Lowe got his 40th save in 45
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred had a five-inch stainless steel screw surgically
implanted Sept. 7 to stabilize a stress fracture in his elbow. He
hadn't pitched for the White Sox since July 14 when he had to leave
a game against St. Louis in the fifth inning because of pain in the
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who had elbow ligament replacement surgery in 1995,
helped the White Sox jump out quickly this season by winning 10
games, including eight straight decisions before he was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred was told if he didn't have the surgery, the stress
fracture would return next year -- he's had it three straight
seasons -- or he could retire.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to get a chance to pitch in the postseason for the
first time, his recovery has been swift.
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering Garciaparra's homer, Eldred was taken out and
got a rousing ovation from another small crowd of just 16,368 at
Comiskey Park. He walked one and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, who hasn't pitched since Sept. 8, gave up an unearned
run in the fifth on Mike Lansing's single, a sacrifice, a passed
ball on Charles Johnson and sacrifice fly by Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who've already wrapped up home field advantage
for the playoffs, scored in the first on Chris Singleton's single,
stolen base and RBI single by Carlos Lee.
Notes: Red Sox CF Carl Everett is probably done for the season
after hurting a tendon near his left ankle Tuesday night. A Red Sox
spokesman said Everett may have an MRI. ... Chicago manager Jerry
Manuel is growing a beard until the end of the season. ''That's a
way of getting people to leave me alone. Maybe they'll say, 'Hey he
looks pretty mean wth that beard,''' Manuel joked. ... Red Sox IF
Manny Alexander went back to Boston for tests after hurting his
right knee while stretching Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Fired employee pleads guilty to killing boss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A fired employee admitted his guilt
Wednesday in the bludgeoning and stabbing death of his boss at an
electrical supply store.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Owes, 33, pleaded guilty to first-degree and
second-degree murder in return for life imprisonment without
possible of parole. Sentencing was set for Oct. 11 in Monroe County
Court.
</P>
<P>
   If Owes had been convicted at trial, he could have drawn a death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Owes has apparently been hiding in the loft of Maynard's
Electricap Supply Inc. in a commercial strip near the suburb of
Irondequoit. overnight, waiting to confront his boss. But the first
person to show up for work Feb. 21 was office manager Janet Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, 53, was battered repeatedly around the head and body with
a blunt instrument and then stabbed multiple times in the torso and
throat with an unidentified edged weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Owes hiding in the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Owes previously had served time for unlawful imprisonment and
criminal trespass and was placed on five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who was married, had worked at Maynard's for about 20
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Kerry Wood closed his comeback season with eight
scoreless innings, striking out 10 Wednesday night to lead the
Chicago Cubs over the Philadelphia Phillies 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa singled home Wood for his 137th RBI as the Cubs won
for only the sixth time in their last 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   Wood (8-7), who missed all of last season following elbow
surgery, gave up eight hits and two walks in eight innings. He
threw 125 pitches, the most in any of his 23 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 NL Rookie of the Year ended with a 4.80 ERA, totaling
132 strikeouts in 137 innings. In his previous start Sept. 22
against St. Louis, Wood walked eight in only 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Lee, who entered the game hitless in six at-bats against
Wood with five strikeouts, had four hits off the right-hander,
including a pair of doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Worrell pitched the ninth for his third save in six chances.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, Randy Wolf (11-9) finished as the Phillies'
leader in wins. He gave up one run on six hits and three walks over
seven innings, striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is the first Phillies left-handed pitcher to reach 200
innings in a season since Danny Jackson threw 210 in 1993, totaling
206 1-3 innings in 32 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Phillies' eighth in their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Wood singled to lead off the Cubs third and reached second on
Eric Young's single. One out later, Sosa singled.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs left fielder Gary Matthews Jr. made a run-saving catch to
end the Phillies seventh and strand runners at first and second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wood had two double-digit strikeout games this year. He has
11 in his career. ... Wood is 13-3 in 23 career starts at Wrigley
Field. ... Phillies 3B Scott Rolen did not play because of a
nagging back injury. 2B Marlon Anderson was a late scratch because
of a sore hamstring. Both were day-to-day. ... The Cubs, who close
the home portion of their schedule Thursday with a day game, went
11-6 in night games at Wrigley Field.

<HEADLINE> Minister Talks About Freeman's Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Cathy Freeman's gold-medal run in the
Olympics will not pressure the federal government to apologize to
the ''stolen generation'' of Aborigines, a cabinet minister said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, whose grandmother was removed from her family as a
child, has criticized the government's refusal to say sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Freeman's heightened Olympic profile, including a
win the women's 400 meters, would increase pressure on the
government, Reconciliation Minister Philip Ruddock told Australian
Broadcasting Corp., radio: ''I don't think it changes the issues at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the point I would make is that Cathy is a great example to
other young people about what can be done, what can be achieved,
and is an outstanding role model for all Australians, but
particularly for indigenous Australians.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1910 until the 1970s, authorities placed about 100,000
Aboriginal children in the care of white families. State and
federal law declared it was humane to save children of a doomed
race.
</P>
<P>
   Ruddock said Freeman's run showed Australia was an inclusive
society in which all are able to participate fully.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's regrettable that in the past that's not always been
possible for indigenous Australians,'' he said. ''What we have been
seeking to do is to have through the reconciliation process a
unifying approach to Australia in which Aboriginal self-esteem is
lifted, that there are role models that people can follow, and I
think Cathy Freeman exemplifies all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Aborigines say it is not possible to achieve reconciliation
until conservative Prime Minister John Howard offers a formal
apology for past government injustices -- something he has refused
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's original inhabitants, Aborigines number about
360,000 of a total population of 19 million people. After 212 years
of white settlement, Aborigines have a life expectancy 20 years
shorter than the rest of society and are the community's poorest,
least educated and most jailed people.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Billed for Bid Execs' Lawyers  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee stopped
payments to defense lawyers for two indicted bid executives after
covering $542,070 of the $762,635 in fees.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, released Wednesday to The Associated Press,
underscore a dispute over SLOC's obligation to pay to defend Tom
Welch and Dave Johnson from criminal bribery charges. Organizers
suspended payments after the bid leaders were indicted in July.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC president Mitt Romney has offered to resume the payments if
Welch and Johnson renounce any legal claims against organizers for
past compensation or wrongful termination.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have refused, with Welch saying he was owed $1 million
in deferred compensation. Both men insist SLOC must cover their
defense costs under a liability policy.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute remained under negotiation Wednesday, when SLOC
disclosed it paid $542,070 to Welch lawyers Tom Schaffer and
William Taylor and Johnson lawyer Max Wheeler, and had accumulated
another $220,565 in unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor replaced Schaffer after the bid leaders were indicted.
Wheeler has represented Johnson since the Olympic scandal broke 22
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The costs are only a small part of SLOC's scandal-related legal
costs. The total, by Romney's count, exceeds $4.2 million,
including more than $2 million spent on a string of lawyers for
Welch and Johnson, the committee, other Olympic trustees and
officers. The lawyers were hired in December 1998 when U.S. Justice
Department attorneys began interviewing witnesses and issuing
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Romney has said SLOC doesn't have to pay for Welch and Johnson's
attorneys if the two men are found guilty by a jury of criminal
wrongdoing. He also maintains organizers can wait until after a
trial to determine whether they have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, 55, who was president of the Salt Lake bid committee, and
Johnson, 41, vice president, were indicted July 20 by a federal
grand jury on charges that $1 million in cash, gifts, scholarships
and other inducements were given to International Olympic Committee
members who in 1995 awarded Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Isler Claims Women's 470 Silver  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- J.J. Isler of San Diego rode Sydney
Harbor's shifting wind to a dramatic comeback on the final leg to
claim the women's 470 Olympic silver medal behind a dominating
Australian boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 10th place and out of the medals at the top mark, Isler
sailed close to Bradley's Head and passed four boats on the
spinnaker run to the finish, with the Sydney Opera House and Harbor
Bridge in the distance Thursday (Wednesday night EDT). She finished
sixth, enough to beat Ukraine by one point for the silver.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian crew of Jenny Armstrong and Belinda Stowell ran
away with the race and handily won the gold, the country's first in
sailing since 1972. Passing ferries and spectator boats blasted
their horns to salute the winners.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second Olympic medal for Isler, 36, who took the 470
bronze in 1992. Her crewmember, Pease Glaser, 38, of Long Beach,
Calif., was in her first Olympics and matched the silver medal won
by her husband, Jay, in the Tornado Class in 1984. Glaser had tried
and failed to make the Olympic team three previous times.
</P>
<P>
   Isler and Glaser were unsure of their chances coming into the
games, because they lost training time after Isler became pregnant
with her second daughter. But they also figured that their
experience would be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second American sailing medal in these games,
matching the total of 1996 when the United States underperformed in
its home waters.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee won the 49er bronze medal
here.
</P>
<P>
   Isler was in good position sailing upwind on the first leg, but
got into bad air coming off other boats' sails as the boats
approached the mark. She never recovered until the final leg.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding races had been scheduled for Wednesday, but the
wind died to practically nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a more typical Sydney Harbor day, with a stiff
nor'easter blowing between 15 and 17 knots.
</P>
<P>
   The men's 470 race was started after the women's race finished.
Paul Foerster of Rockwall, Texas, and crewman Bob Merrick of
Portsmouth, R.I., were in second place coming in, behind the
Australian crew. Foerster was the Flying Dutchman silver medalist
in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Manager Bothered by Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets manager Bobby Valentine said some people in
New York don't appreciate the accomplishments of his team, which
advanced to the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mets beat Atlanta 6-2 Wednesday to clinch their
second straight wild card berth, Valentine contrasted the attitude
of New York toward the Mets with the way St. Louis treats the
Cardinals, who won the NL Central for the first time since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''In their city, they're supposed to feel like kings,'' he said.
''In our city, people feel we should run and hide and be
embarrassed to enter the playoffs. I don't get it and neither do my
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   After obtaining Mike Hampton during the offseason, some
predicted the Mets finally would dethrone Atlanta and win the NL
East. But the Braves clinched their ninth consecutive division
title when they beat the Mets 7-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York led the NL East on Sept. 1 but started the month 7-13,
falling behind the Braves. Some columnists have been critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a couple clowns in our market, where if I win the
World Series, they're going to say that I didn't sweep,'' he was
quoted as saying in the Oct. 2 edition of New York magazine, on
newsstands this week. ''And if we sweep, they'll figure out a
reason why we didn't shut everyone out. It's petty, ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has had to deal with comparisons to the New York
Yankees, who have won consecutive World Series and three of the
last four titles. The Mets haven't won their division since 1988
and nearly missed the playoffs last year, making it only when they
beat Cincinnati in a tiebreaker for the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he felt relieved his team had clinched and didn't
care whether San Francisco or St. Louis was the Mets' first-round
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather step right over into the American League. Can I
pick the American League team?'' he said. ''I have no preference.
Everybody wants to play us. I'll let them fight over it.''
</P>
<P>
   He even joked about his lame-duck status as he waited for Mets
co-owner Fred Wilpon to call after the game. Valentine's contract
runs out after the season and he made no secret he was disappointed
when he didn't get an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, Fred. How many?'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he let everyone in his office in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not there yet,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine picked up the phone again, and this time Wilpon really
was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to go get 'em,'' Valentine said. ''Thanks for
being there all the time, Fred.''

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam Ready To Go After Webb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ALBANY, Ohio (AP) -- Annika Sorenstam can't wait. She gets
her shot at Karrie Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fired up,'' Sorenstam said. ''I don't like being in second
place, and for me to have a chance to beat Karrie, I've got to put
in the time and I've got to play some flawless golf. I really think
I'm on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   The two go at each other beginning Thursday in the New Albany
Golf Classic, the second year of the $1 million tournament. Last
year, Sorenstam won and proceeded to turn around her season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite raw, windy weather, she birdied six of the last nine
holes of her second round, giving her the lead she never lost. She
went on to shoot 19-under-par 269 and won by three strokes over
Mardi Lunn.
</P>
<P>
   It started a streak that has carried over to five victories this
year -- one fewer than Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I came to Columbus and the way I played, that was the
best I'd played in a really long time,'' Sorenstam said. ''I
realized how much I enjoyed playing well. It was so much fun, and I
just wanted to go back to work and grind and play like this all the
time, because I love being in the top spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swede will have to work hard to defeat Webb, whose six wins
include two majors -- the Nabisco Championship and the U.S. Open.
Webb has earned more than $1.6 million, about $500,000 more than
Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've really had a good year,'' Webb said. ''I've played very
consistently and I've been in contention a lot. And that's all I
can ask, just to give myself as many chances as I can and try to
close the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam finished fourth at last weekend's Safeway Golf
Championship in Portland, Ore. Webb skipped the event to attend the
Olympics in her native Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told my husband when we got here that I love this golf
course,'' Sorenstam said. ''It really fits my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are caught up in the Sorenstam-Webb budding rivalry, too.
It's what LPGA fans and players are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're creating a rivalry that the men's tour is starving
for,'' said Meg Mallon, who played at nearby Ohio State. ''They're
the best at being focused of anyone out there. They are the Martina
and Chrissie of women's golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players, including Sorenstam and Mallon, also will be
using New Albany to tune up for next week's Solheim Cup in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Daniel, a captain's pick for the U.S. Solheim Cup team,
said playing conditions could mirror conditions at the Loch Lomond
course in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   New Albany has absorbed more than 3 inches of rain since
Saturday. Temperatures in the 60s are forecast for the rest of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the conditions here are pretty similar to what we
might see over there,'' Daniel said. ''Very wet, not a lot of roll
and a little bit on the chilly side.''

<HEADLINE> Australian Walker Disqualified  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian Jane Saville headed into the
Olympic Stadium tunnel with a huge lead in the 20-kilometer walk,
awaiting the roar of a jubilant hometown crowd. Instead, she left
the tunnel in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Saville was disqualified in the closing seconds of the nearly
90-minute walk, allowing China's Wang Liping to capture the gold
medal. Kjersti Plaetzer of Norway won silver and Maria Vasco of
Spain took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   In other events Thursday (Wednesday night EDT), Chris Huffins
had nearly a 200-point lead after seven events of the decathlon and
all three American women were eliminated in the qualifying round of
the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   Saville already had been given two white warning cards, and knew
a third ''lifting'' infraction -- not maintaining contact with the
ground -- would warrant a red card and automatic disqualification.
The woman walking with her in the final stages of the race,
Elisabetta Perrone of Italy, already had been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   As she headed into the tunnel, a judge suddenly thrust a red
card toward Saville. She threw her arms in the air and looked up in
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'No, No, not me,'' she said. ''He said, 'Yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Saville did not continue walking through the tunnel, but headed
instead to a hill overlooking the stadium. A half-hour later, she
finally entered the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what to do, I was quite embarrassed -- all these
people waiting for me in the stadium,'' she said. ''It's bitterly
disappointing, I thought I was going to win the gold medal in my
hometown. I was thinking this is going to be the most awesome
experience of my life, and it was not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang won in 1 hour, 29 minutes, 5 seconds in the inaugural
20-kilometer walk for women at the Olympics. The event replaced the
10-kilometer walk that was contested at the 1992 and 1996 games.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Rohl was the top American, finishing 17th in 1:34.26.
Chen Yueling, who won the 1992 gold medal in the 10-kilometer walk
while competing for China but won permission last month to compete
for the United States, was 38th. Debbie Lawrence finished 44th.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. decathlete Huffins had 6,401 points to lead after seven
events. Roman Sebrle was 196 points behind. American Tom Pappas was
fifth with 6,124 points and world champion Tomas Dvorak was sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's high jump, Karol Damon, Erin Aldrich and Amy
Acuff all failed to advance to the final.
</P>
<P>
   A night before, the drug taint at the Olympic track became so
suffocating that when an injured Gail Devers dropped out of the
hurdles, one of the first questions she faced was whether her
withdrawal would arouse drug suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would never be a thought that crossed my mind,'' she
responded, having hobbled away from her last realistic medal chance
in an event in which she seems to be cursed.
</P>
<P>
   But, after the news of the past few days, that thought is
crossing many minds. Every time an athlete performs unexpectedly
well, or suddenly pulls out of an event, the rumors of drug use
start swirling.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday began with a women's hammer thrower being escorted off
the field by officials because she had tested positive for drugs
this summer. It ended with a woman once banned for steroid use
winning the hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   And, in between, it featured Marion Jones' return to the track --
in the 200 meters and long jump -- a day after she stood beside
husband C.J. Hunter, who tested positive for steroid use four times
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   With the injured Devers suddenly reduced to the role of
spectator, a hurdler who missed the last Olympics on a drug ban
captured the one medal Devers truly wanted. Devers, a three-time
Olympic gold medalist in sprints, barely missed getting a hurdles
medal in 1992 and 1996 -- and dropped out in the semifinals this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Shishigina of Kazakstan won the 100-meter hurdles in 12.65
seconds. Glory Alozie of Nigeria won the silver and Melissa
Morrison of the United States won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Alozie's fiance was killed when hit by a car in Sydney a few
days before the games opened.
</P>
<P>
   Shishigina missed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics while serving a
two-year drug ban. She was suspended for four years in May 1996 for
testing positive for stanozolol, the same steroid that cost
sprinter Ben Johnson a gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Games. Her ban
later was cut to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Mihaela Melinte of Romania was prevented
from competing in the inaugural Olympic women's hammer throw. The
world record-holder and world champion, Melinte was preparing to
throw when officials told her to leave the field.
</P>
<P>
   Melinte's removal was ordered by the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, because the Romanian athlete tested positive
for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in Milan, Italy, on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time anyone could recall seeing an Olympic
athlete removed from the field because of a drug test result.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone is the same substance that Hunter, the reigning world
champion in the shot put, tested positive for this summer.
</P>
<P>
   American Angelo Taylor won gold in the men's 400-meter hurdles.
Germany's Nils Schumann held off Wilson Kipketer at the finish line
of the 800 meters to win that race. In women's events, Russia's
Irina Privalova won the 400-meter hurdles and Ellina Zvereva of
Belarus won the discus.

<HEADLINE> Colorado's Foote Signs Extension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Adam Foote, one of Colorado's most reliable
defensemen, agreed to a multiyear contract extension with the
Avalanche on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, 29, has spent his entire 10-year career with the
franchise that moved from Quebec in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family loves it here in Colorado,'' Foote said. ''The fun
I've had and the strong seasons we've enjoyed makes this even more
meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote teamed veteran Ray Bourque to form Colorado's top
defensive tandem last season. Foote matched his career-high with
five goals and had 13 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The combination was kept intact when Bourque signed a one-year,
$5.5 million deal during the offseason.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Clubs Guaranteed TV Money  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If there's a strike or lockout following the
2001 season, baseball owners are still guaranteed their money from
the sport's new $2.5 billion, six-year contract with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''The networks have always been willing to finance a work
stoppage on the owners behalf,'' union head Donald Fehr said after
the deal was announced Wednesday. ''That's not anything new or
different.''
</P>
<P>
   If teams continue to split national TV money equally, the new
deal guarantees them about $20 million annually, up from about
$12.7 million this year. As part of their expansion agreements,
Arizona and Tampa Bay receive $5 million a year less than other
teams through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   With a free-agent class upcoming that includes Alex Rodriguez,
Manny Ramirez, Mike Hampton and Mike Mussina, much of that money
will be spent in the upcoming months.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said the increased money will
help baseball's low-revenue teams, but said owners still will want
to make changes to the sport's economic structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm very pleased,'' he said. ''The rest is up to me
to try to take all the revenue and to correct the disparity
problems and the other problems that exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners cite their latest economy study panel, saying the
postseason is dominated by big spenders. The players' association
disputes that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The imbalance that has the Yankees winning less than 90
games?'' Fehr said. ''The one where the White Sox, the Mariners,
the Giants and the A's seem to be winning? That imbalance?
</P>
<P>
   ''Since it is split evenly, obviously that helps to redress the
imbalance to some extent. And they also expect to soon be able to
generate $1 billion per year on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has had eight work stoppages since 1972, and the
current labor contract expires after the 2001 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a strike or lockout that causes Fox to lose games in
2002, baseball would give the network additional games after play
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will work it out,'' Selig said, adding he hopes it won't
come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get protection and we'll continue playing baseball,'' Fox
Sports Television Group chairman David Hill said.

<HEADLINE> Watergate Security Guard Dies at 52  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Frank Wills, the Watergate security guard
who discovered the 1972 break-in that led to President Nixon's
resignation, died Wednesday. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   A University Hospital spokeswoman said Wills had been
hospitalized prior to Wednesday but didn't release a cause of
death. Friends of the family told The Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle that
he suffered a brain tumor and had been ill for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had spent the years since the break-in in relative
obscurity, Wills' discovery on the midnight shift at the
Washington, D.C., hotel-office complex thrust him briefly into the
spotlight. He later played himself in a movie about the scandal,
''All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on June 17, 1972, Wills found a piece of gray tape over a
door latch leading into the Watergate complex. Thinking a shift
worker had put it there to make getting in and out of the building
easier, he simply pulled it off and stuffed in into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   When he later found a second piece of tape over the lock, he
called police.
</P>
<P>
   Wills followed the officers to the Democratic National Committee
offices in the Watergate. Inside, they found five men: James
McCord, Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martinez, Frank Sturgis and
Virgilio Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   The bungled burglary led to discoveries of conspiracy,
obstruction of justice, illegal use of the FBI and CIA and illegal
campaign contributions, all of which ultimately drove Nixon from
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On the 20th anniversary of the break-in, Wills told a reporter
that he had a premonition while walking to work that night. ''It
just seemed the closer I got to that building, there was something
unusual,'' he said. ''It turned out to be quite unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   He quit the Watergate soon after the break-in and had trouble
finding work. He said one Washington university told him it feared
losing federal funds if it hired him. Eventually he was hired by
Georgetown University in security.
</P>
<P>
   Wills made headlines in 1983 when a Georgia court convicted him
of shoplifting a $12 pair of sneakers. At the time, Wills said he
was going to buy the shoes for his son and was hiding them in a bag
so they would be a surprise. The arrest was a mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Gregory, the comedian-activist, hired Wills as a spokesman
for a diet product, a job that took him to a health clinic in the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Wills returned to North Augusta, S.C., in 1990 to take care of
his ailing mother. The two lived off her $450 a month Social
Security check until her death in November 1992. When she died,
Wills said he could not afford to bury her, so he donated her body
to science.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: GOP Ducking Gay Rights Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republican congressional
leaders Wednesday of deliberately ducking his long-languishing hate
crimes legislation because they fear it would split the GOP's base.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it doesn't get to be law, it's because the leadership
doesn't want it,'' Clinton said during a luncheon fund-raiser here
with gay Democrats. He noted that, in light of a spate of hate
crimes in recent years, the bill is supported by more Americans and
by a majority of lawmakers in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a sea-change movement,'' Clinton said. ''More
and more people are identifying with our common humanity.
Increasingly, society is moving to higher and higher levels of
decency and justice. It's just a question of whether the leadership
of the Republican Party in the Congress stays to the right of the
country on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in Texas to help raise money for his party and to
attend a ''Texas Tribute'' in his honor. The three events he
attended Wednesday were meant to raise $1.5 million for Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guests at the $5,000-a-plate luncheon in Dallas, real
estate agent Larry Pease, called the event ''an empowering
session,'' adding, ''It was historic because never before in this
country would a president sit down with such a small group of
people that used to be considered a political liability but now are
a powerful voting bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was held in a private home in an affluent Dallas
neighborhood. About 10 protesters from a group called Free Republic
waved anti-Clinton placards on a sidewalk about a block away. ''We
don't appreciated his lies, his perjury and his obstruction of
justice,'' said Mari Thompson, who said the group was not there to
protest gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described the presidential candidates, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, as ''two fundamentally
patriotic people'' whose vastly different views on the economy are
being blurred by ''daily coverage of this or that flap'' over
smaller matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, I get the feeling the flaps are being deliberately
used to obscure the underlying reality,'' Clinton said. He said
Republicans are ''driven by ideology and control, not by evidence''
that the policies he and the Democrats have espoused on Medicare
are more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are totally undeterred by the evidence,'' Clinton said.
''The vice president will be elected if people understand exactly
what the choices are.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a fund-raiser in Houston for Rep. Max Sandlin, Clinton
expressed frustration with press coverage of the campaign, saying
reporters are more fixated on the personal quirks of the candidates
than on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tell you everything that's wrong with Gov. Bush. And they
say, 'Oh, my goodness, we may be too tough on him, let's load up on
Gore for a week.' ... I think it's a bunch of bull in terms of how
it affects you,'' Clinton said. ''I don't think America is very
well served by all this rigamarole, trying to confuse people into
thinking that if you can just find which one has the worst quirks,
you'll know to vote for the other one. That's a bunch of hooey.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton didn't talk shop all night. He crooned along with
country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, who sang ''Achy Breaky Heart'' at
the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Texas, Clinton said Congress' Republican
leaders thwarted the hate crimes bill because they are worried that
its provisions covering gays and lesbians might anger the GOP's
conservative core.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they think it will split their base or something,''
Clinton said. ''I just hope and pray we can do it. If we can't do
it, what does that Senate vote mean? Was it just some stunt?,'' he
asked, referring to the Senate's 57-42 vote in June in favor of
hate-crimes provisions in a defense bill. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss, has said, however, that the provisions would be
not part of the final version of the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott denounced Clinton's remarks as
''demagoguery at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Pitting one group against another in order to gain personal
electoral advantage is bad even for President Clinton,'' said Lott
spokesman John Czwartacki said, adding that it ''is certainly not
our inclination'' to put the bill to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-hate-crimes bill would define crimes against
homosexuals in much the same way as racially motivated crime.
Clinton often raises the subject on visits to Texas, site of the
1998 dragging death of James Byrd by a trio of white men who hoped
to launch a race war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would add crimes motivated by sexual orientation,
gender or disability to the list of offenses already covered under
a 1968 federal law, and allow federal prosecutors to pursue a
hate-crime case if local authorities refuse to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also provides assistance to local law
enforcement agencies in investigating hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Activists Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Greenpeace activists unsuccessfully
tried to board a tanker filled with a million barrels of crude oil
Wednesday, then followed the 900-foot vessel as it made its way
toward port.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard joined the convoy to ensure the confrontation
didn't end with an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to ensure safety, not only of the vessel but also
of the Greenpeace members,'' said Lt. Carlos Mercado, a Coast Guard
public affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   Five activists left Greenpeace's ship, the Arctic Sunrise, on
small inflatable boats to meet up with the Pecos, a tanker
contracted by British Petroleum Amoco to deliver Argentine oil to a
terminal in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Pecos' deck was too high above the waterline for the
activists to board, said Melanie Duchin, a Greenpeace member aboard
the Arctic Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Three Coast Guard boats kept the activists at least 100 yards
from the tanker, Mercado said. The Arctic Sunrise and one Coast
Guard boat remained Wednesday evening. Mercado said the activists
broke the law by interfering with a ship's passage, but he didn't
know if anyone would be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Duchin said Greenpeace wanted to draw attention to the role of
fossil fuels in global climate change. The group wants the company
to build a $660 million solar-panel factory, saying that such a
large-scale facility would dramatically reduce the cost of solar
power.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Neil, external affairs manager for British Petroleum's
Carson refinery, said the company is the world's largest provider
of solar energy and is active in further developing solar power and
cleaner burning fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Energy is our business,'' he said, ''we still need to keep the
business running while we search for alternative fuels.''

<HEADLINE> Arrests in Rocker-Bottle Incident  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man imprisoned in the death of his newborn son
pleaded innocent Wednesday to a charge of interfering with police
after a friend allegedly threw a bottle at Atlanta Braves pitcher
John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bottle was thrown from the first-base box seats.
It landed about 10 feet from Rocker as he warmed up on the mound at
Shea Stadium, where the Braves played the Mets on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When police tried to arrest Raymond Maniaci, of Wyckoff, N.J.,
his hometown friend Brian Peterson got between them and Maniaci and
refused to step away, police told the Daily News and New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, 22, was released on his own recognizance Wednesday
after pleading innocent at his arraignment. He had served 1&AMP;frac12; years
in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter -- along with his
girlfriend Amy Grossberg -- in the 1996 death of their newborn son
at a Delaware motel.
</P>
<P>
   Maniaci, 22, pleaded innocent to a charge of reckless
endangerment and also was released.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson told his mother, Barbara Zuchowski, that his arrest
Tuesday was a misunderstanding and that he was turning to step away
as one officer had instructed, his Delaware lawyer, Joseph Hurley,
said after talking to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''A second cop implies Brian's physical movement as something
that is threatening,'' and arrested Peterson, Hurley said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson is still serving a two-year probation that was part of
his sentence for the baby's death. It was unclear whether the
arrest would affect his probation status.
</P>
<P>
   He had permission from New Jersey authorities to leave the state
to attend the game, and he had no curfew, said Beth Welch,
spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   She said a decision would not be made until the department
receives a copy of the complaint and a recommendation from
Peterson's parole officer, probably in a day or two. A misdemeanor
conviction would not necessarily mean his probation would be
revoked, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until now, he hasn't had the slightest anything go wrong or
anything be untoward,'' said Peterson's attorney, Russell Gioiella,
after the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, vilified by New Yorkers after he disparaged them in a
magazine article last year, was loudly booed Tuesday night when he
sprinted out of the bullpen in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After the bottle was thrown at Rocker, Braves manager Bobby Cox
picked it up and carried it toward the dugout, discarding it before
he reached the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything to say,'' Rocker said after the Braves
beat the Mets 7-1 to clinch the National League East championship.

   STEUBENVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- One of two men convicted of kidnapping
and murdering two Franciscan University students was sentenced to
death Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Yarbrough, 20, of Pittsburgh, was convicted on Friday in
the kidnapping and killings of Brian Muha, 18, of Westerville,
Ohio, and Aaron Land, 20, of Philadelphia. The jury recommended the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence showed the students were beaten and then abducted from
their home near campus in May 1999. Both were shot to death in the
woods after being driven a short distance over the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph Bruzzese imposed the sentence Wednesday in
Jefferson County Common Pleas Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm going to die, let me die,'' Yarbrough said shortly
before sentencing. He subsequently said he would appeal the
conviction and hire a private attorney. He was represented by a
court-appointed lawyer during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Yarbrough instigated the murders and then
bragged to friends. His companion in the case, Nathan Herring, 19,
of Steubenville, was found guilty and sentenced earlier to life in
prison without parole.

<HEADLINE> UN Reaches Compromise With Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council reached a compromise
agreement Wednesday on yet another challenge to sanctions against
Iraq that had threatened a $15.9 billion payout to Kuwait's oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and China agreed to let the payment go through at
Thursday's meeting of the U.N. Compensation Commission in Geneva as
long as the United States and Britain support a reduction in the
amount of money that the fund receives from the U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
   The three countries, Iraq's strongest supporters on the Security
Council, had sought to delay payment to the Kuwait Petroleum Co.,
saying such a large award to a corporation was unconscionable at a
time when Iraqis are suffering from decade-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 30 percent of every dollar Iraq earns through the
program is diverted to the fund to compensate victims of Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The bulk of the remainder is used to buy
humanitarian goods for Iraqis who are suffering under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise deal, which the full 15-member council agreed to,
calls for the percentage to be reduced to 25 percent for the
six-month period that begins Dec. 6. The excess money, which would
amount to about $1 billion over a year under current oil prices,
would be targeted for humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes against the backdrop of increasingly bold
attempts by Iraq's friends on the council -- France in particular --
to push the envelope on sanctions in Baghdad's favor, much to the
consternation of an increasingly isolated United States.
</P>
<P>
   France last week flouted procedures of the U.N. committee
monitoring sanctions against Iraq by sending a flight to Iraq
without giving committee members time to approve it -- a move the
United States said was a ''blatant violation'' of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent a flight over the weekend, without answering
questions raised by the United States and Britain, saying it only
had to notify the committee. A Jordanian flight flew to Baghdad on
Wednesday with full committee approval, after providing the United
States with information it wanted about the cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The flights have been a gray area for the council, with France
and Russia saying the committee need only be notified of proposed
flights. The United States and Britain say the committee must
actually approve them.
</P>
<P>
   But the compensation committee, made up of the 15 members of the
council, managed to remain relatively free of division, taking all
of its decisions by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and French position on the Kuwait Petroleum Co.
claim had threatened to force a vote in the commission, which might
have politicized future compensation claims, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   At an OPEC summit in Caracas, Venezuela, Iraqi Deputy Foreign
Minister Riyadh Al-Qaisi derided the decision to allow the Kuwaiti
claim to go through, saying the United Nations should release Iraqi
funding so it can purchase food and humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> Kouchner Candidate for Top UN Post  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. administrator
in Kosovo, confirmed Wednesday he is a candidate for the top U.N.
refugee post.
</P>
<P>
   Sadako Ogata of Japan completes her nine-year term as U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees at the end of the year, and there has
been much speculation about a successor in the high-profile job.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he was a candidate, Kouchner replied: ''It
has been well known -- so yes I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added: ''Well, it depends on my country. It
depends mainly on the secretary-general's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. procedures, Secretary-General Kofi Annan will propose
a nominee to the General Assembly, which normally rubber-stamps the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Annan appointed Kouchner, who is French, to head the U.N.
civilian administration for Kosovo in July 1999, after NATO bombing
forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops
out. In August, his contract was renewed for a year.
</P>
<P>
   A former French health minister and a founder of the aid group
Doctors Without Borders, Kouchner was an outspoken proponent of
humanitarian objectives during the Bosnian and Kosovo wars and has
a history of high-profile humanitarian intervention in conflicts in
Africa and Asia.
